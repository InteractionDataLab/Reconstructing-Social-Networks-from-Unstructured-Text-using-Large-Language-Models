Wash with ddH2O a few times.
Soak in glycerol for one hour.
Separate layers for thinner sheets, if desired. (Applying friction to the sheets with a gloved hand should lead to separation of sheets from each other. If not, and thinner sheets are desired, cut down one end of the sheet and then pull apart.)
Soak in glycerol again briefly (~5 min).
Dry sheets on cardstock and paper towels. Place heavy object on top to flatten sheet and speed absorption.

Transformation: Chemically and electrocompetent NEB-5 alpha E. coli cells from New England Biolabs were used for all parts of this project. Protocols were followed according to the manufactur's instructions. Plates containing successful transformants were stored at 4C.
Growing Culture . Transformed cells were inoculated into 3 ml Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and shaken at 37C for 24 hours. Growing culture for protein purification were inoculated in 100 ml LB medium instead.
Molecular Cloning The parts were synthesized by IDT and cloning was done with the standard BioBrick cutsites.
Flag-tag Protein Purification We used the FLAG octapeptide and Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads to extract protein products from the bacteria. Look here for the full protocol.

3. Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device.
We have designed a device (
BBa_K2016005
) using the
BBa_J23100
promoter, adding an RBS site to it, and coupling it to a GFP with a ryhB binding sequence.
In a bacterial infection, lipocalin is produced by the human or animal organism. Lipocalin prevents bacteria from uptaking iron. We use GFP expression as a means to determine and quantify the presence of bacterial infection, by utilising the ryhB pathway.
In the presence of lipocalin (thus, absence of intracellular iron), ryhB can freely degrade GFP mRNA in bacteria. In the absence of lipocalin (thus, presence of intracellular iron), the Fur regulator represses ryhB, and GFP is produced.
We have used fluorometry to experimentally validate that our engineered bacteria change their levels of GFP expression after addition of a defined amount of iron."

Saturday 25/7
Part of our team members took apart in a professional forum about prevention and rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease. The forum hold in Guangzhou, and some of the brightest experts converge at these forum. Such as Professor Hu Dayi who is one of the most famous cardiovascular disease experts and medical educators. We were very happy to be invited to participate in this forum. Thanks for organizers. We learnt a lot from the forum.
Thursday 30/7
With the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we studied the methods of Elisa and RNA extraction. We learned a lot in the course of experiments. But we still need to do the experiments by ourselves so that we can grasp the methods thoroughly.
Friday 31/7
Today we went to the laboratory. We succeeded in reverse transcription of RNA and kept the cDNA in refrigerator. And our cell’s growth situation was favorable.
Sunday 2/8
Today we reported our progress to our tutor in the meeting. After the meeting, we entered the cells room to continue our experiment. Cells were successfully subcultured by us.
Monday 3/8
Today, in preparation, we prepared the solution before the experiment. We used cells which were available. First of all, we extracted the RNA from cells. After running the gel electrophoresis, we detected RNA’s concentration by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. And then, we synthesized cDNA by reverse transcription. Afterwards, we detected cDNA’s concentration, and we processed the data. And then we calculated the consumption of the reagents such as water, primers and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix. We expanded the cDNA with PCR. We used the cDNA which had been expanded to run the gel electrophoresis. After all the work had been done, we cleaned up the laboratory furniture.
On the other side, the work of culturing cells was well. There were more and more cells in our cells room.
Tuesday 4/8
The result of experiment we had done yesterday was less than satisfactory. So we analyzed the reason why we failed. First of all, we found the mistake maybe caused from gene expression. Review of the literature revealed that PDE5A, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3 were expressed in kidney. The cells we used in experiment were HEK293. But we don’t know whether the genes we needed would express in HEK293 or not. So we had to consult with our tutor.

The lsrACDB sequence was divided into two parts and they were cloned separately. Then the two segments were ligated to the plasmid pWH1520 and the recombinant vector was transformed into DH5α. After that, verification PCR was used to select the positive clones. However, we didn't get a good result.

➀
We learnt a new method called circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) for high-throughput cloning of complex and combinatorial DNA libraries, and we decided to use this method to try to ligate our lsrACDB gene. It's encouraging that we succeeded to ligate the lsrACDB gene to the plasmid pHT-01.

Add MQ up to the labelled mark in both solutions. Both media are placed in the autoclave simultaneously with the holders for 50ml biofilm. When all items are sterilized, they are placed directly in the laminar. At the moment when the temperature of the both media is 60°C the antibiotic was added (1 µl on every 1ml of medium), which is previously filtered through the sterilized filter (0,2 µm pore). After the ENDO medium reaches a room temperature, the bacteria, growing on the LBC medium in the incubator on 37°C, are inoculated.  Then, the conical flask is put on the shaker (100 rmp)  for 12 hours at 37°C and is used for the transmission of the medium into sterilized 26-well plate the next day. In each well was added with 100 µl of diluted solution of bacteria in peptone water, diluted in the ratio 1:100. The sample was incubated for 3 days at 37°C without shaking the well plate.

SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," quantitative method to measure laccase activity.
Fig2.4: Azo dyes mixed with solid LB media.
ABTS is a substance that is wildly used in commercial laccase activity assay kits. ABTS is in a clear solution and when it reacts with laccase, it would turn to a bullish-green color that has an absorbance peak at 420nm. We used laccase activity assay kit from Solarbio, type BC1635 which functions based on the previous mentioned method. We set a negative control group by transferring pET28a plasmid in to BL21 – DE3 strain. We set 4 experiment groups by transferring cotA, OmpA - cotA, PhoA - cotA, PelB – cotA gene into BL21 – DE3. We measured the laccase activity of all 5 groups mentioned above to check if our laccase is functional [Fig 2.5] [Fig 2.6] [Fig 2.7].

From the laccase activity, we can see that CotA and Pelb-CotA turned out to be functional. However not all signal peptide sequence is functional.

Michigan,2011,Team:Michigan#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," The media/cells were transferred to 4 50 mL centrifuge tubes and put in the centrifuge at 5000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4 degrees (C). After 5 minutes in the centrifuge, the media was poured out (a cell ""pellet"" was left at the bottom) and the four tubes were placed upside down on a clean Kimwipe to ensure all the media drained out. About 30 mL of 0.1M MgCl2 was added to one flask; that flask was shaken until the cells were resuspended, and then that flask was emptied into the next one and shaken to resuspend the next cell pellet. This continued until all the cell pellets were dissolved in one flask. This was placed back in the centrifuge (with one flask of water to balance) on the same setting as before. After 5 minutes, the MgCl2 was drained out of the flask and about 40 mL (about 1/5 of the original volume from Day 1) of 0.1M CaCl2 was added to the flask. This was mixed, labelled, and placed in the refrigerator.
Other notes from the day:
⇒ To Do: Make and sterilize 50% glycerol containers to store cells in at a future time. After the cells are added to the glycerol, you want the entire solution to be at 15% or so (why making 50% tubes would be a good idea). This would be good for making additional stocks of DH5alpha.
⇒ Words of Wisdom from Ammerlaan: Biology is a ""meatball science""... Not everything has to be completely exact! As long as it is about right, it should turn out correctly. Also, sterile technique is important, but in some instances it shouldn't be completely stressed over. When making cells, sterile technique is very crucial at the beginning when you have very few cells grown. Contaminating a small amount of cells could be a large problem, whereas contaminating a huge batch of cells might not affect them much. If you get a chance to see the Ammerlaan version of sterile technique, I recommend it. Also, if you are ever pouring anything in his presence, please be careful. This is one of the things he is particular about!
⇒ Autoclave stuff: Should start an autoclave bag for all the small things to be autoclaved as waste (such as tips, tubes, etc.). Once we fill this bag up to 70%, then we can autoclave it as waste."

What up, I'm Jessica.  I'm a senior, preparing to be a supersenior in biomedical engineering.  I play saxophone.  I am also part of the iGEM lab team.  I do yoga every morning.  My life oscillates between phases of being saturated with coffee and deciding I need to quit.  I have a collection of dead insects, and a cat- a live one.  I live in a barn.  And I'm a ginger.
Chris Parker
I'm best known for my love of baking bread and singing annoyingly as possible.  When not staring listlessly into the distance, I spend my time studying chemical engineering and/or optimizing a model for the concentration of tea.  I joined iGEM this year to put my HTML skills to use and have my ideas of using PHPMyAdmin shut down.
Christine Liu
Hey there, I'm Christine. I'm currently an undecided second-year at Michigan, but I have many interests, including art, music, film, dogs, and food(so basically nothing that's a viable career path!). I've been trying to learn some coding and design, so joining the iGEM team was a great way to start developing both those skills. Outside of this, other life goals include raising a golden retriever and pomsky, publishing a novel, and traveling around France (I refuse to let 4 years of French go to waste).
Kristine Lan
Hi, I'm Kristine. I'm a junior in informatics, which is basically statistics plus computer science. I enjoy baking. My current favorite recipe is glazed lemon cake. You would usually find me in the Children's Literature section in libraries, because I really love picture books.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," still a difficult problem to solve the combination between the matrix and the probe, due to the biomolecule inactivation caused by ordinary substrate material.
For instance, polystyrene, which has hydrophobic surface, is a commonly used substrate. When antibodies are absorbed onto it, the strong hydrophobic force between them lead to the formation of multilayer film. Among all the antibodies that are absorbed, only the top of them can maintain their activities, while the rest would go through conformational changes and become inactivated. This would result in low sensitivity and a huge waste of reagents.
Scientists have always tried to find new method of surface modification to improve substrate properties, such as three-dimensional surface modification of glass or use gold membrane to replace the ordinary substrate. However, these methods show either complex operation or high cost[1].
A very interesting characteristic of assembled Janus is the amphipathic nature of the coating. By changing the hydrophobicity of a surface the binding of various molecules and cells can be manipulated [2]. In view of this, Janus could find use in substrate modification applications.
Our Goal
Based on previous experience, we use Janus to modify protein chip substrate so as to optimize it. In the process of our experiment, Janus acts as a medium in antibody-fixing by electrostatic force [3]. Compared to the traditional methods, this fixing method not only ensures the activity of the antibody, but also improves the detection’s accuracy rate. Additionally, it can greatly reduce the cost of chip’s making [4]. The most important thing is that this method enables us to use antigens in very light concentration, which can save a lot of samples.
Our Design
In our experiment, we used two kinds of Janus-inJanus and sJanus. inJanus generate more stable assemblies compared to sJanus. We use hydrophobins from two categories on purpose of studying the differences between them in aspect of surface modification.The serum levels of tumor markers are directly related to the state of cancer. The quantitative detection of them in serum will be valuable for clinical research and early diagnosis [5]. In our experiment, we chose CEA, AFP and CA15-3 and their respectively antibodies as samples. Levels of CEA can be associated with lung cancer, and AFP - liver cancer, CA15-3 - breast cancer. In fact, there are a large number of tumor markers that associated with cancer, but the markers we chose are more representative and easier to purchase.

1. Introduction
A deterministic model of differential equations over a continuous time interval is generally easy to implement using known numerical methods. However, the equations alone do not account for the variability in expression that we often observe at low molecular count. In other words, deterministic simulations fail to capture the actual physical basis of the reaction (Gillespie 1977; Wilkinson 2012). This is due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise that occurs at low intracellular molecular counts; interactions do not follow traditionally defined constant parameters which limits the accurate characterization of a genetic system (Elowitz et al., 2002).
It then becomes essential when characterizing a genetic system to have a deterministic approach (to capture the large average overtime) in addition to a stochastic approach. A stochastic approach allows one to model the probabilistic trajectory based on the initial conditions. One commonly used stochastic algorithm is the Gillespie Algorithm— a simple but powerful approach to simulation that takes into account the initial state of the reactants, the reaction rate and the number of molecules present for a reaction with each timed step of the reaction drawn from a probability distribution (Gillespie 1977).
As a working example, we will be working with the pDawn and pDusk operon (BBa K161609 and BBa K1075044). Many teams have made either the pDawn/pDusk system as their inducer (IONIS Paris 2015, Wageningen 2016, NUS Singapore 2017, Cornell 2017, Kingsborough 2017). In 2017, NUS Singapore 2017 and Kingsborough 2017 used the pDawn/pDusk inducer to induce expression of MazF to induce cell death. To our knowledge, there is no literature or past iGEM project exploring a stochastic model of the pDawn/pDusk system at low molecule count.
2. Methods
In order to improve reproducibility and to build on past iGEM teams’ efforts, we used the differential equations and parameters described in the 2016 Wageningen iGEM Team’s kill switch design . Using the “smfsb” package in R for stochastic simulations and the NDSolve function in Mathematica, we modeled the 3 light-sensitive states of the Y"

Thereby he emphasized that we should be able to defend the use of bacteria in a sensor-system and he referred us to research on different sensor-systems as comparison. Furthermore he had some concerns about the use of our system in the human body. Thereby he warned for possible immune reactions and competition with other “naturally-occurring” bacteria.
Prof. dr. ir. M.W.J. (Menno) Prins – Professor in the department of Molecular Biosensors for Medical Diagnostics at the Technical University Eindhoven
Goal: Learn more about different sensor systems and evaluate our system.
Approach: We talked to Menno Prins, who himself is working mostly with enzyme sensors and immunosensors and involved him in a brainstorm session about applications for our sensor.
Results: Menno Prins could not tell us much about specific regulation involved in the use of biosensors, because he is not working with biosensors himself. However he could give us some useful advices about the possible application of our device.    He advised us to focus on the mechanism within the cell. How can this be tuned to allow the cell to give a useful output? In other words: what biological readouts can we get? He was enthusiastic about the idea to allow the bacteria to produce and secrete medicines/pesticides as a reaction to pathogen-detection. However he also expressed concerns about the storage of these compounds within the cells. How are we going to make sure that our cell doesn’t degrade by itself and deposits its contents in the environment?   Furthermore he advised us to extend our system by not solely focusing on the use of aptamers on the outside of the bacterial membrane. If another detection system provides more stability under certain circumstances, detection components can easily be modified to be used in our system.  Finally he made us consider the option of using our system in a different cell. This could maybe help us overcome certain barriers imposed by law.
Q Fever
One of our application scenarios involves the use of bacteria in the detection of Q fever in domestic animals. Generally, people are quite enthusiastic that we are dealing with a local problem. However, to get an overview of the challenges within Q fever detection, we needed to talk to experts on this area. Therefore, we approached Anja Garritsen, who is a researcher from InnatOss, a research institute involved in the development of new detection methods for Q fever. We also talked to one of the farmers who had a Q fever infection on her farm who was very interested and involved in the development of new techniques to eradicate Q fever."

Biosafety measures are completely necessary to ensure Printeria  introduction in non-scientific environments.
We realized it was necessary to improve our safety measurements. Mojica advised us the use of UV light filters as bacterial-killer, which were positively integrated into Printeria final design.
He advised us to be aware about the vocabulary used to divulgue science, as it needs to be technically correct but close and safe enough for the lay public to listen to you.
This, along with the bioartist expert feedback, gave us the idea to use a non-usual approach to divulgue SynBio into the lay-public. As a consequence, Printeria promotion among society was carried out by including the BioArt as the main attraction to get to the public.

To prove Printeria's power in bioart we decided to do one of those figures which you can see above and an interview to get some expert feedback from him. Here you can see the full interview we did:
Interview: Yturralde
Interview conclusions were:
They way we have to bring Printeria to the market
Yturralde said that there is something really important in art and it is the creative process. He recommended us not to show the product (draws in petri plates) but show the creative process. This way we will catch the artist attention. In this line, we consider to do several promotional videos with the process to show them in future art gallery expositions like Hangar Gallery in Barcelona or E planetari de Castelló where we will go after the jamboree to present our project.
Furthermore, he told us that we had to sell the idea of an art that evolves with time because Printeria is not only makes art, it makes life, science and evolution.
Where will Printeria have a great impact?
Yturralde recommends the US to launch such innovative projects."
Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#diffusion_-_-_TEXT.html,"The Netlogo simulator can be found in its website at Northwestern University. To download the source file of our Sexy plant simulation in Netlogo click here: sexyplants.nlogo
Setup
We consider three agents: male and female moths, and sexy plants.
We have two kinds of sexual pheromone emission sources: female moths and sexyplants.
Our scenario is an open crop field where sexy plants are intercropped, and moths fly following different patterns depending on its sex.
Females, apart from emitting sexual pheromones, move following erratic random flight paths. After mating, females do not emit pheromones for a period of 2 hours.
Males also move randomly while they are under its detection threshold. But when they detect a certain pheromone concentration, they start to follow the pheromone concentration gradients until its saturation threshold is reached.
Sexy plants act as continuously- emitting sources, and their activity is regulated by a Switch.
The pheromone diffusion process, it is simulated in Netlogo by implementing the Euler explicit method.
Figure 1. NETLOGO Simulation environment.
Runs
When sexy plants are switched-off, males move randomly until they detect pheromone traces from females. In that case they follow them.
When sexy plants are switched-on, the pheromone starts to diffuse from them, rising up the concentration levels in the field. At first, sexy plants have the effect of acting as pheromone traps on the male moths.
Figure 2.On the left: sexy plants are switched-off and a male moth follows the pheromone trace from a female. On the right: sexy plants are switched on and a male moth go towards the static source as it happens with synthetic pheromone traps.
As the concentration rises in the field, it becomes more homogeneous. Remember that the random turning angle of the insect follows a Poisson distribution, in which the standard-deviation is inversely proportional to the intensity of the gradient. Thus, the probability of the insect to take a bigger detour from the faced gradient vector direction is higher. This means that it is less able to follow pheromone concentration gradients, so sexual confusion is induced.
Figure 3. NETLOGO Simulation of the field: sexyplants, female moths, pheromone diffusion and male moths.
Parameters
The parameters of this model are not as well-characterized as we expected at first. Finding the accurate values of these parameters is not a trivial task. In the literature it is difficult to find a number experimentally obtained. So we"

In early April, we joined Zhejiang Museum of Science and Technology and Guokr.com to hold a booth at the Science Fair. At the same time, we carried out a survey on synthetic biology. Later Dr. Yuhua Hu from University of Edinburgh visited our lab and shared the experiences of Synthetic Biology Society of their college with Synthetic Biology Club of ours. In May, team NJU-China visited our lab and we shared each other’s project. In August, we were invited by NCTU_Formosa and visited Taiwan to meet 7 iGEM teams from 6 universities. During the summer vacation, we held the Qiushi Summer Camp with College of Life Sciences, where 72 high school students from all around China joined the camp.
We gave lectures of iGEM to the pre-undergraduates, and guide them to do some real lab work including PCR. In September, as we were working really hard on our project, we also did some interviews with companies that produce herbicides. We did it both online and offline. For the online track, we interviewed big companies like Bayer and Dows via email. For the offline track, we visited three local companies and interviewed their managers of sales departments and R&D departments. We think that our interviews are really important because we want to know the approaches and strategies of turning our devices in lab into products in the market. The experiences and results benefit not only our team, but also the whole iGEM community.

Debrecen-Hungary,2010,Team:Debrecen-Hungary#Teem Meetings list_-_-_TEXT.html,"Fellow iGEM team, here is a summary of our last team meeting (30.6.10, 14:00):
1.   The following member attended the meeting: Kata S. Kata N, Timi B, Shun CL. Endre K, Ophir K, Lilla O and Balint LB.  The meeting took place from 14:00 to 15:00.
 
2. We discussed the following administrative issues (AKA agenda’s):
Feedback about working habits:
Notebooks- TDK student do not use their notebooks as       often as they should. This causes a problem in information flow,
End of the day- Students should make it a habit to       inform their team correspondent of their day’s work and it’s progression       before leaving for the day.
Meetings- The meeting delegate (lior) and the schedule       coordinator (ophir) will arrive at team meetings earlier (20 min) in aim       of better meeting organization.
Today’s work to be done was discussed (see action      items)            
Subteam’s students will have to undertake individual      responsibilities. This will promote each individual’s work quality. This      item will be expanded in the next end of week meeting. Eg. Timi from the      cloning team will be responsible for electrophoresis        
3. Action items:
A.    Change of working habits (end of day, notebook’s and pre- meetings) as described above should be undertaken by all of the TDK students
B.     Today’s wetlab work will be split into two teams:
I.                          The cloning team will make another electrophoresis to confirm the results of the maxi prep done on Monday (Kata N. and Timi B.) . An inoculation will be made from the biobrick transformation done yesterday (Ophir K., Dorka and Lior M).
II.                       The cell culturing team will do more plating, and a transfection with the plasmids isolated from the maxi prep done at the beginning of the week (Lilla, Shun, Endre, Kata S.)
III.                    A scheduale for the next week would be revealed on Friday morning on the gmail calendar, everyone should inspect it.

This part contains a green fluorescence protein (GFP) under control of a CMV promoter and its double terminator (BBa_I712669 + BBa_B0014). This part is reliable to use when we want to know if a gene is inserted into a eukaryotic cell. For example we can use it when we design a recombinant virus. In fact we inserted this bio-brick into the synthetic virus; finally we are able to see if the virus can infect the targeted cells.
This bio-brick already contains a terminator, so it is ready to use.
BBa_K292008 [9]
This part contains a SV40 nucleus targeting sequence (DTS). This part is reliable to use to increase the level of gene transfection efficiency.
Any plasmid will rarely reach the nucleus if we do not provide to it, the necessary element to trigger a mechanism of nuclear incorporation. Studies were conducted on the use of specific sequences for nuclear import of genetic sequences: DTS sequences (DNA Nuclear Targeting Sequence). This bio-brick is able to play this role. Sequence: 5’ GCATGCTTTG CATACTTCTG CCTGCTGGGG AGCCTGGGGA CTTTCCACAC CCTAACTGAC ACACATTCCA CAGCTGGTTC TTTCCGCCTC AGAAGGTACC T 3’ This sequence, known for having the ability to bind to 10 different transcription factors, provides the transportation of DNA to the nucleus. Added to the therapeutic plasmid, this sequence ensures the entry and the expression of therapeutic plasmid into the nucleus of the target cell.
Bba_K292009 [10]
This part contains a gene coding for the Stem cell factor (SCF) or c-kit-ligand. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor that stimulates the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It is also a specific marker for Stem cells. When binding to c-kit, the c-kit ligand induces the c-kit dimerization and the particle encapsidation. So this is a reliable ligand to transfect a gene into stem cells.
BBa_K292010 [11]
This part contains the D protein from the Lambda phage. The lambda phage wild type has on its capsid, the D protein, which is in charge of the stabilization of the entire capsid. The D protein is exposed on the entire outer surface of the capsid, so this protein is an ideal candidate to be fused to a cellular internalization protein.

In September, we teamed up with Imperial iGEM to host an exhibition at New Scientist Live at the ExCel centre, London. In addition to explaining our individual projects, we made an educational leaflet to improve understanding about synthetic biology, including common laboratory techniques, to distribute to the general public at the event. We also conducted a survey to gauge views on the safety and necessity of different types of genetic modification: somatic cell gene therapy, genetically modified probiotics, and germline cell gene therapy. Visitors were shown a sliding scale and asked to vote on the extent to which they agreed/disagreed with these techniques for therapeutic purposes. The results of our survey, grouped by age category, are as follows:

UK iGEM Meet-up in Oxford
In mid- July, Oxford and SynBio hosted the UK iGEM meetup. Teams travelled from as far as Edinburgh, Cardiff and Exeter to attend this two-day event that promoted collaboration, offered advice and gave an insight into what lies beyond the iGEM competition.
We heard from individuals closely associated with the iGEM foundation and synthetic biology groups in Oxford and attended talks on ‘Safety and Human Practices’, ‘iGEM troubleshooting’ and ‘Entrepreneurship beyond iGEM’. The aforementioned talk, describing the development of a synthetic biology start-up and entrepreneurship within iGEM made a particular impact on the trajectory of our project. Having heard from Dr. Ben Reeve, a previous iGEM participant who has now established his own biotechnology company, we decided that we would attempt the Entrepreneurship track alongside work on our therapeutic. We have now met with a researcher to discuss patent law and the steps required for drug development and approval in the US, EU and other potential markets. We also attended workshops that encouraged a better understanding of organisation and planning and an iGEM troubleshooting session which helped us to understand the tasks we had to accomplish in the time we had remaining. In addition, the principal supervisor of the Imperial 2016 team, Dr. Karen Polizzi, gave a talk on the roles of"
UAM_Poznan,2016,Team:UAM Poznan#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," every job, there are some ups (when everything goes just as planned) and downs (when it just keeps getting worse) but at the end of the day I just can’t imagine myself doing anything else. Although synthetic biology wasn’t my primarily field of interest, it certainly got so during this worthwhile experience!
Attributions: As the newest member of the UAM_Poznań team and therefore the least experienced one, I was mostly involved in helping others with their tasks and experiments. Those included participating in comparison of activity of different modified promoters as well as examination of the influence of ORF optimization on fluorescent protein expression. Together with Marcin, I was responsible for validation of chosen existing BioBrick Parts in order to confirm if they really work as described. I have also been engaged in conducting successful trials of overexpression of different proteins (RNase I, miraculin) using our expression systems. As for our iGEM wiki page, my job was to create and describe the Medal Criteria section.
ADVISORS
Melania Nowicka
Area of expertise: bioinformatics
About me: As a member of another Poznan team I participated in iGEM competition twice in both wet and software tracks. Since that time synthetic biology have become “the core” of my scientific interests. I am really passionate about the “dry side” of synthetic biology, especially design of SynBio tools with medical applications. Now, I am looking for opportunities to combine my broad bioinformatic background and SynBio passion as a PhD student. Because I started my iGEM journey as a member of the first wet lab team in our city it is a real pleasure for me to help the next generation of Poznan iGEMers as the advisor.
Attributions: I was responsible for ORF design, especially for protein expression optimization which includes: different codon and codon pair frequency rankings preparation, codon context optimization (using the software which is the result of my Master's Thesis) taking A-homopolymers and restriction enzymes sites removal. The designed ORFs have also been checked for undesired mRNA secondary structure. As an advisor I helped describing the dry lab part of the project and with the wiki building.
Jakub Bartoszewicz
Area of expertise: bioinformatics
About me: Doing synthetic biology has been my dream from the beginning of my studies. I love designing things. This brought me to participating in two of the previous iGEM editions and pursuing my PhD in bioinformatics for synthetic biology. However, building a community is almost as important as doing science itself, and that’s why I wanted to advise"

What we unsolved?
1.   When we conducted our experiments with FsC, the data shows FsC without incubation with Janus performed better, which is contrary to our conclusions before.
2.   We structured many fusion protein DNA, and haven’t expressed them all successfully. 
Protein Extraction Kit
Background
ATPS (aqueous two-phase systems) is a novel technology to purify proteins. The mechanism of this system lies in the partition between two different phases.
Aims
Construct a brand new and standard way to purify proteins based on aqueous two-phase system.
Results
1. Confirm the strengths using aqueous two-phase systems
2. Successfully separate the target proteins from bulk protein phase based on aqueous two-phase systems at a high partition rate.
3. Construct a standard protocol to separate different kinds of proteins.
The experiment of ATPS
Pre-experiment
Process of this experiment
In the pre-experiment, the original concentration of our protein is about 50ug/ml, which volume is 200uL. We designed the pre-experiment just in order to make preparations for our next experiment. We added 5% (v/v) Berol 532 to protein solution. And then, we used shaker to make them mixed at the speed of 250r/min and 20 centigrade working about one hour. Centrifuge was used to make them separated and came into being two phases at the speed of 8000g for about 25min. In these two phases, the upper phase is rich-detergent and the lower phase is depleted-detergent phase. Because of the property of hydrophobin, fusion protein will stay in the detergent phase, and bulk protein stay in the water phase. We put the rich-detergent phase in another centrifuge cubes and added butanol which is 5 times volume of detergent. Centrifuge was used to make them separated and finally in the lower phase (water phase), we got pure target protein. The upper phase contains detergent (Berol 532), which can be recycled.

With only 7 people in iGEM, Denny was the 8th and last person to join. What a wonderful number, because #8 means lucky in chinese and that is what we needed, she indeed delivered. She is studying food biotechnology, even though she doesn’t have enough lab experience, she was eager and determined to learn everything she can during her stay in iGEM, like really restlessly eager. She told me that there’s only one word to describe iGEM “AMAZING!!!!!”, and that’s the attitude I like within iGEM.
Mentors and supervisors
Mark van Passel
iGEM Mentor
Being the undisputed champion of bowling, he is also a charismatic scientist trying to raise his 5yr old son. The first team he supervised included Ruben and Dorett, who are now supervising this years team. Last years’ team did very well and managed to get to Boston. He has experience as an iGEM judge last year, which makes him a knowledgeable mentor.  He himself cannot conceive of the notion that there might be things he might not want to know and this reflects in his eagerness to explore new fields. Talkative, outgoing, genuine and always in for a new challenge; he knows how to bring together a group of intellectual individuals and initiate the formation of a team.
Dorett Odoni
iGEM Mentor
She is not as talkative as Mark, but when she speaks it is always worthwhile to listen. Together with Ruben she was part of the iGEM team from 2011 where they worked on a synchronized oscillatory system. Her input during lunch meetings has been very valuable and certainly aided in the development of our ideas and finding the right secondary metabolite. She works real hard and makes long days at lab, thereby enabling the iGEM team to work after hours as well.
Ruben van Heck
iGEM Mentor
Ruben just started his PhD at the chairgroup systems and synthetic biology. He was part of the Wageningen iGEM team 2011 and this experience contributed to his choice for Bioinformatics for his master. This year he is supervising the work on the modeling and database. Together with Dorett he will stay at the lab as long as necessary for team members to finish their lab work, allowing the team to make swift progress.

Round two of time-lapse microscopy. We decided to try a new media combination and flow speed to see if we can prevent the cell lysis we experienced last week.
We brain-stormed some ways to create a device for our Sporobeads. We asked our Gold Sponsor Semadeni if they would donate a few 0,20um filter spin columns to use for our envisioned sporo-device. We also batch-produced spores of our strain B53. Even with its modifications, it has definitely not lost its sporulation ability!

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).
High Sensitivity
Few false negatives
NEGATIVE RESULT
Low Specificity
Lots of false positives
POSITIVE RESULT

Has disease
A highly sensitive test will have few false negatives but lots of false positives. Switch to high specificity .

We are planning to provide this information about     the parts to all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next     version of BioGuide in iGEM 2011.
Database Standardization
Two main focuses of our project was the organization of the available     information about Biobricks on iGEM’s website and development of a software     application to help synthetic biologists at the experimental set-up     level by providing all available construct combinations for any given     input and output relations ,which they can utilize for their own project.
Normalization and re-organization of the part information at iGEM’s     web site was needed in order to develop our application, which will     automatically search the possible construct combinations. For the organization     and analysis of the Biobricks, we used part info for Spring 2010 distribution.     The information on all three 384 well plates distributed by iGEM scrutinized     and checked individually to specify the standards available and needed.     iGEM is providing so many parts within a hierarchical way, but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some of     the parts distributed are known to be nonfunctional. Web pages for parts     contain lots of information, but majority of them, are again not ordered.     Moreover, some additional information had to be removed or replaced     in such a way that the information for parts can be used effectively.     And removal of the redundant bulk information related with parts at     iGEM’s web site had been recommended for future.
Although, the final standardization, which we have suggested is not     for general public use and it was urgently needed in order to satisfy     the needs of our algorithm. But, still it will be a valuable resource,     since it summarizes the basic information about the parts.
As the first step to build the proposed standardization template,     the headings selected related to parts are listed on Table 1. Submission     of part IDs for individual parts is an accepted and quite valuable way     of tracking information. Although, every part has unique partID, for     every part there is a need to assign unique part names as official iGEM     names. Part names will have an important role as they will be providing     the short description about the part, which synthetic biologists can     immediately recognize and utilize during the construction of unique     Biobricks. Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify    "

Project Description
The Project
This year, the Michigan Synthetic Biology team explored the applications of temperature-based cellular modulation. We engineered a temperature-controlled bacterial killswitch, designed to prevent survival of cells outside of a desired range, specifically one that is associated with typical laboratory working conditions, as a safety precaution in lab settings. The genetic switch leverages a temperature-dependent promoter to trigger self-lysis in cells. The switch design incorporates a holin/antiholin lysis mechanism, that is initiated if the environmental temperature falls below 34C for a prolonged length of time. As proof of concept, we attempted to construct the kill switch in E. coli. We designed experiments to test the rate of cell death at variable temperatures after growth at 37C.
Why?
We set out to create a plasmid that could be used as an additional safety precaution when working in laboratory environments with dangerous pathogenic bacteria. The project was initially inspired by the library of tunable temperature-sensitive promoters reported in Tunable thermal bioswitches for in vivo control of microbial therapeutics (Piraner et. al., 2016). Other iGEM teams in the past have attempted to develop kill-switches, but they all depended on chemical treatment to trigger self lysis (Knight,  2015). This presents practical limitations as chemical treatment of escaped or uncontrolled bacterium may prove impossible or inefficient. Our solution was to use temperature as a trigger for the self-lysis mechanism. Bacteria with our proposed plasmid will self-destruct when outside their designated, controlled environment. The switch could also prevent the transfer of antibiotic resistance from escaped bacterium to pathogenic strains, decreasing the rate at which antibiotic resistance spreads.
Although we developed our construct in E. coli as a proof of concept, we envision the final product being incorporated into the genome of research strains species, such as S. aureus. This strain can be antibiotic resistant and is known to be susceptible to the holin/endolysin system our switch employs, as seen in Phages of Staphylococcus aureus and their impact on host evolution (Xia and Wolz, 2014).
For example, suppose that a team of researchers was conducting a study that was testing the effectiveness of several novel antibiotic compounds to kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). If improperly disposed of, or tracked out by a researcher, these bacteria could escape into the outside environment and cause infection among civilians. More concerning is the possibility that environmental bacteria may obtain the methicillin resistance"

Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree
We registered and was accepted by iGEM Headquarters on 2016-05-10 at 09:08:56. We definitely had a great summer , and we are excited to attend the Giant Jamboree.
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page
We sure did. You are reading our wiki right now. All our parts were registered and submitted . The safety , judging and registry forms were filled as required. Also, a poster is ready and the team members are set to present our work at the Giant Jamboree.
Clearly attribute each aspect of the project
All the help that was needed is greeted with great gratitude under Attributions .
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
K2018030 is a secretion system for poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). This secretion tags PHB with a hybrid protein consisting of phasin, that binds PHB and a hemolysin tag, and is recognised by a type 1 secretion system. The BioBrick also contains two transport proteins that will recognize the hybrid protein and secrete it along with PHB. This construct creates the possibility for a large scale production of PHB in a continuous stirred-tank reactor.
Silver 3/3
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
Our new devices K2018014 and K2018015 are hybrid bacteriocins that show great effect at inhibiting growth of multi-resistant Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hybrid bacteriocins show greater effect than the native bacteriocins.

Displaying outputs from the GUI
The GUI supports 4 types of output:
Previews
Movies
Pictures
Raw Data
Previews create an instant pop-up window in which the BSim simulation is displayed. This allows users to swiftly check the validity of their simulation options. It is also a great way of rapidly demonstrating BSim.
Movies are produced in .MOV format, which is compatible with most common media players. Users are prompted to specify the length, speed and level of detail of the movie through a pop-up box. They can also choose where to save the file, and what to name it.
Pictures are produced in .PNG format, which is a useful format for web publishing and printing. Users can choose when to take a snapshot of their simulation and where to save it.
Raw Data is exported as a .CSV file. CSV stands for 'Comma Separated Values'; this is compatible with text editors, spreadsheet programs (e.g. MS Excel) and is very useful to plot graphs with.

According to the requirements of our friend, we conducted the experiment on construction of secreting the plasmid Yebf-homoIL10. Having sequenced and verified the plasmid construction successfully, we mailed  no-less-than-100ng plasmid dry powder to them.
NEU-China-A helped us implement experiments on optimizing the conditions of prokaryotic expression of CSCA protein and purifying expression. Our friendship has thus been strengthened and the projects have also been pushed forward as the result of this collaboration, which is as a successful cooperation by both of us.
     
     
                  
     
     
 
 
  
4 . IIT-Madras
As the project continues to proceed, HP's exchanges and cooperations between teams are more frequent and in-depth. After seeing the cooperation application issued by the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Madras) at the iGEM official website, we contacted IIT-Madras to discuss cooperation actively.
We are pleased to collaborate with the iGEM team of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-Madras) to make a video on the science of synthetic biology in the mother tongue. The Indian Institute of Technology is also working with other teams in English, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati and Hindi.
IIT-Madras sends an English script to our team. We need to match the provided slideshow video with the provided text and add the translated text to the subtitles, and finally make it into Chinese video.
We thought it was a simple matter, but there were some  problems at the beginning.The problems is summarized as follows:
1. The English script does not exactly match the sound in  the video, and some paragraphs are missing.
2. English and Chinese belong to different language families. They are slightly different in grammar, and the word order is reversed in translation.
3. Some video pictures and sounds are out of sync and need to be adjusted.
4. Our team members are not familiar enough with the Indian accent in English"

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

As a possible solution we brought together a straightforward intuitive interface                                     built with Electron and React , that gives the user easy access to the state-of-the-art long read alignment tool GraphMap which itself is highly specialized for nanopore sequencing.
To make this possible we run a python script in the background that relies on HTSeq as infrastructure for high-throughput data and pysam to handle the genomic data sets.
What does sequ-into do?
In order to be able to draw conclusions of the sequencing quality in general and the                                     composition of the data                                     - in terms of contaminations versus the true sequencing traget - the reads are                                     mapped to references. The                                     reference being either a possible contamination, leaving your desired reads                                     unaligned, or your target                                     sequence, meaning your designated reads are the ones that did align. The                                     distribution of read length from                                     the original files and the results of these alignments are then elucidated in a                                     statistical overview and                                     employed to separate those reads you aimed for from those that were sequenced                                     involuntary.
How does sequ-into achieve this?
From a Typescript interface to functionality
The user interface of sequ-into is based on Electron and React and written in                                     Typescript. However, the functionality of our app depends on a python script ( ContamTool.py )                                     in the background, that must be called according to the users request.
Read Files
Sequ-into is able to deal with both, the FastQ as well as the Fast5 format. If the                                     latter is used, we                                     extract the base called sequences and convert them into the FastQ format.
Thanks to the fact that the Fast5 format is in fact HDF5 ,                                     a                                     file format that can contain an unlimited variety of datatypes while allowing for                                     input/output of complex                                     data, it was possible to manipulate the files with the h5py python                                     interface efficiently. To prevent excessive runtimes of our app, there is currently                                     a processing limit of                                     1000 reads per Fast5 file.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Programming Spider Silk_-_-_TEXT.html,"binant spider silk a difficult process.
Existing techniques seek to remove reliance of cloning on primer annealing (Tokareva et al, 2013). Generally, these techniques break the silk genetic into monomeric sequences, then assemble the monomers into the final construct. Head-to-tail cloning assembles gene constructs by ligating two plasmid halves together. Each half carries one of the silk monomers, and the resulting complete plasmid has been doubled. This technique can be used recursively to assemble increasingly large silk genes in a specified manner. Directional recursive ligation uses a similar tactic, where individual monomers are ligated one at a time into a receiving plasmid. Concatemerization is another technique where a pool of monomers are ligated in a single reaction, then cloned into plasmids. This particular technique is useful for creating a library of sizes and compositions.
These existing techniques are not ideal for engineering recombinant silks, because they require repeated and extensive cloning for large constructs, as in the case of head-to-tail assembly and directional recursive ligation, or do not offer any control over the length or genetic composition, as is the case for concatemerization. As it currently stands, there is no one technique that offers rapid and controllable assembly of recombinant spider silk genes.
Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) is a cloning method that is used to sequentially assemble long, repetitive DNA sequences. This technique was developed by Briggs et al. in 2012 as a method to assemble Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) which are sequence specific DNA binding proteins that consist of multiple repetitive monomers. Each repeat monomer is responsible for binding to a specific nucleotide in the target sequence. Due to the repetitive nature of TALE genes, conventional PCR is unable to reliably amplify these sequences due to non-specific primer binding.
Although ICA was developed using TALE construction as a model problem, this technique can be used to construct long, repetitive DNA constructs in a directly controllable fashion. ICA assembles repetitive sequences one monomer unit at a time, while preventing the elongation of incomplete nucleotide chains. The full length sequence is flanked by unique primer annealing sites, which allows the PCR amplification of the final product. This entire process is performed using a solid substrate, which greatly facilitates the construction of long sequences.
This summer, we adapt the use of Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) as a technique for cloning recombinant spider silks in a time-efficient and specific manner that is unparalleled by existing methods. Our"

Funding for Mantis
Funding for the Mantis diagnostic would rely on funding from global and national initiatives (e.g. World Bank, United Nations, National Institute of Health), which makes up the public sector. Allocation of funding from such initiatives is done in consultation with the WHO and other healthcare organizations, depending on factors such as the disease burden on society and the impact of the new diagnostic [2]. The WHO monitors the global diagnostic infrastructure and decides whether a new diagnostic can and will be implemented. If it deems the Mantis diagnostic an improvement on currently available diagnostics they might, in cooperation with NGOs, allocate funding for it as well as identify potential manufacturers and implement it in the existing healthcare track.

Step 6.  Training of personnel
Mantis is designed as point-of-care diagnostic, meaning that it will be used in the field. For this, personnel is needed. These people should be able to use Mantis safely and effectively, and communicate to the community why and how it is used. How does the health care system work in different areas, and what type of personnel will use the diagnostic? We looked into cases in Africa and South America.
Case: Africa
In African regions, training capacity of medical personnel is generally insufficient [1], which results in a shortage of healthcare workers in the government-run medical system. NGO’s like MSF are known to set up their own clinics and hospitals, dispersing health care free of charge. The hospital employs both foreign specialists and locals, in which the former educate the latter, as mentioned by medical entomologist Jeanine Loonen. With this system of basic medical education the Mantis device can be applied in the area by teaching the specialists the general use and mode of operation of the apparatus. The specialist in turn can instruct the local healthcare workers how to operate the device. In addition, a manual is available to clarify the handling"

Introduction
Our wetlab design is subdivided into three interrelated modules (in parallel) according to the BioBrick principle. In contrast, our drylab design is in line. Three subdividions are proposed, with one of them just outlined due to lack of experimental evidence.
Modeling Scheme
SynGenome Based GenSniper Production Modeling
In this part, we will use mathematical methods(by solve a set of ODEs with proper parameters) to predict the amount of GenSnipers we can get in a given time(the zero point for time is set as the time when IPTG is added in). This model can inform us whether our system is efficient in industry production.

Production modeling in vector production
In a simple model, the assembly of proteins are considered negligible compared with the time of transcription and translation of these proteins precursors. The amount of product is the smaller one of the amount of package proteins of phage and the amount of targeted DNA ( to be packaged by phage) per bacterial cell.
Results
Beginning with 50 plasmid per cell, the protein amount comes into equilibrium between synthesis and degradation about 10 hours later. The steady state amount of package proteins can reach the amount of about 10 in the"

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

Thereafter, they performed an enzymatic ligation of the operon with the vector plasmid fragment under the conditions of a 16 ℃ reaction for 5 to 6 hours. Then, they transformed the enzyme-ligated plasmid into E. coli top10 strain and observed its growth (the AMP resistance gene was carried on the vector plasmid to confer selectivity). The expected result is 1, 3, 4 groups of bacteria grow, but 2 groups do not. However, they conducted a number of tests and all ended in failure. So, they contacted us to discuss the reasons for the failure and the solution. Finally, we proposed to change the enzyme ligation conditions, and changed the enzyme ligation conditions to a 4 degree reaction for 22 hours (overnight reaction) for enzyme ligation, and proceeded to verify the work. They finally conducted the experiment using the solution provided by us. Sure enough, the experimental results are very good. After that, they were able to carry out the subsequent operations.
BUCT-China also helped us confirm the function of GroES & GroEL. After transforming the plasmid containing GroES & GroEL into DH5α strain, it was verified that the growth of the recombinant strain was better than that of the original strain at 1% butanol concentration. We invited BUCT-China to conduct repeated experiments to ensure the repeatability of the experiment. Through their data we found that we can come to the same conclusion. Under their verification, we confirmed that our GroESL in DH5α was correct. Click here for more: https://2018.igem.org/Team:BUCT-China/Collaborations

We offered many helps in the construction of their project. At their ‘Preliminary investigation’ stage, UESTC-Software communicated with us and we told them our needs for a new biobrick database. When their project has formed into the internal test version, we gave them valuable feedback. Our feedback has become one of the basis for their further adjustment.
We also helped UESTC-Software validate the effects of their predictor. We provided them with the FRE sequence, then they predicted this sequence, and performed promoter optimization to remove unnecessary part. We constructed plasmids with predicted promoter, then transferred it to the host DH5α. The verification proves that the predicted promoter is very likely correct.  And they helped us by using their database BioMaster. We needed some statistics aiding our experiments, so they recommended their database and we found what"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

Safe Project Design
Our project was designed intrinsically without using pathogenic chassis (for humans, animals or plants), but using antibiotics. To avoid the apparition of antibiotic resistance, several precautions must be applied during their whole uses. We notice we use at least two antibiotics together permitting to limit the resistance apparition risk.
Safe Lab Work
Our lab is classified L2 as risk class, low risk. That means there are some organisms which are pathogenic for human but the propagation is unlikely and a therapy or a phophylaxis exists to treat the pathogen-disease. However, we don’t use these organisms for iGEM manipulation. Nonetheless, we apply the Good Laboratory Practices as if we were working with this kind of organisms to avoid their propagation in the nature because it’s GMO.
The use of the antibiotics implies to manipulate them wearing a mask to filter the breathed air when they are in powder and to treat the waste containing it as chemical wastes after sterilization.
Every team member follows a special biosafety formation before starting to work in the lab.

Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

We were wondering if our peptides could activate some biochemical signal or have the larvae reject them. He said if an animal is given something it produces, the tendency is this animal will produce less. He recommended us to see if naturally, bee AMPs get into their food, it could be that maybe if bees have available more AMPs, they disactivate the bacteria, he wasn't sure about it.
When nanoencapsulated medicine is done, there is the risk that it can get accumulated somewhere within the organism since honey bees live within a month, he doesn't deem that is something we should worry about, yet he would say the fat body, that's the place bees tend to accumulate.
Regarding the incidence of American or European foulbrood, he mentioned he has worked in the US for control of these two diseases, the percentage was always around one percent, sometimes two. In Brazil, it's not established, they have few European foulbrood cases and there is no presence of American foulbrood, by the other hand, in Argentina, it has been a big problem. He was there to diagnose the first official finding of it, they had many thousands of colines dying, since then, some of their people went to Brazil to learn bee genetics and the incidence was very much reduced.
In Mexico, we have the presence of Varroa, he mentioned that's a concern because is probably affecting the bee's immune system, another reason to be concerned about the AMPs levels. If we get to see if nurse bee AMPs get to the food of larvae, that is an interesting result because it helps researches understand how bees can resist diseases. Beyond the work, we are proposing, or as part of it, he thinks is interesting to have that information.
As we continue talking about foulbrood, we asked him if it's legal to burn beehives on Brazil, he answered it’s not for someone who is not a beekeeper, the fireman is only supposed to do it if it’s a matter of environmental protection. He has burned a few beehives in a demonstration of how they control the disease when it is found, normally the government would burn beehives is there's a new problem or disease, but they are supposed to pay the beekeeper. He told us about when he was a US bee inspector, what they would do is when they find the disease, they would burn the colonies, quarantine the apiary, and tell the beekeeper he had five days to challenge, after that period, colonies that had symptoms would"

While telling the visitors about our project, we realized that some people unfortunately had a strange image of genetic technologies in their mind, like creating evil diseases or mutated rats for secret government operations by changing and editing the genes of organisms. It seems that this view is mostly based on (bad) science fiction movies. We tried to show them that synthetic biology is not a bad scientific tool, but the key to a brighter future for humanity.

Relationship between activator and Inhibitor
We’d like to design the reaction-diffusion relationship by using famous mechanism of  transcriptional regulations; Lac operon and cataborite repression. When cyaA transcripted by activator plasmid , cyaA transpoeted into periprasm layer by signaling signal sequence,ompA. After that,we leave permability of periprasmlayer.  If the periprasm layer doesn’t transmit cAMP,which synthesized by cyaA, we going to leave life span of bacteria. If activator E.coli died, they going to explode. We expect the exprotion, which burst cyaA.After that, when cyaA explode onto medium, we expect which synthesize of CRP on the medium ,from cyaA when the CRP synthesized  on the medium and incorporated into inhibitor E.coli, it going to activate the transcription of the Inhibitor, lacZ and the glucose. In activator cell, cyaA is transcripted by the Biobrick,and cyaA(transcriptional product)it transported by signal sequence into periprasm. After that, we leave the permability of periprasm.
In concretely, the activate of Inhibitor Biobrick, the lacZ,cording βgalactoristase is formed. βgalactositase also transported by signal sequence, and catabolite the lactose ,then form the glucose and lactose. By glucose absorpt 、it inhibit the transcription of Activate factor,cyaA and cAMP. And glucose going to consume.Mechanism going to be the Inhibit pathway or plasmid doesn’t have LacI binding site. So, Inihibitor cell doesn’to accept influence of the glucose.
In each plasmid,activator and Inihibitor,have the reportergene（BFP or RFP）on downstream of the plasmid. So, we can see the which constlact is activated. We can’t predict that how the pattern formatted by these relationships. So, we have to make predict the relationship"

ACMA
2015.4.27-2015.6.14
Synthetic biology as a fairly young branch of biology is still foreign to the majority of Sichuan university, we started a contest named ACMA, short for Sichuan University-Architects Competition of Microorganism Application.
This contest aimed at introducing the area of synthetic biology to more students. Students were requested to hand in their own idea of a project. They were ranked by the innovation and feasibility of their idea, and the student who ranked first won the fund to realize his or her own project.
The school started introductory lectures on synthetic biology, and successfully invited students from fifteen schools to take part in the contest, including Electrical engineering, Medical school, Business school and so on.
We also built an information platform on Wechat, informing students with notices about the contest and some fun facts relating to biology.

SCUT-China_A,2017,Team:SCUT-China A#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"-concept Experiment
        The original intention of the project is to develop a group visible and low-cost bio-sensors to detect heavy                             metal ions in the environment. In order to prove the usefulness of this concept, we did a series of experiments.                             At first, we use simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving heavy metal ions either                             in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the lake on campus and the factory manufacturing metallic                             materials. Moreover, we took water samples from the factory to test the function of our engineered bacteria.                             Among all experiments, we always follow the Do Not Release requirements .
Safe Lab Work
        Before we start our experiments, our PI and instructors have given us lessons about safety of lab work, teaching us the rules and regulations of biological experiments systematically. And members in our team have read                             the established laboratory safety principles of our school. From that, we have learned a complete understanding                             of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology.
        The topics in our safety training can be summarized as followings:
1. Biological safety
        The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility                             to contact the outside environment. Therefore, we have prevented recombinant DNA from flowing out into the                             environment. Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive                             compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.
2. Chemical Safety
        Inevitably, we are exposed to toxic chemical reagents, such as GelRed, DEPC and so on. To reduce such risks,                             some measures are taken when operating toxic chemical reagents. We place the toxic chemical reagents in the                             specific safety cabinets, and relevant operations are all done in the specific fume cupboards. We also set                             a special area for the preparation of agarose gel and agarose gel electrophoresis. Double pairs of gloves                             are required to wear while working in this area.
3. Safety of Electric and Instruments
        Before starting our lab work, the electrical engineer of the lab showed us the circuit layout and told us details                             about the use of these equipment. When finish our tasks every day, we need to take turns to check these electric                             appliances. Before using every kind of equipment, we read the instructions a few times to avoid any safety                             problems. And we will cut off the power when do not use them. Particularly for using centrifugal machines,                             we will make sure that we have already balanced it and covered the lid well before centrifugation.

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 6_-_-_TEXT.html," visible products. Looking at the primers' designs again, we think it might be due to problems with the annealing temperature. Therefore we are setting PCR reactions across a temperature gradient today to find the optimum annealing temperature.
For the first time, we actually did some Gibson assembly in a realistic setting! We (hopefully) fused together the Mg2+ fragment purified last week, along with the riboswitch DNA purified two weeks ago. If all goes according to plan, the transformation on bacillus that we later performed should provide us with some responsive bacteria by tomorrow morning. If not, we'll try again in e.coli, and see if we can make a new biobrick from the riboswitch in this chassis.
Tuesday
A day of abject failure. Bacillus from yesterday has failed to grow at all. We're leaving them in the incubator for another day, but don't hold out much hope of getting any useful results.
The problem may have been our transformation, in which one of the steps may not have been at the correct 37 °C temperature. Consequently, we're re-running the experiment, as well as trying to get the plasmid working in some TOP10 e.coli.
Gel electrophoresis of the mOrange PCR products give no visible bands. Tom discovered that a base was missing from the reverse primer- so we have ordered a revised version of it. Curiously, we also seem to have problems with our positive and negative controls.
Colony PCR of the luciferase vector followed by gel electrophoresis gave a very faint band that seems to be of the right size (the expected product was over 9kb), so the DNA is extracted. We will gibson it with the mOrange once the new primer arrives and the mOrange successfully PCR-ed up.
Touch-down PCR of pSJ150 for the fluorescent constructed yielded a single product- but not one that we expect. We will have to find a new solution.
The biobricks from the registry also appeared. Charlie streaked out the bacteria for later use.
Wednesday
Apparrently, writing off yesterday as a complete failure was somewhat pre-emptive, as it now appears that our bacillus was actually growing, albeit slowly. Given our bacteria seem to have been transformed therefore, we streaked out potentially functional colonies for testing later.
PJ suggested that pSJ150 is too large (~8.2kb) to be PCR-ed up as one-piece. He therefore gave Tom and Emmy split primers, which will amplify the vector in two chunks (3.5kb and 4."

The star peptide- extending our results to other geometries
We should note that the only variable involved in this reaction is the distance between the active sites of the two enzymes involved in the reaction i.e. the point of production and the point of degradation. Combined with the fact that diffusion is a random process and equally likely in any direction, our results can be adapted to other geometries beyond a two enzyme tether. UniMelb iGEM informed as that they are able to synthesize two and four member systems and have developed a hypothetical method of synthesizing a six member system.
As long as we recognize which distance, D, we are concerned with, the model can be adapted to any number of systems and an amplification factor, A can be defined as:
D_ij = distance between DcmA-i and FdhA-j
D_0 = comparison distance
x = number of FdhA molecules in system
n = number of DcmA molecules in system
Using this relationship, we can predict the relative efficiencies of each of these systems by calculating their amplification factor normalized over the number of molecules in the system. What our results suggest is that increasing the number of enzymes attached in the system will always increase the efficiency of the setup although there will naturally be limitations to the number of enzymes that can be attached in one system.
Visualisations of the two-member, four-member and six-member systems that UniMelb iGEM are able to synthesize. The current setups alternate the two enzyme species.

1) Re-suspend pelleted bacterial cells in 500 µl Buffer P1 BL (kept at 4 °C) and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet. Important: Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1.
2) Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 4–6 times to mix. Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
3) Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and invert the tube immediately and gently 4–6 times. To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution gently but thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer N3. The solution should become cloudy.
4) Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top micro-centrifuge. A white pellet will form. Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
5) Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through (Optional): Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
6) Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Spin for 60 seconds produces good results.
7) Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
IMPORTANT: Residual wash buffer will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation. Residual ethanol from Buffer PE may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions. They are right about this.
8) Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.

Personally, I think the experience is not as much about the project as it is about personal development and about learning and getting to know the world of science and everything it involves. This is not just lab work. And iGEM has been a huge part of me growing up and learning what I want and what I want to do when I grow older. If you ever have an opportunity to take part in iGEM in anyway, shape or form, do it. Even if it means working in a DIY lab where the incubator is made of tin foil and a light bulb like ours”

“My family’s from the Philippines, but I was born and raised in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- think South Padre Island, then go west for an hour. Both of my parents are RNs now, but my dad was a physician back in the Philippines. While I didn’t want to go to med school, I still wanted to help people through medicine like my parents do, but go into research. My uncle, who is a physics prof in the Philippines, encouraged me to, in so many words, look into the intersection between biology, physics, and chemistry for the future of medicine. So, here I am -- the only physics major on the team! I’m really excited in what we decided to tackle this year, because there’ll be some cool physics shenanigans involved later in the project. And that, really, is what I love about iGEM and synthetic biology: that it allows for, and encourages, interdisciplinary approaches in creating products, with the power of biology, to better ourselves and the world around us.”

For me, it makes sense to see proteins and bacterias as a network of computers, and see how the comparison simplifies the complexity of biology systems.

Roll-out plan
Roll-out plan
On this page you will find the iGEM Wageningen 2017 Roll-out plan. As shown on our project page there is a demand for accurate point-of-care diagnostics. But what steps need to be taken once it has been developed? How can you apply your diagnostic as efficiently as possible once an outbreak occurs?
In this roll-out plan, you will find a coherent summary of the best practices for implementing your novel diagnostic, and the current issues found in the field of point-of-care diagnostics. To find out about these problems, we talked to several renowned authorities with different expertises concerning diagnostics and epidemics and combined their insights into the following overview of how a roll-out plan for novel diagnostics could and should work. We were inspired by the thorough analysis of possible scenarios, such as those of iGEM Pasteur 2016 . Through this roll-out plan we aim to elaborate on their principle by incorporating our findings of the current practices. This way, we aim to help future iGEM teams by getting a clear overview of what human practices should be taken into account when designing and developing their new diagnostic.

While China's energy reserves are among the highest in the world, China is also the world's second largest energy producer and consumer country: after the United States and Russia, the energy production output of our country ranks third in the world, and the basic energy consumption accounts for one-tenth of world’s total consumption, which ranks second in the world. However, the level of energy resources per capita is much lower than the average level of the world.
Government
Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and the society. President Xi Jinping, at a speech at the UN office in Geneva earlier this year, stressed that ""ecological construction"" would become an important aspect of a shared international future. We have held innovation, coordination, green, open and share as our concepts of development; and we have already incorporated ecological environmental construction into the national development strategy. Energy is the basis for everything which can joint three spheres together.
Administration
National Energy Administration held mid-2017 working meeting, and pointed out that the first half of energy development was a good trend. We achieved our goals such as constantly optimizing the energy structure, supplying effective continuous improvement, making efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation and development, strengthening the construction and operation of agglomeration energy market more orderly and comprehensively promoting international energy cooperation.
They have put together projects to help people access green energy.
Corporation
There are hundreds and thousands of small energy plants struggling for finance, as most capital usually goes to big operations. To help them, Chinese government built a bridge so financiers could work out funding issues.
Professors & Experts
We interviewed the Professor Xu Qingli from school of Resources and Environment. He told us that it was necessary to understand the expert data and opinions about energy status, which was conducive to the smooth development of the practice and timely correction.
We held a mini symposium with Professors from the school of Biology. They gave comments on our projects, which later proved to be very useful in our experimental design. Also, they encouraged us to achieve the practice with what we have learned.

Public recognition
We designed a questionnaire to get to know about the public recognition of energy crisis"
