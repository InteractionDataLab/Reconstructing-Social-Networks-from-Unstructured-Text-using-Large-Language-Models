Ultimately the choice is yours: the TAPR OHL is particularly effective if the patent rights for the original work belong to the licensor, but it also has its drawbacks. As a license TAPR is older, but the CERN OHL has the backing of a strong community of physicists and does not deal as directly with patent rights.

Permissive Licenses
Features of Permissive licenses:
There are no reciprocity requirements when using a Permissive license. Redistributors can restrict access to derivative products and make them proprietary [1]
Hence they make it more likely that a given product will be repackaged and commercialised [2]
This is seen by some as a driving force for innovation and an additional freedom compared to Copyleft licenses [3]
They are designed to be legally simple and compatible with a greater variety of downstream licenses than Copyleft licenses (see compatibility charts)
It is important to recognise that any improvements on the product that are made proprietary will not be available to the community. This is not a problem with Copyleft licenses.
The BSD and MIT license logos. These are widely used and well-established permissive licenses.
A variety of Permissive licenses are available, and recently it has been proposed to develop a new one based on the Apache 2.0 software license as this is already well established [4].

How does Memory work ? ( fr ) / ( en )
How does Sleep work ? (fr) / ( en )
It was the first time we wrote for a journal on sophisticated scientific subjects, and what is more aimed at an uninitiated readers. We rapidly became aware that this task required to take a step back and start with the basics. Defining each term precisely, illustrating notions with examples, performing analogies with objects of daily life ... Science popularization is a permanent dilemma between simplicity/concision and truth/precision of the given information, and we constantly juggled between these two aspects. Through this experience, we developed teaching skills and our ability to summarize. Indeed, simplicity is the best way to get the message across. We hope to have shared our love of sciences and that we managed to motivate and convince our readers to learn more.
Parlons peu parlons science reminded us of something essential: underneath all those layers of scientific knowledge, of complex mechanisms, and endless formulas, science is above all here to be shared. And we hope that is what we achieved.
School Interventions
Fatma, Linejy and Marguerite explaining the DNA concept to children
Talking about sleep
Once again, we came to visit our little monsters in order to talk about sleep. But how can we catch their attention without boring speeches about benefits of sleep in general? All of us had probably experienced the nap. Parents say that it helps to gather some energy. However children do not realise how beneficial sleep can be for their health. At the end of the meeting, we wanted them to become aware of the importance of sleep.
As we walked into the classroom, the pupils seemed to be very restless. In order to catch their attention, we began to talk about dreams. They became very enthusiastic and mentioned the characters, the atmosphere and even the anomalies that happened into their dreams and nightmares.
They discovered afterwards the sleep cycle and they interrelated sleep and health. We finished the meeting by talking about sleep diseases. The pupils showed a lot of concern and curiosity about narcolepsy and sleepwalkers. For some of them, these words were new, but many understood very fast the impact of such diseases on the everyday life.
We finally left the classroom. Pupils seemed to be satisfied with their new knowledge but they regretted they could not tell us more dreams and nightmares.
Discovering the DNA
On June 9th, we went to primary school to meet kids aged between 7 and 8 years old and make them understand what DNA is. This intervention began with a short video"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," fairly major advances in genetically modified foods, but the UK public wasn't ready to accept them, and the press overreacted to one piece of mass-deception by one particular company, and so it's never really been possible to reintroduce that technology. But in countries where food production is less secure than here, and as populations grow and it becomes harder to feed even the West, he expects the atmosphere to change significantly.
Fionn asked about this incident mentioned above.
Graeme said it was fairly clear that there were no massive safety issues, though some things were not known and could not be known until there were large scale field trials. But the scientific background suggested it was extremely unlikely there would be any health risks or safety issues. The one unknown was how genetically modified plants would interact with plants in the wild, but he said there were now plenty of examples to show that, globally, this is not a major issue.
Allan explained about Edinburgh's project, mentioning synergy between cellulases and our attempts to bring enzymes close together on a cell surface or M13 phage. He mentioned the possibility of creating biorefineries to take in cellulose and make fuel or foods, possibly for animal consumption.
Graeme said this sort of area, multi-enzyme complexes, was taking off when he was an undergraduate. Since cellulose breakdown is done in such complexes in nature, our project starts from a relatively secure background. The difficulty for the cell-display system would be getting enough enzymes produced to bring them close enough to make a difference. We might have a better chance on bacteriophage, since in principle we have more control, though it would require a lot of optimisation.
Allan suggested up to 100,000 proteins might be expressed on a cell surface, and wondered whether that would be enough. Graeme said it was a question of density, and suggested we do some modelling.
Allan asked how undergraduates should be taught about safety and ethical issues in biotechnology.
Graeme said the university doesn't address it in a very significant way until the student's final year. He noted that biologists generally are not specifically trained in bioethics, which is more of a social science issue. But at a research level there is now a huge amount of interaction between social scientists and biologists.
If needed, he said the approach would be to bring in somebody with expertise in these areas, because many of these areas are beyond the expertise of the core teaching staff. The core staff recognise what the issues are but are not experts, so don't really teach in those areas.
He said it was important for all"

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Repressor Section_-_-_TEXT.html," system is tight.
Figure 3 Characterization plasmid pIGR03/04, containing promoters, repressor and GFP reporter. No expression of GFP shows that the repressor is working as expected.
The last plasmids, (pIGR05 and pIGR06) contains the arabinose inducible promoter pBAD with antirepressor antO/antT and RFP located downstream, see figure 4. This means that if there is expression of RFP, the anti-repressor is also expressed assuming that both proteins are equally translated.  pIGR05/06 are designed to have a different origin of replication than pIGR03/04 which allows transformation of both plasmids into the same E. coli strain. This enables us to see the influence of the anti-repressor on the repressor. We expect to see expression of both GFP and RFP, as the anti-repressor will hinder the effect of the repressor on the pR promoter.
Figure 4 Characterization plasmid pIGR05/6, containing pBAD promoter, antirepressor and RFP reporter. Expression of RFP shows that the antirepressor is expressed.
All the plasmids were assembled using the iGEM 3A assembly standard , and they were verified using PCR.
Results
Our first discovery was that when growing the E. coli transformants, carrying the pIGR01 or pIGR02 plasmid, we saw a wide variety not only in colony size, but also in level of GFP expression. Colonies with visible expression of GFP were significantly smaller in size indicating that the pR promoter expresses GFP to a level that becomes toxic to the cells,see figure 5.
Figure 5 Agar-plate with colonies of E. coli carrying pIGR01. We se small colonies expressing GFP.
The transformants carrying pIGR03 or pIGR04 did not show any expression of GFP – as expected.
Figure 6 Agar-plate with colonies of E. coli carrying pIGR02 and pIGR03. We se that colonies carrying plasmid pIGR02 are expressing GFP (left), and that colonies carrying pIGR03 are not expressing any GFP(right).
These results were very interesting and must be considered when making the final design for the switch. We might even have to consider the need for a different reporter in our final design of the switch.
Sequencing of characterization plasmids
Because of the differences in colony size and GFP expression that we saw on the transformation plates, see figure 5"

Between each tRNA gene is a rox recombination site that will allow for subsequent induced recombination within and limited to the tRNA chromosome, when the Dre recombinase is expressed at the whim of the investigator, so that the importance of order and relative copy numbers of tRNA genes on the tRNA array chromosome can be examined. Also it will be possible to detect deletions and more complex rearrangements of genes using this system and their phenotypic effect.

VT-ENSIMAG_Biosecurity,2010,Team:VT-ENSIMAG Biosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," findings to officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) after the iGEM Jamboree.
Several online news articles describing the VT-ENSIMAG project have been published. See Media Links section for more information.
Additional work
In addition to successfully developing a sequence screening software, we have also screened the iGEM registry with this software ( registry screening ).
We have also developed an application to design USER Fussion primer sequences from PCR experiments. Given the error-prone and tedious nature of designing primers by hand, this software will improve the accuracy of primer designs in the future as well as save teams much time.  ( User primer ). This application is available to download and open-source ( download it ).
Conclusions
A prototype sequence screening software, GenoTHREAT, was developed by our team in accordance with a draft sequence screening guidance published by the United States Government in 2009. To the best of our knowledge, this implementation of the draft guidance is the first of its kind. Preliminary testing of the software was completed and elucidated several operational characteristics. For instance, the keyword and anti-keyword lists used to identify ""Best Matches"" as Select Agents or Toxins play a critical role in the efficacy of the software. The quality of the sequence screening is further influenced by the BLAST parameters used and the system on which the software is run. Although the average number of sequences currently screened by companies across the industry is unknown, readily available hardware systems such as Sirion would allow a company to screen several hundred sequences of under 10,000bps per day. For more information concerning the computer systems used in testing, see section Different implementations .  Any sequence screening software must be able to recognize sequences which have been modified but which can be reconstituted into a functional form. The GenoTHREAT software was able to effectively identify sequences containing ""hidden"" lengths of Select Agent or Toxins, sequences which have been randomly mutated, or codon optimized sequences. A manuscript is being prepared for publication which will explain the methods and results in greater detail.  To test the software in a real world environment, the iGEM sequence registry was screened using GenoTHREAT. Upon a manual review of the hits, one dangerous sequence were identified: a gene for Botulinum Neurotoxin A. This sequence was already known by iGEM officials to be part of the registry.
Preliminary testing of the prototype sequence screening software, GenoTHREAT, has identified it as a potentially viable software for implementation in a large scale screening environment such as the iGEM registry or gene"

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.      It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",     and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,     and theological speculation throughout history.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Collaborations#Translation_-_-_TEXT.html," Wendepunkt. Während die erste organische Chemie bereits erfunden war, war die von nicht allzu langer Zeit entstandene Generation von organischen Molekülen zutiefst verschieden. Sie waren in räumlich begrenzten Strukturen organisiert und replizierten sich in einer immer schneller werdenden Geschwindigkeit selber. Bald darauf waren alle frei verfügbaren organischen Bausteine verbaut, die immer komplexere Strukturen begannen um Ressourcen und Lebensraum zu konkurrieren. Leben entstand und mit ihm die Darwinistische Evolution.  Das Konzept des Lebens hat sich als unermesslich Energiereich herausgestellt und unseren Planeten hat sich schnell entwickelt in das, was ET als einen großen Bioreaktor beschrieben hat. Unzählige Mutationens- und Selektionsrunden über Milliardenjahre erhöhte die wunderschöne biologische Vielfalt und Komplexität die wir heute haben. Leben taucht auf und kann sich nahtlos anpassen um auch noch die härtesten und unfreundlichsten Umgebungen durch schlaue Lösungen zu besiedeln - unter der Voraussetzung, dass sie genug Zeit haben diese zu finden. Und das ist der Punkt wo unser Projekt beginnt.  Dieses Jahr hat sich das iGEM Team Heidelberg das Ziel gesetzt die enormen Energie der Darwinschen Evolution sich zu bedienen und die Entwicklung von Biomolekülen, die dem Menschen nutzen, zu erleichtern. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, setzen wir auf die PACE (Phagen-assistierte kontinuierliche Evolution) Methode, welche Evolution verkleinert und beschleunigt und zu einem vordefinierten Zweck hinführt. PACE verknüpft das Überleben von schnell mutierenden Phagen die ein Gerüst aus Proteinen tragen mit der direkten Selektion innerhalb von E. coli - Wirten. Damit können die Proteine mit den gewünschten Eigenschaften innerhalb von Stunden evolvieren anstatt von Jahrhunderten.  Um das enorme Potential zu nutzen, wollen wir einen umfassenden und standardisierten Werkzeugkasten designen und eine dazugehörige Software, die die Anwendung von PACE für diverse Proteinklassen einschließlich Enzymen für pharm"

Part4: THU-E Sweet Pressure Part
This is a plasmid  providing selection pressure for the evolution and enrichment of tryptophan  overproduction microorganism phenotype by glucose utilization.The selection  pressure was based on the tryptophan dependent maltose  hydrolase expression which functioned in a maltose-sole carbon source culture  condition. It is achieved by cloning E.  Coli maltose hydrolase gene (malQ)  downstream of our previously constructed tryptophan biosensor which is controlled  by the strict araBAD promoter in amalQdeletion  strain E. Coli JW3379.A random ribosome binding sequence (RBS) library upstream  of malQwere constructed. 48 strains  from the library were selectedbased onthe growth difference between maltose and  glucose M9 minimal culture condition. Strain 3-4 with the RBS sequence“AAAAAAATGTGCT”  was selected and named after sweet pressure part strain.
The  performance of the sweet pressure part strain 3-4 was further measured in a  tryptophan addition fashion. The colony from LB agar plate was picked up and  cultured in M9 medium with 8g/L glucose for overnight. On the next day, seed  medium was transferred to fresh M9 medium in 24 well plate with2, 4, 6 and 8g/L  maltose as single carbon source, respectively. Initial OD600 was set  as 0.16. When OD600 of the medium reached 0.6, 0, 0.5 and 1g/L  L-arabinose, 0 and 1mM was added as induction. The growth curve was measured  and shown in Figure.3.
It could be found that for conditions of 4 or 6g/L maltose in M9 medium, when  inducer arabinose was added as 1g/L, strains induced by 1mM trypt"

For starters, we offered timely help to them around May on how to establish a team by sending basic plasmids and answering questions through social media. After many rounds of discussions, we invited them to Nanjing University to have a face-to-face communication about each other’s project on June 9th. In return for this little conference, on September 24th, some of our team members and our team leader joined the meeting up with TMMU-China along with a few other teams. It is indeed a wonderful collaboration experience and both of us benefited a lot from each other by regular discussions. We sincerely hope that we can hear good news from each other in Boston!

The dynamics model constructed for 'Low-temperature  Release System'
Motivation
   A low-temperature release system was designed and constructed in the Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT or Terminator) to control target protein expression. A specific ribosome binding site (RBS) BBa_K115002 with high translation activity at high temperature(> 37°C) and low translation activity at room temperature was used to design the temperature-dependent genetic circuit in E. coli, with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) used as the reporter protein (Fig. 1). We analyzed fluorescence intensity during E. coli growth at log phase and stationary phase at temperatures 25°C, 30°C, 30°C and 40°C. Our experimental results indicates that high temperature decreased the translation rate of the target protein, and this temperature-dependent genetic circuit can control the expression level of the target protein by the host cell's incubation temperature. However, the translational activity of the RBS BBa_K115002 at different temperatures can not be quantified directly from experimental data. To overcome this problem, we provided a dynamic model which can quantitatively assess the translation strength of the RBS BBa_K115002 at temperatures 25°C, 30°C, 37°C and 40°C.

Bacteria has urea channel which is regulated positively by protons, opening at acidic pH values to allow more urea in to buffer cytosolic and surface pH, and closing at neutral pH to avoid over-alkalinization [1].
Ammonia (NH3) buffers the cytosol and periplasm, and creates a neutral layer around the bacterial surface[1].With this surface created by bacteria, protects itself against low acid coditions of the stomach.
Figure 1: Helicobacter Pylori Environment.
Autoinducer 2 (AI-2)
Such as many gram-negative and gram positive bacteria has the quorum sensing (QS) molecule, H. Pylori has this molecule too. QS molecules are specific, low-molecular-weight signal molecules which used by bacteria to regulate expression of genes in response to changes in population density.[2]
H. pylori has Quorum Sensing molecule “Autoinducer-2 (AI-2)” which is produced depended on the activity of the LuxS enzyme [3].
Based on the information given above, we expect to find ammonia and Auto-inducer 2 molecules in the existence of H. pylori. Thus we aim to sense both of these molecules to find out if H. Pylori’s presence.
Figure 2:Our “AND GATE” system diagram: According to our system, TnrA transcription factor represses TnrA promoter which produce Toehold. In the presence of NH3 this press will be eliminated and Toehold will be produced. Lsr transcription factor represses pLsr promoter which produce Trigger mRNA. In the presence of AI-2 (Autoinducer-2) this press will be eliminated and Trigger mRNA will be produced. In conclusion Trigger mRNA opens the toehold system and TEV-Protease will be formed.
As a result, our “SENSING” system composed of three parties:
1.NH3 sensitive TnrA promoter
2. AI-2 sensitive Lsr promoter
3. Toehold system
1. NH3 Sensitive TnrA Promoter
Bacteria use nitrogen which is present in nearly all macromolecules such as proteins, carbonhydrates and peptidoglycan. Prokaryotes have developed transport and assimilation systems for a variety of nitrogen sources for living under optimal conditions and regulate their own systems. This regulatory network allows an adequate response to situations of nitrogen limitation.

UCSF,2012,Team:UCSF#Violacein Results_-_-_TEXT.html," which only has the first half of the enzymes necessary to produce violacein is still able to produce a green pigment. When the pigment is extracted from cells, the wavelength scan shown in dark blue is obtained.
Strain 2, which has the second half of the violacein pathway, produces no pigment. This is expected because without the first half of the pathway, no pigment can be produced.
Strain 3, which contains the entire violacein operon produces a wavelength scan similar to our standard obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, with violacein having a maximum absorbance near 575nm.
Co-Culture: Strain 1 and Strain 2 grown together (red line) produce a wavelength scan that indicates production of violacein.
Violacein Mono- and Co-Culture Extractions:
When monocultures of strain 1 was grown, a dark green pigment was clearly observed. As seen in the plate above, strain 2 did not have any pigment on its own. However, when co-cultures of strain 1 and strain 2 were grown and the pigment extracted a purple pigment was seen and based on wavelength scans (above) appears to be violacein.
Addressing Efficiency and Metabolic Burden
Using linear interpolation (from the maximum absorbance at 575nm, wavelength scans above) we found that the co-culture produces 3.6199 mg/ml violacein and the total operon produces 3.5945mg/ml. While this amount is nearly equal, we believe that the production of violacein could be optimized such that it would produce much more violacein than the monoculture.
The growth rates of strains decrease when inducer is added, as shown in the left graph. By  comparing the rate of induced and uninduced growth, we can see how the cells are affected by production of their respective enzymes, and therefore how high the metabolic burden is. In the bar graph, Strain1+Strain2 (coculture) clearly is least affected by metabolic burden, showing that splitting a metabolic pathway does seem to lessen metabolic burden.

At the beginning, we focused on no-antibiotic screening in recombinant strains. To figure out the current use of antibiotics in medical and laboratory research, we talked to Dr. Ye from Capital Medical University. He indicated that the                     ability of screening specific strains without antibiotics would undoubtedly be a great breakthrough in fundamental research. However, he also pointed out that the use of antibiotics is irreplaceable in medical healing but dosage and                     extensive application are strictly stated in our law. Dr. Ye made us aware of the fact that the abuse of antibiotics is in fact a very severe problem afflicting modern society.In parts, this problem is, as Dr. Ye says, the strict controls                     of top laboratories making the leakage of superbugs hardly possible. Dr. Ye thus recommended a close collaboration with industrial companies for the law forbids the use of antibiotics in mass-producing fermentation. After the discussion,                     we continually focused on overuse of antibiotics and drafted a manifesto calling for the legislation of biosafty with the help of ZJUT.
When it comes to industrial biology, we came up with the idea of providing growth advantage, leading to the final selectivity of recombinant strains and useful mutants. Dr. Ye was fascinated by our ideas and claimed that applications of                     self-screening system will have a high demand for usage in the industrial business.
Prof. Xin Mingxiu
Chinese society of microbiology
Beijing normal university
As our project is mainly about the self-control of microorganisms, we thought it is necessary to consult prof. Xin for some advice. Having been engaging in industrial organism for decades,Prof. Xin is one of the most qualified experts                     in fermentation industry. Prof. Xin greatly appreciated the prospect of our parts’ application in industry, but he also mentioned that the ethical, social, legal, and environmental impact of a concept usually unfolds when it is transformed                     from a novel idea into reality ,especially when it is applied to the practice of production. Compared to the professional technicians, we lacked necessary industrial experience, so we surveyed LooKChem®, a leading biotechnology company                     in Hunan, China.
We focused on two questions during the investigation:
How does a biotechnology factory control the stability of strains in huge-amount gross production?
When our idea of automatic selection is converted into an application, what should be thoroughly considered?
LooKChem®
About these questions, Dr. ? gave us two important information. The first is when it comes to the biological legalization, an automatic cell factory is forbidden to use antibiotics which is"

Project Safety
Below are our responses to the four questions posed by the iGEM judges:
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher Safety
Work with E. coli and Bacillus can be done under Class I microbiological safety regulations in the UK. The E. coli strains we used are harmless, and B. subtilis is also considered to be harmless, and is, in fact, used in large quantities in the food industry. We were careful to follow the microbiological safety rules laid down in our department. However, cadmium is a toxic metal. There are regulations and restrictions for working with heavy metals. To test our cadmium sensor device BBa_K174015 , these regulations would have to be followed, although we did not get to this point. The UK Government's guidance for working with cadmium are at: HSE's guidance .
For the duration of the project, the team have been working in the Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences (iCaMB) (Newcastle University) who have drawn up rules for all lab workers to adhere to. To read a summary of the rules compiled by iCaMB, please click on this link . There was a full version of this document which can be found on iCaMB's website however this information is only available to on-campus students and staff. We made sure we were familiarised with all of these rules
Public Safety
Our project is about sequestering cadmium into inert spores. Spores are extremely resiliant bodies, able to withstand extremes of temperature, mechanical and enzymatic conditions. Once cadmium is immobilised in spores which are unable to germinate, the toxic metal should no longer provide a hazard to the environment. Even if"

The presentation went extremely well and the Chief Scientist was very impressed with their work in the summer and the progress made. The students were finally able to let out a sigh of relief as they finished their presentation successfully. Afterwards, they came back to the lab to perform the transformation on the plasmid. The students followed the protocol exactly and were able to achieve favorable results.
Packaging: The entire iGEM team met at Carroll in the morning to explain the project to several teachers from the science department and to the principal. Later, the team presented to the chief scientist of the 711th. In the lab, a second transformation was performed using the ligations that were left overnight. Additionally, samples from the flasks containing the University of Michigan strains were prepared for storage in the negative eighty degree freezer.
Week 11: August 7-11
Monday (08/07/17)
Sense/Respond: Unfortunately the students were disheartened to learn that none of the plates grew colonies. The students were at first shocked, but immediately started tracing back to the different protocols and plasmids from the past few days. Mentor Mike ultimately recommended them to run another gel on the PCR product and the students diligently began the gel protocol. After a few hours, the gel inspection seemed fine and the bands displayed exactly what the students expected. Therefore Mentor Mike recommended that they re-do the ligation from Monday. The ligation went very smoothly and the transformation will be done tomorrow.
Packaging: Samples of pJAAM01 from early August were digested using Nco1 in the hope that the TOPO fragment would separate from the pBAD-CsgA-dCBD plasmid. A gel showed the digests to be successful, and a gel extraction was performed. The concentrations of the results from the gel extraction were checked using a Nanodrop. The RXers then set up ligations using the gel extractions and a gel was run to confirm the gel extractions. Colonies from the transformants of pBAD-CsgA from last week were patched on an agar plate and inoculated in culture tubes. Finally, plates were streaked using the freezer stocks of the University of Michigan strains and left to grow overnight.
Tuesday (08/08/17)
Sense/Respond: Today the LabPats were finally able to transform the plasmid from the ligation yesterday. They followed the standard protocol and transformed the cells into E. coli DH5a again. After that, the cells were ready to be plated like previously. This time"

TecBio iGEM Presentation at Pitt Beyond the Bench[mark]
On July 11th, the Pitt and CMU iGEM teams went to give project presentations at Pitt with the TecBio group. Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TecBio): ""Simulation and Visualization of Biological Systems at Multiple Scales"" REU program is a 10-week summer program that provides a challenging and fulfilling graduate-level research experience to undergraduate students. Students receive classroom training in topics pertinent to the emerging field of computational biology, such as computational structural biology, cell and systems modeling, computational genomics, and bioimage informatics. For CMU and Pitt iGEM, this provided a wonderful audience for giving our first presentations of iGEM, biology, modeling, and outreach being worked on by the teams. A heavy emphasis was placed on the modeling aspect because of the nature of the program being more related to computational biology than anything else. Once the two presentations were done, we took questions and socialized over pizza and drinks. It was a good group to give our first presentations to and helped us tighten up our public speaking skills.
July 11, 2014; 21 undergraduates
SRI iGEM Presentation at CMU Beyond the Bench[mark]
Also on July 11th, the CMU iGEM Team presented to the Summer Research Institute (SRI) participants. In this summer program, students spend ten weeks working on a research project with a faculty member. Research projects involve recombinant DNA techniques and biochemical methods directed towards the functional analysis of proteins and enzymes. In addition to wet laboratory techniques, students use software for DNA analysis and experimental design. This provided another platform for the CMU iGEM team to practice their project presentation and receive feedback along with the questions.

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html,", can take up to a year from publishing the application. This ensures safety, but hardly promotes innovation. Once the authorization is granted, it is valid for 10 years – renewably – throughout the whole Community, but the authorized action is subject to a constant supervision.
3.2.3. Labeling
The fundamental and detailed rules of labeling are also covered by these two regulations. Food and feed products containing GMOs must be labeled as such, i.e. by printing a clearly visible text of “genetically modified” on the product. The only exception applies to products that contain less than 0.9 % GMOs.
3.2.4. Option to “opt out” for Member States
Although the geographical scope of the granted authorization covers the whole Community, there are several Member States that have successfully banned some GM products from their territories. If Member States want to do so, they have to invoke the safeguard clause of Directive 2001/18/EC, but they are supposed to have reasonable cause of the prohibition. For instance, several Member States, including Hungary have banned producing, selling and using GM maize MON810 on their territories. Even though in that specific case the Scientific Panel of EFSA did not find the scientific evidence provided by Hungary enough to justify the prohibition of MON810 , the Council of Ministers rejected the Commission’s proposal to force Hungary along with and Austria to lift their bans.  I would like to note that Hungary also banned Amflora in 2010 , and given the abovementioned retreat of BASF in Europe, this ban is also very likely not to be lifted. Summarizing the EU legislative rules and attitudes, it is very interesting to see how the Community tries to maneuver between promoting innovation and minimizing risks. Back in 1998, the European Parliament and the Council admitted the importance of biotechnology and genetic engineering and talked about their protection with the words: “will certainly be of fundamental importance for the Community's industrial development.”  In my opinion, today’s Europe tends to choose risk minimization over innovation and growth, but only time will be able to tell whether it was the right decision or not.
4. The United States
As mentioned above, the American way of dealing with the GM issue is almost the opposite of the European. Given that the Unites States is the largest GM crops producer in the world, it is not surprising their jurisdiction and government firmly support these new technologies. Their less restrictive legislation dates back to the 1980s, when the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee was established, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States"

Deeper look at ProteinGAN
Introducton
After seeing multiple successful applications of GAN (generative adversarial networks) in numerous of fields, we have decided to apply them to the field of synthetic biology for the creation of novel biological parts with useful functions. More specifically, we were interest in world’s cleanest and environmentally friendly catalyzers - enzymes. For many important reactions used in research or industry we don’t have the appropriate enzymes to catalyze them, and have not other option but to use chemical catalyzers.
Thus, we have decided to build the world’s first Protein sequence Generative Adversarial Network (ProteinGAN) which would be capable to learn “what makes protein a protein”. We have started by acquiring and standardizing large number of protein sequences from public databases, which all had a specific class attributed to them.
After in-depth literature analysis and a large number of in-silico prototypes we have built the appropriate GAN architecture for protein work. Finally - we have trained the neural networks with specific classes of enzymes. We have hoped they would learn how to generate the class of enzymes they were trained for, yet also deliver unique protein sequences for that class.
All important technical details, architectural choices and detailed explanation of how ProteinGAN works can be found at the end of the page.
In addition to that, we also provided a short guide on how to build and train your own ProteinGAN !
Gathering the Protein Sequence data
As an initial sequence database we used the full (reviewed + unreviewed) UniProtKB database. We selected the sequences which had a full EC number associated and filtered out the sequences which had been known to form heteromeric complexes. The resulting dataset was relatively sparse for our purpose, therefore we decided to upsample using the NCBI RefSeq non-redundant protein database ("

UiOslo_Norway,2016,Team:UiOslo Norway#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"idase. LacZ alpha and -omega are two separate peptides that form the active form of galactosidase when in contact with each other. By fusing these two peptides to two separate dCas9 constructs recognizing adjacent parts of the same gene, the presence of said gene would be coupled to the forming of a functioning galactosidase. Thus, by adding for example liquid compounds similar to X-gal, a visible color change could be achieved, similar to the one seen in our project with nitrocefin.
By designing different tracr/crRNA sequences, this design could potentially be altered to recognize any gene present in high enough numbers in a liquid sample.

To investigate how this would work with different classes of ESBL, we aligned the sequences found in clinical isolates of ESBL infections in Norway (information provided by Ørjan Samuelsen in Tromsø).

Although it includes relatively few sequences, this phylogeny suggests that the classes A, B C and D of ESBL are so different on a genetical level that the design we propose could probably be used to pin-point the class of ESBLs present in a sample, simply by designing crRNA/tracrRNA compatible to sequences unique to each class.
In summary: to expand our project, we want to create a potentially universal gene detection tool by utilizing parts from the iGEM registry, as there are several dCas9-constructs and LacZ peptides there. The set-up would include both bioinformatics, when designing the right RNA sequences, regular cloning, to fuse the LacZ peptides to dCas9 and protein expression to form the final constructs. If realized, this would enable us to efficiently test for both ESBL proteins and genes within minutes using our PhoneLab. By adding more slots for cuvettes in our hardware, this test could have been integrated into the set-up and enabled us to test for both ESBL proteins and genes at the same time.  Thus, we imagine to use CRISPR/Cas9 methods in a relatively new and creative way, and have a concrete plan as to how to improve and expand our project.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html,". By means of several biochemical steps a 7-methylguanosine molecule is bound to the 5’ end of the pre-mRNA, via a 5’ to 5’ triphoshpate linkage.  This 5’ cap has various functions including prevention of 5’ degradation, export from the nucleus and initiation of translation.  Not only the 5’ end but also the 3’ end is modified, this process is called polyadenylation. Therefore a Polyadenylation signal is needed (consensus sequence 5'- AAUAAA-3'), further in the 3’ direction occurs a 5’-CA-3’ element, these both sequences are recognized by the enzymes cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and cleavage stimulation factor. Together they are attracting many other proteins including Polyadenylate Polymerase (PAP). The protein complex cuts the pre-mRNA at the CA element and the PAP adds about 200 adenine residues to the 3’ end.  The function of the poly-A tail is protection against degradation, marking of the end of the transcript and aid in translation initiation.  The pre-mRNA contains not only these sequences coding for the protein, so called exons, but also many sequences which are non-coding. These introns have to be removed, that occurs in a process known as splicing. A protein complex called spliceosom connects all the exons thereby cutting out the introns. Responsible for the recognition of the exon-intron borders are small nuclear RNA within the spliceosom. Many genes can be spliced in several ways, an incident termed alternative splicing. [48] [49]
Regulation of transcription in eukaryotic organisms
Cells have to adapt to changes in their environment and must be able to receive and react to extra cellular signals; cells accomplish these requirements by the up and down regulation of certain proteins. The protein expression in eukaryotic cells can be regulated on many different levels, this article concentrate on the regulation of transcriptions.  Only a small percentage of the human genomic DNA is transcribed into mRNA. On the opposite, a huge part of the human genome is involved in regulating the transcription of coding sequences.  To initiate transcription of a gene eukaryotic RNA-polymerases have to bind to several general transcription factors to establish the so called initiation complex (IC), which is able to bind to the DNA. The binding occurs upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) in a region called core promoter, this part of the promoter often contains specific elements like the"

     The goal of our system is to regulate the soil microbiota in order to reach the maximum crop productivity. To accurately predict the curcumin content from NPK content in soil, we created a bio-sensor. This sensor could precisely detect the curcumin containment in turmeric. After the detection of curcumin, results could be fitted into our productivity model and utilize artificial intelligent to increase the accuracy.

Project 2: Biofilm Prevention
Quorum Sensing in LuxR containing Bacteria
This year the CU iGEM team has harnessed the quorum sensing factors endogenous in the Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium LT2 strain to detect AHLs produced by other bacteria. Neither Salmonella nor E. coli have been shown to produce detectable levels of AHLs, so they were model organisms for the detection of other AHL producing bacteria such as VF, or pathogenic bacteria such as Yersinia pestis. AHLs are small molecules synthesized by most gram negative bacteria, and are able to freely diffuse throughout the membrane. When the concentration of AHL producing bacteria in a specific area increases, the total concentration of AHLs diffusing into the cytoplasm also increases. Once a threshold level of AHLs are in the cytosol, transcription factors like the VF LuxR or Salmonella enterica SdiA activate gene synthesis for quorum factors to be produced. In pathogenic bacteria, these signals have been shown to activate transcription of pathogenic factors.
Detection and silencing of AHL producing bacteria
The SdiA transcription factor has been shown to be more sensitive to lower concentrations and a greater diversity of AHLs than its LuxR homolog. We took advantage of this extra-sensitivity to create a detection system for AHL producing bacteria, while additionally attaching the detection system to the secretion of potent AHLases such as the Aiia enzyme, and a reporter protein RFP. Using this construct we tested whether we could disrupt the quorum sensing signal AHLs in order to keep them from reaching the threshold concentration to activate the less sensitive LuxR receptor. The VF species and other pathogenic bacteria use the LuxR receptor, therefore inhibition of AHLs would keep VF from producing light. Keeping the VF from producing light is an analogous model to keeping pathogenic bacteria from being stimulated by AHLs to release their pathogenesis factors.
Inhibiting quorum sensing in bacteria has been shown to not only inhibit the transcription of pathogenesis factors, but also to keep biofilms from forming. In the history of iGEM, teams have used secreted enzymes to digest biofilms that have already been made, but our use of quorum sensing inhibitors have gone a step further, and are being tested in their ability to keep bacteria from making biofilms in the first place.

The TU Delft team also works on a part which can provide stickiness to E. coli. Thus, we have decided to collaborate to improve the results and characterization of our respective parts. Their project is about mussel glue and protein responsible of the attachement of mussel to rocks. The strength of this adherence, transposed to bacteria, could be an efficient way to fix bacteria on a support for various purposes, like the production of biofuels.
After an exchange of e-mails and a visioconference, we were able to find different ways to help each other.
We offered to reproduce each other's experiments, to validate the repeatability of our characterization tests. But also...
What we did for them
Both team had issues with a promoter existing in the registry, we have decided to synthesise a strong promoter (trc promoter) and to provide it to TU Delft team.
We have shared our stickiness characterization protocol in 24 well plate and by violet crystal in order to help them characterize their part.
What they did for us
With these protocols, they are able to repeat our experiment to confirm our results.
They provided us an access to their confocal microscope to get some detailed pictures of our sticky strain.
They offered us to use their model of adherence. However, after examining it, we realized this model was not adapted to our project.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," By pressing a button, the displays switches between showing either the illumination time in a range from 1 second to 60 minutes, or the LED's intensity in percent. The only problem with this interfacing option is the amount of wires needed for its connection. As the displays need to be attached to the outer side of the case protecting the circuitry and the operator, all connections would have to be made using isolated cables. This is disadvantageous in terms of assembly, heat dissipation and durability.
The next evolutionary step was to use a LCD‑display as the central user interface. The model that we decided on is a 128 x 64 pixel LCD‑display that is controlled via the Inter‑Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol. This protocol uses two bidirectional open-drain lines, the Serial Data Line (SDA) and the Serial Clock Line (SCL). Both are pulled‑up to V+ with resistors. In principal, digital data is transmitted over SDA by pulling the voltage down to ground, synchronized with a regularly switching voltage of SDA that specifies the frequency of the data transmittance. The peripheral device called ""slave"", in this case our LCD‑display, is addressed by its individual 7‑bit address.
The LCD‑display offers a greatly enhanced flexibility and even allows to display images in low resolution, for example our team logo. To make use of these enhanced capabilities, we decided to leave behind the control buttons and tried something more intuitive: A rotary encoder. A rotary encoder is basically a turning knob that has no scaling and is endlessly rotatable both in clockwise and anticlockwise direction. It emits a distinctive signal to the microcontroller when rotated into either of the two directions. Because it has no scaling, the microcontroller program has to interpret these signals and display the corresponding action on the LCD‑display. Even though this requires a more complex software, the amount of cables needed is greatly reduced. In addition, the turning knob of the rotary encoder encloses a button as well. By pressing the turning knob for a short period of time, we programmed the microcontroller to switch between adjusting the illumination intensity or duration when the rotary encoder is turned. By pressing and holding the turning knob, the illumination is started.
A rotary encoder and the I2C controlled LCD‑display showing our team logo.
This interfacing option turned out to be perfectly suited for our application. Furthermore, it is easily adoptable when additional features need to be added in future. No hardware modifications are needed, because both the display and the rotary encoder are controlled software sided."
Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html,"  As we begin today, I understand the true importance of making a paper prototype before actually programming so we can all be on the same page of how features will work and the software’s layout.
6/23/2015: Day 17
Today we finalized the basic layout and made certain features (such as the scanner) functional, but the software is still having trouble with marker recognition.  We reprinted out markers and attached them to new vessels with which to use them, but it’s still a bit funky.  We’ll come back and try again tomorrow!
6/24/2015: Day 18
We finished most of the basic functionality today.  In the afternoon, we were informed that due to the way that the MultiTaction screens are set up at The Tech, we cannot use the set up that we had had of two “scenes” on one screen.  We began re-designing, and continued on functionality.
6/25/2015: Day 19
Today, we checked in with Orit and discussed our next few steps- we’ve been working on functionality, but now we are beginning to see more of a need for an alternative design that is more collaboration-focused.  We continued to brainstorm possible designs.
6/26/2015: Day 20
We spent the morning going over our designs and listening pros and cons of each, and then after lunch we met Mike Horn, an assistant professor at Northwestern and the director of Northwestern’s TIDAL (Tangible Interaction Design and Learning) lab.  He showed us some of the projects that TIDAL is working on and it was so incredibly exciting to see the ways his lab applies computational thinking and computer science to education.  He also shared some helpful literature with us, including Thomas Humphrey’s Fostering Active Prolonged Engagement, which was very interesting to read and very applicable to what we’re working on.  Today was such an exciting day.
6/29/2015: Day 21
We devoted all of today to brainstorming and creating a new paper prototype!  A busy day.
6/30/2015: Day 22
Today we finished the paper prototype and chatted with Stephanie Houde, a Wellesley grad with a lot of graphic design experience.  She shared a lot of tips, including taking photos of each step and how to consider animations that inform the user how to proceed, including exaggeration and “amping up” to introduce movement/animation about to occur.

As for the His-terminator, we tried to optimize our signal sequence to find the minimal sequence length which still enables antitermination.
It turned out that a signal with overall 10 nt, 8 nt for the random signaling part, and 2 nt for the part which partially binds to the Trp-terminator,  5' CUGGGUAUUC 3', suffice to enable antitermination as the picture and the corresponding video below display.

Results
We showed that the Trp-terminator should function properly. Although the terminator itself is less stable than the His-terminator for appropriate signal length the terminator is not folding, thus antitermination occurs. We also demonstrated that a signal length of 10 nt is sufficient for successful antitermination.

Tyler Forster
Once upon a time in land very similar to Edmonton, Alberta, lived two ordinary people with an extraordinary dream. This dream was to produce a son who would go on to contribute to the invigorating field of synthetic biology. On a beautiful morning in a time very similar the year of 1991, this dream, of a not yet existent field of science, took root with the birth of a son. He was known throughout the land as Tyler Forster. For many years, the dream lay low as it gathered force. In a year very similar to 2010, the time had come for the dream's full power to be displayed, and so Tyler got involved with iGEM while in his first year at a very similar institution to the University of Lethbridge. As part of the master plan, Tyler's parents subconsciously interested him into bird-watching, soccer, volleyball and especially basketball. Although the story is far from over, the rest of the story has yet to play out. And so dear children, I will leave you to sleep in peace, secure in the knowledge that greater things are still to be done in this city. *To be continued, but probably not*

Software
image taken with the camera
analyzed image
The WatsOn software is responsible for presenting a user interface on the display of the device and to take images with the LED wavelength selected by the user. Therefore, it is separated into three single components: the graphical user interface (GUI) with a backend script running on the Raspberry Pi and the code on the Arduino board.
The GUI (left image) provides the user with the option to take a single image or a time lapse shooting and specify parameters for the camera and the wavelength of the LEDs. The wavelength used in our device are 480nm for GFP and 450nm for iLOV. Furthermore, the images are analysed for the presence or absence of P. aeruginosa by processing the image with Measurarty and providing the user with a visual feedback (right image). All taken images can be saved to disk manually for single images and automatically for time lapse shootings.
Further details on the software including the backend which gives the possibility of using the GUI remotely on a different device (e.g. notebook) in the same local network can be found here [1] .
Measurarty
SRM component of our image analysis component Measurarty
SRM is one of the core components of our image analysis approach. This image shows the different regions created.
Measurarty is the image analysis software of our device and is designed to allow an automatic segmentation and classification of our agar chip pictures. Therefore, it accepts an image from WatsOn as an input and produces an output image with pathogenic regions marked in red.
This component mainly focuses on recognizing pathogens early, such that pure thresholding is not necessary. We therefore designed a pipeline and established a smoothness index to make statements about the pathogenity of a chip as early as possible, but also with as much certainty as possible.
A sample output of the segmentation is presented below, showing that the pipeline works as intended.
The left half shows the original images from the device and the right half shows the same pictures with the detected pathogenic region analyzed by Measurarty.
Detecting P. aeroginosa with K131026
Measurarty identifies the fluorescence signal given by K131026 in response to P. aeruginosa.
Achievements

These triangles, so called pods, fulfill different tasks such as the fixation of carbon dioxide, food production and local recreation without hindering the renewable energy generation, furthermore the transportation of passengers and goods.  As we were amazed finding such a great sustainable concept, we didn't hesitate to get in touch with Op.N (Ali Fard and Ghazal Jafari). We asked for their permission for mentioning their work on our page, and they gave us a nice and fast feedback affirming the ""great structural flexibility and expandability of the triangular floating pods"". We believe that this design is feasible and that an additional PhyscoFilter pod could extend this design. Using the rafts close to big cities doesn't bring along the problems other solutions have to face. Most cities use just a fraction of their water surface, leaving much space that could easily be made use of. At this point the the PARALLEL NETWORKS concept establishes. The raft's great flexibility also enable a short time of usage, simply changing their location if they get in the way of other schemes, avoiding greater costs.
Commercially available rafts called ""Kampen""

During the search for a possibility to build remediation rafts for our moss filter we found BGS Ingenieurbiologie und -ökologie GmbH which is a German company that developed and provides products for the revegetation of rivers and wetlands. The company has its head office in Tangstedt, Pinneberg (BW) and is specialized in engineering on biological tasks. It is one of the leading manufacturer for individual solutions that must harmonize with the environments natural development.

Thus MeHg levels decreased until the NADP pool within the cell was depleted and MerA was no longer able to remediate mercury ions resulting from demethylation, leading to cell death.
Encapsulation

The main goal of EncapsuLab was to create a system for the preservation and protection of the bacteria in our system,  as well as physically separating them from the outside environment. To achieve this, we created a water-porous   silica matrix using techniques developed by the Aksan and Wackett labs at the U of M. Furthermore, we developed   a device to work as a proof of concept for the use of encapsulated bacteria in a real water-cleaning system.  In addition to this, we conceptualized a scaling-up of our system for larger water-cleaning problems. Lastly,  we developed a mathematical model to compare our experimental data in order to better understand the biochemical networks behind our work.

Encapsulation Procedure
To make a silica matrix surrounding a cell, we needed a supply of silica nanoparticles and a reactive cross-linker capable of
covalently bonding reagents into a unified volume. Two solutions were prepared: one was a combination of TM-40 (colloidal
silica) and diluting components (ultrapure water and polyethylene glycol). The second solution was tetramethyl orthosilicate
(TMOS) cross-linker. In slightly acidic conditions, methyl groups of TMOS are hydrolyzed, producing methanol and the silica
cross-linker. Resuspended and washed cells are then added to the relatively innocuous colloidal solution. Upon combining
these two mixtures, a rapid polymerization linking colloidal silica together occured. In order to achieve proper bead
sphericity, we combined all of these components in an hydrophobic solution and let them set. After some experimentation, we
were able to produce beads with a consistent size. To purify the mixture, we phase-separated the silica beads by adding
water to solution, which forced them into the aqueous phase. These were then recovered to assess viability.
The Biochemical Network
In this project, systems of mathematical equations are used to model the biochemical network of methylmercury conversion in E. coli and to determine the effects of changing methylmercury concentration on the conversion rate. A combination of enzyme kinetics and protein expression equations was in the model."

""a.external"" addresses all links that have been assigned to the group ""external"" (<a class=""external"">-tags). ""#bestImage"" refers to the element that has the ID ""bestImage"" (e.g. <img id=""bestImage"">-tag). And finally "".red"" selects all tags within the class ""red"" (e.g. <a class=""red"">, <p class=""red"">, <table class=""red"">).
All style instruction are place inside brakets ""{ ... }"". They all share a common syntax. and the left side of a colon is a keyword that specifies what property is to be changed, and on the right side is the new value that will be set. An instruction is terminated by a semicolon. There are many different keywords that can set all kinds of properties (colors, borders, dimensions, visibility, text-decoration, etc.).

The nice thing about MediaWiki is that nearly every element in the wiki framework (the big banner on the top of the page, the table of content, the title of the page, etc.) has a unique identifier or belongs to a certain class. An identifier is specified using the HTML tag id, whereas an element can be assigned to a class called ""title"" by using class=""title"".  Consequently, to change the look of a certain element, you have to first get to know the name of the class or the identifier and then use this name to change the appearance using CSS.
To find out the name of the identifier or the class, you can either take a direct look at the source of the page, or you can use a very powerful Firefox extension to easily extract this information. Take a look at the following ""read more"" section for details about this.

We are working towards to introducing an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake regulated by fatty acid concentrations. To test our promoters, fatty acid has to be added in the cell culture medium. It is however known that high fatty acid levels could lead to apoptosis by inducing stress responses. So in order to determine the range of fatty acid concentration suitable for testing, we conducted cell viability tests using MTT assay under different sodium palmitate concentrations. Our desired concentration range should keep at least 60% of cells alive after 24 hours incubation and/or at least 50% alive in 48 hours.
Fatty Acid Quantification
To differentiate between the fatty acid amount added to the medium versus the actual fatty acid amount inside the medium, we investigated two fatty acid quantification methods: 1) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS), and 2) fatty acid quantification kit (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). While we managed to measure the fatty acid quantity in cell culture medium using GC-MS, we were not able to use the fatty acid quantification kit due to time limitations.

In addition, non-specialists knowledge concur with a balancing factor of social, ethical and political values that cannot entirely be obtained by analytic techniques (Stern et al. 1996).
Mistrust of government decisions is often a basic source to conflicts within the United States (Bella, 1987; Englsh, 1992; Flynn and Slovic, 1993; Kasperson, Golding and Tuler, 1992; Laird, 1989; Pijawka and Mushkatel, 1992; Renn and Levine, 1991; Slovic, Flynn and Layma, 1991; U.S Department of Energy, 1992). Trust becomes fragile since there is a tendency of mass media to highlight bad news, physiological tendencies to notice, believe and underline trust-destroying more than trust-building information. Furthermore, there are specific groups that encourage mistrust in policy debates (Slovic, 1993a). Thus, the instrumental rationale gives weight to those conflicts may decrease and simultaneously acceptance of or trust in decisions by government may increase with participation of a diverse combination of groups and individuals within risk decisions (Stern et al. 1996). Stern et al. 1996 describes this “By providing people an opportunity to learn about the problem, the decision making process, and the expected benefits of a decision may improve the likelihood that they will support the decision” (Peelle, 1979; Peelle et al., 1983; Peelle and Ellis, 1987). Stern et al. 1996 also describes that information transfer to the public does not necessarily have to increase the support for the decision but it could prevent potential misunderstandings of it as well as promote trust for future similar issues.
Scientific statistics in the context of decision-making
The role of science in risk decision-makings is essential. To make proper judgements of understandings around risk decisions, scientific and technical experts contributes with imperative knowledge, methodological characteristics and experience. But partaking of other well needed disciplines are less often pointed out. Risk analyses are  as much in need of economic, social, human population migration and fairness units as in need of scientific ones. For example to enable health risks decision-makings concur of individuals and organizations that control or are affected by hazardous substances or processes are essential. Information from outer science units can contribute with knowledge of great importance to the risk decision process, which is"

This meant that for high copy                     numbers, tetR concentration scales fast, thus the repression on dcas is                     stronger.

Broaden perspective
In the current reprocessed paper manufacturing process, factories break all the paper into paper pulp, this cause enormous paper fiber lost. Our method increase the specificity of deinking process by a localizing deinking system (LDS). The LDS is made up of two input-output system, while one is biological and another is mechanical. The system combines the analytical power of modern technology and molecular biology. By using these cutting-edge technologies, we are able to solve environmental issues. In the future, the LDS system could change the environment of the paper making. The deinking enzymes that we had chosen from different organisms can be used in further application. An eco-friendly deinking process would we promote as a fashion, deinking device would be brought to not only factories but families. Education and commercial promotion must followed the development of technology.
Focus Problem
The current solution to the chemical pollution caused by deinking process is to replace chemicals like sodium hydroxide into biological enzymes. However this does not improve the recycle rate of the paper fiber. In order to improve the deinking process, we had built up a device to demonstrate how our method would work in large scale factories. The benefit of using the LDS would be saving paper fibers up to 80%, and also replaced the chemical reagents. Our design remains high costs and low efficiency, but the recycle rate of the paper fiber give the potential to this technique. We focus on the reprocessed paper fiber recycle rate of deinking process.
Design and Approach
Our deinking design goes through the following process, first, image taken from the camera of the target recycled paper, the image would go through analysis of identify the printed part of paper. The threshold of different kinds of paper could be monitored and changed for different condition. After the analysis, a signal will be sent to the LED board, the red light would shine only onto the area with ink. This Technology can be optimized and improve to a high resolution deinking system. The red light signal will then be accept by the engineered yeast, which had PhyB-PIF3 system. The light induced system will trigger the downstream protein expression, this leads to secretion of three deinking enzymes, xylanase, glucanase and lipase.This design allows yeast to secret enzymes to any target, in this case, deinking enzymes. Based on the previous research of bio-enzyme deinking by Prof. Su, Yu-Chang (2002), the project focus on three different kinds of deinking enzyme, such as glucanase, xylanase, and lipase."

By creating the logistics and protocol schedule, we’ve created a system that can be used by anyone to distribute protein samples of any kind; provided minor alterations to the protocol be made if a group were working with another type of RFP or GFP. The information we’ve gained from this collaboration effort has been priceless and we’d encourage any team to try to implement our setup into their own study.
As for the future of the collaboration effort, we would like to send out recombinant cells for teams to observe the archaeal cells with a fluorescence microscope. Also, we would once again like to try to create an official iGEM Archaeal InterLab study to run side-by-side with the E. coli InterLab study. We strongly believe our ‘pilot’ collaboration study to be a huge success and would like to take it to the next step.
Education
Increasing Awareness of Synthetic Biology within our University Community
The iGEM team placed flyers around the University of Georgia explaining what Synthetic Biology was and inviting members the University to come in our lab. Some flyers were also handed out to students and the field of Synthetic Biology was introduced to them.  The students aided in ranging from collecting cell pellets to taking fluorescent measurements.
Microbial Health Lesson at Oglethorpe Elementary
The first outreach project was conducted at a local elementary school and aimed to increase awareness of Science in general. Several members of the iGEM team collaborated with the organization FIMRC (Foundation for International Medical Relief for children). This organization teaches health lessons at a local elementary school and for one week, iGEM was allowed to teach the lesson. The iGEM team, taught students that bacteria play an important role in our everyday life. Specifically, we taught the second graders about how bacteria help with digestion and they can be used to clean the air. We concluded the lesson by showing the student how to properly wash their hands using a dye that turns bacteria florescent under the Ultra-Violet Light.

With 61 amino acid encoding base triplets that means 549 possible mutations, 21 (or 3.8%) of which create a stop codon. Now, let us look at the first ten amino acids of the killswitch’s core protein. Out of 61 possible codons, 18 can be turned into a stop codon by a single-base substitution, which is about a one in three chance. With ten codons, we now have a chance of less than 1% for not including a one-hit kill spot in the sequence. This spot will likely be mutated by the end of the day, resulting in a useless peptide and a very happy cell (because it gets to live).
Table 1: Codons that can be converted to a stop codon with a single-base substitution.
Of course, these issues can be alleviated by e.g. codon optimization. There are methods of controlling and restraining cell growth and the fact that most of us are not dying of cancer right now is solid evidence that this is true. However, to quote Dr. Ian Malcolm from “Jurassic Park”:
If there is one thing the history of evolution has taught us it's that life will not be contained.
The fact that some people are dying of cancer right now is solid, if sad, evidence that this is also true. This leaves us with exactly two options when considering the applications of genetically engineered organisms in the environment:
Live with the fact that we cannot control the cells, especially simple, fast-dividing organisms such as bacteria, or
Make sure they never leave the lab alive.
We chose the second option.
Kill it with fire
Of course, killing the bacteria was a challenge since the cells are an integral part of the structural stability of our solar cell. Fortunately, our chemists had a neat little trick called “sintering”, i.e. heating to several hundred degrees Celsius for a few minutes. The chemists do this to partially melt metal compounds and improve the cohesion of nanoparticles. Since we were quite sure that doing this would not endanger the functionality of our solar cell, sintering quickly became our favorite technique to sterilize our functionalized biofilms. We also found that it had the pleasant side effect of improving the efficiency of our solar cells. To determine whether this killed all bacteria on the glass surface, we performed a quick experiment with two microscope slides that we streaked some of the E. coli suspension"

I. Overview
After setting our goal to decompose synthetic dye with laccases, we sought to find out more information of biological sewage treatment and practical problems that required to be addressed. We also wanted to find out how our project could be applied to real world sewage treatment, and what change should we make to improve our project.
Therefore, we visited Hanghua sewage plant（World Trade Center, Beijing, China). Hanghua sewage plant was experienced in using biology method to decompose pollutant while they also had used other ways, including chemical and physical methods. Mr. Li, the manager of the sewage plant, told us lots of information we needed.
II. Silver
During the interview, we found out the situation of each current methods.
a. Chemical and Physical Methods
First of all, we learned that their previous chemical and physical techniques such as active carbon adsorption and oxidation method, and being expensive in cost for both methods, the sewage plant had to switched to biological treatment.
b. Biological Method
Hanghua sewage plant mainly used integrated sewage treatment device, in which a critical step was to add bacteria to decompose pollutant. Specially engineered bacteria were able to reproduce rapidly in sewage water, and this allowed the factory to process waste water with relatively lower financial requirement.
However, the bacteria used in sewage treatment may release toxic gases such as H2S. The plant had to turn on the ventilation system periodically, which consumed large amount of electric power and produced loud noise. As time went by, the advantage of lower cost is offsetted by electricity bills and the higher payment for their workers working under unfriendly environment.
In traditional biological treatment method, bacteria are usually injected into waste water directly, floating, growing, as well as continuously being removed by the outflow. The dynamic balance of bacteria concentration might be broken by increasing the total flow of sewage water. Under extreme circumstances, growth rate of bacteria might be overwhelmed by the loss rate through outflow. Moreover, workers in the sewage treatment plant told us, due to wear and tear since 2003 and other undiscovered problems, the total ability of sewage treatment had dropped 40%. To address this issue, we needed to develop a sustainable consumptive material.

SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". With the consideration of his suggestion, we kept our regulatory system containing a small number of sgRNAs.
What’s more, we also interviewed Dr. Yunzi Luo, first PI of SCU-WestChina in 2017 iGEM, as well as an expert in synthetic biology field. She advised us to try other kinds of promoters for sgRNA expression, and we took her suggestion willingly.
Application
Our team has always focused on transforming scientific theories into practical technologies and solving the existing issue seen in the society. Thus, we tried to use CRISProgrammer in biosynthesis of indigo, which can solve the pollution problem of chemical synthesis and provide a better way to store and transport the engineered bacteria.
We are concerned about indigo because of a visit of a Xiangxi batik workshop. After that trip we knew that indigo is an important ancient dye and it is also the material of batik--an ancient folk traditional textile printing and dying craft in China. However, there are many shortcomings of the modern process of producing indigo. So we decided to find a better way to produce indigo, which means biosynthesis combining CRISProgrammer.
In all of the above mentioned interview, study and communication, we obtained information and assistance that pushed us forward and enabled us to complete our project step by step. Finally, through our own hard work and the generous help of others, we finished a thorough, complete project with practical value.

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," been shown to carry an indioidine synthetase called indC (Brachmann 2012). We will use indC instead of bpsA for the following project parts.
Week 12
Indigoidine Production - indC
Since S. lavendulae DSM40708  does not carry the bpsA gene, we used indC from Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01 instead (Brachmann 2012).
The PPTase Sfp, originating from the B. subtilis strain 168, has been shown to exhibit a broad substrate specificity (Nakano 1988) and thus was used to activate indC on pRB3. pRB3 is similar to previous plasmids (indigoidine synthetase and PPTase on pSB1C3) but contains a KpnI cutting site as a spacer between the first ribosome binding site (RBS) and the indC coding sequence, a BamHI cutting site as a spacer between the second RBS and the sfp coding sequence as well as a NheI cutting site at the end of sfp. Therefore, this plasmid can be used with both Gibson or CPEC and a classical restriction cloning assembly strategies.
If pRB3 is functional, we will continue testing various combinations of PPTases and indigoidine synthetases.
pRB3 is a functional pSB1C3 construct with the genotype lacI-Promoter - RBS1 -KpnI-indC- RBS2 -BamHI-sfp-NheI-pSB1C3ΔmRFP1. The blue phenotype of pRB3-transformed E.coli TOP10 cells proofs production of the blue pigment indigoidine after 30 hours and incubation at 37 °C. Transformed cells expressing the indigoidine synthetase gene and producing indigoidine grow much slower than usual TOP10 cells. This effect was already reported by other groups (Owen 2011) and is supposed to be due to the slight toxicity of indigoidine.
Next week we will amplify other PPTases and assemble plasmids with combinations of indC, bpsA(pMM64), sfp, svp, svp(pMM65) and entD. The ladder is the endogenous PPTase of E. coli and considered to be inefficient in activating indigoidine synthetases (Takahashi 2007). We want to test and compare entD"

Methods
    The following methods cover 1) Construction and use of different xylose-inducible expression vectors, 2) Transformation of B. megaterium with these plasmids, 3) Induction of protein production, 4) Optimization of the Ribosome-Binding Site(RBS), 5) Verification of RdhANP-overexpression B. megaterium’s dehalogenation, 6) Integration of engineered version of hemA and xylA Promoter upstream of Operon hemAXCDBL, 7) Coexpression cellulose binding domain(CBD) and Membrane anchoring domain(MAD), 8) Introduction of engineered B. megaterium into Hybrid Membrane Bioreactor(HMBR), 9) Detection and adjustment with Model.
1.General construction of xylose-inducible expression vectors
    This year, we aim to construct several different xylose-inducible expression vectors compatible for B. megaterium, including RdhANP-pSPAsp-hp, RdhANP-pHIS1525, RdhANP-pHBintE, hemAKK-pHBintE and CBD-MAD-pSPAsp-hp. For further optimization of our project, more vectors are constructed but not listed here. Some things should be mentioned about plasmid pHIS1525, pSPAsp-hp and pHBintE are that, they are all shuttle vectors for E. coli&B. megaterium.  And pHBintE is capable of chromosome integration due to its temperature sensitivity.
2.Transformation of B. megaterium with these plasmids

IGEM PARISIAN MEET-UP
On July 7th, 2018, a Parisian meet-up was organized by the iGEM Pasteur team. It was a great opportunity to meet for the first time 8 other french iGEM teams. We were able to practice our project presentation for the Jamboree and to get more acquainted with other projects for an eventual future collaboration. In Paris, our team was represented by Thomas (team leader and engineer) and Elise (biologist).
IGEM MEDITERRANNEAN MEET-UP
On August 9th and 10th, our team had the chance to be invited to Marseilles for the Mediterranean meet-up organized by the Aix-Marseilles iGEM team. The team presented its project and poster in front of a jury. Our team was also able to talk with a guest speaker about bioethics. iGEM ambassadors were also present.
A lot of remarks that we got during this meet-up allowed us to progress with our project. To see how this meet-up allowed us to integrate the Human Practices in our project, click below.
Changes in our project induced by this event
Following the feedback we received, after the MeetUp we:
prioritized the biobrick of lysis over that of resistance
created a new poster for the giant jamboree by adding the human practices and the modeling
planned to check with doctors if waste management can be easily done in a hospital
created a bank of questions and answers to know how to defend the usefulness of the project
had positive feedback on the project, which led us to continue in the same direction
tried to think about a multiple uses of the system

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Meeting with an ethicist: Dr. Lily Frank
To examine the ethical implications of our iGEM project, we contacted Dr. Lily Frank.  She is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of Technology and is specialized in Biomedical Ethics. With Lily we discussed the potential benefits and dangers of synthetic biology, and she pointed us at some of the more controversial issues related to synthetic biology.

June 1, 2018. Meeting with an ethicist: dr. Lily Frank
Dr. Lily Frank gave us some valuable suggestions regarding controversial issue of synthetic biology. For instance, Lily strongly recommended us not to choose an application relevant to third world countries before the technology has been properly tested in our own country. That would conflict with the principles of justice and fairness, which prescribe a fair distribution of benefits and burdens globally and across society. This was interesting food for thought, as we had been considering creating a malaria sensor. Furthermore, we learned that the novelty of synthetic biology as a field complicates risk assessment, as many of the potential benefits and risks are still uncertain. Finally, Lily recommended us some frameworks. We used these for an ethical analysis which we performed over the summer .
Insights
We learned about the existence of some useful ethical frameworks.
A fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of synthetic biology both across society and globally is an important task of scientists working in the field of synthetic biology.
Follow-up
We decided against using our living material for malaria-sensing or vaccines-delivery in third world countries.
We explored the ethical frameworks recommended by Lily and used them for an ethical discussion  of our work.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are ("
Nanjing-China,2013,Team:Nanjing-China#model_-_-_TEXT.html," us to find that the number of the cells in different circuits changed in different ways. Here, it is clear that, the bacteria with circuit 3 aggregate in specified gradually, which shows a nearly straight-line slope in the fig. 4-9 as the behavior of circuit 2. At last, fig. 4-8, which present circuit 2, exhibits little change about the number of cells in specified region at the beginning. Shortly，the census has further proved the result obtained from figure 4-4~6.
We have mentioned that we have introduced the QS systems into our design as circuit 2 and circuit 3. However, we can't find out its advantages in figure 4-4~9 and our result is got from limited times of simulations. In order to solve these questions, we have got the figure 4-10~12, which can illustrate this question clearly.
Fig. 4-10 The aggregation/ the number of moving bacteria ratio of circuit 1.
Fig. 4-11 The aggregation/ the number of moving bacteria ratio of circuit 2.
Fig. 4-12 The aggregation/ the number of moving bacteria ratio of circuit 3.
The figure 4-10~12 have showed the effective aggregation, which is described by the number of cells in regions to the number of moving cells ratio. In this way, we have considered the number of moving bacteria rather than all the bacteria. Because only the moving bacteria are trying to move toward atrazine region.
As we can see from figure 4-10~12, the value of effective aggregation of circuit 1 is always below 1, which means even though their can aggregate so fast at the beginning, their movement is aimless. The circuit 2 respond too slowly and the value of their effective aggregation is low as well. So it has neither fast aggregation nor effective aggregation. Circuit 3 have a peak in the figure, which reached 3 at the beginning. It proved that their movement is goal-directed and our design is more intelligent than circuit 1.
Besides, we have introduced the Markov chain into our model in order to takerandomness of movement of bacteria into consideration. As you can see in the figure 4-10~12, they have 3 curves related to the 3 omega values (=1, 3, 5) and these curve are similar, which suggested that the result of our simulation has little variance. It means that our data in figure 4-4~9 are credible and our designed system is robust and their behaviors are stable.

Transformation of E.coli Xl1-blue with Vector pGADT7-AD
Investigator:Georg
CaCl2 competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells were put out from the stock in -80 °C freezer and were gently thawed on ice.
1 µl of pGADT7-AD (P98) was added to 100 µl of competent cells and mixed gently.
30 min incubation on ice
5 min. heat shock at 37°C
Adding of 1ml LB-medium to each tube.
Incubation for 45min at 37°C in the 180rpm cell-culture shaker.
100µl of those cell suspension were plated on ampicillin plates.
The rest were centrifuged for 1min at 13000rpm and the supernatant was dicarded.
The pellet was resuspended in 100µl of LB-medium and this concentrated cell suspension was plated"

The rest of the team members tested the protocol and further suggestions for improvement were made. Despite the suggestion, all teams were successful in creating L-forms. (microscope picture)
Sucrose and Glucose test
Aim:
To check whether the colonies on the Cm plate with B.subtilis 168 containing Groningen 2012 integration plasmid actually contained transformed cells rather than a random mutants/contaminant.
Methods:
The agar was melted on heat plates for half an hour, left to cool, plated and left to set in the fume cupboard. Then the colonies from the transformation plates were plated out onto the agar. Both B.subtilis with the Groningen plasmid at concentrations of 30, 45 and 60 µl and B.subtilis alone (negative control) were put onto both sucrose and glucose plates.
Results:
Please refer to July 23th .
Improving the poster design
Progress on the poster design was made by thinking of different alterations to the layout to make the poster more readable. The favorite was selected as a starting point for the final design.

Sucrose and Glucose plates
Aim and Methods:
Please refer to July 23th .
Results:
Both the Sucrose and Glucose plates overgrew which means that the Groningen plasmid is not integrated. our next step is to consider whether to sequence the plasmid using the BioBrick primers.
Poster Design
Today, the layout was developed further and shown to the group. The next steps would be to introduce the text, logos and illustrations.
BioGame
A loading bar has now been added for the BioGame, providing the user graphical representation of how long they will be waiting for the game to load. This then opens into the main game screen where your Bacterium can be seen. The next stage is to add the User Interface allowing the user to ""take care"" of their Bacterium and install BioBricks.

Team
The team consists of students from different grades of bachelor’s degree, armed with varied but complementary expertise. It was founded in winter of year 2015, 3 months after which the general topic of this project (a new treatment for cancer) was determined through the process of brainstorming, article reading and debating. Then questionnaires had been sent out to get public expectation for cancer treatment. Under the guidance of Prof. Xi Chen and Prof. Chenyu Zhang, and based on survey results and deeper understanding of related research articles, the ultimate idea was established on March of 2016.
person_pinChenhui Deng
Chenhui Deng is one of the two who in charge of all the qPCR experiments in both in vivo and in vitro validation of iRGD-siRNA-exosome function. It was him who pointed out that we should referred to the view from public (both general one and patients) to value if our idea did have its practical significance. He will represent the whole team to present our project at the final Jamboree.
person_pinJingyi Chen
Jingyi Chen learned cell proliferation assay and endotoxin detecting assay from our advisors, two graduate students in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ascertain iRGD-siRNA-exosome can suppress cancer cells’ proliferation and to prove our drug system is nontoxic for normal cells, respectively. In human practice, she accompany with Jiaxin Cai to deeply interview the doctor from a local hospital. Also, she will present our project at the final Jamboree together with Chenhui Deng.
person_pinXiaoyang Gu
Xiaoyang Gu is the master of western blot, conducting all the experiments that proved significant decrease of our target gene (KRAS) in the protein level after treated with iRGD-siRNA-exosomes. During this process, she learned transmission electron microscope assay (TEM) from a graduate student in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ensure we get exosomes after collection assay according to the morphology of the harvest, and also determine exosomes’ density.
