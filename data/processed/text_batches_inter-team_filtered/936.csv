Human Practices Collaborations
An important collaborative effort has been made in the frame of our Human Practices activities. We skyped the ULaval iGEM team during the summer to talk about our projects. It quickly appeared that we pursued common human practices goals and that collaborating seemed a great idea. Both teams have advisors who were specialists in ethics and we decided to compare the point of views of Europeans and North Americans visions about ethics. To complete our study, we asked the National University of Singapore (NUS) iGEM team to join us, so we could also have an Asian point of view. From there, we produced together a joint 20 pages document, ""HP Worldwide"", describing how synthetic biology and biotechnologies are perceived on our three continents (see Human Practices ).
Bordeaux iGEM Team
We met the Bordeaux iGEM team at both the French and European meetups. They were trying to find a way to substitute an alternative segment of the traditional petrobased chemistry with a new green bio-based chemistry. Cellulose was a possible substrate for them and they were especially interested about pure bacterial cellulose. We therefore engaged in producing sufficient bacterial cellulose for them. Our initial production rate was not designed for that so we had to improve our production capacity to match their requirement. We were very pleased when we visited them in Bordeaux from the 24th to the 26th of August to give them 5g of beautiful bacterial cellulose so they could test their project using our material. Best of luck guys !
Montpellier iGEM Team
iGEM Montpellier 's project is called Vagineering, and it looks to solve hormonal contraceptive issues with a novel, non-hormonal method. The goal is to create a lasting contraceptive using only bacteria, which can later be reversed by engineering the strain with a kill-switch. Montpellier is participating for the first time in the iGEM competition! We wanted to help them since our two cities are neighbours. We visited Montpellier at the beginning of our adventure. It was a great opportunity for our two teams to build relationships and think together about a collaborative project. After several exchanges we decided"

Pretty fly for a nerd girl
An iGEM inspired cover ‚ÄúPretty fly for a nerd girl‚Äù was written and performed by the LiU iGEM team.                     The cover was produced and mixed by Johan Blomqvist at AfterNine studios, for whom we are grateful.                     The song was originally performed by the famous band The Offspring as ‚ÄúPretty fly for a white guy‚Äù.                     Work was also initiated to produce a music video for the song.
The aim of the video is to demonstrate the great community of iGEM where sharing of knowledge and                     information is central. Therefore, it was important for us to make the production of this video a                     collaboration, which we managed with a couple of iGEM-teams. The teams were; Macquaire Australia and                     Groningen, the Netherlands, who have recorded some of the clips to be used in the video.
However, we never got time to complete the work, but we aim to do so after the jamboree. Thereafter,                     our aim will be to use it as a promotion for iGEM, to recruit new members to the teams as well as to                     increase the interest of iGEM and the competition.

Q4: What‚Äôs the advantage of your method comparing with others?
A: Referring to the existing methods, whether to strengthen the regulation or to save the bacteria in safes, the bacteria are all protected from outside, which will waste lots of money and energy. And once the bacteria are lost, they can hardly be got back again, even though they are marked. But our method works inside of the bacteria that can prevent the multiplication of them when they are outside. As a result, the nature of the protection of bacteria can be changed from passiveness by people to activeness by the bacteria themselves, which can not only protect the bacteria effectively but save the unnecessary money in regulation.
Q5: As we all known, Different proteins are degraded in different lengths of time. How can you ensure the time between two added substance can open the gate but not lock it down? Just like, when we add 2, the protein 1 has already been degraded.
A:  We can add a tail which can control how long the protein can exist. By this way, we can ensure our project‚Äôs function.
Q6: Would the lock losing its function via the gene of the Min system mutated?
A: If the gene of the Min system mutate, other useful genes would change. So I think it makes no sense.
Q7: Did all of you participate in the experiment and master the experimental skills ?
A: Of course! We are a team with the strongest spirit of unity and cooperation. All of us work together to face any possible difficulties both in experiment and life. Thus everyone have a good command of our works.
Q8: The molecules like arac, IPTG and aTC would degrade, resulting in the disappearing of the inducible proteins. Consequently, the E. co lock may close again. How to deal with it?
A: We designed memorial circuits to express the needed inducible proteins continuously, avoiding the open lock turn to close again.
Q9: How we know the proper concentration of arac, IPTG ,aTC and AHL, and the corresponding cellular state?
A: We optimize the concentration repeatedly and use modeling to simulate the cellular state.
Q10: Do you have any problem in ligasing genesÔºüWhat‚Äôs kind of means you apply to ligase genes?
We do have difficulties in assembling biobricks.We have tried many ways to solve this problem including 3A"

Undoing the melanin modification is easy. Like a snake shedding her skin. Pink and soft skin like a new born. Easy to bruise.
No one knew if it was a Bleaker or an Inker who threw the first punch. Cooler heads from both groups tried to separate them. But accusations started flying in from both groups. It must have looked surreal when down above, little black and white dots coalesce with their own colors seemingly trying to form a divided circle.
This is what I could make out before I blanked out: an Inker grabbed me out of tangle of bodies. He recognized me from the press prints. I was one of the first in line, a speaker for my people (my people?). He asked me

Story #2
Prediction 2025: In vitro Immune system used to generate treatments for all conceivable human disease.
Prediction 2150: Natural human immune system is bred out of general population due to general efficiency of artificial immunity. When new viral strains that cannot be targeted by synthetic immunity emerge, several nations decide to harvest immunity from niche communities who still have natural immunity.
IVIS, the medical breakthrough of the 21st century. Hailed as one of mankind's greatest triumph. It was supposed to provide complete protection from any disease, virus, bacteria, even cancer and neurodegenerative disease. It would bring us a new era of prosperity. It became a common practice to receive the IVIS vaccination at birth. A completely synthetic immune system far superior than the one found naturally in our own bodies. Soon everyone, even babies in third world countries would receive this vaccine. And why not? It was cheap, comparable to a bottle of aspirin. The human immune system, evolved over millions of years, rendered useless in a matter of decades. Evolution stepped in accordingly. Why"

Preparation
Grow a 5ml overnight culture of cells in LB media.  In the morning, dilute this culture back into 40ml of fresh LB media with 0.8 ml of Mg-mix (0.5M Magnesium chloride + 0.5M Magnesium sulfate) in a 100ml conical flask.  You should aim to dilute the overnight culture by at least 1/100.
Grow the diluted culture to an OD600 of 0.5 - 0.8.
Put eppendorf tubes on ice now so that they are cold when cells are aliquoted into them later.  If your culture is X ml, you will need X tubes.  At this point you should also make sure that your TMF is being chilled (it should be stored at 4¬∞C but if you have just made it fresh then put it in an ice bath).
Split the culture into two 50ml falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 min.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4¬∞C and the cells should be kept on ice wherever possible
Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4000 rpm and 4¬∞C.
Remove supernatant.  The cell pellets should be sufficiently solid that you can just pour off the supernatant if you are careful.  Pipette out any remaining media.
Resuspend in 4ml chilled TMF buffer and add 1 ml of 40% glycerol. You may need to vortex gently to fully resuspend the culture, keep an eye out for small cell aggregates even after the pellet is completely off the wall.
Add 100 Œºl aliquots to your chilled eppendorfs.
Flash freeze the eppendorfs containing the cells with liquid nitrogen.
Store the cells at -80¬∞C.
It is a good idea to run a positive control on the cells.

It can give early information for researcher, doctor and other practical that can be used as reference to continue the research as well as to give scientific. CHS (Cancer Herbal Screening) part is design plasmid which contain  promoter P97 (HPV 16) or P105 (HPV 18). This part has ability in screening chemical compounds of plant for cervical cancer therapy. The herbs have to inhibit transcription factor of P97 and P10.
Promoter was combained with fluorescence reporter GFP obtained from biobrick Bba_E0240 (Plate 4, well 11N) to detect the successfull of the herbal compounds.  P97 (HPV 16) and P105 (HPV 18) were digested with EcoR1-Xbal, GFP digested with Xbal-Pstl, and plasmid backbone pSB1C3 digested with EcoR1-Pstl. Then, the HPV promoter and GFP was ligated into palsmid backbone pSB1C3. Plasmid design was transfected into HeLa cells containing some transcripton factor to induced promoter. Based on Chong et al (1991), trancript factor such as NF1, AP-1, and oct-1 were present in higher concentration in HeLa cells. Therefor, HeLa cells can be used as transfection for promoter P97 and promoter P105 so it could be activated. This part was purposed to help researcher work easier to explore herbal plants for cervical cancer therapy.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," not so that man was not manipulating the world around him before but now it comes to a new dimension. The manipulator becomes the creator and diverges even more from his natural roots. One risk is that nature becomes artificial, using the term biofact already points in this direction. A global system in which man is just a small part is too complex to be understood in details. The state of not knowing does not prevent man from intervene in natural processes and so he is often confronted with unwanted results. Is nature really a playground for human creativity? Why can mankind demanding adaptations of nature to man? Where is an acceptable limit? Possible consequences of using synthetic biology can lead to an even additional alienation of nature and mankind with effects on human self-image. If nature is becoming plannable and predictable then also humans will become so. Cultural values like optimization and profitability will no longer used only for economic systems, it will now also be used for ecologic and biologic systems. Society only benefits when a moderate use of synthetic biology based on a respectful handling of nature is accomplished. The chance is there to create a new society where the term sustainability is rated with a higher value. A new powerful tool is available when synthetic bacteria can transform PET to Catechol. This tool can be used as alternative to the now used combustion strategy. PET what was no longer useable in the past is now becoming a popular feedstock with a higher price.   If the price of PET increases mankind will hopefully start to use alternative materials for packing. New materials should be bio-degradable. It is a pity that price and convenience are such important factors in the acting of humans. Today still more plastic bags are used than for example linen of paper bags.  It is a task for politics to set possible incentives for a change in the right direction via a clever price strategy or directed prohibitions. Additionally funding should be given into investigative fields of research for finding appropriate materials. This would be a good strategy in the long way. Using these new nature conservating materials must not be a privilege for rich people. This should be fundamental right for each human being.
c) Environmental orientation
Aspects of environmental orientation have already been suggested earlier. Now these aspects should be intensified. A reduction of PET would not only lead to a higher quality in human health it would also increase environmental quality. Since a large amount of PET find its way to the oceans so that in some marine areas the concentration of PET exceeds the concentration of plankton, a reduction of PET would be in any case desirable. Degradation time for plastic is estimated with 450 years but there is no concrete"

An HDMR expansion to second order
<math>f(x)=f_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(x_{i}, x_{j})</math>
often provides a satisfactory description of <math>f(x)</math> for many high dimensional systems when the input variables are properly chosen. This is also the formula we use to achieve HDMR expansion. How to determine HDMR component functions? Practical formulations of the HDMR component functions determine whether we can carry out this algorithm. Theoretically, a component function
<math>f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il})</math>
is obtained by minimizing the functional,
<math>\min_{f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il}}\int_{\Omega}\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},u) [f(u)-f_{0}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(u_{i})-\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(u_{i}, u_{j})-...- \sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il})]^{2}du</math>

P. putida clones bearing minTn7BB-Gm insertions were selected on LB plates supplemented with Gm (and chloramphenicol when mating was used). Viable counts were also performed in both experiments, and plasmid transformation frequency was determined using the ampicillin/carbenicillin resistant replicative plasmid pBBR1mcs-5 in the electroporation experiment. The results are shown in Table 1.

The results clearly show that the gentamycin-resistance marker was acquired by P. putida KT2440 by both electrotransformation and conjugation, suggesting that the transposon was transferred to this non-enterobacterial recipient. In the electroporation experiment, the efficiency was low, with only 70 potential insertions per Œºg plasmid DNA, despite the fact that the strain had become very competent as shown by the high transformation efficiency achieved with a replicative plasmid. On the other hand, transposition frequency in the mating experiment was quite high, suggesting that conjugation may be a more efficient means to transfer the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon to P. putida. Similar results were obtained with the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon borne in the commercial plasmid pMA (Mr. Gene). Interestingly, conjugative transfer of pUC18 or pMA has not been described, and a transfer origin is not documented for any of these vectors. Similar frequencies and efficiencies have been obtained with other miniTn7 delivery plasmids, such as those of the pBK-miniTn7 series (Koch et"

High Fidelity PCR
The dxCas9 coding sequence contains forbidden restriction sites to be RFC compatible. Therefore, Gblocks were ordered at IDT. The dxCas9 is to large to order as one Gblock. Therefore I ordered two Gblocks, also incorporating Linker-Tn5 coding sequences (Gblock 1 and 2). To be able to construct also a different variant of the fusion protein, two Gblocks were ordered in the order Tn5-Linker-dxCas9 (Gblock 3 and 4).
To amplify the Gblocks 1 and 2 as well as the pACYCDuet-1 backbone, high fidelity PCR was done. The template DNA are the Gblocks 1 (primerset 045 & 046) and 2 (primerset 047 & 048) and pACYCDuet-1 (primerset 049 & 050). Six 50¬µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol .

The gvpC gene was then inserted downstream of gvpA using the same process. pSB1C3 containing the gvpC biobrick was disgested with XbaI and PstI and the J23100/gvpA plasmid was digested with SpeI and PstI ‚Äì this caused the formation of a scar sequence between GvpA and GvpC upon ligation of the correct fragments. Again, the constructs were transformed into TOP10 and DH5Œ±. The DNA was isolated by miniprep to be digested and run on the gel to check the presence of the inserts. The DNA was also sent for sequencing.
A similar process was carried out to place gvpC downstream of gvpA, each with their own RBS in pSB1C3. The resulting plasmid was given the biobrick number BBa_K1463340, and the construct with the J23100 promoter is BBa_K146345. The results of the sequencing showed that the construct had mutated in the RBS and would therefore be unable to function.
In order to resolve the mutant construct, new PCR primers were designed to isolate the mutated construct from the plasmid by PCR ‚Äì as well as correct the mutation ‚Äì and reinsert it into a new plasmid.
The construct was reinserted into the plasmid containing the J23100 promoter. The corrected construct was also inserted into BBa_J61002-based plasmids containing promoters of varying strengths (J23103, J23106, J23112 and J23116). Again the constructs were confirmed by transforming into TOP10 and DH5Œ±, the transformants were minipreped and restricted to run on a gel. Liquid cultures of the different transformants were left for 3 days in 30C and 37C to give the cultures time to grow and settle ‚Äì this would allow any floating to be observed. Unfortunately, there appeared to be no difference between the different transformants and floating was not observed.
The construct was also placed in a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid under the control of the arabinose inducible pBAD promoter (pBAD33; Guzman et al 1995). The resultant DNA from the transformants was sent for sequencing to confirm the presence of an unmutated construct. The confirmed transformants were then observed for their ability"

Biochemical and binding properties of zinc fingers
Zinc finger motifs are formed from a short stretch of amino acid residues folded around a zinc cation and have the shape of a finger. Each individual finger is highly conserved in its structure and consists of around 30 amino acid residues. There are two hisitdine residues in every finger on the Œ±-helix and two cysteine residues on the Œ≤-sheet that interact with the zinc atom. A short stretch of amino acid residues in the Œ±-helix is responsible for 3 - 4 bp binding specificity. Each finger recognizes and binds to 3 base-pair subsites (see scheme, upper panel), however using modular approach we can stitch several zinc finger mini domains together (scheme, bottom panel) and achieve chemical distinctiveness through variations in certain key amino acid residues. With every new attached zinc finger domain 3-4 base pairs are added to the recognized sequence, thus minimizing non-specific binding on nucleic acids present in host organisms and increasing the specificity of the zinc finger. They also have an advantage over most other DNA binding motifs from natural transcription factors, since the targeted DNA sequence does not have to be symmetric.
Figure 2: Binding and binding specificity of a zinc finger with one (upper panel) and three (lower panel) fingers
Application of zinc finger proteins
In 1994 it was demonstrated for the first time that zinc finger proteins could modulate endogenous gene expression in living cells. Ever since, many studies have been made where promising results were shown using zinc fingers as endogenous gene regulators. They can bind with nanomolar dissociation constants and discriminate effectively between specific and non-specific DNA sites and thus function as transcriptional activators or repressors in living cells. Different groups showed the importance of zinc fingers in regulating gene expression like Erb-2 gene involved in the development of human malignancies, MDR1 gene which is important in controlling multidrug resistance in cancer cells, activation of the human erythropoietin gene and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and many other genes. It was also shown that zinc fingers could have an important role in antiviral therapies, for example against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), herpes simplex virus 1(HSV-1) and human papillomavirus (HPV) (Sera, 2009).
The role of zinc finger domains in our project
In this project, we used zinc finger proteins as adaptor molecules that recognize and bind specific DNA sequences instead of their original function as"

4-H Experience in the Lab
A group of high school aged students in the 4-H Youth Development group came to visit the iGEM laboratory this summer.  Sam, Megan, and Jovanna gave them a presentation on iGEM, this year's project, and how science is found all around us!   They experienced what it was like to culture bacteria on LB plates and got a taste of working in the lab.
Field Day
Bringing Science to the Kids!
In an effort to raise the community‚Äôs awareness of iGEM, team members participated in the University of Nevada, Reno‚Äôs annual Field Day.  This event was open to the general public, and roughly 400 people were in attendance.  The objective of this event was to educate the community about what the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources has accomplished.  It is also an opportunity for the public to ask the college questions and keep up with news and current events.  Team Nevada 2011 set up a booth at which people (mainly kids), could build cells out of Jell-O and candy.  Different types of candy were set out to represent different organelles in the cell, and the Jell-O represented the cytoplasm, in which all of the organelles were placed.  As the cells were being ‚Äúconstructed‚Äù, the functions of the organelles were explained.  While the kids were enjoying their treat, iGEM members were able to explain iGEM to the parents, as well as other inquisitive passersby.

Gurpal Bisra I am an engineering physics student, in my final year of undergrad, interested in pursuing bioengineering or biomedical engineering. I joined the iGEM team to further develop my biological skills and apply my engineering skills to a real life biological problem. I have traveled to 14 countries so far and my thirst for adventure never ceases! For our wet lab component, I developed a yeast cell to contain the mutant erg20-2 gene and made ERG20 and erg20-2 bio-bricks. I also helped develop plasmids that contain the K6R-HMG2 and IDI1 genes. My contribution to modeling was to simulate the biochemical pathways for our genetically engineered yeasts. I programmed simulations using MATLAB. Furthermore, I am helping to develop another model which shows the spread of the pine beetle using ARCGIS.
Daisy Ji I am a Pharmacy student interested in translational research. One of the interesting aspects of iGEM is the multidisciplinary approach it takes towards a whole variety of problems. My project consists of expressing 3-carene synthase in yeast and also submitting the 3-carene synthase as a biobrick part. Also, I will be truncating the 3-carene synthase to increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. I am also working to characterize the composite limonene synthase part from the Parts Registry by expressing it in C41 DE3 cells and assaying its limonene production in vitro. I enjoy reading books and playing chess. I also enjoy working out at Birdcoop and ballin'.

Communication between modelers and biologists has also been recognised to be a significant problem in professional research organizations. Lack of knowledge means a lack of understanding, and not understanding what the other person is talking about obviously makes cooperation difficult. Without training or hands-on experience, modelers have problems understanding the constraints of experimental work and experimentalists difficulties in understanding why modelers need what they do, as MacLeod and Nersessian point out . Lack of a common vocabulary and using different terminology to refer to the same concept creates confusion, contributing to the difficulties of cooperation. Differences in the way of thinking between students with a mathematical background and a biological background is considered by some to be the biggest obstacle in interdisciplinary cooperation. This problem has also been recognised in professional research environments, and is often referred to using the metaphor of language: the other field seems to ‚Äúspeak a different language‚Äù, implying a different way of thinking. The same expression of speaking a different language can also be taken more literally, referring to technical words (e.g. ‚Äúpolymerase‚Äù or ‚Äústochastic model‚Äù) and thus to the two other problems in communication, lack of knowledge and common terminology.
Engaging the whole team in modeling was seen as difficult, perhaps due to the knowledge gap between modelers and biologists. However, it was considered important to have experimentalists take part in the model development to make sure that the modeling is connected to reality - if the model is disconnected from reality, it is of little use in the project.
Solutions for cooperation challenges
Synthetic Biology for Modelers and Modeling for Biologists, by iGEM Grenoble 2011 .
All common issues of cooperation iGEM teams faced seem to be solvable by taking the time to learn at least the very basics of the other field and with thorough communication. Only the essentials of the other field need to be learned to be successful, as pointed out by Nersessian et al . Grenoble 2011 iGEM team has made flyers specifically for this purpose, for both biologists and modelers to learn the basics of the other field. Besides studying textbooks of biology, modelers can for instance take some time to get familiar with the labwork in the beginning of the project. Likewise, it can be beneficial for biologists to get some hands-on experience in modeling. This approach has successfully been used also in professional research environments, as Macleod and Nersessian explain .

Once upon a time in 2016,     many decided to answer the call of what seemed to be the proposal of a great     scientific and human venture. After a strict selection remained only nine immaculate souls; so the mystical core of the  iGEM EPFL 2017 team was formed. As soon as the members     had obtained confirmation of their acceptation, brainstorming sessions were organised     (as early as of February 2017) for several months in order to find a collectively     acclaimed project. These meetings, coupled to extensive research on many cell-free papers,     led us to focus on the usage of toehold switches and aptamers in cell lysates.     From then on, the team quickly agreed to work on a biosensing device; thus our project
Aptasense
arose     from the ashes. The iGEM EPFL 2017 team members interacted     during the whole competition with many people affiliated to different scientific     fields that contributed to shape the project into its final form.
Team members
Lab work
The whole team took part in either wet     or dry lab sessions from February until     the end of the competition. In order to optimize our work,     several teams were formed:
The design of the parts was realised by Lena, Lisa and Malek.
The publication of the parts in the correct plasmid backbone were realised by Lena and Elia.
The work with aptamers was ensured by Jonathan, Tim, Matteo and Felix: Tim principally focused     on running bead assays, whilst Jonathan and Matteo fabricated the     very MITOMI chips they would later on use to perform their experiments with microfluidics,"

Designing Life with Synthetic Biology
The Powerhouse is the largest branch of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney, Australia. The Macquarie University iGEM team have an ongoing relationship with the Powerhouse Museum who have devoted a section of their rotating science collection to synthetic biology, iGEM and other related materials. These contributions have exposed large numbers of people who visit the museum annually (approximately 64,000) to synthetic biology and the important contributions that the iGEM teams have made to this novel field.
In early September the Macquarie iGEM team were lucky enough to have their associated professors Dr Natalie Curach and Professor Ian Paulsen discuss their Hydrogen synthesis project at the ‚ÄòDesigning Life with Synthetic Biology‚Äô event hosted by the Powerhouse Museum. Their project was used as an example of how design principles in combination with molecular biology techniques can be utilized to address real world problems, such as clean and renewable energy production. Dr Curach also taught the audience a bit about the iGEM competition and the contributions that iGEM researchers have made over the past thirteen years.
Synthetic biology is a novel discipline. It has also been the subject of significant misinformation and distortion within the media, and for these reasons, a significant proportion of the public hold either a severely limited or unduly negative understanding of the field.
We of the Macquarie iGEM team would like to fix this. So do Professor Paulsen and Dr Curach, and for this reason, much of their talk was aimed at improving public comprehension, encouraging enquiry, and helping foster to a more positive general perception of the discipline. iGEM maintains a rich tradition of facilitating safe and ethical research in the synthetic biology field.

Market Analysis
This year, the final goal of iGEM_Bit team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB‚Äîessentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections‚Äîto ordinary communities. Our plan is to commercialize JACOB to provide warnings for potential disease and develop a self-sustaining facility for production and further research. From market analysis, we concluded the prominent advantages of JACOB and focused on those to provide more competitive products; from direct interaction with commercial industries, we optimized JACOB's operability and compatibility with the market.

Circuit Testing
We have determined that it is necessary to characterize our parts in order to guide the construction of our device.  Precisely because our system is so complex, we need to ensure that we understand  the correct parts in our smaller circuits before moving on to the system as a whole.  In such a case, we have outlined a few critical tests to demonstrate the proper functioning of our parts.
We ran a test of our LexA activator and inducible reporter on the confocal fluorescence microscope, and saw mCherry in the nucleus and YFP in the cytoplasm as expected:
The mCherry is tagged onto the LexA activating transcription factor, and so is localized to the nucleus due to the SV40 NLS ligated just before the terminator.  The YFP is generated by mCYC+LexA binding sites on a construct containing Kozak+YFP+ADH1 terminator.
This strain contains the following parts: BBa_K165068  pGAL1+ LexA activator BBa_K165078  LexA activator reporter (LexA binding sites+ mCYC1+Kozak+YFPx2+ADH1 Terminator)
It was grown in media containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose.  Raffinose is used as a neutral sugar that provides a carbon source while neither inducing nor repressing the pGAL1 promoter.
Inputs
Our proof-of-principle design incorporates the use of inducible promoters that respond to varied levels of chemical input.
pMET25 is a repressable promoter that responds to levels of methionine from 0-500 uM. pGAL1 is an inducible promoter that responds to the concentration of galactose between 0 and 3%
pGAL1 normally has an all-or-nothing response, and is thus not tunable. Christina Smolke of Caltech published a paper investigating the dynamics of the Gal"

FucO (BBa_K2571000)
FucO is a protein-coding region that codes for L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase which is an NADH-linked, homodimer enzyme                  having the role of acting on furfural. Furfural is a highly toxic substance which is a toxic inhibitor of microbial                  fermentations causing cell wall and membrane damage, DNA breakdowns, DNA cleavages and reduced enzymatic activities                  (Zheng, 2013; Liu, Ma & Song, 2009).
In the presence of furfural, NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases go active in order to reduce furfural to its less toxic alcohol                  derivative - furfuryl alcohol (Zheng, 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2010). In this pathway, the expression of oxidoreductases                  that are NADPH-dependent, such as YqhD, are shown to inhibit the growth and fermentation in E. coli by competing with biosynthesis for                  NADPH (Zheng, 2013).
Because the native conversion of NADH to NADPH in E. coli is insufficient to revitalize the NADPH pool during fermentation, the actions                  shouldn‚Äôt be interfering with NADPH metabolism (Wang et al. 2011)."

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," degradation of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin (MC), is also engineered in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We want to produce an MC-degrading enzyme called microcystinase (MlrA) which is found naturally in some bacterial species. Our goal is to produce an enzyme capsule which can be added into MC-containing water where it degrades the toxins and makes the water safe to use.
There is a gene cluster which has been identified to code for enzymes which degrade microcystins. The genes mlrA, mlrB, mlrC and mlrD code for enzymes MlrA, MlrB, MlrC and MlrD respectively. They all have a role in the degradation process with different functions. MlrA, also known as microcystinase, acts first by hydrolysing the bond between microcystin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s amino acids Adda and arginine. This linearizes the toxin, after which MlrB (a serine protease), and MlrC (a metalloprotease) are able to degrade it further to individual amino acids, which are then used in the cell√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s metabolism. MlrD√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s function is not fully understood at this point, but it may have a role in importing the toxins. (1)
Our focus will be on the degradation of MC-LR because it is the most common cyanotoxin and also because the degradation has been characterized for this toxin. The linearization, performed by MlrA, renders the toxin 160 less toxic (2). This should be enough to make for example a bucket of water safe to use as sauna water (check some calculation about this in results somewhere).
Since the cyanobacteria release the toxins only as they lyse, we have to take also that into consideration. Based on earlier work by Peking 2014 iGEM team, hen egg lysozyme is good to lyse the tough cell walls of cyanobacteria WE CAN√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢T USE LYSOZYME. Our final product will contain lysozyme and microcystinase. The lysozyme would first lyse the cyanobacteria and release all the possible MC, and the microcystinase which would then linearize the toxins.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," Biotech stuff). It was determined the problems faced by biosensor developers are in 5 main areas, detailed below. We spent the summer addressing these issues, and our solutions can be found on the following links: 1) Part Reusability - The sometimes tedious techniques used to construct genetic circuits mean that interesting, reusable parts are often so tightly coupled inside the system they were developed in that they never get reused 2) Output Comparability - The lack of any standards in biosensor development means that day-to- day background differences can have a huge effect on reporter values ‚Äì without any change in input concentrations 3) Binding Sequences - The bulk of the time spent in the design phase of biosensor development is in the search for a system which can interact with your target molecule. The more we can take the emphasis off the biology, the less we are limited by what nature has already created and the more we can move synthetic biology into a true engineering discipline 4) Uptake of Technology - You‚Äôve got your biosensor - great! But how are you going to make sure it gets used by the people it‚Äôs designed for? 5) Legislation  - One of the main advantages of synbio biosensors over traditional methods is their reduced reliance on additional equipment, meaning they are perfect for onsite diagnostics and use in resource poor settings. However, no biosensor has ever successfully made it through european legislation for use outside of a laboratory

In this project, it is proposed that modularity, and therefore the ability to use parts ‚Äúoff-the-shelf‚Äù without further genetic engineering, could be improved by splitting components of biosensors into different cells which communicate to coordinate responses. The orthogonal quorum sensing systems Rhl and Las will be used as biological ‚Äúwires‚Äù, linking different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together. The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. (2011) have previously suggested that the use of synthetic quorum sensing circuits enables each cell to be considered an independent logic gate, which may rectify the ‚Äúfuzzy logic‚Äù seen in some biosensors, where stochastic cellular processes may produce false positive results. Quorum sensing has also been previously used to synchronise gene expressions, leading to reduced variability within a population (Danino et al., 2010).

The majority of the wet lab work is performed at the Readiness Acceleration and Innovation Network (RAIN) Incubator, a startup non-profit in Tacoma, Washington with ties to University of Washington Tacoma (UWT) and Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC). Some work was also performed at UWT laboratories. We have designed our arsenic circuit , cloned the inserts into the pSB1C3 vector, and transformed them into E. coli DH5a cells.
We will evaluate the circuit by measuring GFP expression in cells and the activation of the circuit using arsenic. While approaching our project in different directions, we ultimately decided to utilize the following protocols to create and test our arsenic circuit.
Protocol
Cloning
We used IDT gBlocks to synthesize the DNA we selected from the iGEM Parts Registry. Because we were creating a regulatory protein and a reporter, we made two separate pieces of synthetic DNA and later joined them with a restriction enzyme site to create a biscistronic plasmid. We also added the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix to the ends of our synthetic DNA so that we can insert it into the BioBrick assmbly plasmid pSB1C3. Information about our Parts can be found on our Parts Page.
Standard protocols for restriction enzyme digests, ligations, and transformationss were found on the iGEM Protocols page.
After transformation, two colonies were selected for screening from the transformation plates and subject to the miniprep protocol put forth by Promega Wizard Plus SV Miniprep DNA Purification system.

Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part‚Äôs/Device‚Äôs Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion #4.
We have validated and documented the characterisation of our parts Mg-chelatase plasmid [BBa_K1998000] and psbMZHWK [BBa_K1998004] and submitted these to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modelling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Our major collaboration was with NTU Singapore . We also participated in collaborations with South Africa and Paris Bettencourt . To read a summary of our collaborations please click here .
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
As part of our Human Practices engagement we have addressed the following concerns and issues surrounding our project. In addition, we have actively engaged with the pubic and wider community to increase awareness of Synthetic Biology.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#METHODS and PARTS#parts_-_-_TEXT.html," tested under arabinose inducible (pBAD) promoter in lacZ_DTER_pBAD_BsaI_DTER cut with BsaI ( BBa_K323089 )
The successful binding of DNA binding protein to the synthetic promoter would prevent transcription of lacZ resulting in lower beta-galactosidase activity.
Split GFP/FRET device
Combining five BioBricks, four of them being proteins, and one being an non-codable DNA program sequence ( BBa_323039 ), mammalian cells exhibit split mCerulean and split mCitrine reconstitution upon binding predefined DNA elements. When both subsystems bind DNA, the composite device is ready to FRET. Original BioBricks had to be cloned into pSB1C3 backbone thereby loosing mammalian terminator. We have deposited both sets of four functional plasmids, one set being cloned into desired submission backbone (parts BBa_K323021 , BBa_K323029 , BBa_323005 , BBa_323080 ) and the other set of plasmids originating from pSB1AK8.
Characterized parts:
We characterized several parts already deposited in Registry:
pBAD/araC promoter ( Part:Bba_I0500 )
We further characterized the pBAD/araC promoter ( Part:Bba_I0500 ) using lacZ gene that encodes for beta-galactosidase enzyme ( Part:Bba_K323133 ). When incubating E.coli cultures containing the lacZ under pBAD/araC promoter, increasing concentrations of arabinose leads to higer promoter activity that results in higher amounts and subsequently higer activity of beta-galactosidase enzyme.¬†The tested cultures incubated at different concentrations of arabinose (i.e. 0%, 0.001%, 0.0025%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1%) have shown a trend of increasing beta-galactosidase activity with raising arabinose concentration. The activity was highest at 1% added arabinose, which implies the promotor should be induced by this arabinose concentration in order to reach maximum expression of the regulated protein. However, some beta-galactosidase activity was observed even at 0% added arabinose, which indicates slight leakage of the pBAD promoter.

ACP of class 2 DD is about 40 animo acids shorter than class 1, which cannot form a polymerization area. Having the similar length with class 1 DD, KS of class 2 is   unable to form a spiral structure domain coiled coil due to its strong polarity. Therefore, the class 2 DD have no dimer, even though all of their structures are of   even numbers.
There are two alpha helix existing in the upstream and downstream of the class 2 DD separately. KS has alpha A and alpha B at the head of domain, while ACP has alpha 1   and alpha 2 at its end (Figure. 2). In order to get closer and form tighter combinations, the alpha helices between alpha A and alpha B or between alpha 1 and alpha 2   form a sharp turn (sharp bend). This structure makes class 2 DD different from class 1 [3][4].
Figure 2: Structure of class 2 docking domain
Design:
As introduced, it is obvious that the Class 2 DD has more advantages, such as its shorter lengths, closer combinations, clearer effect of regulating protein   function and higher transfer efficiency in completing upstream intermediate. Therefore, we have selected the Class 2 Docking Domain as our part. Because of its   specificity as mentioned, the connections between different sets of ACP and KS are different. Typical PKS subunits are tightly homodimeric and contain one to six   modules each. They are thought to associate with other multienzyme subunits through contacts at their C and N termini to form the overall PKS complexes. For example,   the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), assembling the polyketide core of erythromycin A, contains three multienzyme subunits as DEBS 1, DEBS 2, and DEBS3, each of   which includes two extension modules [1][5]. We get the interest sequence of six pairs of DDs (DD1, DD2, DD3, DD4, DD5, DD6) by sequencing synthesis, and we   also add RFC 23 to insert restriction enzyme cutting sizesÔºàFigure 3). At last, we built them to pSB1C3 vector.

The equations that model these species in our system are as follows:
The extracellular proton and chloride rates of change are set to zero since the extracellular volume (the human stomach) is as much as 15 orders of magnitude larger than the individual cell volume. Thus molecular fluxes will have negligible effects on the ionic concentrations.
Our Phytastic E. coli use a chloride-inducible promoter, Pgad, to sense the change in chloride concentration as a way to detect the change in pH.  The Pgad operon part, which we obtained from the Chinese University of Hong Kong iGem team, includes a constitutive promoter for a positive regulator gene, gadR. gadR binds upstream of the Pgad promoter, where it can be allosterically activated by chloride ions, which significantly increases transcription. Our Phytastic E. coli have a coding region for lysozymes downstream of the Pgad part so that they can selectively lyse at low pH. The model, however, replaces the lysis cassette with GFP for the purpose of comparing the model to results. The Pgad/GFP system is illustrated below:

Sheffield,2014,Team:Sheffield#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in 2012 by a team from WHU-China. The part consists of promoter BBa_J23110 with a FadR binding site placed downstream with a 3bp overlap.
This allows for production of the full length downstream gene or protein, unless the promoter is blocked by the binding of FadR (a bacterial transcription factor). FadR binding is inhibited by long chain fatty acyl-CoA compounds, such as oleic acid.
Enzyme Synthesis
Due to the use of constitutive promoters within this project, enzyme synthesis within the cells would be occurring at all times, given the growth conditions suitable for growth and synthesis of the cell.
Enzyme Secretion
TliA, our heat stable lipase, has been shown to excrete via a Type 1 ABC transporter. Without the exporter, the lipase is sequestered inside the cell. Excretion is necessary for the creation of our design product, as the enzymes need to be removed from the system without damage to the cell culture.
KerUS has been shown to self export in BL21, a strain which it would be feasible for us to use in a mix self culture with other E.coli strains.
Safety
A main focus of our project was to engineer our bacteria in a safe and sustainable way. Because of our focus being on E.coli, we had little to worry about in the way of pathogenicity, and our enzymes were deemed safe as long as standard lab practice was used; gloves, lab coats, no licking the benches.
We were, however, conscious of the fact that our product would be used in a home environment. Kill switches were discusses but seemed over-used and not always effective. A dead cell is just as bad as a live one in an open system where genetic exchange is the main worry. To keep users of our product safe, we aim to keep our system closed and bacteria removed from the system on a monthly basis by disinfection with bleach.

Figure 3: Graph of GFP v HSL
The final values of all the molecules are RNAs are then substituted into the model as the initial values for the next run and the HSL is reduced at a fixed rate, producing the data shown in figure. It can be seen that the up-regulation is maintained for a much lower HSL threshold than when the first run. In fact, the cell never fully returns to a down-regulated state again. After trying to achieve this through decreasing the rate at which the HSL is taken away and increasing the number of increments for which the model is run, it was decided that our model simply did not produce the behaviour we were looking for. Figure shows how the concentrations of the various molecules and the mRNAs changes over the transition from down- to up-regulated states. The model predicts low concentrations of the HSL-LuxR complex which is theoretically predicted, but in general the results were unsatisfactory as to drawing any real conclusions about the causes or otherwise of the bistability.
Figure 4: Graph showing the variation in the concentrations of all the components of the system with time during the HSL up ramp
It should be noted that while figure 4 actually contains plots of the mRNA concentrations and of the HSL-LuxR complex, they are so small when compared to the other components that they cannot be appropriately scaled.
Figure 5: Graph showing the change in concentrations of HSL-LuxR and mRNA with time over the HSL up ramp
Conclusions
Our first model was met with some success in that switching behaviour did seem to be present. However, after further analysis we found that the 'bistability' was not true to what we would expect and so was disregarded. In essence this model was too simplistic for any quantitative purpose and so further work was continued.

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor ‚Äì IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," in previous research was used to steadily increase the RBS strength of a gene, GFP mut3b, the expression of which was then characterized. Unexpectedly, expression level of proteins plateaued even as the RBS strength (and thus TIR) was increased. By using the RBS Calculator to increase the translation initiation rate, we can detect when the plateau occurs, which is called the ""maximum translation rate capacity."" Since this plateau occurs independently of TIR, it is theorized that it is due solely to translation elongation becoming a rate limiting step.  The design of the GFPs using only common and rare codons was based on the data in this table.
Codon Frequency
Number in % collumn shows the percent of time that the amino acid was coded for with a specific codon. More frequent codons have higher percentages.
Modified from Maloy, S., V. Stewart, and R. Taylor. 1996. Genetic analysis of pathogenic bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY.
To optimize for common degenerate codons, the most frequent codon for a specific amino acid was taken. To optimize for rare degenerate codons, the least frequent codon was taken. For example, if a codon in the original superfolder GFP coded for Phenylalanine, the codons UUU and UUC were available.  The frequencies of these were taken from the table (UUU-.51, UUC-.59). For common GFP, UUU was used whenever Phenylalanine was desired, because it had the highest frequency. For rare GFP, UUC was used. Because all codons were found to be either common or rare for E. coli, the common and rare optimized genes had zero commonality. Tryptophan is the only amino acid coded by one codon, but it does not appear in superfolder GFP.
Result of common/rare optimization is two coding sequences with zero commonality.
In another recent project, all the genes (coding DNA sequences) of E. coli are divided into five groups based on the naturally occurring TIR, from lowest to highest. Then, the codon usage profile of each group of genes is statistically analyzed to determine whether a codon is slow or fast. A fast codon is defined as one with high correlation between TIR and its frequency. Otherwise, it is a slow codon.  It is hypothesized that the groups of CDS with high TIR will hold more ‚Äúfast‚Äù codons, which will lead to higher translation elongation rate and thus higher protein expression, whereas the slow regions will hold more"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html," for a protein-based receptor was comparatively more labor-intensive anyways than for the sensors that could be created with riboswitches.
Riboswitches are composed of short sequences of nucleotides made up of an aptamer, which is a ligand-binding domain made up of nucleic acids, and the expression platform that can control gene-regulatory functions. These aptamers can be tested in vitro for progesterone specificity, whereas proteins require synthesis in vivo. A paper by Contreras Jimnenez et al. (2015) described several in vitro-derived aptamers specific for progesterone (Contreras Jimnenez et al., 2015). Unfortunately, like the progesterone receptor, these aptamers are also three orders of magnitude too sensitive for our desired concentration, but have much shorter sequences - an average of 51 bp compared to 933 bp for human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) (UniProt, n.d.; Verbeke et al., 2013). Mutating these short sequences and isolating variants would be much easier than mutating a larger protein receptor. We found that the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method follows a similar logic to directed evolution, and is intended for selecting RNA aptamers (Ellington and Szostak, 1990).
For these reasons, we looked into the viability of creating a progesterone-specific RNA aptamer that could be used in conjunction with a riboswitch expression platform to affect the expression of a reporter gene. Our research uncovered a previous iGEM BioBrick (BBa_K1913011) that used a trans-functioning riboswitch to indirectly affect the expression of an RFP reporter gene directly affecting the expression of a TutR inverter protein as well as another paper describing the in-vitro characterization of several progesterone-specific RNA aptamers. We attempted to mimic the same TutR inverter system as in the previously described BioBrick until we found another paper describing a more fitting option.
PoPPY-switch
The expression platform of the hammerhead ribozyme has been altered to be more accommodating to the attachment of arbitrary RNA aptamers, giving us the modularity and cross-domain function needed to create our sensor. With this new information, our project then became the creation of a novel single gene reporter system.
Win and Smolke (2007) published research on the hammerhead ribozyme, which works across varying domains, where they increased the modularity of the expression platform by adding two small nucleotide sequences labeled as the switching"

Modeling
The Illinois - Tools team can model any pathway, whose starting and ending compounds are stored in the Kegg database.  The algorithm developed by the team takes information from the Kegg database and finds the most optimum pathway, based on the weights selected by the user.  Examples include the pathway with the least number of steps, or the pathway that uses the least amount of ATP.
The Illinois-Tools team also wishes to use this algorithm to help other IGEM teams in modeling their own desired pathways.  For example, the our program can help the Illinois wetlab team in modeling their pathway.  The wetlab team's project is about a binary decoder in the organism E. coli, that senses 2 inputs, such as 2 sugars, and produces one of four possible outputs, which are fluorescent proteins, based on the combination of inputs.
Go to Illinois
A possible future expansion of their project would be to model these pathways computationally, and see if it would be experimentally feasible. Furthermore, once the protein output is obtained, they want to check if it can be used to produce useful compounds like biofuels.
To help this team reach its goals, our program, IMPtools, was able to model a pathway from D-Arabinose to Ethanol in E. coli.  The result can be seen below.  It has been optimized for E.coli, and can be further optimized when the wetlab team is ready to work on it.  The labels on the reaction are the Kegg IDs for compounds.
The Algorithm
In modeling for other teams, a few things should be considered. The algorithm requires interactivity. It is can only optimize if you set the parameters to specify what you mean by ""optimal"". In that light, the user of IMPtools when modeling for a practical design application should consider how important removing excess reactants or creating biproducts could be, as well as the implications of ATP consumption. Sometimes the algorithm can return intermediate compounds that are truly only cofactors of a main reaction (these can generally be avoided by weighting against high order nodes, but also by specifically removing certain nodes). With IMPtools and a small amount of manipulation, a reasonable pathway can be returned using IMP's pathfinding algorithm. Using these results, actual experimentation is necessary to validate the pathway - perhaps, given future"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids obtained was measured on Nanodrop and plasmids were stored at    -20¬∞C.
Experiments
Experiments:
See Proof of concept experiment.
sfGFP(Sp) in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1930006 )
sfGFP(Sp) is a reporter gene originally optimized for Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has been shown when expressed in B. subtilis that the signal is even brighter than the one from sfGFP(Bs) (Overkamp et al. 2013) . To submit sfGFP(Sp) reporter gene as BioBrick ( BBa_K1930006 ) we cloned it in the pSB1C3 standard iGEM backbone.
PCR
Experiment:
06/10/16: sfGFP(Sp) was amplified from the pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) plasmid, that    we constructed during the project, with the primers prefix sfGFP(Sp) and    suffix sfGFP(Sp) (primer sequences can be found here ).
PCR mixture:
50 Œºl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see    following protocol .
Figure 1. DNA electrophoresis with amplified sfGFP(Sp)     gene (763 bp in size).
Conclusion:
The sfGFP(Sp) was successfully amplified from the pDR111+sfGFP(Sp) plasmid.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with PCR Purification Kit ‚Äì Jena Bioscience .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
The sfGFP(Sp) was cut with EcoRI and PstI. The backbone pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was digested with the same enzymes. This construct is carrying RFP reporter therefore it was used for easier screening after transformation. You could see self-ligations as red    colonies and the correct ones as white ones.
RD mixture:
20 Œºl RD assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see    following protocol .
Figure 2. DNA electrophoresis of EcoRI and PstI digested     pSB1C3 - BBa_J04450. The RFP insert is 1069bp and the pSB1C3 backbone     is 2019 bp.
Conclusion:
The digestion was successful because bands for both expected    fragments could be seen on the gel"

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#HumanPractices2_-_-_TEXT.html," our 80 minute presentation focuses on an activity called Central Dogma Relay.The goal of this activity was to get kids moving and understand how DNA codes for proteins. They were given a coding sequence (white) the complementary strand codons (blue) the mRNA codons (green) and the amino acid (orange). We reversed engineered sequences of DNA so that the amino acid strand would spell things like ""Penn State"" and ""Science"". We received a lot of positive feedback and were offered the opportunity to present again in the fall as part of ScienceU's STEM showcase.
This experience builds on the reputation set up by Penn State's iGEM teams in previous years as a very knowledgeable and accessible group that is committed to educating others. It can be continued by future iGEM teams, and was so popular this year that it could easily be expanded to include more students in future years. We believe that through this type of community involvement, especially with the energy and creativity level that is typical of iGEM teams, a strong foundation will be created that the next generation of engineers will spring off of.
The foundation that we built on.
Engineering a Metabolic Pathway: ROUND 2
As the second part of our presentation, we talked about how we designed our project and the different aspects that are important when you are thinking about a plasmid. This was a little more technical, but the kids caught on very quickly and every group was able to construct their own plasmid. I think that this reinforces the idea that this is a quick activity that teachers can take to the classroom and use to teach their students about genetic engineering. This type of repeat-ability is what gives our outreach a stronger impact. Much like a part in the registry, we took a concept for community involvement that has been used by previous iGEM teams, improved it, repeated it, and set the stage for it to be even better next year.
Our SCIENCE U Presentation
Download our complete presentation and take a look! Note that this material is geared for students with little prior knowledge in the subject area, and is meant to be a very interactive presentation.

Our project has implications for the environment, ownership and sharing, education and safety.
Environment and Sustainability
The main goal of our project is to clean up environmental pollution and by doing so, reclaim the source of the pollution (ammonia) so that it can be converted into a useful product or into a source of energy.  By providing a small scale solution that can be deployed the source of ammonia pollution, we are able to prevent the spread of ammonia into the environment.  As ammonia run off from farms is a main cause of eutrophication, our solution will help prevent eutrophication.  Additionally, we are able to provide farmers with a means to reclaim value from fertilizer that has washed off their fields.  This solution has been designed considering the global context of the nitrogen cycle.  By closing the loop early, we are viewing pollution as an opportunity and source of value instead of as a problem to be gotten rid of.  As a result, we are able to simultaneously prevent widespread pollution of watersheds, and to provide small scale sustainable energy production to farmers.
Ownership and sharing
As we have seen over the last 30 years in the software realm, there is a lot of discussion around whether patents on intellectual property help stimulate innovation or restrict it.  The debate in the software space is now becoming highly relevant to biotechnology as the ability to engineer genes, devices and organisms with commercial and social impact increases.  The software world is broadly divided into two ideological camps -- those who believe that innovation is driven by the ability to protect it with patents and who aim to commercialize their wares, and those who believe that having freedom to modify and distribute your software is necessary for having freedom over your life [1] .
The spirit iGEM embraces is more closely aligned with the free software movement than with commercial software -- the parts registry provides a free means for teams to exchange DNA sequences, and iGEM encourages teams to build on and improve existing sequences that have been submitted, while"

Engineering E. coli to Fix Nitrogen and Regulating Transcription with Light
Why are we doing this project?
Synthetic biology is an exciting area of research that aims to genetically improve organisms to make them more efficient and hopefully more useful to us as well. The human population in 1950 was 2.5 billion, yet it is predicted to surpass 9 billion by 2050 [1] . Even with population growth slowing, increasing life spans and standards of living will soon tax our natural resources. One of the most concerning is our food supply. The agriculture industry needs a revolution in order to keep up with our expected growth rates. Currently about 80% of chemically fixated nitrogen is used as agricultural fertilizers, the majority in developed lands [1] . Intracellular nitrogen fixation in crops could help to sustain the burgeoning world population, especially in areas with less fertile soil without taxing the planet‚Äôs waterways. The exponential increase in nitrogen fertilizer has led to more runoff into rivers and oceans. Fertilizers then provide nutrition for algal blooms that result in hypoxia and form oceanic dead zones. These dead zones lead to the death of marine species and have potentially large economic consequences.
The ramifications of nitrogen fertilizer runoff can be averted by genetically engineering plant crops to fix their own nitrogen. Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen for nutritional needs, while most organisms can only acquire it from the food it consumes. Synthetic biology allows us to transfer this ability to fix nitrogen to a heterologous host that has many genetic tools, Escherichia coli, so that we can learn how to give single cell organisms, and eventually chloroplasts the ability to create their own nitrogen fertilizer.
Diazotrophic (organisms that fix nitrogen) cyanobacteria such Nostoc Punctiforme or Anabaena use heterocysts (specialized nitrogen fixing cells) to create a mini-anaerobic environment to aid nitrogen fixation. However, Cyanothece "

Overview

Simulations
Kinetics of drug protein of interest
Both our proteins of interest, PAH and cellulase , are enzymes to be released in the small intestines, after degradation of the capsule. As part of the study for our system, we would like to calculate the amount of enzyme a capsule must contain so that a PAH-replacement therapy or a grass-based diet becomes a feasible prospect.
A necessary step for this calculation is the estimation of the enzymatic activity of our enzymes of interest.
The standard model for enzymatic action will be used to analyse the raw data (either the substrate concentration or the product concentration over time) gathered in the wetlab.

Our Goals
Overview of system
Characterise the general dynamics of the system,  including its two main modus operandi.
Assess how its various parameters can affect its output.
Investigate the validity of the common Michaelis-Menten assumption of enzyme kinetics.
¬† about the Michaelis-Menten assumptions!
Data analysis
Show how the relation between the enzymatic activity of our protein of interest and the rate of breakdown of substrate, d[P]/dt can be exploited.
Investigate ways to estimate the concentrations of enzyme or substrate if either is unknown as is the case in our experiments.
¬† about the model assumptions and predictions!
The System
The behaviour of the system (the single-substrate mechanism) can be described with four ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Each component is described by a simple rate term for each of the four species involved in the mechanism.
¬† about the equations and what they mean!
Summary of simulation results
For lower values of [S0], the rate of formation of the product is directly proportional to the amount of [S0]. However, for higher values of [S0], rate of formation of product saturates at a maximum rate.
Michaelis-Menten approximation only holds for very small values of [E0].
Increasing K3 values will increase rate of formation of product.
¬† about the simulations!
Conclusions
Michaelis-Menten assumption can be applied to our system because for us, KM >> [E0]

Gibson Assembly on Geneious ¬∑ Benchling
Gibson Assembly on Geneious
Introduction
Make plasmids on the internet!
Materials
Procedure
Linearise vector plasmid where you want to insert new gene (eg using a restriction site).
Manually replace start codon if lost.
Select the gene you want to insert excl. stop codon and extract.
Select vector and extracted gene and click tools --> cloning --> Gibson assembly.
Ensure backbone = vector, box contains gene fragment. Choose min overlap length (18-22), min overlap Tm (48), calculation of Tm is based on protocol.
* Can also insert multiple genes simultaneously or a subfolder (eg promoter) to make several different products.
* We want G-C at primer ends, particularly on 5' side.
* Make sure primer code is written 5'-3' from L-->R for synthesis.
* If % GC is high then higher annealing T, lower % GC has lower annealing T. High Tm means less likely to anneal in funny places but don't want too high that doesn't get a chance to anneal before enzyme runs at ~72ÀöC.

Everyone was willing to help and they were happy we had the initiative to assess the environmental problem the community was facing.
Figure 3: Sof√≠a with Jos√© Vel√°zquez, Director of the Risk Management unit.
Final Action Plan
Based on the news we have read and the conversations we had, our team decided a small part of it would travel to Chiapas and Tabasco to gather samples from locations provided by people from Cecropia. Not only did we identify the problem, but we decided to get a closer approach and get directly involved.
The Journey
From now on we'll start talking to you as Human Practices team, conformed by Samantha, Alan, Nora, Nufo and Sof√≠a. We started our journey on the last week of July, travelling around 1,736 km to get there. It was a big challenge for us; everyday we would drive at least 7 hours by car to get to the samples locations, but we were never alone. From the moment we touched the ground at Tabasco until we took our plane back to Monterrey, partners, workers, family, and friends were supporting us. Hadn't we had the help from Mart√≠n Hern√°ndez and F√©lix G√≥mez, our sample gathering simply wouldn't have taken place.

Model
Fig. Model for the effect of miR-21 sponge in cells. After introduction of the sponge transgene, sponge RNAs are expressed at a high level and attract miR-21, inhibiting the expression of eGFP reporter. The expression of miR-21 should be identified by their eGFP reporter expression.
Model
We created a model which can measure the expression of miRNA in cells by using miRNA sponges. This model is very novel because it is the first time of using miRNA sponges to monitor the expression levels of miRNA. The principal of the model based on characteristic of sponge RNAs, which can attact miRNA and inhibit the expression of miRNA-target (Figure).

The Community
Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval                 and more convenient biological ideas sharing. Apart from these functions, an online editor is added to                 BioHub 3.0. Users not only can finish their reports in a more convenient way, but also can release their                 reports and read or comment on other scholar's reports on this platform. Praise and collection are also                 supported. As an extensible community, more fantastic features would be integrated in the future.
Intelligent Search Engine
The Intelligent Search Engine is based on 2017's project. The following features are added.
It has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like ""reports                     today"", ""reports by ana"", ""reports this year"" and etc..
Filtering rules and Collation can be customized.
Advanced search is supported.
We have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could                     search information more quickly.
User Interface
We introduced a new user interface. In order to match our frontend framework perfectly, we choose                     Ng-zorro, which is written in TypeScript with complete defined types as our UI framework. The                     high-quality components and style of Ng-zorro help us complete our design quickly and provides a better                     experience."
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," red is a red fluorescent protein that could produce ROS (Reactive oxygen species) by light illumination. As shown in Fig.1, green light (585 nm) stimulation of the QYG chromophore of killer red produces ROS from water to kill cell[1][2][3]
Figure 1. The sketch map of killer red mechanism
The killer red is very specific and would not produce ROS without light illumination. In human gut, the killer red should not induce any tissue damage since there is no access to light. Deliver light to guts will terminate engineered bacteria when necessary.
Phi 174 Gene E
Gene E is a cell lysis protein from phage, which kills bacteria by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. We decided to test this gene under different promoters so that we could induce cell death when needed. Compared to the killer red, gene E is more efficient in killing and its expression can be controlled by chemicals (such as IPTG), thereby more convenient in killing.
Results
The killer red limits bacteral growth
Figure 2. Confocal images of killer red expression in E.coli.
Then, We tried to cultivate the induced killer red under the light of oven, and the growth curve did not show significant difference between the experimental group and control group, illustrating that when under the illumination of white light, it would not produce ROS that could do harm to cells, confirming it‚Äôs safety in gut.
Finally, to test the efficiency of killer red, we put it under the illumination of the specific light of fluorescent microscope for 4 hours, and then cultivate them in 37‚ÑÉ drying oven overnight, and we could see it clearly that the culture medium which both under induction and illumination is significantly have less single clones, and the others(one illuminated by light and not induced, one induced without illumination of light, one neither induced nor illuminated) surface are rough, indicating the large amount of E.coli.

The current burning of beehives threatens the environment and the loss of its resources, which is why a viable alternative to avoid such burning is necessary.
He clarified that the word of a beekeeper is not in doubt; however, it might be hard for us to obtain real data regarding the presence of American foulbrood as it is a mandatory complaint issue, so there is distrust of the producer.
Dr. Tanus suggested liquid application (in the form of syrup) which beekeepers could feed their hives. This syrup (sweetened water) could contain the peptides in it and be fed directly to the box. This way, nurse bees would feed on here. Since Africanized bees appeared, he claims, it is better to have interior feeding to avoid foragers. This method would also avoid product loss from environmental conditions such as the wind or sun.
We mentioned the possibility of adding the solution cell by cell, but he said we must think of the beekeeper. This just isn‚Äôt scalable for 3,000 or 4,000 boxes. We realized here that the easier the application, the more attractive the product.
We should consider the effect our product would have on the bee's usual microbiome.
He put us in contact with MSc Alejandro Romo, MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, and Dr. Alfonso Arroyo.
We received an invitation to the XXVI International Congress for Beekeeping Updates in 2019.

Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Practices#An iGEM Critique_-_-_TEXT.html," characterization ( this part , for example). The volume of new BioBricks introduced each year is too much to parse, and it becomes difficult to independently verify the validity of a part.
Interesting parts will often be used by future teams, who can say whether a part works as described or needs to be corrected; however, the vast majority of parts will never be used or looked at again. If the Registry is meant to be a database of parts to be used, the vast range of quality makes it difficult to trust that any part is high quality, even if it's thoroughly documented. It is intractable for a group to verify the results of each submitted BioBrick, and independently verify results, so we are required to rely on the results of the individuals who created and submitted that BioBrick.
Independently verifying results is a core tenant of science that is used inconsistently with regards to the registry. This inconsistency and lack of adherence to fundamental scientific principles makes it difficult to see the Registry as something other than a plasmid mystery grab bag: you don't know what you're getting until you take a look inside.
iGEM 2009
Likewise, it's not difficult to extend this reasoning to wikis, models, and even entire projects. There's considerable effort from teams to make sure their information is as clear as possible, but despite efforts to make information relevant and useful for years to come, more often than not the information doesn't mean much for scientific progress. But I expect that. Why? Because we're students, not experts. We're still learning, and no matter how much we learn over the course of a year or two, we aren't professionals.
I am not saying that teams should be expected to live up to the expectations of fully qualified scientists or developers, and that if they don't meet those requirements they should stop. Nor am I arguing with the intent for these works. All of the above is meant to illustrate one idea: iGEM has little, if any, incentive to work on projects with any long-lasting benefit. Once the Jamboree is over and the prizes are awarded, there is little motivation to make sure the completed work is updated, or that even the most basic of errors are fixed.
That is not science. That stems from the fact that iGEM is an educational program, and I am OK with that. But conflating the two ideas and attempting to build upon a foundation that is inherently unsturdy gives me pause, and leads me to believe the goals of iGEM should be readdressed and clarified for following years.

Garage Lab
GarageLab is a group of scientists, artists and engineers cofounded by Emiliano Kargieman and Dario Wainer in 2009 as a Workshop about Bioengineering at the University of Palermo.
During these years, it grew up to be a multitasking group, by getting involved in subjects such as Neuro-robotics, Contamination assessment, Data Privacy and Management, Personalized Medicine, Public Information and Problematics of Open Innovation.
Now a days, the group has 22 active members and 5 projects with Non governmental organizations.
They are evolving in order to become an institution and in process of building a proper infrastructure that would allow the resolution of high impact issues, as much as bigger workshops, hackatons, talks, conferences and developments.

Of the several reunions that we had at Garage Lab, perhaps the most interesting was the one in which one of our members taught Synthetic Biology to a group of computer scientists and engineers through a game. The key question was not ""How does DNA works?"" but ""How can we make it work for us?""
Through these talks we find out how people from different disciplines other than natural sciences come up with new ideas and points of view"

A treatment more dangerous than the disease it treats ?
For this sentence not to become a reality for our project, we thought long and hard about biosafety. We chose to use Escherichia coli as a chassis because it is a Biosafety Level 1 organism and is very commonly used as a model in biology. We also used Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, another Biosafety Level 1 organism during our experiments. As mentioned in the final safety form submitted in August 28, 2015, we worked in a Biosafety Level 1 lab and we took all the required precautions.
We also thought about what we could do to reduce contamination risks if our projet would become real. One application of our project is to use our bacteria in small to medium enclosed industrial plants. The most efficient location would be either near water or in the ocean, where the microparticles are the most present. The plant would function as follows : the water containing micro- and macro-particles of plastic enters the plant and is put in a first container where the bacteria are located. The plastic is digested and the fluid moves on to the second compartment after filtration. In this compartment, Erythromycin A will be extracted. In normal conditions people would not be directly exposed to the bacteria.
We also thought of the possibility of using our bacteria before the plastic ends up in the ecosystem, at recycling facilities. Here, the bacteria would be in direct contact with solid plastic.
If our project were fully developed into a PlastiCure factory, we would have to be very careful that the modified strain of E.coli does not leave the plant and ends up in the ecosystem. This would be the main issue with our project. In order to reduce the risk of leaks into the ecosystem, we would implement a filtration system. The plant would have to be perfectly sealed. At the French Meet-up in Bordeaux, the Paris_Saclay team advised us to use a compartment with two filters to be safer and to reduce the risk of contamination.
We also plan to have a kill switch using an inducible promoter, so that the promoter will not function outside of our factory.

13) Use bacteria or a micro-organism well-tolerated by humans to use them for applications in skin regeneration and localized drug delivery (and production) for extensive wounds: for example such bacteria could be deposited on the wound and they could produce some sort of protective biofilm or continuously deliver a molecule essential for better cicatrisation... (Basile, Nicolas, Rafael, Gabriela)
14) A solution to reduce CO2 emissions: use cyanobacteria and modify their tolerance levels for CO2 uptake so that they'd absorb higher quantities and metabolize them: even if the bacteria subsequently die, the CO2 at least wouldn't be released as a gas (it would be transformed into biomass) (Basile)
15) Help people with an intolerance to gluten (or allergy...) digest it quickly enough for it not to affect their health by making them eat for example a probiotic yoghurt containing bacteria which would provide the enzymes necessary to metabolize the compound. An alternative would be to simply make the bacteria ""absorb"" the gluten: these would then naturally be eliminated from the organism. (Heidi)

The BphP / PpsR system
Finally this part of the project was cancelled, due to lack of time.
But it is still of interest to describe it, it could be useful in the future. PpsR1 is a redox sensitive activator. It binds DNA under anaerobic conditions, and forms a tetramer via a disulfide bond. This interaction is ablated in the mutant PpsR1-C429S; meaning that we should be able to mimic an anaerobic system even under aerobic conditions.
PpsR2 is a transcriptional repressor, regulated by BphP.

CO2 Utilization Result Analysis
Let Numbers Talk
Analysis CO2 uptake Metabolism Flux Experimental data References
Analysis
There are three major questions we have answered in result analysis
How much CO2 (air) uptake by engineering E. coli?
How much CO2 can be fixed in biomass?
If the pyruvate trend match biomass trend?
Amount of CO2 uptake
At first, we set up a closed system to model CO2 uptake by E. coli.                                          After a period of time, concentration of CO2 uptake reached a balance.                                          The result can tell that more than 50% air CO2 diffuse into E. coli in a closed system.
Fig 1. CO2 uptake under closed system
However, we cannot set a CO2 utilization system in a closed system.                                          No matter our application is continuous culture or fed-batch culture,                                          air CO2 concentration will be constant, which means a boundary condition.                                          Therefore, we model again under open system. Under constant air CO2 condition,                                          CO2 diffusion speed changed with time and we categorized them into three phases, which are                                         steady climb phase, transition phase, and saturated phase.                                          The time segments of these three phases depend on CA activity.                                           We assume A, B, C as time intervals of three phases.                                           The cover area in the result shows that different time interval refers to different amount of CO2 uptake by E. coli. Its CO2 uptake rate change with time as well.                                          As a result, we collect the CO2 uptake rate and then calculate with the xylose consumed rate and                                          pyruvate produced rate. What‚Äôs more, the main reaction of CO2 in engineered E. coli happened between RuBP to 3PGA,                                          which is another part we are going to discuss.

Time A was about 10 min (or 700 s) with [CO2 uptake] reach 1 mM, causing 25% CO2 uptake in total.

In the average mRNA graph in Figure 2 we can see ompA and lgA mRNA present in rapidly increasingly levels until an equilibrium is reached (around 1 hour), the increased rate and higher equilibrium value of lgA mRNA are due to its shorter gene length and hence faster mRNA synthesis than OmpA. Average bamA mRNA starts of at comparatively high levels due to the initial additions of bamA mRNA however the mass of DNA present in the average case is not sufficient to maintain these high mRNA levels and hence bamA mRNA drops to an equilibrium level around 25% of OmpA and lgA mRNA.
Minimum mRNA levels occur when no addition of initial mRNA is made as well as when screening over low DNA masses and fast mRNA degredation rates. In this area of the parameter space mRNA for all 3 proteins quickly reach low equilibrium levels characterized primarily by effect of gene length on speed of mRNA synthesis.
Maximum mRNA levels are reached with large additions of bamA mRNA and large masses of DNA. The resulting synthesis of bamA mRNA maintains a high equilibrium value throughout the entire model run. mRNA of OmpA and lgA in the maximal case quickly increases to a high equilibrium value after around 100 minutes.
By comparing the mRNA levels in average, minimum and maximum cases we can observe as might be expected that increasing mass of DNA means that equilibrium levels of mRNA take longer to reach and occur at a higher value.
In average, minimum and maximum cases the protein expression of OmpA, lgA and BamA follows the same trend which is unaffected by fluctuations in mRNA level. Each protein is expressed at a rate primarily proportional to its length and to a magnitude primarily dependent on the mass of available DNA.
Figure 3 displays the distribution of number of BamA molecules present at 20 minute intervals, appendix B contains analogous plots for OmpA and lgA.
Figure 3. Distribution of BamA at 20 minute intervals
At each 20 minute interval we can observe the distribution of BamA expression stretches to the right as more protein is synthesized. Within the initial 40 minutes the distribution is heavily grouped together as there has not been enough time for BamA to be present in high levels. Between 60 and 100 minutes the distribution spreads out and settles into distinct groups corresponding to particular parameter settings which increasingly move to the right as more protein is synthesized.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of number of bamA mRNA"

‚àÜCsgA_pSB1C3_CsgA and ‚àÜCsgA_pSB1C3_CsgA_His were grown overnight (25/08/2015) and then diluted 1/60 in 10 mL LB+Cam until an OD of 0.6. 1 mL of 5% Rhamnose was added to both cultures and grown at 37¬∞C for 2 hours. Then the cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm @ 4¬∞C for 15 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and pellets were placed in -20¬∞C.
Also a restriction was performed for CEFG_low, CEFG_med, CEFG_high, BCEFG_low, BCEFG_med and BCEFG_high.

OD600 was measured for ‚àÜcsgA_csgA (1.77) and ‚àÜcsgA_GFP (1.90). Based on this result, 500 ¬µl of each culture was added to 5 mL M9.
6 tubes of ‚àÜcsgA_pSB1C3_CsgA, ‚àÜcsgA_pSB1C3, ‚àÜcsgA_pSB1C3_csgA_His were grown to an OD between 0,4 and 0,5. The cultures were then induced with 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5% rhamnose. The cultures were left overnight at room temperature.
The pellets of 26/08 were resuspended in 1mL lysis buffer with lysozyme, and 1ŒºL DNAse. The lysis reaction was left on ice for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 12000 g for 30 min at 4¬∞C. The supernatant was collected and run through 1mL Ni-NTA spin column.
