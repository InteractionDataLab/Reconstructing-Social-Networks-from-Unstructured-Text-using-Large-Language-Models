Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," second criterion for a fully functional interface is its ability to conduct a neuron’s influx. Thus, conductivity measurements were made for different types of membranes. Results indicated that bare alumina oxide and PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes showed similar conductivities, indicating the incomplete coating of PEDOT:PSS on alumina oxide membranes. On the opposite, PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts exhibit on average better conductivities, but in the same time, the coating of these membranes revealed by electron microscopy seemed to have covered the alumina oxide membranes in a more uniform way, ensuring enhanced conductive capabilities . These results can be criticized because of the high deviation and because the membranes conductivity was measured after several biofilms were grown on them, which may have affected the measurements.
Figure 11: Membrane conductivity
Biocompatibility
One last important property of the membranes is the capability of bacteria to form a biofilm on them, as in our prosthesis system, the membrane is going to be directly in contact with the genetically modified biofilm, as well as the human body. We conducted multiple series of biofilm culture on special culture wells designed by our team. Biofilm growth was measured for each type of membrane.
Figure 12: Biofilm growth
CONCLUSION
Biocompatible polymers like PEDOT:PSS represent ideal materials for engineering biocompatible and conductive interfaces, that are also relatively easy to produce, thus making them our preferred choice in our project. However, it is worth mentioning that we are totally aware of the fact that we can’t just expect neuron axons to bind to our interface and produce an electric signal. The electric signal transmitted by a nerve is heavily limited to the interior of the nerve by myelin covering the axon, and the signal transmitted by the axon is purely chemical. So it requires special electrodes, like Fine or Cuff electrodes, to detect an electric signal. We might explore these solutions in the continuation of our project to enhance our interface’s ability to transmit neuron signals.

CONTROL
Begin by defining which inputs and outputs your microfluidic chip will have. Declare any limitations in terms of port size, channel width. Neptune will efficiently place and route the features of your chip. The mapper (MM) tool within the place and routing functionality has been made completely by the iGEM Team.
Check and visualize your device layout using the Neptune graphical user interface. Edit the design if you so desire. Establish a control sequence to move fluids through the microfluidic chip.  The interface has been made completely by the iGEM Team.
Assemble your microfluidic system. Import our design files into a 3D Printer and CNC mill to make the chip and the pump setup.  Change the setup using our parameterized designs to fit your specific needs. The design of the setup is BU iGEM work, whilst the chip manufacturing is the work of our mentors.
OUR PROJECT
Neptune is a specify, design, and build tool for the development of continuous flow microfluidics. With Neptune, users can specify microfluidic devices through a high level description of liquid flow relations. Our application will automatically place and route the design schematic of the microfluidic and, when used in conjunction with low cost and readily available CAD tools, a user can build their custom microfluidic system in-lab.
The Boston University 2016 iGEM Hardware Team is encapsulating this entire workflow through a graphical user interface. Users can write files that specify the function of the microfluidic, preview and edit their microfluidic design generated by the application, use this application directly with CAD tools such as a CNC mill to fabricate their device, and physically control valves and ports on the microfluidic chip. The iGEM team is also complementing this workflow by developing and releasing open source designs of our hardware, including parametric 3D print files and firmware for microcontrollers that actuate the microfluidic valves. Finally, the iGEM team is also involved in the development of the place and route software that converts a high level description of liquid flow relations into"

V Discussion
Why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in simplified model used in experiment
    When we look at the model, we will find most part of the model uses hypothesis that is commonly used, like Volterra-Lotka equation or Michaelis-Menten equation, and they can be confirmed experimentally. However,some parts of it are not, like the hypothesis that the decreasing effect of chloramphenicol on population growth rate is proportional to the amount of chloramphenicol inside that character. This is not confirmed by our experiment yet. Therefore, it is still not reasonable now to detect OD600 directly in simplified model used in experiment design. What's more, using RFP intensity to detect LacI and thus killing effect is confirmed by our experiment---Killing Test and so we detect RFP intensity to indicate killing effect.

If it was found, then we checked to see whether both [1] and [2] are found on the same chromosome; if they are found on different chromosomes, they are not attached so the system cannot detect it as a false positive. If they were found on the same chromosome, we figured out which part of [1] or [2] the aligns with that match. Remember that TALEs are polar. In other words, they bind much more strongly to the 5’ end of their target sequence compared to the 3’ end. Therefore, if the alignment included 0 to 10th nucleotide of the target sequence, that combination of those two target sites was ruled out. To get better idea of how we went about designing the TALE, refer to the figure below.

Considering the designing of an end product that can track down illegal drug laboratories.
Full Summary
Integration of human practices into our project
The input of the stakeholders, experts and public considerably influenced our project, altering the application of our sensor from a biosensor introduced in the environment to a handheld-device. Safety, low-costs and rapidly available quantified data were leading values in both project and product design processes. All requirements and difficulties emanating from the interactions were considered and integrated into the project, which is summarized below.
Finding a suitable application
We commenced with a method detecting botulism toxin in surface water, a serious issue for both wild animals and humans. In this case, quick demonstration of botulism presence and finding its source is important. However, upon discussing the topic with experts of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), we decided that introduction of GMO into the environment would not be feasible. Therefore, we shifted our attention to the application of the sensor as a lab tool to measure the presence of a certain compound.
Since our system was not specifically aimed at botulism toxins, the decision was made to detect toxins in food. However, after a literature search we concluded that the size of toxins would be too large to be able to be detected by our system. This lead us to focus on the detection of small molecules in food. Jos van der Vosse from the Netherlands Organisation for applied scientific research (TNO) advised us to focus on the detection of small molecules in water, since in this area measured concentrations are supposedly lower. Furthermore, he recommended us to assure the quantification of the signal and preferentially the concentrations as well.
Onno Epema from Rijkswaterstaat (part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management) pointed out the importance of pharmaceutical waste products in water, for which our system could improve the detection.
Surface water contaminants contain a wide variety of compounds, all with a different ecological impact. The meeting with Martin van den Berg, Deputy Director of the Institute Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), guided us to focus on one of the forthcoming most hazardous emerging contaminants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). These hormone mimicking compounds are used as antidepressant, and include pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. Even in low concentrations SSRIs are pharmacological active in vertebrates and have an ecological impact.
The interactions with both stakeholders and experts provided us with a number of applications for our biosensor, such as a pre-check for the chemical analysis and local sampling. To enable the use of DeTaXion to"

The N-terminal region mediates both dimerization and DNA binding and contains a nuclear localization signal, while an acidic C-terminal domain controls transcriptional activation. GAL4 directly interacts with the Tra1 component of the SAGA complex, recruiting Mediator and the general transcriptional machinery to initiate transcription. This ability to activate transcription is retained when GAL4 is expressed in other species including plants, human cell lines, zebraﬁsh, and Drosophila.
Gal80 and GAL80ts
The activity of GAL4 can be repressed by physical interaction with the yeast GAL80 protein. A dimer of GAL80 binds to the C-terminal ends of the GAL4 dimer so that, while it can still bind to a UAS sequence, it can no longer activate transcription. This interaction of GAL4 and GAL80 can be taken advantage of to reﬁne the expression pattern of GAL4-dependent transgenes.
Temporal speciﬁcity can be achieved using a temperature sensitive allele of GAL80. The Temporal and Regional Gene Expression Targeting (TARGET) system takes advantage of a variant of GAL80 that while ubiquitously expressed under control of the tubulin 1α promoter is only active at permissive temperatures.
Thought to be the result of a single glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid 203 of GAL80, GAL80ts is unable to bind GAL4 at restrictive temperatures above 29 °C but retains its repressive function at the permissive temperature of 18 °C. Controlling the activity of GAL80ts through temperature shifts provides temporal control of GAL4-dependent transgene expression. Limiting expression to deﬁned temporal windows can help to deﬁne critical periods for the effects of misexpression or rescue experiments. Temperature- sensitive alleles of GAL4 itself have been generated and tested in Drosophila, however the ease of combining tubGAL80ts with already established GAL4 drivers cause the TARGET system to be more commonly used.

OVERVIEW
NUSGEM is delighted to have interacted with so many teams around the world! We believe that collaborations have made our project more meaningful, and we are excited to share with you about our collaborations with the following teams!
Team CUHK
NUSGEM initially wanted to explore using RNA aptamers as a reporter system for our stress promoter (htpG1) and blue light repressible promoter. However, we faced many difficulties in constructing our aptamers reporter system and we could not get a successful construct for many months. However, we read that the Team CUHK was working on aptamers. Hence our team leader, Nanda, met up with them in Hong Kong.
Nanda (far left) with the members from CUHK iGEM team
After an exciting discussion in Lee Woo Sing College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, both teams saw a great collaboration opportunity between us, discovering many aspects of our projects which we could collaborate in - wetlab, modelling and hardware.
Selfie on a beautiful Sunday morning!
The two teams concluded our meeting by agreeing to keep in contact, and we continued to discuss intensively on our collaboration even after Nanda returned to Singapore. Eventually, we decided to collaborate on wetlab!
As the CUHK team worked on a RNA-based project, they were urgently looking for a particular strain of E. coli, BL21 Star. It is an RNase-knockout strain that will allow them to maximize RNA production. They asked whether our lab has this E. coli strain - we do! Without any hesitation, we shipped the strain over to them.
On the other hand, NUSGEM needed help on RNA aptamers constructions. Team CUHK kindly offered their expertise by redesigning our RNA aptamer constructs, as well as designing suitable primers to increase the chances of successful construction. In addition, they incorporated the RNA aptamer that they aimed to characterise, tRNALys3-iSpinach, with our stress promoter"

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

UFAM-UEA_Brazil,2016,Team:UFAM-UEA Brazil#Project#MerOperon_-_-_TEXT.html," abiotic and biological mechanisms. Microbial  mechanisms dominate the conversion of ionic mercury to organic mercury compounds,  especially methyl mercury. Some microorganisms are also capable of transforming  ionic or organic mercury into elemental mercury. This capability constitutes a  detoxification mechanism due to the lower toxicity of elemental mercury relative to  ionic or organic mercury. Organic and ionic mercury resistance is due to a dedicated set  of plasmid-encoded mercury resistance genes (the mer operon.) merR is a regulatory  gene. merP and merT are involved in mercury binding and transport. merA encodes for  a reductase which reduces ionic mercury to elemental mercury using NADPH. merB  encodes for an organomercurial lyase, which converts organomercurials into ionic  mercury and a reduced organic product.
Figure 01: Model of carbon-mercury lyase operon. The symbol indicates a cysteine  residue. RSH indicates cytosolic thiol redox buffers such as glutathione. Shows the  interactions of MerB, in green, with mercury compounds and other gene products  of mer operon. (Figure adapted from ""Bacterial mercury resistance from atoms to  ecosystems."")
The enzymatic reduction mechanism from Mer Operon is headed by two main  enzymes codified by MerA and MerB genes, organomercurial lyase and mercuric ion  reductase, respectively. MerB breaks the bond between Hg and a carbon atom from an  organic radical. In this complex, mercury has the ability to bind itself to biological  tissues and propagate through food chain until it reaches humans, a phenomenon called  biomagnifications. MerB orchestrates alongside MerA by releasing Hg(II) from the  organic complex, so MerA can reduce it to the volatile, less toxic Hg0.
Structure and mechanism:
MerB gene (0.6Kb) was first described by Kenzo Tonomura and is an integrated  Mer Operon gene, a functional cluster of genes that can be used for mercury  bioremediation. It catalyzes the bond breaking of methylmercury, releasing Hg(II).
The purified protein required a minimum two-fold molar excess of thiol over  organomercurial substrate to exhibit any activity and preferred the physiological thiol  cysteine to non-physiological mercaptans. The enzyme has a very broad substrate  tolerance, handling both alkyl and aryl mercurials, with a slight preference for the latter.  As is often the"

Two visits were made to Sanquin, one general introduction visit and one specialized visit where the specific DNA extraction method was taught to some of us. Aicha Ait Soussand and Ellen van der Schoot of the Experimental Immunohematology group of Sanquin helped us by explaining how they work with small fragments and DNA extraction and gave us access to their optimized extraction protocol used with the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit. Since isolation of fragmented cell free DNA out of blood and white blood cells can be quite a hard challenge because of the low concentrations, the experience of Sanquin helped a lot in optimizing our DNA extraction method. In addition, they pointed at the delay in red blood cell development, which gave us the idea to extend our model to include the whole process of gene doping and its effect.
Targeted Sequencing
Professor on Therapeutic Gene Modulation Hidde Haisma gave us insight in the most attractive methods for athletes for gene doping. Also, he gave us information on the detection possibilities for gene doping, for example the presence of exon-exon junctions due to the removal of introns, a distinct promotor for increased expression and viral vectors to penetrate into the human cells. Furthermore, he inspired us with his research in whole genome sequencing for gene doping detection and his limitations concerning data analysis. Reducing our data output for less complicated data analysis became one of our requirements for our gene doping detection method.
“I expect athletes that would be using gene doping now to use either plasmids or adenoviruses as vectors.”
Alina Ham, Gerard Coyne and Angelica Vittori from Oxford Nanopore Technologies inspired us to adapt our initial idea, which would involve detection of target sequences based on dCas9-affinity and subsequent nanopore blocking. The forces exerted by the motor protein were suggested to overcome dCas9 affinity, and were most likely to push off the DNA-binding protein. This important advice made us change our project from a detection method based on signal absence towards a methodology striving for targeted sequencing.
Fusion Protein for Targeted Sequencing and Library Preparation
The idea for our fusion protein came through several phases. We read about Zinc finger and Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), but wanted to improve on the versatility to anticipate the plethora of changes that could be made to the genes used as gene doping. Therefore, we came up with a Cas9 based protein with a flexible guide RNA library after elaborate discussions with amongst others prof. Stan Brouns. Later, during a presentation at the Delft Health Initiative, CRISPR experts"

Outreach overview
Soon after starting our project we came to the conclusion that it is of high importance to on the one hand promote our project to the public through many channels and on the other hand also to gain knowledge about certain aspects related to our project. Our promotion therefore involved a press release, which lead to numerous newspaper articles, radio interviews, a television report, several public lectures at schools and at university establishments, a postcard exchange involving a cooperation with several other German iGEM teams and a broad social media appearance.
To acquire more knowledge about aspects of our project, we had talks with experts of different fields, we visited the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, the 5th Information Day about Cancer and conducted a public survey.
In more detail, parts of our outreach were…
Human Practice: Education in Public
The postcard campaign we started, that involves several other german teams.
An info booth and two lectures during the NRW day, which celebrated the anniversary of our state’s founding, where we showed simple experiments to wake people’s interest in biology.
Two radio interviews, one with our local campus radio station and one with the Deutschlandfunk, a nation-wide radio station.
A TV report aired on three different TV stations.
Several lectures at local schools in front of Senior students who focused on biology.
The participation in the Heine Slam, a cross-faculty competition at the Heinrich-Heine-University, similar to poetry slam.
Learning more about the actual research in Jülich.
Integrated Human Practice
A visit at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, including a tour through their facilities, and a telephone conversation with experts from the PEI.
A public lecture at the “Haus der Universität”, where admission-free public lectures are held on a regular basis.
We Skyped with a true expert for optogenetics and cancer.
We attended the 5th Information Day about Cancer at the “Haus der Universität”, where we learned a lot about the progress that was made in cancer treatment therapy.

Team Profile
The DTU iGEM team 2014 is an ambitious team consisting of 11 graduate students, five advisors and three main supervisors with a total of seven different nationalities. We share a deep interest in chemistry, biology and biotechnology and work dedicatedly in the cross-disciplinary environment of iGEM. Our group possesses a unique combination of valuable competences, comprising skills in molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling, scientific programming, project management, entrepreneurship as well as scientific and non-scientific communication. Combined our team has a keen interest in state-of-the-art biotechnology and is eager to contribute to the field of synthetic biology.
Fun is fundamental. There is no way around it. You absolutely must have fun. Without fun, there is no enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, there is no energy. Without energy, there are only shades of gray.
- Doug Hall
To create and maintain a dynamic group and enjoyable working atmosphere as well as to keep up our enthusiasm when sitting inside a laboratory when getting snap-chatted by friends on the beach, we of course also went out sunbathing and swimming, enjoyed some cold beers, traditional Danish dinners, and delicious ice creams during the summer.

Successful implementation of the Lung Ranger and the L.A.S.S.O. could provide quantifiable benefits to the CF community, the National Health Service and the 'UK PLC'. These themes are explored here .
A Wiki Page for Everyone… Not Only the iGEM Community
In gratitude for the generous contributions of our friends at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, we thought it was a fitting tribute to design our Wiki page with them firmly in mind. We feel that the artistic design of our Wiki, (our thanks go to Avril, iGEM Alumna), targets a different audience. If those affected by CF and the wider public can learn about the potential of synthetic biology to improve lives, here on our Wiki page, then we believe they are more likely to engage in discussions about how to ensure the technology is used responsibly. Going into the future this is essential in maintaining the integrity of the field.
We had Fun Raising Money for CF Charities
It’s not all serious. We raised money for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust charity by having a bake sale, (the cakes were delicious!) and raising sponsorship money by taking part in a 10K and Half Marathon run. Roddy’s knees no longer function as joints BUT he did work off the cakes. Take a look at some pictures from these events here .
Cystic Fibrosis Trust Conference
News of The Lung Ranger spread quickly in the local community, and we were thrilled to be invited to present at the UK Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Manchester. This national conference saw leading experts in Cystic Fibrosis research, clinicians, and funding agencies gather to discuss novel treatments and national concerns relating to CF.
Gillian and Jenny from the team highlighted the use of Synthetic Biology as a novel, viable and powerful option for CF management and care. Our project had also addressed key points highlighted by directors and researchers of the CF Trust, including; managing digital data, personalizing care and ‘Putting the patient voice at the heart of CF care’ (Oli Raynor, Special Adviser, Research & Patient Involvement at Cystic Fibrosis Trust).
It was clear from the feedback that we were attempting to address an unmet clinical need, and this was further evidenced when we received messages on social media from people watching online.
Clinic Visits
From the offset we visited our local CF clinic in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, as well as making visits to Western General in Edinburgh. Patients were extremely generous with their time, sharing what it was like living with CF, the biggest day to day challenges they faced and"

Following the CBD, we added a FLAG tag, Lumio tag, and His tag for protein presence verification, extraction, and purification. Finally, a double terminator was included before the biobrick suffix to insure termination of transcription.

Figure 8: BBa_K2027009 , Control Sequence Peptide (P601) for Melanin Binding (Nonpolar-Protic)
Results/Future Directions
Although the 4D Melanin Binding Peptide was the only construct we were able to purify with a Cellulose Binding Domain and a Flag-Lumio-His-Tag, we were determined to increase the radiation resistant properties of our materials. Since cellulose has been a common proof of concept materials to plug into with our chromoproteins and FQ sensor, we decided to build off the work of previous iGEM groups by further validating the cellulose binding domain in a new application. The Cellulose-Melanin 4D linker was incubated with melanin in ethanol since melanin is a relatively insoluble compound. The mixture was then coated on cellulose sheets (and glass filter paper for a control). This linker protein could help serve as a coating for other materials like elastin and latex down the road. We acknowledge the tradeoff in mass necessary to provide enough UV protection; however, dealing with the radiation is an unmet need in both ballooning and space applications, so any steps in the right direction are promising.
Figure 7: Melanin attached to Cellulose Paper.
Figure 8: Melanin coated filter paper left under UV light for a week to test integrity of Melanin under prolonged radiation exposure.
In order to simulated our UV protected material under the harsh conditions of space, we used the NASA Ames Solar Simulator which uses up to 1300W of power to provide radiation comparable to UV bursts during solar flares. Likewise, we wanted to interrogate the long-term UV exposure effects on materials, so we place our melanin bound cellulose filter paper under our lab's hood's UV lamp for one week.
To test the efficacy of our melanin linker, we washed each sheet with water three days after the initial attachment to the cellulose sheet and collected the runoff. In theory, since"

(b) Parallel (OR)
This design utilizes two redundant toxin regulating branches (find design here ). Being connected by an OR gate,                 this provides a backup mechanism in case one branch is disabled through mutations. The result can be found in figure 2.
Figure 2. The modeled Parallel (OR) kill switch with biologically correct                 parameters. The first two subplots show the two abstract inducers’                 concentrations \(I_a\) and \(I_b\). The second inducer, \(I_b\), is kept on after                 release to resemble a destroyed kill switch through mutations. The blue curve in the                 last subplot shows the toxin expression with both branches working properly while                 the dashed green line with branch b deactivated. Since both concentrations are                 well above the threshold \(\theta\), the kill switch is in its ON state in both cases.
(c) Serial
The Serial kill switch design is simulated (find design here ). Figure 3 shows the kill switch typical behavior.
Figure 3. The modeled Serial kill switch with inducer in the upper                 subplot and the toxin in the lower subplot. The toxin threshold is                 exceeded such that the kill switch is in its ON state after the inducer                 having been turned off.
Since this design introduces a longer serial cascade than the BNU China 2014 design, the delay between inducer deactivation and                 toxin expression is longer.
(d) Parallel (AND)
A parallel design that connects both branches with an AND gate is studied (find design here ). Figure 4                 shows that both branches need to be functional to trigger the kill switch's ON state.
Figure 4. Simulated Parallel (AND) kill switch. The subplots are equivalent to the one shown in                 figure 2. Artificially deactivating a branch leads to a                 kill switch remaining in its OFF state. A single branch                 does not regulate the toxin.
As evident from figure 4, the deactivation of one of the two branches leads to the kill switch being in the OFF state permanently - thus,                 the branches are indeed linked by an AND gate.
2. Evolutionary stability
For different incubation times and mutation rates, the escape probability of the BNU China 2014 kill switch design is studied.                 Figure 5 shows the results from which two intuitive results are confirmed:
The higher the mutation rate, the larger the escape probability: As the likelihood for a mutation to occur increases, the                 probability of the linear cascade to be destroyed through one of these mutations increases as well.
Longer incubation times lead to higher escape probabilities: This is"

Lab safety
Safety
Large signs around the lab help to  caution those that aren't familiar.
Over-grown mutated E. coli strains potentially develop harmful unknown genes
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher Safety?
The WashU team is working primarily with common, harmless chemicals. In addition, the researchers have been trained in proper handling of chemicals for hazardous chemicals such as Ethidium Bromide. For each such chemical, the team has read and followed appropriate safety protocols to ensure the continued health of the team. In all necessary instances, nitrile gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles are used as a further safety precaution. Additionally, all work with volatile chemicals is carried out in a fume hood. Overall, though, the chemicals that the team deals with on a daily basis are relatively harmless and can be handled by any researcher with ease.
Public Safety?
All researchers in the WashU team have been trained in applicable lab safety and sterile techniques to ensure that no one inadvertently releases bacteria into the environment. In any case, all bacteria are maintained in cell cultures. The products we extracted from the bacteria, safranal and crocin, are safe to work with. There is no danger to the public from the work that the team does in the lab.
Environmental Safety?
All harmful chemicals that we work with are disposed of in compliance with local and federal Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) standards. The EHS disposes of these harmful chemicals in a way that is least deleterious to the environment.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our new BioBrick parts raise any significant safety issues given that they are genes found commonly in Crocus sativus and Arabidopsis thaliana. None of the new BioBrick parts should provide any advantages in transformed bacteria as compared with wild type bacteria. Therefore these parts should be very safe to use and manipulate.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes.
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The local EHS division is active on the Washington University campus. The entire"

Table 1 The statistics of questionnaire
Fig 3 Serious heavy metal pollution in water considered by respondents.
(There are totally 8 choice questions.)
There are three main conclusions
1.  Water pollution is serious and of concern: More than 45% respondents both in China and western countries think they are contaminants in the local water and over 68% of them care about the water pollution. These results shows that it is high time to detect and treat the heavy metal pollution in water. And that is the goal and meaning of our project.
Fig 4A
Fig 4B
Fig 4C
Fig 4D
2.Chemical detection and Biological detection are known by more people than physical methods.
Fig 5a
Fig 5b
Most people have heard of chemical detection, while more people are aware of biological detection in several developed countries outside China, which indicated with the development of society, people prefer convenient, environment friendly and cheap biological detection.
3. Although most people agree with using modified microbes to treat contamination, they are unsure how they can be used. With so many people, over 70% of the respondents, accepting biological treatment of heavy metal pollution in water, it is possible for us to promote our device to the public. Meanwhile, since there are still many who don’t know about biological treatment, it is a rather important thing for us to spread related knowledge about modified microbes for pollution treatment.
Public Education
We also devised some interesting and educational activities. We showed our ideas about our detecting system ‘micro holmes’ to the public and handed out some booklets to help them know more about water health. There is no doubt that the highlight of our public education is field experimentation, which attracted a lot of people. The live demonstration experiment is easy but useful and interesting, and is a novel approach to public education in iGEM.
Here are more details about our public education.
On the first day of the May Day holiday, a sea of people visited the zoo. Our team, LZU-China, seized this opportunity to do our human practice, informing people of basic facts about water, which helps the citizens develop a healthy habit of using water. By the way, we also spread some information about how to detect pollutants in water and the basic knowledge of Microbial Fuel Cell.

Max Zhou
Biological Engineering '19
“How do you even cast a gel” -Max Zhou, June 27th, 2017 5:19 AM. A junior studying Biological Engineering from Brooklyn, NY, Max Zhou is a true renaissance man. His hands a blur, he effortlessly configures a camera and filter setup and plants some radishes, all while wiping away his tears at another failed PCR. While already an accomplished programmer and chess grandmaster at the tender age of 20, Max’s real goal in life is to perfect his signature seventeen spice blend. Legend has it that upon adding the sixteenth spice, Max was ambushed by hitmen sent by a paranoid Colonel Sanders; the details of the encounter are unclear but the fact remains that no KFC restaurants are located near Cornell. Guided by his singular mission to achieve what no human has ever accomplished and take his rightful place in the pantheon of culinary greats, Max distracts himself with iGEM, Science Olympiad, and agriculture in the meantime.

Chemical Engineering '20
Rahul Rambhatla La Land isn't just another grown man on the team. He's often regarded as a father figure. Some on the team may even go so far as to call him a dad, or even daddy. Just look at his daylong five o'clock shadow. As a Chemical Engineering major, Rahul is one of the smartest and most hardworking members of the team, often found slaving over laboratory protocols so old and outdated they match the year on his favorite types of drinks. Not only that, he is also dashingly handsome, vocally obsessed with Superoxide Dismutase, and should be considered mildly insane, based on his alb work. Why insane you may ask? As the old cliche goes, insanity is characterized as performing the same action over and over again, each time expecting a different result. Rahul is most definitely clinically insane. However, he is a true joy to work with in a lab setting, as his positive energy nullifies and often reverses the utter pain and suffering that comes out of failed laboratory work.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the internal phosphodiester bond of DNA and/or RNA and this leads to their degradation. Bacterial endonucleases are also called restriction enzymes. In contrast to Exonucleases multiple nucleotides arise (Nishinoet al.2002) (Figure 1).
Vibrio cholerae, like V. natriegens, is able to pick up DNA from the environment. However, most of the DNA is degraded by the nucleases secreted by the microbial community. Some transformable material is mostly available and can be taken up by naturally competent cells. V. cholerae has two extracellular nucleases: xds and dns. It has been shown for V. cholerae that the transformation efficiency greatly increases when the two extracellular nucleases are knocked out. Thus, the DNA to be transformed into the organism is no longer degraded (Blokeschet al.2008) .     In order to build a cloning strain of V. natriegens, it is also very important to knock out the nucleases. Otherwise, the DNAses would digest the DNA and it would not be possible to transform DNA.
RecA
Figure 2:Functionality of recA. 1) RecA bind single-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. 2) RecA recognizes homologous regions between the donor strand and a recipient molecules. 3) There is an exchange between the two strands held by recA. 4) The homologous single-stranded DNA fragment was integrated.
The enzyme RecA is present in many bacteria. It is an ATPase that mediates homologous recombination. Homologous recombination is important for genetic diversity and genomic integrity (Chenet al.2008) . The role of the allosterically regulated protein in this process is to detect the homologous sequence in a variety of heterologous sequences (Saviret al.2010) . RecA - bound to ATP - can make a complex with single-stranded DNA. This helical filament can bind to double-stranded DNA, search homologies, and then catalyze the exchange of the homologous strand (Chenet al.2008) . In addition, recA has another function. It has a co-protease function in the bacterial SOS response system being responsible for cleavage of LexA and the λ-repressor (Horiiet al.1981) . Because you do not want to have a chromosome integration or homologous recombination in a Cloning strain, this gene is mutated in the E"

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," out into nature. This risk is reduced by lowering the viability of the bacteria like described before. A risk of gene transfer with other bacteria cannot be ruled out absolutely and therefore a small possibility exists that in a worst case new pathogen germs can develop. It would be a train wreck, if these pathogenic bacteria were also able to degrade fatty acids. Imagine such an organism in human gut. This fiction is one reason why a release of the bacteria into nature is not desirable. Consequences for humans and animals are not appreciable.  New possibilities arise when bacteria can be used low-risk and successful in sewage treatment. If the technique works with PET maybe it can also be used to eliminate other substances like hormones, medicaments or other toxins from drinking water. This means higher possibilities of human promotion.
b). Social orientation
What kind of social consequences will occur when a non natural synthesized bacteria is inserted into the ecosystem? First of all is there a difference between organisms which are engineered by synthetic biology and those manipulated with conventional biotechnology? Since 1977 human insulin is produced by bacteria (Porro (2011) and since thousands of years organisms are used for producing foodstuff like beer, cheese or wine. These organisms were cultivated over years to show the optimal results. „A concrete contentual distinction between synthetic biology and other existing fields in science and technique is not easy. One reason is that these fields are historically related“(Boldt (2008)). Compared to conventional biotechnology in which new enzymes are inserted into existing bacteria, in synthetic biology the goal is to easily manipulate even metabolic pathways and signal cascades via biobricks. In the actual case, where we look at the results of the team of the TU Darmstadt, a bacteria is engineered for the degradation and metabolization of  PET. It seems that engineered, planned organisms are manageable but there can be no 100% safety. Mutations and adaptations are essential parts of what we call life and they do not disappear when new creatures are built (Saint-Ruf (2006)). In synthetic biology new combinations of biobricks are possible. First simulated in computer models there are no borders for creativity. By generating new possibilities on a creative and creationistic scope synthetic biology enriches society. Options seem to be limitless and visions known as science fiction become realistic. Mankind can now make the old dream real of being a creator of nature and will use this new option to optimize natural processes after their interests and goals. It is not so that man was not manipulating the world around him before but now it comes to a new dimension. The manipulator becomes the creator and diverges"

Ethical issues in synthetic biology
An introduction to the main ethical issues in synthetic biology and an explanation of why reductionism in biology raises ethical concerns.
Introduction
The marriage between technologies in molecular and cellular biology together with genetic and chemical engineering gave life to a new phenomenon called synthetic biology. Since then, a lot of ethical questions were raised. Although the definition of synthetic biology is not yet clear and future implications are yet uncertain, research in the field of synthetic biology is at its peak. Different articles claim that synthetic biology is the answer to curing cancer and the production of bio-fuel, and several leading universities assembled specific departments for this field of research. An OpenWetware created by the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, gives free access to a large registry of BioBricks: basic “ready to use” biological machinery components. The most important resource for these BioBricks comes from the annual iGEM (international genetically engineered machine) competition, in which teams of students can compete on building the best microorganism machine by combining, describing, implementing and/or designing these biological standardized parts.

Definition
Although the term has been abundantly used for almost a decade, there is no consensus on a definition for synthetic biology. Different practical approaches to synthetic biology research and engineering emanate from different disciplines, resulting in an intangible characterization. An attempt by the European Commission to describe synthetic biology resulted in partial acknowledgement by the scientific community. The EC tried to reflect how synthetic biology differs from other emerging technologies and focused on constructing of artificial life forms with use of engineering principles applicable in biology. Their working definition of synthetic biology is as follows:
“Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biological components and systems that do not exist in nature and the re-engineering of existing biological elements; it is determined on the intentional design of artificial biological systems, rather than on the understanding of natural biology” ( EC, 2005 ).

Key Takeaways
A larger percentage of people in Stony Brook claim they know what synthetic biology is compared to people in Ithaca. This relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.01).
A larger percentage of people in both Stony Brook and Ithaca believe that synthetic biology/genetic engineering has a positive impact on the world.
However, many people still believe that synthetic biology should be limited to certain areas in future science.
There is a negative perception of the term GMO compared to the term synthetic biology. This reveals that there is a stigma against the phrase “genetically modified organism” even if the idea of synthetic biology is actually not opposed.
Demographics do not significantly affect perceptions of synthetic biology.
LAB TOURS AND SYMPOSIUMS
RAWExpo
RAWExpo is an annual event at Cornell meant to showcase the work of creators in all disciplines. iGEM attended and shared our work engineering life through synthetic biology. At our display we showcased last year’s project and discussed our ideas for this year’s project. The dialogue among other groups of creators in the Cornell community, ranging from engineers building planes to design students creating fashion lines to architecture students designing structures, was beneficial for our team, and helped us more thoroughly consider the users of our project and the aesthetics of the final deliverables of our work.
Makerfaire
Makerfaire is a symposium where different groups display the innovative ideas and creations they have come up with, often applying the principles of engineering. Among airplanes, cars, and model architectural structures, we showed others how to create with biological tools. We talked to visitors about the possibilities that synthetic biology could bring to reality. We discussed the types of techniques that could be used, such as cloning and CRISPR-Cas9, and also explained our past and present projects as tangible examples of what synthetic biology could accomplish. Makerfaire was a wonderful place to showcase synthetic biology’s ability to push boundaries and its increasing role in the society, both of which iGEM encompasses.
Society for Women Engineers Lab Tour
Despite huge progress over the past decades, women still struggle to advance in several fields of engineering. The Cornell Society of Women Engineers organized a way for high school women to connect with Cornell engineering students.

This behavior has been observed in the activity plot of the positive control TVEL0 before, indicating, that the oxidation catalyzed by this laccase seems is reversible. Additionally, protein concentrations of each fraction were identified using the Bradford protocol. The four tested fractions showed approximately the same amount of protein after rebuffering, namely 0.5 mg mL-1. Fraction 4, containing the most protein and also most of active laccase was chosen for subsequent activity tests of BPUL. The protein concentration was reduced to 0.03 mg mL-1 for each measured sample to allow a comparison between TVEL0 measurements and BPUL measurements.
Figure 11: BPUL laccase activity measured in 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL at 25°C over a time period of 3.5 hours. Each tested fraction reveals activity reaching the saturation after 15 minutes with ~60 µM ABTSox after 0.4 mM CuCl2 incubation. (n=4)
BPUL pH optimum
Note: The experimental setup for the pH acticity assay was not well chosen. The buffering capacity of sodium acetate buffer is restricted to a smaller pH range than used in this experiment. The activity assay was optimized after the Regionals in Amsterdam to ensure correct measurements and values.
To determine at which pH the BPUL laccase has its optimum in activity, a gradient of sodium acetate buffer pHs was prepared. Starting with pH 1 to pH 9 BPUL activity was tested using the described conditions above and 0.03 mg mL-1 protein. The results are shown in Figure 12. A distinct pH optimum can be seen at pH 5. The saturation is reached after 3 hours with 50% oxidization of ABTS through the BPUL laccase at pH 5 (55 µM oxidized ABTS). The other tested pHs only led to a oxidation of 18% of added ABTS. Figure 13 represents the negative control showing the oxidation of ABTS through 0.4 mM CuCl2 at the chosen pHs. The highest increase in oxidized ABTS can be seen at a pH of 5. After 5 hours 15% ABTS are oxidized only through CuCl2. Nevertheless this result does not have an impact"
Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Model#IntegrationQS_-_-_TEXT.html," the wet-lab experiments, we developed a mathematical model of our quorum sensing system. In the model, certain parameters resulted in behavior qualitatively similar to our wet-lab results. We identified parameter sets that were able to qualitatively produce the desired wet-lab results (Video 1). The leaky expression of LuxI resulted in fluorescence despite the fact that LuxI production was never induced.

Video 1: The left window shows the cells in orange and the signaling molecule AHL in blue. On the right is visualized produced fluorescence. The animation starts at t=55 and ends at t=120. The duration of the complete simulation was 150 time units.
The parameter space showed the important role of certain parameters in preventing spontaneous auto-activation.
From model simulations, we found that a low rate of cellular AHL degradation is associated with spontaneous auto-activation. A potential method of controlling this parameter in the wet-lab is to use the enzyme aiiA, capable of degrading AHL. The role of using aiiA to combat leaky expression has been explored by previous iGEM teams; for example, ETH Zurich.”.
We first explored the effect of adding aiiA to our spatiotemporal model . Reaction rates for aiiA were added to the model and parameter sets that resulted in spontaneous lysis were simulated (Video 2). This demonstrates that aiiA can prevent fluorescence from being generated in the absence of GFP while still maintaining the generation of fluorescence in the presence of antigen.

Video 2: Fluorescence produced by the original system (top) versus the system with aiiA included (bottom). On the right side is shown the system induced with antigen. On the left, the system in the absence of antigen.
We were able to tune the kinetic parameters of aiiA so that aiiA would prevent spontaneous auto-activation caused by leaky expression while not preventing the detection of low levels of AHL produced by neighboring cells (Table 1).
Table 1: A system with negatively regulation of LuxR that self-activated spontaneously was modified by adding aiiA or increasing the degradation rate of LuxR, resulting in the desired behavior.

With Ginkgo’s pioneering work, we wondered about the concomitant growing pains within the company. One interesting problem was the lack of visibility in understanding the regulatory standards surrounding biotechnology, especially commercial industries. Ms. Chuang delineated that most of their work was situated at the intermediate position in the production of a product, that their yeast strains were not the final product and so were not subject to the same regulatory guidelines. This informed us of the need for defining more visible guidelines for safe and responsible synthetic biology, as a the field grows, so will the need for the public arena to engage synbio comprehensively.
Another takeaway was Ginkgo’s framing of the field of synthetic biology. Because it is so young, Ms. Chuang stated that it is difficult to define exactly what synthetic biology encompasses. However, one way to look at the field is its ways of translating the principles of computer science into equivalent ways we engineer and ‘code’ organisms, by using predetermined building blocks to create emergent properties not possible otherwise. The most immediate way we saw to apply this was to our outreach, through communicating what synthetic biology truly is to the public and to educate, especially the students, on the relevant building blocks of synthetic biology. This became part of the inspiration for our plasmid education kit endeavor.
With these new insights, we saw correlations from their large scale operations to our small but ambitious mission in Oscillate. This helped inform how we perceive regulations and the growth of our project in the long run, and how we are to frame synthetic biology to the public and to ourselves as scientist and engineers.
To Product
The possibilities with Oscillate are boundless. As we developed our frequency-dependent genetic circuit and discussed it with researchers from around the world, we heard about so many exciting potential applications for Oscillate. What follows are a list of these application suggestions:
Dr. Hasan Baig, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Habib University in Karachi, Pakistan, suggested we use Oscillate to perform cellular computations within a desired period of time. In this way, cellular computations would mimic digital computations. Dr. Baig even suggested we use tools that he developed to analyze our genetic logic gate.
Dr. Guillaume Lambert, The Gordon Lankton Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow in the Applied and Engineering Physics Department at Cornell University, had many suggestions. Some of his suggestions include using Oscillate in co-culturing and differential control of complex microbiomes.

The design of our limiter incorporates multiple transcription factors, each binding specifically to certain promoters, often in combination with others.  To achieve this precise orchestration of our control elements, we employ a synthetic system of transcription factors, each binding to distinct operator sites which can be combined to provide an enormous variety of transcriptional control.

The Power of Standardized Modularity
To make the engineering of biology easier, synthetic biologists devote considerable attention towards the standardization of parts and of practice.  The inspiration for such a focus stems from similar concepts in engineering, which depends upon well-characterized components for the design of complex systems with predictable and reliable behavior.  As such, the iGEM competition makes use of the Biobrick standard, an idempotent approach to cloning recombinant DNA.  The Biobrick standard constitutes a conserved sequence of four restriction enzyme cut sites that envelop a genetic part, whether it be a coding gene, a promoter, or some other functional piece of DNA.  According to the process of Standard Assembly, one can then ligate two such parts together after following a formulaic scheme of restriction digest reactions.  The end result is a linking of two two genetic parts bounded by the same four restriction sites in a reproducible fashion.  Such a system facilitates the pairing of two parts, allowing for the creation of endless combinations while constructing a device.
As a slight deviation from this system, our synthetic transcription factors were designed according to the Biofusion standard, which was developed by the Silver lab at Harvard University.  Biofusion parts have an identical arrangement of restriction digest sites relative to the part, with one exception.
Intrinsic to the Biobrick standard is the placement of a single nucleotide between the part and each of its adjacent restriction sites, namely XbaI and SpeI.  The nucleotides are intended to act as spacers to protect the part from enzyme cleavage.  When two Biobrick parts are ligated together according to the Standard Assembly,"

--CS-- /--BRK--Today we tried to get started but realized that we actually didn’t have anything that we needed. Dr. Grose could not find any P. aeruginosa PAO1 here at BYU, so we sent an email to Dr. Romesberg at The Scripps Institute requesting DNA from them. We also discovered that the antibiotic plasmid BioBricks that we need to transform are actually not in the iGEM kits that we already have, so we sent emails to the teams that submitted them last year to try to acquire the plasmids from them.

--CS-- Today we sent out some more emails to people regarding P. aeruginosa PAO1 DNA samples. Since we hadn’t heard anything from Dr. Romesberg, I sent an email to Stephen Lory at Harvard (www.pseudomonas.com says that he is the go-to guy for P. aeruginosa PAO1 samples) and Bri sent one to somebody else. Julie and I also wrote descriptions of our primers on the BYU database spreadsheet that Dr. Grose sent us. Bri also contacted the iGEM Registry people to try to track down the antibiotic BioBricks we need.

Governing Guidelines
We looked into the guidelines reported in the Public Health Agency of Canada when looking at working with blood. Per the Canadian Biosafety Standards, there are no issues working with animal blood in a control level I lab since the blood is not being introduced to any human pathogens or any specimen that is at a higher risk level. Any work done in the lab should still be treated with good microbiological lab practices (Canada & Agency, 2016). The Canadian Food Inspection Agency does not have any stipulations about working with animal blood use in a lab or transportation within Canada (Branch, 2015). Guidelines may be different depending on the country you live in and should be looked into before working with blood in your lab.
Safety Considerations
When working with pigs blood and/or cells in the lab, we practiced extreme caution in order to ensure the safety of our fellow team members and advisors. The safety precautions that  we followed included, wearing all the proper personal protection equipment (lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses). We also ensured the proper disposal and cleaning of lab equipment that came in contact with the pigs blood: petri dishes, pipette tips, volumetric pipette tips, paper towels and glass containment vessels used to transport the blood, using biohazard bags as a primary means of storage until loaded into an autoclave. After using mechanical equipment and lab space, we take time to make sure the equipment and lab bench is properly cleaned and sterilized with a 12.5% bleach solution followed afterwards by a 70% Ethanol solution rinse of the surrounding area. Upon reception of the blood in the sealed glass vessel the containers were surrounded by plastic bags and then placed into either a styrofoam transport container or a cardboard container. Once in the lab the glass container was removed inside a fume hood along with pouring of the initial blood solution in the fume hood.

We tested different amounts of transfected pPCMV_mGMK:TK30 DNA, different concentrations of ganciclovir and different time periods after the addition of ganciclovir to find the optimal conditions where our pCMV_mGMK:TK30-transfected cells would be most efficiently killed while the untransfected cells would be left unharmed. We monitored pPCMV_mGMK:TK30-transfected ganciclovir-treated cells under a light microscope and discovered that as little as 40 hours of incubation with higher concentrations of ganciclovir (>30 µg/ml) is enough to kill over 50 % of our pPCMV-mGMK:TK30-transfected cells. After 65 hours of incubation with ganciclovir there was a decrease in cell number and survival already at low concentrations of ganciclovir (1 µg/ml). We showed that the HSV-TK/GCV system successfully kills cells even at low amounts of transfected mGMK:TK30 and upon addition of relatively low concentrations of ganciclovir (5 µg/ml).
We determined the number of viable cells after ganciclovir treatment by staining the cells with Trypan Blue (to distinguish between living and dead cells) and counting them. After 6 days of incubation with ganciclovir, the cytotoxic effect could be seen when only 1 µg/ml ganciclovir was added to pPCMV_mGMK:TK30 transfected cells while untransfected cells remained unharmed. The number of viable cells decreased to <10 % when 10 µg/ml ganciclovir was added. These results demonstrate that our safety mechanism is effective even at low doses of ganciclovir, where only therapeutic cells are killed while other cells are left unharmed.

Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," knowledge between researchers and the public may lead to complications and possibly make the public reluctant to trust scientific research. It is therefore very important to try to reduce the gap of knowledge between the groups. A good way of doing this is to have informative events that are attractive to all areas of society. In an effort to reach out to the community and inform others about the endless possibilities within synthetic biology, our team spoke at an event hosted by the board of the Uppsala iGEM community. The event is a yearly lunch conference called SynBio Hour. The first part of the event was a presentation introducing synthetic biology and iGEM. Following that introduction we presented our project. There were over 100 people attending the event and the audience ranged from students with no prior knowledge about synthetic biology to iGEM alumni. We also reached out to the student body at our university by speaking at the annual Student Conference of Science and Technology. This conference is an interdisciplinary event where students from different fields speak about interesting research. We presented iGEM and our project to the audience of over 100 students. Furthermore, we reached out to the biohacker community Makerspace in Stockholm. They were curious about our method of making microfluidic chips so we sent them manuals and guides explaining our method. They also received the CAD designs for our chips. The Makerspace organization provides a basic lab for people that are interested in biology but do not have formal education.
Our various presentations and our collaboration with Makerspace helped us reach out to the community and perhaps helped to make the gap between science and the public a bit smaller.

Primary selection of virA variants with novel binding properties
After the determination of the MIC the screening for virA variants with new binding properties could be started. The aim of this screening is to find versions of virA that can be induced by one of the tested substances capsaicin, homovanillic acid, dopamine and 3-O methyldopamine.
For that purpose one should transform the mutagenised variants of virA to E. coli and plate the bacteria on LB-agar with the determined kanamycin concentration. At the same time a mixture of all mentioned substances should be present in the agar. All bacteria including a virA variant that is activated by at least one of the substances will grow on the selective agar, since it expresses the kanamycin resistance. With this step it is thereby possible to select thousands of bacteria with unwanted versions of virA from few individuals with wanted binding properties.
At this point it must be mentioned that some grown colonies might still be non-induced and false positive results. As the virA gene has been randomly changed before, it is possible that some variants occur where the receptor is always active. This would lead to a constitutive expression of the reporter gene and thereby a high level of kanamycin resistance. To exclude those false positive clones, the bacteria should be tested whether they are only resistance to the MIC of kanamycin when one of the tested substances is present. Every colony that can withstand the high kanamycin concentration without any inductor includes a constitutive version of virA and should be discarded in further analysis.
Quantitative analysis of virA variants after induction with novel substances
Should we find some bacteria that respond to the presence of the tested substances (capsaicin, homovanillic acid, dopamine and 3-O methyldopamine) by growing on the MIC of kanamycin, it is desirable to quantify the induction. For that purpose it is appropriate to change the read out system from kanamycin resistence to luciferase expression. This complex and time consuming task can easily be achieved without any cloning step, when using the advantage of our two plasmid system.
After primary selection each bacteria includes two plasmids with different origins of replication (oris). The plasmid with the virA is in a common <partinfo>pSB1AT3</partinfo> backbone with a ColE1 ori. Contrary to that the read out plasmid with KanR has a special ori, named R6K, which can only amplify in E. coli strains that express the gene pir to produce the so called Pir"

Of course, controllability can only be improved when completely understanding the process and its consequences.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," use directed evolution coupled with FACS selection.   By implementing genes for the conversion of
3HPA
into succinate, we lead our product back to the central metabolism. By deleting all other genes responsible for succinate production, the cells are forced to use the
3HPA
bypass to get succinate, which is needed in the TCA cycle.   The big advantage of using V. natriegens for that purpose is that it’s short doubling time increases the number of cell divisions per time and thereby increases the number of mutations in a given time frame.   Coupled with our biosensors and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) we can easily and rapidly select for cells performing the most efficient pathways.   Additionally to mutation-guided evolution there are many genome modifications which could increase flow towards
3HPA
, for instance by downregulation of side reactions. In the Directed Evolution section of our metabolic engineering design, a list of possible genome modifications is shown.    By using
MAGE
, it is possible to get a library of different genome modifications, which can then be selected via FACS for their efficiency to produce
3HPA
or succinate.
MAGE
stands for multiplex automated genome engineering and is a technique to create combinatorial genome modifications.
MAGE
uses a set of oligos, which get transformed into a population of cells and then integrate into the chromosome via homologous recombination.   Different cells in the population will have different numbers and combinations of modifications leading to a genomic diversity. By applying
MAGE
in combination with FACS for our pathway we get a huge variety of possible pathway optimizations which can be sorted via FACS based on their efficiency.
Applications of our workflow
By using V. natriegens as a chassis for metabolic engineering, it is possible to build, test and optimize pathways and enzymes at a high-throughput level.   The Marburg Collection enables the fast construction of pathway libraries, while the genetic accessibility of the strain makes genome modification and pathway integration simple.   The usage of our biosensors for screening of malonyl-CoA and
3HPA
accelerates identification of the best pathway variants and the short doubling time coupled with the high nutrient uptake rate empowers V. natriegens to be the perfect chassis for metabolic and enzyme engineering!

Measurement
BioBrick
BBa_K381001 was first used by team BCCS-Bristol in iGEM 2010. This part encodes nitrate and nitrite sensitive promoter PyeaR with a GFP coding device and B0030 to create a nitrate-sensitive system which signals through expression of GFP. In 2010, the team BCCS-Bristol used it to sense the nitrate concentration in soil. Yet, our team think this part can do more than that. This year, our team decided to create a whole new measurement system for sensing the nitrate level in aquaculture water by using this part.
How dose it work ? Lyophilized E. coli powder ?
The nitrate in water will activate PyeaR promoter and lead to expression of GFP. We realize that liquid broth E. coli doesn’t work well in this system, having to wait for a long-time period to get the value, which is not accepted by fish farmers because a sudden increase of nitrate level will lead to the dead of the whole pool in an instant. Therefore, instead of liquid broth, we choose lyophilized E. coli powder as our platform. When water pumped into the cuvette, activity of lyophilized E. coli recovered and showed corresponding fluorescence intensity along with different nitrate level in merely 20 minutes. Comparing to 4 hours detection time in broth process, the time cost of lyophilized E. coli powder decreases dramatically.
Figure 1 . The lyophilized E. coli powder
Nitrate Sensor
The BioBrick alone is not enough to create a fully functional measurement system, a sensing device is also one of the key element to perfect the system. After doing some research, we self-assembled a portable GFP sensing device.
Figure 2 . Our idea of sensing the GFP expressed by the lyophilized E. coli powder
The Mechanism
The value of fluorescence is detected by our sensing device and recorded as voltage form. By cross-matching our data base and modelling results with voltage signal detected by device, we can evaluate the nitrate level in water accurately to 1 ppm interval. In a relatively short time period, 20 minutes , our users are able to know the nitrate level of the pond via our app.

Advantages
Compared with the spectrophotometer in the lab, our sensing device is smaller, more portable and less energy consumed."
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," derepressed and red colored bacteria will be observed with production of RFP. After showing stability of TnrA-pAlst sytem by using the RFP fluorescence protein, Toehold-TEV protease will be replaced with RFP for binding to AND gate system.
QS dependent promoter pLsr
There are two promoters on LsrR’s operon Lsr . these promoters are called LsrA and LsrR, and they are repressed in the absence of AI-2. The location LsrR binds on these promoters(p-lsr-Box)  are shown below. Dark ones indicate the common sequences in both promoters. We preferred to use lsR promoter as it is one of ATOMS Team’s parts in 2013.
FIGURE 5:LsrR-binding site recognition and regulatory characteristics in Escherichia Coli AI-2 quorum sensing (Ting Xue, Liping Zhao, Haipeng Sun, Xianxuan Zhou and Baolin Sun).
We aimed to show repression of LsrR protein on pLsr promoter and dereppession of it in the presence of AI-2. For this purpose, we gathered LsrR protein gene sequence and pLsr sequence on the same biobrick. We put RFP as a reporter in front of pLsr promoter. To produce th repressor protein Lsr in a high amount, we put LsrR-pLsr-RFP gene sequence in front of J23100 constutive promoter .  We added RFC prefix on 3’end , RFC suffix on 5’ end of  LsrR-pLsr-RFP gene sequence.
LsrABCD operon, which makes AI-2 getting into the cell, already present in E.coli; so it is expected to be enough when an AI-2 sensing promoter system placed into E. coli. Thereby under the absence of AI-2, Lsr promoter will be heavily repressed by LsrR protein. If Quorum Sensing molecule sensed successfully AI-2 will be phosphorylated and LsrR’s suppression on pLsr will disappear. Thus RFP expression will occur.
We chose to use the part J23100-LsrR-pLsR-RFP(BBa_K1202108) as 2013 ATOMS IGEM TEAM designed. After showing LsrR-pLsrR system’s stability by using RFP, Trigger RNA will be replaced with RFP to connect the inputs to the And gate system.

Suggested methods were shearing cells, French press and chemically breaking cells.
We need to also think about how we could collect the fragrance.  Suggested methods were gas chromatography but it was pointed out that this would be expensive on an industrial scale.
More research needs to be done in this area before Boston.

UiOslo_Norway,2014,Team:UiOslo Norway#Safety#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,", environmental ethics and research ethics. For our project the category referred to as research ethics will be of the bigger relevance as it is significant to be able to relay science in a proper way.
In research ethics there are six main problems that can have major implications. These are:
Not telling the whole story
As in withholding information, usually negative fallouts when publishing research results.
Example:  Not revealing results from clinical studies that have a negative outcome for the hypothesis which could be the expected or unexpected effects of a for example of new drug substance.
Exaggerating the story
By either letting on more than what is actually true or enhancing the results by implying the results are greater than they are.
Repeating the story
As in using the same material and results several times to substantiate a hypothesis.
Plagiarizing (Telling someone else’s story)
Plagiarizing means to use the work of others and claim it as your own.  This can be done both deliberately and unintentionally.
Telling another story all together
As in tell a story that is neither the story to be told nor a story agreed upon by all parties.
A good example is: We had an interview with our student newspaper called Universitas. For this article we were talking about iGEM, and our work. However when the article was released it was titled ""Frykter bioterror trussel"". In English this title means ""Fearing bioterror threat"". (See: Media )
Conduct unbecoming
This problem is very rare and most institutions have a code of conduct upon which the employees, students and others associated with the institutions are obligated to follow.
No matter how tempting it is to commit these types of wrongdoings, the repercussions for oneself and the research community are enormous.
Therefore the keyword in research ethics should be transparency. It is through transparency and cooperation that these problems no longer pose a threat to the research environments credibility.  As we, the UiOslo_Norway team have tried to do. Yet, when transparency can lead to misunderstanding and false accusations, the ethical reasoning behind transparency start to diminish.
Ethics in synthetic biology  (Deplazes et al., 2010)
First it’s important to define what a GMO is when we talk about bioethics. This is a term that has been used many times, also in contexts where terms such as substance modifications would have been better. GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism and had been heavily debated for more than 20 or so years. The use of GMO has been especially controversial when it comes to its use as food for"

Human Practices
In the ""Talking life"" project we did not only want to speak with bacteria, but we also wanted to speak with humans! The HP practices team identified some ethical and social issues that were relevant to our project. We wanted to  communicate such issues and discuss them with a broader peer community, with scientists and other citizens. We made a movie that we used as a vehicle to communicate those issues and to trigger public debate. Slide along the timeline to know the steps we followed in the course of our HP exercise:
If you are fond of our work on Human Practices, download our Ethical issues diary here !
Talking Life
Click here to watch the 10 minute film that we made in collaboration with Artefactando. We also acted in the movie and used it in our debates. Based on real ethical concerns but in the form of a fictional story. We envisaged a possible future applications for our talking bacterial cultures and we used the movie to generate debate. The movie initiates debate around three ethical issues: Could we use talking bacteria to care for others? Who should own living technologies? If bacteria can speak, can they also lie?
The film was projected and debated five times: (1) France (Banyuls) to an audience of scientific European students, (2) Norway (Bergen), in front of a group of sociologists and ethics, (3) Barcelona, to a heterogeneous group of students and workers, (4) Valencia, in the cultural center named “Octubre” to a scientific public from professors and doctors to undergraduate students, and (5) in the scientific Campus of University of Valencia to a wide biology-related student audience.

Biobricking Primer Designer
At the beginning of the summer our Wetware comrades were faced with the challenge of designing primers for over 50 future biobricks. In order to aid them, and of course future iGEMers, we developed a command line tool for creating primer sequences suitable for biobricking under RFC23 - the Silver Standard. The wetware team used this tool at the beginning of the summer and said it was 'indispensable'. This program affects human practices of synthetic biology by facilitating the construction of biobrick part design and construction.
The code for this program is available on the iGEM Software github repo: NYC SOFTWARE REPO
We are also working toward incorporating this primer designer into a web-based utility so you wont have to download it to use it. At the time of the wiki freeze we do not have this online, but check This Location to see our progress.
Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.

In the previous iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element. As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine. To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our target consumer and real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.
We designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project. To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts. Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd (the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China) right after we finished our original plan. In later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice to improve our project. On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
After we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them are still fans of sweetness which makes people feel happy and warm. According to what we found，there is an excellent opportunity for us to research the sweeteners. Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that been observed already.
We mainly have two questions:
Which sweetener do you prefer?
What are your interesting features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew that people might be more acceptable to natural sweet"

Team Training and Project Start
Stanford University is well equipped for synthetic biology work, as an undergraduate Bioengineering program with several lab courses exists in full force. Brown University offers a Synthetic Biology Course every other year taught by Gary Wessel. We alternated between using Dr. Lynn Rothschild's lab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the open-resource Uytengsu Teaching Center in Stanford's Shriram Center for Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering. Most of the members on the Stanford side of the team became acquainted with bioengineering lab work through BIOE44 (Fundamentals for Engineering Biology Lab). This course is generally taken as a sophomore, and some of our team members took it during the fall quarter of 2015-2016 (9/21/2015-12/11/2015). Materials for this course, such as the syllabus, are readily available online: here is an example from 2014.
Our team had brainstorming meetings and cross-continental team Skype sessions beginning in March 2016, where we stitched together rough subprojects and the overall theme of bioballoon. Our work in the lab did not start until the"

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Translate_-_-_TEXT.html," allows for applications in fields beyond healthcare, such as agriculture. RNAi can be used to improve the nutritional value of crops and bioremediation potential. Engineering pathways in plants can be improved by increasing anabolic pathways while decreasing catabolic pathways for the desired end products (Tang and Galili, 2004). For example, the flavenoid and carotenoid contents of tomato plants can be increased by silencing the DET1 gene (Davulrui GR et al 2005). RNAi can also be used to improve bioremediation of contaminated areas. The accumulation of arsenic in the shoots of Arabidopsis plants was increased by up to 16 times by silencing the arsenate reductase gene (Dhankher et al 2005). Silencing arsenate reductase in the shoots allows greater mobility for arsenic to move from the roots into the shoot tissues.
Improving bacterial conjugation
Greater opportunities for the transfer of specific genes through a bacterial population could result from improved conjugation efficiency. In bioremediation,  conjugation can be used to restore contaminated environmental areas. Many plasmids are able to provide additional metabolic capabilities to bacteria, and can therefore recipient bacteria to have enhanced abilities for the degradation of contaminants (Top Springael and Boon 2002). The ability to transfer genes from donor cells to indigenous microorganisms via conjugation allows increases survival of the indigenous microorganisms, and also increases their ability to degrade contaminants (Ikuma and Gunsch 2012). This was suggested in a Pseudomonas species in Antarctica that has acquired the ability to degrade polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as phenanthrene and naphthalene (Ma, Wang and Shao 2006).
Pharmaceutical Industry
Waterloo iGEM’s project findings lead could to the future development of a drug that can treat MRSA infections. With the production of a new drug, the pharmaceutical industry has a new product on the market with a comparative advantage over existing MRSA treatments, and this product would subsequently be useful to healthcare workers.
Healthcare
MRSA quickly emerged as a deadly pathogen in intensive care units after methicillin was used as an antimicrobial agent in the 1960s (David & Daum, 2010). Since MRSA is prevalent in healthcare facilities such as hospitals and clinics, healthcare workers would be interested in Waterloo iGEM’s solution to eliminate MRSA. If a drug or disinfectant is eventually developed, the technology can be applied to treat patients and clean facilities.
Although most individuals get MRSA infections"

Oxygenation
      For proper growth, each chamber needs a constant flow of oxygen. A four-channel variable aquarium oxygen pump, inside the apparatus base, oxygenates the Cyanobacteria and E. coli. Each chamber is fed from the bottom through two lines, check valves were installed to prevent the bacteria from draining down the tubing into the oxygen pump. On the top of the base is the adjustment knob to control the oxygen flow. Hand blown glass bubblers, made from borosilicate glass, were attached to the top of each chamber to allow proper venting without releasing the bacteria out.
Illumination
     In order for photosynthesis to take place some sort of artificial light is necessary. Two T5 14W fluorescent bulbs, each connected to a slider that allows them to be independently adjusted to vary the amount of light as needed in the Cyanobacteria chamber.
Controller
      The base is constructed of 6 panels of 6061 aluminum tig(GTAW) welded together. Its dimensions are approximately sixteen inches long, fourteen inches wide, and three inches tall. All electrical switches and wiring are inside with the oxygen pump and rings stand base to keep bacteria out and make it easier to clean.

“Fellowship” is one of the words that widely represents the iGEM competition. Thus, we                         created a Facebook and a WhatsApp group for the Latin American iGEM community. This groups                         represented an opportunity to, first of all, know each other's project, and of course,                         troubleshoot about all kinds of issues and look for solutions together. Finally, the teams                         arranged collaborations to enhance the projects and strengthen the bonds between nations                         and present a united front.
IGEM UNESP Brazil
While developing a project involving synthetic biology you need to consider how is it going                         to be received in other countries, focusing mainly on local regulations. That is why Brazil                         asked for our help, in order for them to visualize how their genetically modified                         probiotics would be seen here in Mexico. Thus, we provided them with a report about how in                         Mexico this type of GMOs are a big taboo and there is a lack of regulation about them.
And also, during the realization of our project, we needed to know how burn injuries are                         seen and treated in other countries. Therefore, UNESP BRAZIL team did an amazing work                         making this report universal.
