Digital  Display:
Today  went smoothly, except for the plates of the previous day. We cannot figure out  why no colonies could be observed in some plates, while others grew well.  Competence cells were made in the same time. Wang looked up all the possible  reasons and was perturbed about the competence cells she made and  transformation procedure. To find where the problem is, she did a positive  control using the remained competence cells.  If the positive control does not produce the expected result, there may  be something wrong with the experimental procedure, and the experiment is  repeated.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  prepare NaCS.
Result:  After 66min's reaction, we didn't completely squeeze out all the reaction  liquid from the reacted linters, therefore the subsequent processes were  impeded. At last we didn't get proper production.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.3-luxI-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The transformation of RBS1.0-luxI-TT,  RBS0.6-luxI-TT, RBS0.3-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT, RBS0.01-luxI-TT and  RBS1.0-luxR-TT were failed before,  we do  the ligation again. Cause RBS0.3 was stored at -20℃, we only isolate plasmids of luxI-TT.
The  transformation of RBS0.6-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT and RBS0.3-luxI-TT were  failed.
Design:
Other  drafts were finished. Other details of the uniform had been sure.

Monday,  August 13th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Another  sad day for the lab. No colonies can be observed in the transformation plate  except for positive control. If the problem was not competence BL21 or  transformation process, ligation is to blame for the failure. For another part,  isolated plasmid and digest for restriction analysis. The electrophoresis photo  indicated the failure of ligation. Since the part get longer, there is a great  chance of unsuccessful ligation.
Wang  found water has leaked into some plates preserved close to the wall of the 4°C  refrigerator. It seemed that"

Introduction
We help USTC Wet Team identify the kinetic parameters in pConX2+LuxR+pLux/Tet+GFP device. The completion of this model are a result of collaboration. With the permission from both teams, we share the source code of this description page together
pConX2+LuxR+pLux/Tet+GFP
Parts:
Reactions and ODE
A Simplified Model
We employed an ODE model. We defined the input to be AHLout the and the output to be the synthesis rate of mature GFP. In this system,we assumed the concentration of the LuxR was constant.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S2-4), (Recation S2-5) and (Recation S2-6) were considered to be able to get balance in a very short time.
From above equations, we can the change of PoPS respond to the AHLin.
For this system, the value of parameter d, 0.00847, could be estimated based on the measurement of the OD. For instance, when the concentration of AHLout was zero, the value of d was 0.00368 per minute. The values of 4.8E-3 per sec for rmG, 1.8E-3 per sec for a and 0.4 per sec for pG were got from the experiment conducted by Barry Canton and Anna Labno in 2004, click here to the details.
Identification Results
With the help of USTC Wet Team , we succeeded to estimate the values of k3, rAHLin, C1, C2, C3 and C4. The simulation results as follows.
Parameters
k3=0.8; rAHL=0.001; C1=1.5*10^(-10); C2=1*10^(10); C3=8*10^(-7); C4=5.8*10^(11"

Mercury disposal in the environment
Currently, Brazilian legislation is regarding to the levels of metals released into the environment, but not to the laws on the handling of toxic metals such as Mercury. Besides the error in the use of mercury in terms of quantity, there is another contradiction of laws related to the regulation since the national legislation which governs the drinking water is the Ministry of Health and the one to rule over the aquatic environmental systems is the National Environmental Council (CONAMA).
Based on CONAMA N° 357, March 17th, 2005, the classification of waters is valid for the entire national territory. The classification is done in 9 classes, and the resolution separates fresh water (salinity < 0.05 %) in five types: Special Class and Class 1 to 4, in which the restrictions impurities decrease as the number of the class increases. Saline waters are classified as Class 5 and 6, and brackish waters are Class 7 and 8. The resolution also determines the maximum allowable levels for effluent discharge into the waters, except for special class of waters that cannot receive releases wastewater as it is intended for domestic supply and should be absent of coliforms. For Class 1, the maximum mercury content allowed is 0.2 mg/L for Class 2 is 2 mg/L, for Classes 5 to 7 is 0.1 mg/L, and for other classes there’s no maximum levels specified.
For other waterbody (class 1-8), which are neither the sub-surface nor special class, is tolerated dumps that meet the specifications of maximum (Hg = 0.01 mg/L) and has a maximum flow of 1.5 times of the activity average daily period of agent launcher, as soon as they do not exceed the limits set for their classes. Thus, legislation allows a higher concentration in the effluent than in the waterbody, believing that there is dilution of which was released. However, it is known that there are many sources of pollution that contains the same harmful substance that discharge"

Designing SdiA to be Specific for Cholera
In the beginning our plan was to transform into E.coli the most essential parts of the V.cholerae quorum sensing system. This was done, but our response proteins GFP and RFP did not work as expected.Shown above are colonies that were not supposed to be glowing. So we decided to try mutating the quorum sensing system E.coli already has such that it senses only CAI-1 which is an auto-inducer specific to V.cholerae. The following is a schematic of our approach.
Below is a T coffee alignment of SdiA (E.coli protein involved in quorum sensing response) and CqsS (receptor protein in V.cholerae that can only sense CAI-1). It was found that the amino acids corresponding to the binding pocket for auto-inducers of both proteins lined up in the alignment indicating a similar structure. We hypothesized that if the five amino acids in SdiA that are known to be important in autoinducer molecule binding were changed we could make SdiA a more specific receptor instead of a promiscuous one. According to our alignment two of the five amino acids were already the same between SdiA and CqsS (black arrows). The other three amino acids we decided to change in SdiA through site directed mutagenesis to be the same as CqsS (blue arrows).
Biofilm Inhibition by α-Amylase and Dispersin B
The enzymatic activity of α-Amylase was characterized to determine its capacity to inhibit biofilm formation by V. cholerae. Samples were prepared by adding 50 µL of V. cholerae culture to 1 mL of a high salt LB. The samples were then treated by the addition of purified α-Amylase in various concentrations and allowed to incubate at 30°C for 48 hours. After 48 hours the samples were examined and a distinct difference was seen in the amount of biofilm formed in the treated and untreated samples.
The samples were then transferred to eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for two minutes, the supernatant was discarded to remove the growth media, and the samples were resuspended in 200 µL ddH2O. The samples were then stained with 50 µL of a 0.03% CV"
USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ISPR spacers, which is quite                                 similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms. Cas9, which is                                 CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme                                 associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from * Streptococcus pyogenes* and                                 other bacteria. It has been showed that Cas9 plays an important role in memorizing,                                 interrogating and ultimately cleaving these foreign DNA. Mechanism of cleavage is to                                 unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief). When the recognition result turns to yes,                                 Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA. Nowadays, with proper modification, CRISPR/Cas9 has                                 become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.
When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve                                 recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA. In general, gRNA consists of 2                                 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary                                 to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at                                 the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene. And the latter part is a secondary                                 structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9. During engineered                                 section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to                                 take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.

Goal: To amplify the Gaussia Luciferase DNA using PCR
1a. Conduct a Gaussia Luciferase experiment where we resuspended the DNA using this protocol:
20µl of water into the 200ng tubes
Use 5µl in PCR
1b. Primers
10µl of stock with 90µl H20 → 10µM
2. Then we did a Phusion PCR using the following measurements:
6.15.15
Goal:To PCR amplify the PelB Gaussia DNA and test the competence of competent cells.
Checked to see if the gel sizes were correct.
We split PelB PCR into two tubes of 25µl each for digestion because we eluted with 50µl of H20 during PCR purification instead of 30µl. That’s why for digest we added 3.2µl of buffer and 2 of each enzyme.
If so, then did digestion for PCR product
2µl of each enzyme: Xba1 & PST (Can also use EcoRI instead of Xbal)
3.2µl of buffer
No water because volume is too large (from PCR)
Put digestion pieces into new gel to extract out separated DNA
1:1 binding buffer on gel extraction (PCR purification)
Digested the backbone (101A) using the same enzymes
Digestion
14µl of 101A backbone
2µl of buffer
2µl of each enzyme (xba1 & pst1)
Gel Extraction (Cut out 2000 bp band). However because we were very confused, we cut out the incorrect band
Gel purification
Ligation
4:4 ratio
1µl buffer
1µl ligase
However we were only suppose to do a 2µl : 2µl  ratio of digestion product : insert to backbone
Transformation
50µl  competent cells (our competent cells)
5µl of ligation but it should have been the entire 10µl of ligation ("

We would like to start with thanking Markus Linder, the primary PI of our project. He has been there for us right from the start, introducing us to the ways of iGEM and guiding us through the brainstorming and initial research stages. He helped us get in touch with experts and also arranged for some of our funding. We held weekly meetings with him almost during the whole project and got valuable advice on many matters. During different stages of the project we had several ideas on which direction to proceed in - he helped us recognize the more important things to focus on. He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain"

In samples 4 and 5 the astrocytes are treated with medium from microglia cell culture grown in astrocyte medium with LPS for 24 and 48 hours, respectively. We expect very bold, thick bands as well. The band may be weaker than samples 2 and 3, since the microglia are not grown in their native medium and therefore may not survive as well leading to lower cytokine secretion.

Introduction
   For every woman killed by TB, there are two men. Our review of the literature on gender bias and tuberculosis can be found here . If a disease can be biased, what about ourselves? iGEM? Synthetic biology? Gender bias in science may appear in different forms. Gender balance varies by discipline, by job title, by age or by region. Only 30% of researchers in Europe are women, while 92% of French university deans are men.
Hisorically, gender bias has affected the lives of scientists and the practice of science. However, assessing gender bias today in a living community is very difficult. History, stereotypes, limits of the disciplines, and the simple lack of data can prevent us, the synthetic biologists, from thinking about our own relationship to gender.
Most of those issues should not apply in synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is a new field. The argument of the heritage of some habits cannot be made. It is a"

Utah_State,2008,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," operon for amplification.  Five PCR targets were promoter sequences:  5’phaCproF/ATG R, 5’phaCproF/SD R, 5’phaCproF/TC R, -35F/ATG R, and -35F/TC R.  Four PCR targets were from phaCAB gene complex:  phaC, phaA, phaB, and phaCAB.  A variety of annealing temperatures and Mg++ concentrations were tried, and it was found that 60˚C annealing temperature and 12% (v/v) Mg++ concentration were optimal.  Two sets of primers were used:  those without the BioBrick prefix and suffix attached and those with them already attached.  The use of the PCR conditions just described enabled the use of the latter, saving subsequent ligations from needing to be done.  Such PCR reactions were successful with all of the promoter regions and the phaB gene.
PCR Primers
Two sets of primers were created for PCR – those containing the prefix and suffix restriction sites and those without the prefix and suffix.  The primers with the prefix and suffix already attached were designed to save subsequent ligations of the prefix and suffix from needing to be done.  The primers without the prefix and suffix had greater affinity to the DNA template than those with them because of the absence of non-binding segments.
The figure below illustrates the greater binding affinity for primers without the prefix and suffix.
Vector Selection
Two plasmids were primarily used during the course of the project – pSB1A3 and pSB3K3.  pSB1A3 is an ampicillin-resistant plasmid, 2157 base pairs long,  that was used as the vector for all submitted BioBricks.  pSB3K3 is a Kanamycin-resistant plasmid, 2750 base pairs long,  that was used for promoter testing in accordance with the iGEM promoter- testing protocol.
Gel Electrophoresis
DNA gel electrophoresis, 1% w/v agarose, was used for analysis of PCR products, digested plasmid, and ligation constructs.  The cross-linked matrix formed by agarose gel separates DNA by size when an electrical field is created across the gel.  DNA migrates toward the positive electrical anode by electromotive force because of the natural negative charge of the DNA’s phosphate-sugar backbone. Ethidium bromide and Sybr Green dyes selectively bind"

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

We can see from figure 10 that when the concentration of L-arabinose is 50000μM, the inducible expression of reporter protein regulated by the FourU element cultured is significantly higher than the group cultured at 37°C, and there is almost in difference between the two temperature in the positive control. The inducible inducible mRFP expression with RNAT-fourU element shows a repaid response to temperature changes from 30°C to 37°C.   According to the result, we could use this inducible plasmid with different concentration of L-arabinose to simulate different interaction strength of ligand and receptor. And this induction experiment for simulation is undergoing.

Protein Production
Overview
The E.ncapsulator has been designed to produce and deliver protein biopharmaceuticals to the intestine. Module 1 encompasses the protein production phase of the system. The E.ncapsulator is engineered to allow the production of any protein or polypeptide.
Rationale
In order to perform this function successfuly, the polypeptide (amino acid polymer) must be synthesised at a rate that will be sufficient to facilitate its accumulation inside the cytoplasm of the cell. With our generic design, it is possible to synthesise any polypeptide, so we have a thoroughly reusable system.
  About the difference between enzymes and peptides.
Theory
Engineering a cell to produce a protein
DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is in turn translated into protein. By knowing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of interest, we work backwards and convert this into a DNA sequence coding for production of the protein.
In our case this has been developed further by optimising the DNA sequence for E.coli. By combining this coding sequence the other necessary genetic components, we can engineer the chassis to manufacture the protein.
Genetic circuit
This is the remaining part of the Module 1 genetic circuit
  About the genetic circuit
Polypeptide Showcase
To demonstrate The E.ncapsulator's versatility, we have chosen to showcase it with both enzymes and peptides. These two classes of polypeptide have very different properties that we have considered and catered for in The E.ncapsulator's design.

Gel of our PCR product that we sent out for sequencing.
They looked good, so we sent them out for sequencing.  Hopefully we will have our final OZ control plasmids for tomorrow.
Practice Plate resuspension
We resuspended the practice plate oligos in 40 ul of water to produce a 100 uM solution, taking 10 ul of the final solutions into 90 ul of water in separate tubes to create 10 uM working concentrations.  When we receive our tag primers, we should be able to test the presence of the oligos in each tube as well as amplify them in preparation for integration into the expression plasmids.
Colony finalization
For the colonies that we plated yesterday, we saw that the plates all had good growth on them and so we wrapped the plates in parafilm and put them at 4 degrees for storage.  1/1000 ul from saturated culture seems to be a good amount to plate.

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#CloneWars_-_-_TEXT.html," the plasmids that contain them.
Integration into Plasmid Backbone
Starting from the standard iGEM plasmids (pSB1C3, pSB1A3), we need to introduce restriction sites into a non-coding, non-regulating sequence in the backbone that will allow us to clone our finished constructs (possibly one of each kind) into the backbone. Since we want to create RFC compatible plasmids, we have to use non-RFC restriction enzymes for that.
We decided to use ApaI, BamHI and HindIII for this, as they are easily available to us.  To find the best possible positions for the insertion of new restriction sites, we used a python script (see here ). This allowed us to find the position in the backbone where the lowest number of mutations would be necessary for any combination of two of the three enzymes in all non-annotated (as analysed by SnapGene, see fig. 3) sequences in both plasmids.  The sequence we selected for mutation is located between replication origin and the antibiotic resistance gene. The wild type sequence GGGGTCtgACGCTC can be mutated to the target sequence GGGCCCtgAAGCTT by changing the for bases marked in the oiriginal sequence. Thereby the restriction sites for ApaI and HindIII are introduced.    This allows us now to insert any combination of a negative selection cassette and plasmid purification cassette into the mutated backbones, that have the additional restriction sites.
Plasmid maps of pSB1A3 (A), pSB1C3 (C) and the mutant plasmids (B and D, respectively) containing new restriction sites to include the kill cassettes and/or zinc fingers.

We tested three different 3D printer materials concerning their stability in solvents which could be used during the linking reaction of biotin to a 3D-printed microchip. After two hours incubation of the materials in the solvents, we observed that all the materials were either completely dissolved or were very soft to the touch (see fig. 4). Since we could not leave out piperidin in the coupling reaction, we had to re-think on better alternatives for coupling our biotin. The Intavis AG in Tuebingen helped us out by giving us a derivatized  cellulose membrane, originally used for their SPOT synthesis, which stay stable during the coupling process. Sadly, due to time problems, we could not test the coupling of biotin to the"

A substance that specifically binds to an antibody is called an antigen,                     hence the name allergens for antigens that binds to the antibodies that initiate the cascade of                     immunological events causing an allergic reaction.17 The most prevalent allergen in peanuts is Ara h                     1, which is the substance detected by an antibody complex in LiU iGEM:s peanut detector.
   The survey showed that allergens are rather common knowledge.
There is a correlation between the severity of the allergic reaction and the amount of                     allergens.
True: Which symptoms that evolve during an allergic reaction depends on                     where in the body the histamine is released. Histamine is a hormone that has a key role in the                     cascade of events included in an allergic reaction and is released in response to allergens binding                     to IgE antibodies. A larger amount allergens thus increases the amount of histamines released and                     higher concentrations of histamine affect tissues in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and                     blood vessels, causing the more severe symptoms.18
There are several documented deaths upon peanut intake.
True: Peanut allergy is not the most common food allergy, approximately 2                     % of the world population, but it is the food allergy that causes the most number of deaths due to                     anaphylaxis.19 About 80% of the fatal anaphylaxis cases is caused by peanut or tree nut allergies.20
There are several documented life-threatening allergic reactions caused by airborne peanut                     allergy.
False: According to Magnus Wickman, a professor at Karolinska Institutet                     and children’s allergolog at the Sachsska children’s hospital in Stockholm, are there are no                     documented life-threatening allergic reactions caused by airborne allergens from peanuts or tree                     nuts known in the international society of specialized allergolists.15 LiU iGEM has not been able to                     find any situations that contradict this statement.                     Unlike what many may think food allergens are not gases that spread interminably in the air. Food                     allergens are small particles,"

Know your enemy; improving public awareness of biosciences
Summary
Advantages and Limitations
Executive Summary
During the past years, biotechnology in Latin America has been growing quickly. Different technologies have been developed or introduced. However, it currently faces constraints that limit its social acceptance, mainly due to a lack or distortion of available information to decision makers and general public. Usually, people that do not study the subject know about technologies and advances of biosciences from what they see in the media, and this information is not always from reliable sources. Also, the establishment of laws and regulations has been delaying the development of biotechnology in Latin America
Education plays an important role in the development of awareness about science development.
What people learn in education centres, such as school and universities, influence a lot in their perception about biotechnology development; especially when they believe that it is or not correct. Biotechnology in Latin America has been carried out through the development of genetic modified organisms (GMO’s). Honduras is one of the few countries that allow GMOs to be commercial released for production and consumption, thanks to the appropriate laws and regulations in the country. However, population is not well informed about biotechnology and its applications. Our team was interested in evaluating and determining the perception that undergraduate students have about biotechnology and GMO’s and the Honduran regulatory process for approving products derived from genetic engineering through a survey.
We were interesting in the public perception of students about biotechnology. We focused the investigation into determining the different public perceptions between students from our university, which has an agricultural background and that in its activities use GMO´s, and students from other universities in Honduras.  We determined a relationship between education and perception, and the acceptance that people have about biotechnology and synthetic biology. In order to apply this concept to the Honduran context, we coordinated and conducted education and information activities with children and youth through basic biotechnology practices.
Through the main philosophy of our University, learning by doing, we developed theoretical-practical sessions for each group of students. Children have interacted with DNA extraction experiments, learned more about the applications and implications of biotechnology, future prospects of the science and introduced some synthetic biology concepts. Advanced practices were conducted with elementary students, where they had the opportunity to practice with real synthetic biology applications.

Gel separation and DNA isolation of digested pSB1C3 and mutated dCas9, transformation of ligation product, amplification of mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3
Goal:
Separation of DNA fragments on gel
Gel digestion and DNA isolation of dCas9 and pSB1C3
Transformation of ligation product
Amplify mutated dCas9 and linear pSB1C3
Procedure:
Gel electrophoresis:
Enzymatically digested pdCas9 and pSB1C3 (prepared from yesterday - 23.09.2018) were separated on gel green at 90 V for 45 min.
Gel digestion and DNA isolation:
The desired fragments of dCas9 and backbone were cut out from the gel. The DNA fragments were further isolated by following after the same procedure fromn02.07.2018.
Transformation of ligation product into competent cells:
Heat inactivate the ligase at 65 ℃ for 20 min Transform 5 μL of ligation product into competent cells by following the protocol from 25.06.2018 P.S. The fragments were not separated on gel before ligation (after so many times of failure to isolate DNA from gel…), wrong insert or re-ligation of pdCas9 fragments may occur… so inoculate more colonies and store one of the plates sealed with parafilm in the fridge.
Amplify mutated pdCas9 and pSB1C3:
PCR mix for amplification of pdCas9 and pSB1C3 were prepared by mixing:
pdCas9: 0.5 μL template (PCII, 65.8 ng/ μL), 6 μL FWD GA1 primer, 6 μL REV GA3 primer, 12.5 μL Takara HiFi PCR premix.
This sample was amplified in a PCR machine with an annealing temperature at 55 ℃ for 10 s, and an elongation temperature at 72 ℃ for 7 min.
pSB1C3: 1 μL template (linear pSB1C3, 25 ng/ μL), 6 μL FWD primer, 6 μL REV primer, 12.5 μL Takara HiFi PCR premix.
The sample of pSB1C3 ran in a PCR machine with an annealing temperature at 55 ℃ for 10s, and an elongation temperature 72 ℃ for 2 min.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#LindaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," this lunch break, I went back to trying to fix my code. This afternoon was very frustrating, because the problem why the javascipts aren’t working is not because of the code, but because I needed to export it onto the server and publish it. And I didn’t figure this out till I was out of ideas and I went to my mentor for help. Man, I shouldn’t asked help a lot earlier.
July 13: Solved the problem
So I figured out that my problem is actually the software that I am programming on. I can’t seem to publish my project on Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows 8, because it doesn’t have the function. But Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web does. So I download that other version, but I realized that the code is written in ASP instead of HTML5. Though both codes are relatively similar, the syntax is still slightly different. So either I need to convert all the code that I’ve been working on to this new language, or hopefully I can find a better way of doing it.
Other than that, I got the front page/ pictures working!
July 16: Website going live
I finally go the website to go live. It was a lot easier than I thought. No need whatsoever publish program stuff. Just put it on the server (at the right place- which I had trouble with, of course). I thought I had to download another program and write it in a different language, but I didn’t actually have to. So here it is, live, meaning you can access it at cs.wellesley.edu/~hcilab/UI. I made it!!
Here’s what it looks like.
For tomorrow, I need to write a cgi script for this website. In english, this means that I need to write a program that will grab information from the web dynamically and put it into the datasheet/ template that I have. Currenlty, the program is grabbing info from a textfile, having a cgi script will make the program more flexible.
July 17: cgi, work please!
cgi stuff, doesn’t work. why?? is it because the settings are wrong?
I ended up having to stay in late, so I missed my Ultimate Frisbee game. Bummer.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#FRED#Prototype_-_-_TEXT.html," to be interpreted by the user.
This year, we significantly improved the design and function of the potentiostat. We also designed and developed hardware for housing the circuitry and samples, as well as a software package for controlling the hardware and analyzing the data. We have also created a standard protocol for how to build and use a system such as this. Download our walkthrough here. You can also download the needed code here and here.
The Potentiostat
Figure 1: From validating the breadboarded circuit, to making the final circuit, to assembling the prototype.
A potentiostat is an electrical circuit used to conduct eletroanalytical experimentation to study redox reactions. It controls a three electrode system by changing the voltage difference between two of the electrodes, the working electrode and counter electrode. The third electrode is the reference electrode, that acts as a virtual zero voltage against which all voltage values are measured. The potentiostat will then record the current produced at the working electrode. Common experiments that use potentiostats are cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic runs .
FRED needs a potentiostat to be able to talk to us, however traditional laboratory potentiostats have a few significant drawbacks:
Expense: Commercial potentiostats often cost thousands of dollars, with some costing over fifty thousand dollars
Size: Although newer models are smaller (and more costly), most commercial potentiostats are large and heavy pieces of hardware
Immobility: In addition to being very bulky, most commercial potentiostats require a 120 V power outlet and are not designed for portability
In order for our biosensor to be viable for use in the field (e.g., samples in/around Alberta's oil sands tailings ponds) we needed it to be inexpensive, small, and portable. This led us to investigate the possibility of assembling our own customized potentiostat. We came across a paper (Gopinath and Russel, 2006) that described a simple, inexpensive design for a three-electrode potentiostat. This informed the design of last year’s potentiostat circuit which achieved portability through the use of 9 V batteries, but was limited in its function. This year, we made many upgrades: we tweaked the circuit to run in our desired -2 V -> +2 V sweeping range, added hardware filters to eliminate noise in our readings, implemented a variable dip switch for changing resistors values to alter measurement sensitivity, and had it milled onto a compact and durable circuit board with a diameter of only "

Most importantly, the results demonstrate that most participants will accept the information that life is fully reducible. Further research should indicate how the general public feels about these issues. Properties like special, magical or sacred are arbitrary and in this respect lack a specific definition. As fairly indicated, sacredness and purely biochemical properties do not have to be mutually exclusive properties.
Graph 12-1.
12. I accept that God's hand is involved in life
Please indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much you agree on this.
The graph shows one outstanding bar, representing a 44% chunk of the group that does not accept that God has a hand in life. An additional 16% leans toward denying that God has a hand in life. 22% (4,5,6,7) is not sure whether or not they agree with the statement and a minority of 19% does accept God's hand in life.
Graph 13-1.
13. I believe that life is holy/sacred
Please indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much you agree on this.
In contrast to the previous question, the statement saying that life is holy/scared is answered more diversely. The group that has a tendency of rejecting the statement is equally big as the group that embraces it (both 36%). A relatively large group of 28% does not have a particular view on the holiness or sacredness of life and sticks to the middle.
Even though the majority of the group does not think that God has a hand in life, the believe that life is holy/sacred is still very much divided, which indicates that there is not a necessary relation between the existence of a God and sacred or holy properties of life.
Graph 14-1.
14. I think that the properties of biological systems can be explained by their reducible subsystems
Please indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much you agree on this.
This topic has been the red thread through out the survey. This question should give a direct answer to how the scientific community perceives the capabilities and the prospects of the reductionist approach.
There is a plurality of 43% that is strongly leaning towards believing that the properties of biological systems can (some day) be explained by their reducible subsystems. A very big group of 42% is not yet sure what to expect, while a minority of 14 % has a more holistic point of view and believes that there is more to living systems than just it's subsystems.

Interlaboratory Measurement Collaboration
In light of this year’s Interlab study, we wanted to further assist this                     initiative by conducting an Interlab study of our own by measuring the                     constructs we have designed. We wanted to investigate whether stabilized                     promoters would reduce variability in interlaboratory fluorescence                     measurements exhibited by engineered genetic constructs across different                     laboratories. (Jake et al.)
Fluctuations observed in plasmid copy number are caused by small changes in                     the cell’s environment as well as the cell itself. For example, differences                     in growth temperature and growth medium composition affect the copy number                     of plasmids. Such variations may be more apparent between labs (e.g.                     differences in lab equipment, handling), becoming a major hindrance in                     scientific research.
The measurement protocol was the same as the one performed for the plate                     reader measurements in this years interlab study. There were 4 Test                     Devices:
TD1 and TD2 contained pupsp1 and pupsp2, two constitutive promoters                             .
TD3 and TD4 contained TALEsp1 stabilized pupsp1 and TALEsp2 stabilized pupsp2 promoters.
Due to the fact that the teams that took part in our Interlaboratory                     Measurement had, also, participated in the iGEM Interlaboratory                     Measurement, so they provided us with the interlab negative control and                     calibration data.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#15 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," transform DH5-alpha E. coli cells.
Today's work will involve the team looking for transformant colonies on the plates and processing them based on observations. If there are colonies, 12 will be picked and used to inoculate 12 tubes of 5ml LB (+ antibiotic) for mini-preps. If unsuccessful, another attempt at ligation and then transformation will follow. The team will also carry out digests of the 5 midi-preps we had done earlier to prove that they have the correct DNA.
Practical Outline
Here are the tasks the Metal Sensing team need to get done by the end of the day:
Check plates for cotC-GFP-smtA transformants and arsR-cadA AND gate transformants
If successful prepare for mini-preps by picking 12 colonies and using them to inoculate 12 tubes of 5ml LB
If unsuccessful, reattempt ligations and transformations in E. coli cells.
Digest the 5 midi-prep samples (cotC-GFP-smtA, kinA, pGFP-rrnB, pMUTIN4 and pSB1AT3) to ensure the DNA is correct.
Run these digests on gel to analyse.
Observations
It can be seen from the photograph above that there are colonies present on the cotC-GFP-smtA transformant LB + amp plates suggesting that the ligations and transformations were a success. This cannot be said for the cadmium sensor 'transformant' cells which did not yield any colonies on the LB + amp plates.
Procedure
Preparation for cotC transformant mini-preps
To prepare the cotC BioBricks for midi-preps, 12 colonies were picked from the LB + amp plate containing 200ul of transformant cells. These colonies, under aspetic conditions, were then used to inoculate 12 tubes of LB + ampicillin. The tubes were transferred to the orbital incubator for overnight growth at 37ºC.
Digesting midi-prep samples
The digests on the cotC, kinA, pGFP-rrnB, pMUTIN4, and pSB1AT3 midi-prep DNA samples were carried out as follows:

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html," (BBa_K346004) that was synthesized by iGEM Peking 2010. As described by the team, this MBP design was based on the tandem of two metal binding domains to make a high performance and less energy consuming metal binding peptide. The idea came from the high similarity of the C-terminal metal binding domain with MerR family TFs, which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-protein complex structure.
The Mercury ions accumulator device biobrick (BBa_K1355003) has dual function: A) In reverse: transcription of MerR regulator protein; and B) In forward: transcription of MerP - MerT - Metal Binding Peptide proteins, as represented below:
In absence of mercury, MerR forms a MerR-promoter-operator complex, preventing RNA polymerase to recognize the promoter, consequently, messengers RNA for MerPT and MBP will not be transcript. In presence of Hg2+, MerR protein binds to this element and dissociates from the promoter-operator complex, allowing MerPT and MBP expression, as represented below:
Experiments and Results
The experiment for Hg bioaccumulation was made according to the protocol “Quantification of Mercury bio accumulated by metal binding peptide (MBP) in recombinant DH5-alpha in different Hg concentrations”. DH5-alpha transformed with BBa_K1355003 was inoculated in LM (LB with low concentration of NaCl) liquid medium with chloramphenicol and grew until the optical density was 0.4 to 0.6abs (measured on spectrophotometer at 600 nm wavelength). After cell growth, an aliquot of 400μl was taken and distributed in 4 eppendorf tubes (1.5ml) and then added mercury chloride in order to achieve the concentrations: 50 ppb, 100 ppb, 250 ppb and 500 ppb. The samples were incubated at 37°C on shaker. We collected each eppendorf tube at time 1 (01:30 hours of incubation) and time 2 (03:00 hours of incubation). After the designated time, both were centrifuged at 12000g for 3 minutes and the supernatant recovered (LM medium). We washed the pellet with TN Buffer (Nacl 0.15M + Tris HCl 10mM) and then re-suspended with 400μl of the same buffer. To measure bio accumulated Hg, we need to quantify the Hg inside and outside of bacterium after the"

2017.7.10-8.20  Construction of BcsA-knockout Enterobacteria sp.FY-07
In order to make the production of cellulose become controllable, we knocked out the BcsA gene (the coding gene of the A subunit of the cellulose synthase) in FY-07. It was observed that FY-07 knocked out the BcsA gene no longer produced cellulose. When we replenish the BcsA gene into FY-07, FY-07 began to produce cellulose again. This phenomenon can be clearly observed on Congo red media. On the Congo red medium, when the bacteria produce cellulose, the colonies will show red.
2017.7.3-9.24  Construction of engineered Enterobacter sp. FY-07
Our project is aiming to engineer Enterobacter sp. FY-07 (which is separated from oilfield produced water and able to produce cellulose naturally), so as to controllably produce rhamnolipid and cellulose.
2017.7.3-9.3 Functional Test of Our Design
We have test the functional of gene rhlABC, BcsA and fimS switch. The results are roughly in accordance with our expectation.
2017.9.25-10.22 Basic Parts Construction
The lyase, fimS and fimE genes are cloned by PCR. Then both these segments and pSB1C3 vector were treated with restriction enzymes. After that, the three gene were separately ligated to linear pSB1C3, and the ligation products were separately transformed into DH5α. Verification PCR was performed to select the positive clones. The positive strains were chosen to be cultured overnight and plasmids were extracted. After restriction enzyme digestion verification, the positive clones were sequenced.

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," do that, we carried out a functional       metagenomics strategy aiming at selecting promoters from a library of metagenomic DNA. As a first step, we wanted to isolate metagenomic DNA from       environmental samples, but instead of using traditional manual kits, we decided to build a robot able to automatically extract metagenomic DNA for us… It       is a pleasure for our team to introduce you our TOOL robot:
“The TOOL” robot
How does it work?
The main goal of this machine was the automation of the DNA isolation process. This robot can be used for both E. coli (mini/maxipreps) and for DNA extraction from metagenomic samples.
The robotic system was developed in a continuous philosophy and all the components were assembled on a piece of wood. In short, it consisted of the following modules:
The control and powering system: the system was controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 microchip, powered by a computer via USB. The other components          of the machine were powered by an ATX power supply.
The injection system, which consisted of several screw stepper motors controlled by an A4988 driver. We chose this kind of motors because they          allowed a quite accurate control of the position and the speed of the injections. A torque of 35N*m was also included. The system had three-way          stopcocks in order to refill the syringes easily.
The temperature modules: high temperatures were achieved with a system that combined hot water and Peltier cells, whereas low temperatures were          achieved by ice cooling. Temperature was measured with a dbs1820 temperature sensor.
The mixing: a homogeneous mixture of all the reagents was obtained thanks to the use of tubes allowing a turbulent regime.
The complete process was as follows:
Manually inject a suspension of the cells into 3 mL of ice-cold solution I.
From this step until step 8, the procedure is automatic (indicated in italics).
200 µL of solution II are injected and mixed during the flow into the silicone tubes.
The mixture is moved through the silicone tubes to a water bath at 65 ºC and incubated for 30 minutes.
60 µL of ice-cold Potassium Acetate 3M (pH 5.0) are injected and mixed during the flow into the silicone tubes.
The mixture is moved through the silicone tubes to an ice bath and incubated 20 minutes at -20ºC.
The resulting suspension is then filtered through a membrane and insoluble particles are removed.
An equal volume of isopropanol is injected and mixed with to the filtered"

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," observe  the expression of GFP under the induce of IPTG . Then ,we sent the 1-9H and  2-7I to check sequence , only to found 2-7I is not as the description and the  sequence was totally wrong . We had no idea but to change our design .
Week 23
Considering the error of  2-7I , we transform some part including 2-7E,lux I -15b ,RFP, FimE ,we  need and confirm them by pcr and order-checking . We found that 2-7E is wrong  and the others are right .
   
Week 24
This week ,we clone gene  FimE to pET-21a ( Xhol Ⅰand BamHⅠ),RFP to 1-9H (XholⅠand NdeⅠ). the protocol is the common protocol  .
We got the targeted plasmid .the recombinant plasmid of RFP and 1-9H can express GFP at the induce of AHL . We add AHL when OD600  reached 1.0 and we observed and recorded every one hour . We found that four  hours after AHL was added red fluorescence can be seen by naked eye .
Human practice
We did many human practice during the whole year. Fisrt ,we hold a campus talk to publicize igem and synthetic biology . Then we set blog at sina. Com.home page at renren.com . The home page and blog attract many people on the internet . We usually publish new and communicate on the internet . Also we participated in the meeting of iGEM teams in BeiJing . Apart from the activities among university students , We hold some other activities facing to more people . We hold an exhibition in the 101-year anniversary . Students and teachers from all departments , alumni, visitors ,and so on see the exhibition . They read our panel and asked many questions. To let more people know synthetic biology , we went to middle school to give an presentation , talking about the emerging fields in biology .
After we hold many activities ,we found that many people have strong interest in synthetic biology . So we organized the association of synthetic biology in Tsinghua university . We hope it can be a paradise of synthetic biology liker .
Wiki
We have done a lot of hard work in building our wiki. From the time we settle our main topic, the work of wiki began as well. All members in our group have participated in the discussion of how to make our wiki more attractive"

European Meetup in Munich
In July we attended the European Meetup in Munich.                  It was a great experience to get in touch with so many teams.                  For the first time we presented our poster to a greater audience and                  were excited by all the positive comments and helpful advice we received.                  We are thankful for the opportunity to get an insight into the other amazing projects.                  Not only did we get to hear stunning talks about synthetic biology in current science issues,                  but we also received important information by attending many workshops.                  In the end we left a bit wistfully, but we also took home so many amazing impressions."

Sequencing of psb1c3+T7 promoter+silk biobrick'
The miniprepped samples from 7/29 were sent in for sequencing.
Running HoneyBee Protein on SDS PAGE gel
In the morning I incubated the purified inclusion bodies in a slightly above RT water bath in order to resolubilize the SDS and the protein.
I then took a 40 ul fraction and put the rest in the 4c room for storage.
Fasih Asahn taught me how to load a pre-cast SDS PAGE gel with my samples.
Put the samples on ice.
Establish what sample will go in which lane.
From left to right it is F1,S1,F2,F3,S2,S3, Final product, and BSA positive control.
Calculate and prepare the Sample Buffer (2x).
The sample buffer is composed of 5% Beta-mercapto ethanol, and 95% Laemli sample buffer.
Since I have 8 samples, 40 ul each, I will need 320 ul of this 2X sample buffer.
Add the BME in the fume hood into an epi tube, and add the Laemli buffer. (must be prepared fresh every time.)
Add 40 ul of this prepared Sample buffer to each of the 40 ul samples and mix thoroughly by pipetting.
Set the heat block to 95C and incubate tubes for 5 minutes.
While the heat block is warming up, set up the gel rig.
Prepare the 10X running buffer, lock in the apparatus, shake up the buffer, and fill up the inner chamber before adding to the outer chamber.
Once samples have been boiled, remove the comb from the gel, and add samples to the lanes.
Don't forget to add ladder.
Set the voltage at 200V and run approximately 40 min, or until the dye front hits"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Selection#Bacterial Two-Hybrid System_-_-_TEXT.html," is the expression of the reporter gene, in example the beta-lactamase(6). No binding between the target and the binding protein (7) leads to no expression of the reporter gene (8). At the end only the bacteria survive with the activated reporter. These bacteria you can use to produce a lot of the binding proteins against your specific target (9).
Theoretical background
The bacterial two-hybrid system is a possibility to separate cells from each other through differences in protein-protein interaction strength( Hu et al. 2000 ). The whole system works in vivo and gives bacteria with strong interaction of two chosen proteins a high advantage in their growth ability. This growth difference distinguishes such bacteria from bacteria with very weak protein interactions. This method can be applied to our Evobody generation system by constructing a hybrid transcriptional activator system. This system comprises two fusion proteins. One protein contains a DNA binding domain fused with our target protein (1). The second protein consists of our Evobody fused to a subunit of the RNA polymerase(2). The DNA binding domain of the first fusion protein binds to a specific DNA pattern upstream of the promoter sequence of a reporter gene (3). If there is an interaction between the target protein and the Evobody (4), the interaction leads to a recruitment of the fused subunit of the RNA polymerase to the promoter (5). Therefore, the RNA polymerase can only express the reporter gene, for example a beta-lactamase, if the interaction of the target and the Evobody is strong enough (6). Otherwise, a weak or unavailable interaction (7) leads to no reporter gene transcription at all (8). Therefore, it is possible to raise the antibiotic concentration to increase the selection pressure on cells. The results are optimized Evobodies with high affinity towards the target (9).
Our system in detail
The DNA binding domain
Our system is based on two fusion proteins. The first protein consists of our target protein fused with a DNA binding domain. In very early hybrid transcriptional activation system the frequently binding domains were different zinc finger proteins ( Joung et al. 2000 ). Each of these proteins has a so called zinc finger domain, which is able to bind at specific DNA sequences ( Klug & Rhodes 1987 ). The zinc finger domain of the murein transcription factor Zif268 was most frequently used in two-hybrid systems. Three individual zinc finger motifs collectively bind a nine base-pair long sequence ( Pavletich & Pabo 1991 ).  Due to the development of more complicated experiments more zinc finger proteins per experiment were needed. This"

Katerina Cheronis
I am a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering student hoping to pursue medical school following graduation. Having grown up in Athens, Greece scientific terminology does not intimidate me, although I still struggle to pronounce the most obscure names of bacteria. I am currently involved in imaging research for cancer diagnostics, but recently became fascinated by the field of synthetic biology and by how we can engineer bacteria to do the unimaginable. When not in lab, I’m probably reading mystery novels, solving Rubik’s cube puzzles or trying to improve my tennis serve.

gene No. 1 EC_HAD is expressed in the system, probably was split into two sub units, we presume the reason is in the separation process, a change in the electrical charge due to a change in PH may cause protein catabolism to sub units. Another possibility is the existence of other proteins that were separated in the elution process to release the Gln-H protein. Nevertheless, one can see that the protein is expressed well in the system. 
Picture 14
gene No. 2 EC-GFP we can see the expression of the Gln-H protein in channels 7-14. Expression of the protein in the gene is lower; the intensity of the mark is very low compared to the protein extracted from gene No. 1.

After electrophoreses we cut out the band at the size of 2000bp we purified the DNA and measured the concentration with the NanoDrop.  To get the Inserts we used PCR. As template we used like said before the positive sequenced pJET clones. We used an aliquot of the PCR product to check the correct size the other part of the PCR was used to purify. Then we cut the fragments with EcoRI and PstI. Next we calculated a molecular 1:1 ratio and performed ligation. Transformation and plating out followed.  After screening the plates for positive clones we performed dilution plating to get single colonies.

Conclusions
After 3 months of working in the lab and planning everything on our own for the first time, we realized that synthetic biology can be quite challenging.  As it was the first time we did a project all alone, we faced many troubles we would never have imagined before. From getting a lab ready to work in to making time schedules and redoing a task again and again we had the chance to learn a lot. Before the iGEM competition our university laboratory exercises were planned and completely coordinated by professors with all their experience. We had no idea about how hard it will actually be to get a living organism"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," when only the promoter/reporter fusions were present. This was a breakthrough as the PmanA-gfp fusion still showed GFP expression while the PcblD-gfp fusion did not.   This lead us to perform a BLAST search of the Clp sequence from the DSF system against the E. coli genome to look for similar transcription factors in the wild type. CRP from E. coli showed significant similarity so we obtained a CRP-deletion mutant (BW25113 ∆CRP) and transformed it with our promoter/reporter fusion in preparation for blotting.
BCAM0228-PcblD-GFP was set up in E. coli MC1061 for blotting, as there may be potential crosstalk causing GFP to be produced in the absence of our sensor kinase, BCAM0227.
Week 17
The two PAI-1 sensors looked good from sequencing and so was transformed into E. coli MC1061 in preparation for blotting for GFP after induction with synthetic PAI-1 obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
Western blot of BCAM0228-PcblD-gfp showed GFP expression. Contrasted with the negative results from the PcblD-gfp blot, this suggested that something native to E. coli was activating BCAM0228.
A Western blot of PmanA-gfp in the CRP deletion strain of E. coli still showed expression of GFP.
Week 18
The two PAI-1 sensors containing different promoters both worked to different extents. The sensor containing PlasB-gfp showed slow induction of GFP over time, however the sensor containing PluxR-gfp was initially on but showed increasing GFP production over time.  What a relief. After much head-scratching and brow-furrowing over the other two systems it was great to get a positive result. We have learned a lot about the potential cross-talk between signal transduction pathways when they are expressed in different species. We believe that research into untangling these interactions will significantly speed-up the process of applying synthetic biology solutions to real-world problems.
Time to pack up the lab and hand over our equipment to the new PhD students for training, it’s been a rollercoaster of a project that every one of us has benefited from in ways we will likely still be discovering years from now.
See you in Boston!

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the non-traditional growers, such as J.J. Reidy at Urban Pastoral, who uses an old shipping container for his setup, had similar complaints about energy usage and monitoring as the traditional hydroponic growers did. Another hydroponic farm, Urban Crop Solutions, told the team about its own use of oxidants such as ozone to sterilize the hydroponic solution.
Interviews: Andrew Blume (Agritecture), Nathaniel Shaw (Karma Farms), Dr. Neil Mattson (School of Integrative Plant Science), ShuShan Valley HydroFarm, Filipous Charalambous (Urban Crop Solutions), Henry (Agritecture), JJ Reidy (Urban Pastoral)
Business: Subteam lead worked on creating crowdfunding campaign content.
JUNE 19TH TO JUNE 25TH
Wet Lab: Team ran PCR reactions to amplify pR and FixK2 promoters as well as Hydrazinase and NADPH gblocks. The team verified these PCR reactions with agarose gel electrophoresis followed by PCR cleanup. Primarily 1.5% agarose gels were prepared. The PCRs for GSH Independent Formaldehyde, 2-Nitropropane Dioxygenase, and L-Asparaginase were not successful.
Product Development: Product Development began prototyping the planter cups and assembling the hydroponic tank. Team members also setup the Raspberry Pi and created the first web design mock-ups.
P&P: P&P designed a lesson plan for 4H Career Explorations focusing on the the principles of synthetic biology, biology entrepreneurship, and designing a biobrick device. The lesson involved wheat germ DNA extraction using the Building with Biology kit for a hands-on experiment. There was also an interview with Maria Harrison specializing the symbiosis between plants, fungi, and bacteria.

Collaborations
In this year, we, the team Rheda Bielefeld, participated for the first time in the iGEM competition and in the result we were astonished by the scale of this event which takes place every year since 2003.
Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec
Luckily we didn't dive into the competition alone, because the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec helped us greatly in the project and mentored us from the beginning of the competition. They didn´t only help us in the technical side, which includes HTML, CSS and Java, but they also participated with us in the InterLab Study and guided us through it.
Even when the first results didn't match, we repeated the InterLab Study experiments and successfully completed it.
During the work with the wiki we encountered some gravitating problems and haven't found a possible solution, until one of their members helped us to find the solution and further provided us information to the wiki code.
Also we participated in their Dual Use Research of Concern."

Besides, we also kept a close contact with the EPA in a various province in order to know more about the policies and situation of heavy metal pollution. They all answered our questions enthusiastically，and told us that if we needed any help they could offer, they would not be hesitant to help us. And every time we finished a small section, we would contact with them to discuss whether it is feasible in policy.
Long-term partner
What' s more, we also had a talk with heavy metal treatment company to know more about the recent technology of settling down the heavy metal so that we could know what we should do to make it more suitable for the environment. They said that our total project was extraordinary because we used genetically modified strains to settle down heavy metal, which solved the problem that these strains could not survive in water containing so many heavy metal ions and they said that they would be willing to use our method to remove heavy metal from water when our project became more mature.

Wednesday, 3rd August
Today we had the pleasure of welcoming Kiran, an A-level student on a work   experience placement. Frank spent the morning showing him around the labs and   showing him the mystical ways of making broth. We gave him some time to get   acquainted with our project before he helped Ming with preparing a whole new   batch of plant media for the experiments and the growing plants.
We had another visit from the RCA guys, Koby, CJ and Pei, which was cool. We   had a cool discussion about some of our human practices work as well as the more   artistic side of things such as the wiki and videos.
Nick had a stroke of bad luck this morning, as it seemed that the strain of   bacteria he was using for his transformation appeared to have lost their   antibiotic resistance genes. Oh well.
The modelling team of Si and Nina were on top form as usual. Si finished a   cool animation and provided Nick with the necessary numbers for his experiments.   Nina spent some time working on the most efficient way to deliver auxin to the   roots, which we should probably have a group discussion about.
The day ended with Chris sorting out the chemicals for his auxin assays and a   pair of transformations from Frank and Nick. Frank transformed some E.coli with   Berkeley 08's killswitch module and Nick transformed E.coli K12 BL21DE3 with a   plasmid affectionately referred to as pRhys, after its supplier.
Thursday, 4th July
Today was cool. The PCR of the backbone vectors was succesfull so tomorrow we   are going to gel purify and when the genes arrive we are ready to assemble!   Chris and Nikki started the Salkowski standard curve, living on the edge working   with acid. Nick had super awesome amazing training on the widefield microscope   with the super cool dude and it was so cool. The Mcps bacteria from Spain move,   yay! Frank got some feedback on the kill switch, and got very frustrated working   on it... Rebekka and Ming are preparing the bacteria for uptake by Arabidopsis,   hopefully it works. Nina is starting to model root growth, Si is modeling the   kill switch. You can see what Yuan Wei has been up to here. The new addition to   our team, Kiran, did his first transformation today.... Until next time

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Overview | Design | Results
Background
mRNA is the molecule that carries information about the sequence of amino acids in a protein. However, much like the lines on a sheet of paper, the protein coding sequence of an mRNA molecule does not start right at the beginning, or top of the page. Instead, once the mRNA is bound by a ribosome, a start codon must first be read before the protein can be translated. This start codon is generally AUG, or Methionine.
The Problem
Once this start codon in read the ribosome will continue reading and building the polypeptide (protein) until a stop codon is reached. But what happens if you have two AUG codons close together? That is the question we are attempting to answer.
We are trying to understand what happens when there are two start codons very close together, but out of frame. Out of frame refers to how the ribosome reads the mRNA. Remember those codons and how they are groups of three bases on the mRNA? The reading frame refers to which group of three. If you start at one base and read the bases in groups of three from that point on, that is one frame of reference. If you then move your start point ahead one base, then you are reading in a new reading frame. If you advance you starting point one more base, that is the third reading frame. If you advance it again you are now back in your first reading frame, but you have skipped the first codon. We are looking into what happens when you have multiple start codons close together, but in different reading frames. Which frame will be preferred?
The Objective
This construct aims to test the possibility of multiple start codons on a single mRNA strand. A plasmid has been engineered with two start codons slightly out of frame from each other, but close enough to test start codon slippage.  Testing the fluorescence of E. coli carrying the plasmid will determine the rate of cod"

The beauty of creation
To clarify the progression of our cloning, the results will not be presented chronologically, but rather in a logical manner, starting with the simplest constructs. This is not an exhaustive list, but merely a presentation to clarify our work and give insight into our thoughts. Please consult our submitted parts-page (dig deeper), as well as our comprehensive protocols to gain full insight into our work. We have done our utmost to edit the gel photos in a responsible manner. Should questions arise, originals can be found in our protocols.

St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Modelling-tests_-_-_TEXT.html," sustainability.  To model fish numbers, when the definition of a sustainable number of fish varies so significantly from one species to another, would have been silly.
Why adult fish?
Having chosen to measure fish population in terms of (wet) fish biomass, it also became necessary to measure population in terms of adult fish biomass, instead of all fish biomass.
We sought to model fish biomass throughout time but to model all biomass would have required us to take into account the growth of fish.  We would have had to model the population dynamics of multiple weight classes of fish, as well as the interaction between the weight classes. Instead, we chose to investigate adult (mature) fish biomass as we could assume, to a first approximation, that the biomass of an adult fish is constant throughout time (as suggested by Von Bertalanffy's fish growth model).  We were, thus, able to produce a justifiable and relatively simple first model.
The mathematics
Our model takes into account what we believe to be the most fundamental factors that alter adult fish biomass measurements between two years: the recruitment of junior fish into the adult population, the natural death of adult fish and the catching of adult fish.
Our mathematical model
$$\textrm{Biomass (this year)} - \textrm{Biomass (last year)} = \textrm{Recruits} - \textrm{Natural Deaths} - \textrm{Fish Caught}$$

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," tRNAs, bearing phenylalanine in the cell (tRNA-Phe). On that account, we created tRNA-Phe biobrick (K1983010) and combined it together with two kinds of promoters – constitutive (K1983011) and naturally found in E. coli DH10B strain (K1983012) . We integrated tRNA-Phe together with polyphe proteins into the cells to make one working unit. In theory, bigger expression of tRNA-Phe consequently leads to more RNA molecules, carrying amino acids and therefore greater protein expression as well as increased system activity. However, our experiments did not confirm this hypothesis. Due to this, we can claim that tRNA-Phe expression is either not a limiting factor or the difference between system with and without it was too little to determine (see our results and demonstration ).
Future
To develop our project even further beyond the lab bench, we have a few objectives. It is particularly important to reach the highest expression levels possible for both of the approaches – PAL enzyme and polyphe proteins. Also, both of these systems (PAL and polyphe proteins), working in cooperation in one cell, could undoubdtedly become the most succesful approach and reach the maximum effectiveness. This would maximize the amount of phenylalanine uptaken from the human intestine into the probiotic bacteria. Read more about maximum system efficiency on our modelling page.
Another significant issue is safety and system regulation. One of the main reasons, why such probiotic bacteria might be prohibited to use, is continous fear of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their manipulation. In the view of the fact that our bacteria, in theory, would be used directly by people and could possibly cause medical issues, it is of great importance to regulate its life cycle and activity. Last year Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2015 team created a bacterial timer as a control mechanism . Combining this method together with post-transcriptional control, such as aptamers and riboswitches, could serve as a potential regulatory unit. We performed an extensive literature research on this topic at the early stages of the project, however, this kind of research would require a substantial amount of time and resources.
Since the final product of our project is a probiotic, is it our concern to consider the most suitable chassis organism for the matter. Even though we conducted our experiments in conventional model organism E. coli, we reviewed Bacillus subtilis 168 strain for experimenting in the laboratory as well as B. subtilis HU58 strain"

1. Concentration dynamics of kill switches
This chapter summarizes the first working phase of the iGEM Marburg 2016 modeling work: The continuous ODE model                 presented previously is used with the biologically relevant parameters to compute the concentrations'                 dynamics \(\vec{X}(t)\) for all times. This shows that the designs are comparable in terms of the toxin expression levels. The latter                 three designs are comparable in terms of the number of model parameters.
At first, the lab environment is simulated in order to evaluate the toxin expression during the kill switch's OFF state.                 After that, the organism is released into wild life conditions – no inducers present – and the toxin expression of the                 activated kill switch is compared to the OFF state. From there, a toxin threshold is found.
This sections serves as verification that the non-mutated kill switch designs work as intended.
(a) BNU China 2014
The BNU China 2014 kill switch (find design here ) is simulated and the results are shown in figure 1.               One observes a significant increase of the toxin concentration once the organism is released into wild life conditions which               lacks an inducer. The lethal toxin threshold is defined as  based on the simulation results. This is the mean of the kill               switch's OFF and ON state. It is consistently drawn as dashed red line in the following.
Figure 1. Simulated BNU China 2014 kill switch dynamics. All involved concentrations are simulated. The first subplot                 shows the externally set inducer – IPTG – concentration. The last                 subplot shows the resulting toxin expression and the lethal toxin                 threshold \(\theta\). All subplots in-between correspond to the                 concentrations of intermediate substances.
Interestingly, one can observe a noticeable delay between the inducer turned off and the toxin turning on. This is due to the signal                 traveling through the network at finite speed.
The next kill switch designs represent different generic kill switch topologies and abstract from specific biological substances to                 substances that behave just like their biological counterparts. This enables to focus on the bare kill switch design (see algorithm                 description for further details here ).
(b) Parallel (OR)
This design utilizes two redundant toxin regulating branches (find design here ). Being connected by an OR gate,"

The 3' end of the nick is extended by DNA polymerase III, single-strand-binding protein and the Replication. The displaced positive strand is re-circularized by pll and converted to RF DNA. Later, when sufficient G5P has accumulated, G5P dimers coat the single strands, earmarking them for assembly. Besides, G1P, G4P and G8P also play important roles in phage enveloping and release[3].
How do we modify the M13 bacteriophage?
In IgEM, the life cycle of M13 bacteriophage could be accomplished only when reporter gene of Bacterial Two-hybrid System is supplied, meaning the prey and bait are strongly interacted. To achieve this process, we need to obtain defective M13 vector, of which breeding ability is abolished. Meanwhile, this vector should re-gain its breeding ability with exogenous gene expression supplement. Thus we modified the M13 bacteriophage vector in the following aspects.
First, delete a core gene to prevent the defective vector from breeding itself. Then, test whether the vector above can breed with exogenous core gene supplied.
Next step, integration.
After acquiring the modified M13 vector, to accomplish IgEM integration, we would

Conclusion
Vectorization encounters several problematic like stability, toxicity, targeting, resistance or stealth to the immune system, passage through the membrane and industrialization.
The Double Vector System (DVS ) offers a key to these major problematic.
DVS is composed by a first vector , tissue vector, from bacterial type, able to reach a tissue and by a second vector , from phage type, able to reach a target cell. When the target cell is reached, it releases a therapeutic plasmid which has an action against the disease.
The first vector  : Mycobacterium avium, goes to the tissue of interest for which it has a high affinity. It resists to the immune system thanks to its cell wall and has a low toxicity for its host. In the target tissue, it creates the second vector , the cell vector.
The cell vector targets the cell type of interest, which increase the DVS specificity. The cell vector integer itself in target cell, thanks to viral proteins exposed to its capsid. These proteins permit it to be efficient and offer the capacity to pass through eukaryotic cell membrane. The cell vector is able to encapsidate the therapeutic plasmid and to deliver it after its own internalization.
The therapeutic plasmid expresses one or more therapeutic genes replying to target physiopathology. It possesses a sequence providing its encapsidation in the cell vector , and a DTS sequence  (DNA nuclear targeting sequence) to its transport inside target cell nucleus.
DVS improves underlying vectorization problematic. Tissue vector characteristics bring a solution to specificity issue and to elimination by the immune system met by vectors. Cell vector characteristics reinforce the vector specificity and give a solution to pass through the cell membrane and to the therapeutic agent delivery.
DVS becomes one of the more specific vectors by permitting the transport of one or more gene insert in a therapeutic goal with a high efficiency.
