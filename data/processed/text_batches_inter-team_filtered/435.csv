Mini-Jamboree
This year, there are four iGEM teams from Israel competing in the competition.  For the first time ever in Israel, we held a mini-jamboree event at Technion, on September 9.  We invited the four iGEM teams from Israel, as well as the Technion student body and faculty.  About 80 people attended.  The aim of the meet-up was to provide a platform for all the Israeli iGEM teams to present their project and get feedback and tips for improvement.  At the meet-up, each team presented their project, and a panel of judges asked questions and gave tips for improvement at the end of each presentation.  After the teams presented, Dr. Ido Bachelet spoke about his fascinating research in the field of Critical Bionic Design.
We would like to thank the panel of judges, who helped make the mini-jamboree incredibly constructive and helpful to the teams: Dr. Orna Atar, Prof. Roee Amit, Dr. Ido Bachelet, Dr. Sarah Goldberg, Michal Meirom, and Asst. Prof. Boaz Mizrachi.  We would also like to thank the iGEM participants of previous years, who gave us helpful tips related to presenting at the competition itself: Inbal Vaknin, Lior Levy, Noa Katz, and Beate Kaufmann.

    where I1(t)=g(t), and K1, K2  is coefficient derived from the equation (). Because the intensity of GFP fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of GFP protein, y , we try to get the function as y=F(I1,I2,t)  . However, y changes with time going by, which greatly increases the difficulty of presenting the results.     Therefore, we try to simplify the equation. We find that when t get larger , y would get closer to a steady state value, which is defined as ys , and the function can be simplified as ys=f(I1,I2) . We have demonstrated that  , but I2 is still difficult to measure,  so we simplify the function using the concentration of DPD. Thus, we have constructed the relationship between the two inputs (DPD and green light) and one output (GFP).     Suppose
, we can get the steady-state solution that
    Here, K3, K4, K5 are the coefficients that are related to rx, d, etc. Using MATLAB and taking different values of the coefficients, we can get the three-dimensional figure: ( Shown in Pic3)
Pic 3     Predicted GFP abundance of Integrated Model
    From the integrated model we can conclude that our model successfully simulates the results of our light-controlled and AND logic gate experiment. Besides, Pic3 also shows the character of AND logic gate, where the system is only ON when all of the inputs are ON.

Newly industrialising countries with widespread emerging healthcare systems like China would also benefit from our tool. Lung cancer, in large part down to high rates of smoking, caused 529,153 deaths in China in 2011. [45] In conjunction with anti-smoking policies governments could introduce, our screening test could be very effective.
Dr Desai cited the epidemiological evidence that strongly suggests the smoking rate increases in these countries will increase the prevalence of NSCLC.
Both China and India have fairly large isolated rural populations, [46] so again the portability of our test has benefits, and the low cost of our system is also obviously attractive to governments. These countries already have various treatment options and the capability to roll out administrative networks for processing screening results. The problem again lies with the fact that cancers like NSCLC are detected too late, which is why screening is so essential.
False positives
High false positive rates and unnecessary further testing are major downsides to current screening methods. It can be debilitating to be given a diagnosis of cancer and it can have a major psychological impact. It is paramount that when the diagnosis is given, its is accurate - so false positive rates need to be minimized.
Some of the common physiological impacts of a cancer diagnosis include anxiety, emotional upheaval, and depression. Between 20 and 50% of patients with a solid tumor are reported to have linked depression. [47]
Misdiagnosing cancer also has negative economic impacts. It costs the NHS money to carry out all the scans, tests and procedures needed to treat someone diagnosed as positive. The average cost of the unnecessary tests for a false positive in a prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian screening trial was over $1000 per patient. [48]
MiRNA levels have the potential to produce false positives - even when several are quantified and the results combined. As such, it is unlikely that our tool would ever give a conclusive diagnosis of cancer. However, depending on the cutoff value chosen it could definitely rule out cancer in individuals. In others, the results could also strongly indicate the patient has a disease, but further testing would be needed to make the final diagnosis, stage a tumor, and inform therapeutic decisions.

 Motivation
Difficulties are inevitable in a project, but help from our friends would always bring us to cross the finishing line. We were fortunate to have met many teams and built much friendship through iGEM. We helped each other in different aspects of our projects, and much of our effort bore meaningful fruits in our laboratory work and beyond. Here is the documentation of our precious memory and our expression of gratitude for all of their help.
UI-Indonesia
This year, we were glad that we could collaborate with team from University of Indonesia ( UI_Indonesia ). Our extensive collaboration ranges from wet lab to human practice.
 How the Story Began?
We helped UI_Indonesia to clone their HT constructs as they faced great difficulty. The construct is a fusion of native Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor and human HB-EGF receptor which in the purpose of diphtheria toxin can be recognized by bacteria. This HT was designed and ordered in a gBlock from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
Initially, UI_Indonesia ordered the HT gBlock as one fragment with a size ~1900 bp. However, they were informed that there was a problem during the construction, so they would need to change it and came up with ordering two separate fragments with one restriction between 2 parts, namely HT1 and HT2.
They planned to combine these two fragments together into a vector by ligation. However, when they tried to amplify HT1 to insert it in into a vector, they found out that the amplified product of HT1 was not specific. The size for HT1 was supposed to be ~1100 bp, but the band was very faint in 1100 bp. For HT2, there was a band at 800 bp, but it showed multiple bands, indicating low specificity. Because of this problem, UI_Indonesia sought help to ligate the two fragments together and put it in a backbone. Therefore, they asked us for help in ligating and cloning this fragment into a vector, so it would be easier to amplify and proceed for their assay.

Safety
Synthetic biology has the potential to impact many areas of society.     Synthetic biologists may use artificial molecules to reproduce emergent     behavior from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial     life or seeking interchangeable biological parts to assemble them into     devices and systems that function in a manner not found in nature (Benner     and Sismour 2005, Endy 2005, Heinemann and Panke 2006, Luisi 2007, Serrano     2007).There is possibility of causing intentional or accidental harm     to humans, agriculture or the environment. While deliberate damage is     dealt with under the heading biosecurity, the potential unintended consequences     have to be considered under the term biosafety. As a software developer     , we have to consider all possible maliciously use of synthetic biology     tools. However, it is diffucult to understand for which purposesour     tools will be used, bestway avoiding garage bioterrorism is all parts     before adding to partsregistry must be checked , looked for toxic affect     and any environmental or human harmness.

Harvard,2017,Team:Harvard#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to specify the rate constants of the various molecular interactions were drawn from analogous systems or interactions, as parameters specific to interactions between curli proteins are currently unavailable in literature. Obtaining experimental data to either update or validate these parameters is a fundamental first step to increasing predictive accuracy of our model.
Another area is the mathematical simplification that we used in describing the aggregation and polymerization kinetics. Far more descriptive models of protein aggregation and polymerization have been developed by Meisl et al., Wang et al., and Schreck et al.. The 2014 INSA Lyon Team also made significant efforts to model the polymerization kinetics of curli fibers. However, as the 2014 INSA-Lyon discovered, modelling protein aggregation and polymerization kinetics to this level of detail requires very high levels of computational power. Thus, in order to be able to run our model on student-owned computers, we chose to make simplifications in this aspect of the model, as described above. Developing a way to combine the specificity and intricacy of the models developed by those studying protein aggregation with the computational feasibility of the simplified version we used in our model is another step towards increasing the accuracy of our model.

The food containing antibiotic residues, the intestinal flora in body will gradually have resistance to antibiotics, which will causes the poor effect when use the antibiotics. As students of biology major, we also hope to contribute to solving this problem relying on our own efforts. So when we have a chance to participate in IGEM competition, we choose to focus on the food safety, hoping to improve the food safety in China with our efforts. Finally, we determine to develop an effective and simple antibiotics detector, which will not only provide a new method for the detection mechanisms, but also will help the consumers detect their food easily. To a certain extent, it can ensure their food security.
At first, We set the goal to sold our product in the market. At the same time, through our promotion, it can also make more people focus on their food safety and know the important of rational use of antibiotics. In order to successfully achieve the goal, we find some venture capital firms to talk about cooperation, also participate in Innovation & Entrepreneurship Fair for College Students in Shenzhen. There are a lot of start-up companies in this fair, to our surprise, there are many life and health start-up companies. We exchange ideas and products at the fair and I think in the future there will be more technological companies in the field of life and health, they will provide better services for human health. In addition, many invest-                   ment firms participated in the fair. We communicate and exchange information with them, and some express the intention to cooperate.
Through this fair, I deeply felt that the life and health field is a focus of society. That strengthens our beliefs to struggle for human life and health."

L'UCL
Université Catholique de Louvain was founded in 1425 and saw numerous important persons within its halls.
For example, George Lemaître was one of the first and finest experts in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (1915). He connected the theory to experimental data proliferating in the field of astronomy and presented two hypotheses: the universe is both expanding and the result of an initial explosion of incredibly concentrated energy.
Christian de Duve (1917-2013) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1974 for identifying two organelles, the lysosome (1955) and the peroxisome (1965), which help cells absorb beneficial substances and reject others.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Translate_-_-_TEXT.html," allow treatment time. If Staphylocide must be removed, the necessary actions such as cleaning the infection, assessing the infection, and/or replacing the dressings should be performed as soon as possible, before re-applying the ointment on the infection.
Healthcare practitioners should also perform regular microbiological testing of the infection site to monitor the progress of conjugation. When microbial testing indicates that all cells in the area are susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics, a transition from Staphylocide to using antibiotics can be made.
Here is a product use guideline we have created outlining the major steps health care professionals must follow when using our product.
Screen for adverse complications (i.e. immunodeficiency) and confirm MRSA infection. (Sanofi Pasteur Limited, 2002, Public Health Agency of Canada, 2012)
Train administrators to handle and discard materials according to Biosafety Level 1 practices. (ATCC, 2014)
Instructions: Reconstitute bacteria and incubate.  Inoculate base (vehicle).  Apply Staphylocide in appropriate dose(s) for an optimized period of time as determined by plasmid conjugation, and apply the β-lactam antibiotics.
Store at (2°C to 8°C) until expiration. (Sanofi Pasteur Limited, 2002, Public Health Agency of Canada, 2012, ATCC, 2014)
Adaptations for This Project Beyond iGEM
The results of Waterloo iGEM’s project would be of interest to the following groups and industries:
Academia/Research
Our project incorporates systems and procedures that those in academia can apply to their own research. These include the CRISPRi system that inhibits mecA (the gene responsible for β-lactam antibiotic resistance), RNAi, and conjugation in gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococci.
RNA Interference (RNAi) systems
RNA interference is the silencing of genes using small RNA molecules (Daka and Peer 2012). It has many potential uses where the synthesis of specific proteins must be prevented. Therapies using RNAi to treat diseases include those for glaucoma, hepatitis C virus, HIV, various forms of cancer, and diseases of the central nervous system have been investigated (Deng et al, 2013), (Ramachandran Keiser and Davidson, 2013). The versatility of RNAi allows for applications in fields beyond healthcare, such as agriculture. RNAi can be used to improve the nutritional value of crops and bioremediation potential"

CAS Conference Synthetic Biology - Munich
From July, 23rd to 25th our team went to Munich, Germany, to visit the CAS ( Center for Advanced Studies ) Conference for Synthetic Biology. This was a great opportunity to listen to highly exciting. E.g. we learned from Jay Keasling (UC Berkeley) about the latest developments on fuel making bacteria and from Brynne Stanton ( Voigt Lab at UCSF ) about chemical wires and logical gates.
From our Marburg Center for Synthetic Microbiology ( SYNMIKRO ), Lotte Søgaard-Andersen presented her approaches to define modules for regulation of cell polarity. On the second day there was a meeting of all attendees of various iGEM teams.  Here we had the first opportunity to exchange ideas with participants not only from Germany but also from London and Wageningen . The conference offered much time to communicate with other iGEM teams and to learn about their experiences and the progress of their projects.
Legoland for scientists - Göttingen
The iGEM team from the Georg-August-University of Göttingen organized an information day on September 7. During this event they presented their project to the public and discussed synthetic biology. For this meeting, our instructor Prof. Michael Bölker, was invited to give a talk on chances and possibilities of synthetic biology. Two other speakers, the journalist Sascha Karberg and Dr. Anna Deplazes Zemp (Institute of Biomedical Ethics, ETH Zurich) completed the information day by a critical view and considerations of ethical problems connected with synthetic biology.
Afterwards a stage discussion with the invited speakers and a representative of the biotech seed company “KWS” was set up. Thanks to well-prepared questions the audience could enjoy a critical and informative exchange of arguments.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2015,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Public Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," China’s total water resources is almost invariant, per capita water resource is less and less.
Compared with uncontrollable reasons, controllable part should be paid more attention to, because we can solve the problem through our efforts.
Controllable part covers water pollution, waste water and underwater over-exploitation.
Figure  6.5.5 2001 Percentage of Heavy-polluted water in China
Heavy-polluted water includes water of class IV, V and under class V according to Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water (GB3838-2002).
Data resource: The Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China
We can clearly see the situation of the water pollution in China in 2001 in figure 6.5.5. The percentage of heavy-polluted water in total water resources is over 75% in Ningsia, Shantung, Shanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanghai and Tientsin. In China, the percentage of heavy-polluted rivers is about 31.4%, and the percentage of heavy-polluted lakes is about 68.1%.Much water is too contaminated to be used or drunk, which causes quality-induced water shortage.
The second reason is about the over-use of water. For example, except for waste of water in daily life, effective utilization of agriculture water is about 40%,which is extremely low and only half the level of the developed countries（Yao, R. 2004）.
Figure  6.5.6 2010 Degree of groundwater Exploitation in China
Data resource: The Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China
Underwater over-exploitation is also an important problem, which will cause deterioration of water quality, ground surface settlement, and seawater intrusion. Taking Shenyang in Liaoning Province as an example, when the area of groundwater depression cone reaches 400 square kilometers, the underground water level will drop about 1 meters every year, and groundwater storage will unwater 280 thousand tons everyday(Tan,H,2013). As figure 6.5.6, the water shortage problem is running the vicious cycle. The area with most serve water shortage problem is also facing underwater over-exploitation.This also proves that underground water system is vulnerable compare to any other water body in the world.

Design Notes
In our design, merR was isolated from the operon and assembled with constitutive promoters of certain strength to maintain its expression intensity at certain level. For the same reason, the divergent promoter Pr was also removed by deletion of its -35 region(Fig.3).
Fig.3. DNA sequence of the Tn21 mer operator promoter region. The MerR binding site on PmerT is marked by a box. The -35 and -10 regions for both PmerR and PmerTPAD are marked with boxes, and the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence that MerR recognizes and binds to is marked with arrows under the DNA sequence. (A) The divergently oriented promoters are marked by blue box and purple box, respectively.  (B) In our project, the expression intensity of MerR should be maintained exogenously, so the divergent promoter Pr (of MerR transcript) was also removed by deletion of its -35 region. The resulted promoter sequence is marked with a dark purple box Modiﬁed from (Hobman, Wilkie et al. 2005)
By annealing PmerT-forward (5’-3’) and PmerT-reverse (5’-3’) primers, Ptpcad carrying a sticky end of EcoRI and SpeI was cloned upstream of BBa_E0840, a GFP generator. With exogenous expression of  MerR in bacteria, GFP’s expression could be induced by Hg (II) in a dose response manner(Fig.4).

We cut 5x5 cm piece of copper, put nail polish on several 2x2 cm copper pieces, and centrifuged cells. We made 1L liquid media and used pH paper to test for pH. The pH was around 3-4 and so we added in more sulfuric acid. The pH still did not change. We put our cells back in the 9 flasks, each containing 100 mL of just made liquid media (AFM). The flasks were placed into a shaker.
July 27
The flasks were still clear from one day of shaking. We centrifuged one of the flasks and found out that there was no pellet. We used a pH meter and found out that the liquid media pH was a little below 1, which meant that all our cells, from July 24, died. We discarded the contents of all 9 flasks, cleaned them, and autoclaved them.

Server Part
The server of Biohub 2.0 are written in Python 3.6, which is an easy-to-write and cross-platform language and can lower the learning curve of developing plugins. We choose Django to be the basic framework, partly for it allows fast prototyping and large-scale deployment, partly for it already contains a matured plugin system (Django App Framework). However such plugin system is static, which means plugins cannot be loaded/unloaded during runtime. It will be a great deficiency for a website that may frequently alternate its components. To solve the problem, we build our own plugin system on the basis of the one in Django. We carefully monkey-patched Django's underlying implementation to make its core components (URL resolving, data model registration, and etc.) dynamically changeable,  whilst avoiding possible memory leaks. We also supplemented Django by adding many new features:
Hot Reload: Other processes can send SIGUSR1 signal to Biohub 2.0's worker processes to inform them that the installed plugin list has changed and the server needs to be reloaded. By this way the server can be renewed without stopping.
WebSocket Routing: Websocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, which is supported by most of modern browsers. Biohub 2.0 develops a customized protocol over Websocket, making it easier to route Websocket packets. We have used this protocol to achieve real-time notification sending and notifying accomplishment events in ABACUS plugin.
Background Tasks: As a website designed for synthetic biology, their must be many computation intensive tasks, which will blocks requests if handled inappropriately. Thus we split out and encapsulate this logic and make it an independent module. Background tasks can use websocket to notify certain events. Currently we have used in ABACUS computing.
The modules are all available for plugins, so developers can take advantages of them to build amazing artworks.
About the Bricks Data
Biohub 2.0 is constructed on the base of Biobricks data, which comes from two channels. We use the data downloaded from offical interface as our initial data. The initial data is actually a snapshot of iGEM, containing most information of the bricks. However certain fields, such as group name or parameters,"
Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#TeamBITCHINA_-_-_TEXT.html," residuals.
Results and inspirations
The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of $H_2O_2$ and the fluorescence intensity divided by the OD value, which the $H_2O_2$ is in the interval from 0 to 2.5$mM$. And we also analyze the residuals of the model to ensure it works well. With this model, we can properly predict the output when the concentration of $H_2O_2$ is in certain interval.

The Mathematical Model
In a coculture where the organisms are dependent on each other for survival, a mathematical model can be useful to predict the stability of the system under different conditions. To that end, we worked on developing a model to aid us in our work of creating a stable coculture system. The mathematical model described here is based on a paper by Kerner et al. [1].
A Substrate-Constrained System
Our model relies on the assumption that the system is substrate-constrained. For the production organism, this is quite realistic, as the only substrate available will be the acetate produced by Synechocystis. In the case of our cyanobacterium, the limiting substrate in the model is the amino acid produced by the production organism (arginine for E. coli and B. subtilis, and glutamine for S. cerevisiae and Y. lipolytica), for which Synechocystis is auxotrophic. While this amino acid is required by the cyanobacterium, it is not guaranteed to always be rate limiting. For instance, the amount of light could be the limiting factor under certain conditions, especially as the OD increases with the growth of the cells, restricting the penetration of light through the medium. Another conceivable limitation is the CO2 used by Synechocystis during photosynthesis, but that should be relatively simple to maintain abundant levels of. For this model we have assumed that we will be able to maintain conditions where the amino acid will be the growth-limiting factor.
Mathematical Relations
For a substrate-constrained system governed by Monod kinetics, growth can be described with the following equations [1]. Just like in the article, we have not taken cell death into account in this first simple system.
The first two rows of equations describe regular substrate-constrained Monod-governed growth, where µ is the growth rate [1/h], n is the cell density [g DW/L], k is the maximum growth rate [1/h], K is the substrate affinity [mol/L], and c is the concentration of cross-fed"
Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," then measuring OD, activating the AB using specific wavelengths of photons, measuring OD again and again over constant time-lapses, and then shining on the cells with the activation wavelength again. Here are some of the results we got from select wells:
When we saw these results, we decided to look closer at the data, and bring to our aid the fact that the plate readers measured the OD at 16 different points (a 4x4 grid) within each well. We were then able to see what happens to the standard variation during the spike, and we saw that it actually plummets:
This means that the OD in all of the well suddenly becomes uniform, as opposed to having some variance between the concentration of bacteria for different locations throughout the well.  We believe this was caused by the fact that the clusters were partially broken by the temporary change in the form of the AB caused by the shining of light – causing the OD to increase overall, while becoming more uniform.
Conclusion
From these experiments we have concluded that there could definitely be some kind of interaction between the AB and the bacteria, causing them to form unusually large clusters, our results were far from neat and orderly (some wells without any AB to begin with showed the formation of clusters) but that might just be due to the volatile nature of Azo-Benzene.
To find out more about this phenomenon we first need to be able to show a clean control run of the protocol we formulated for the robot. We plan to do just that in the time leading up to the competition and come closer to characterizing the nature of the affect AB has on bacteria like E.Coli.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,". Phosphorylated intermediates then freely bind as repressors to the corresponding output gene (cyan for red light, yellow for blue light). With the green light sensor, a signal inverter will be introduced, as the FixJ system acts as an activator not a repressor (the exact opposite of what we want). Instead of acting on the gene coding for the output (magenta) the phosphorylated intermediate binds instead to a gene coding for the cI protein used in the lambda phage (a bacteriophage which infects E. coli). Once synthesised the cl protein acts as the output (magenta) repressor.

Potential Applications
Our project is potentially relevant and applicable to many areas within technology, industry and even medicine. One of our fundamental aims was to design a system that would allow other teams or users to use any gene they desired as the set output gene, thus allowing progression and greater freedom whilst also accommodating a range of other projects. The development of a true bacterial camera would also hold its own niche alongside other paths of photography, it even presents a number of positive advancements on standard digital photography. Incredibly high resolution images are possible, whilst noise problems could potentially be avoided and the technology may even have applications for low light photography. Light targeted therapies could be introduced that use bacteria inserted into a wound or other area of the body to produce the relevant drug or treatment. This would be very beneficial in the strive for ever less invasive methods of treatment.

For the mutagenesis of aroG, we ran a PCR reaction without polymerase, to have a comparison on the gel.
No bands were visible for either the positive and the negative mutagenesis PCR reaction. However, it is possible that a cluster of annealed plasmids didn't move into the gel, since there is a high signal in the well. Luckily, Misha told us, E.coli is capable of untangling this, so a transformation might still work.
We also put the methylsalicylate producing brick into a new backbone, pSB1C3.
In order to reconstruct the methylsalicylate brick for higher production, we also transformed the bricks 13B5 and 1M3, respectively pTetR+RBS and the lacI coding sequence on ampicillin and chloramphenicol plates, respectively.

Week 7: Megaprimer
We started the construction of new biobricks:
pTetR + strong RBS
lacI + strong RBS
strong RBS + MIT 2006 brick
The methylsalicylate producing brick (MIT 2006) in the pSB1C3 backbone was cut with EcoRI and PstI and put on gel. (Picture below, second lane, two bands: approximately 2000 and 3000 bp) We will now send this brick to be sequenced, so we will get a confirmation that this is indeed an improved brick.
For the mutation of aroG, we repeated the mutagenesis PCR with the megaprimers,one reaction with polymerase (+) and one without (-).
One part of this was put on gel (picture below).

The rest was DpnI treated, and dialysed to remove salts, by adding it to a 2% agarose + water gel.
After 30 minutes the contents of the well were pipetted out and electroporated.
Furthermore we performed a Phire II PCR reaction on our methyl salicylate brick, to obtain good PCR products of the bsmt1 and pchBA genes seperately (we need to get rid of the lacI operon in between, since it would interfere with the rest of the model).

Abstract
     Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.
     Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or affected area. We envision our system not only being useful in such applications, but also being capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer.
All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor"

Model 4: The total protein level at the community level
Introduction
In model 1, we treated bacteria at the single cell level. In model 2, we predict the secretion and surface display efficiency of proteins base on the SPusp45 secretion signal peptide and cA anchoring domain. In model 3, we used non-parametric method to predict the growth rate of bacteria at the community level. Here, we try to combine the 3 models together to get a compound model to calculate the total protein level that can be surface displayed at the community level.
Figure 4.1 Schematic representation of the total protein level at the community level.
Modeling
We combined the best growth curve and the gene expression rate, using matlab to realize our idea by programming.
Analysis and Results
We found that when the concentration of nisin is 1 IU, the efficiency of protein expression level that can reach a peak is better than other nisin concentrations. This combined model can be used in the nisin controlled expression system, and reduce the workload of researchers.

The plastic companies will only be able to use our plastic if it fulfills the customer's wish for sustainability. Since our plastic is biodegradable, there will be limitations to its use. The final choice of material will be made by the customer. It is therefore the customers.
Interviewing Morten Østergaard Andersen
In relation to the possible functions our biodegradable plastic can fulfill in medicine, we consulted Morten Østergaard Andersen. Morten is an Associate Professor at the Southern University of Denmark, researching in different biomaterials. Morten introduced us to several experiments, which we could conduct for our plastic Nygaard, J. V., et al. (2008). ""Investigation of Particle-Functionalized Tissue Engineering Scaffolds Using X-Ray Tomographic Microscopy"" Biotechnology and Bioengineering 100(4): 820-829. Andersen, M. Ø.., et al. (2010). ""Surface functionalisation of PLGA nanoparticles for gene silencing."" Biomaterials 31: 5671-5677. . One of them was how we could use our plastic for coating for different proteins. The plastic could for instance be used for coating of antimicrobial peptides onto implants. The PHB will decompose slowly, which also means that the antimicrobial peptides will be released continuously from the implant and thereby reducing possible infections and biofilm. The PHB could also be used as the implant itself in cases where e.g. the bone needs a scaffold until it has healed. However, here we should be aware of the side effects of using PHB as bone implants, if the patient is also ingesting bone stimulating drugs. These drugs can lead to the formation of bones other places in the body than intended to. Mr. Andersen made us also aware of the side effect with the use of PHB inside the body.
Mr. Andersen introduced us to how we could 3D print our plastic. He also provided us with materials about plastic polymers, which we could use for background knowledge and for inspiration of possible opportunities. Furthermore, Mr. Andersen gave us the contact to two of his master students; Martin and Casper. They had the knowledge and the equipment to make the 3D printing possible. This corporation also provided them with a new experience, since it was the first time they had the opportunity to print with this type of plastic material and see how it responded to the 3D printing.

DISCUSSION
Ⅰ. What We‘ve Achieved
ü We helped new iGEMers.
Figure 1 Team Numbers in iGEM from 2013 to 2015
From the figure we can find that each year many new teams participate in iGEM. This year, 111 new teams took part in the competition for the first time. Thus, it is necessary to give some advice to new iGEMers and we managed to invite both old and new teams to share their experience about team establishment. We believe that there is some important reference to iGEMers.
ü We connected software teams to wet teams.
We published the sixth issue-a special issue about software, trying to make software teams and wet teams work together. The open-ended questionnaire about software drew great attention from wet teams and we hope some vision will somehow guide the future software teams.
ü We tried to give feedback to judges.
To make the competition better, we add the part called “About Competition System”. It was clear that Latin America faces important issues to do research. Last year, Team UFMG_Brazil (2014) made a survey in Latin America and we’ ve found that in addition to infra-structure, funding was indicated as the main difficulty to do Science. Yet the feedback can hardly reach the judges. One of our friends Zamorano who cannot come to the Giant Jamboree wrote that: In a sense, the competition might be too strict, stopping some people from being able to compete. The amount of money necessary to compete might be limiting to some teams. We publish these words, appealing to help those friends. Also, it is the first time that high school teams come to the Jamboree. Yet they argue that they should be judged differently.
ü We managed to attract experts.

$$ K=\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}=\frac{(NR_p-[RL])(L_t-[RL])}{[RL]}=\frac{\frac{(NR_p-RL)(L_t-RL)}{{(VN_A)}^2}}{{\frac{RL}{VN_A}}} $$
Replacing $RL$ as $x$, we can have follow function
$$ x^2-(NR_p +L_t +KVN_A)x+NR_pL_t=0 $$
The solve of this quadratic function are
$$ x_{1,2}=\frac{NR_p+L_t+KVN_A\pm \sqrt{{(NR_p+L_t+KVN_A)}^2-4L_tNR_p}}{2} $$
According to the limitation $RL \lt R$,we remain this solve to calculate the concentration of ligand-receptor compound in the testing system.
$$ RL_t=x_1=\frac{NR_p+L_t+KVN_A- \sqrt{{(NR_p+L_t+KVN_A)}^2-4L_tNR_p}}{2} $$
Now we simply use the expectation of the activated histamine receptor in each cell,which is defined as $ERL=\frac{RL_t}{N}$ to approximate the reality.This figure below demonstrates the  relation between concentrations of histamine and the activated histamine receptor.
$$RL_t=f(L_t)$$
Signal pathway in a yeast
This part o model displays the modified pheromone pathway in the yeast. The input signal is the concentration of activated receptor in a yeast. The system is constructed by GPCR, MAPK and the expression of the EGFP gene. And the output is the concentration of EGFP.In this part, we use Simbiology in MATLAB to construct and simulate our model.
Compartment Diagram
Model details
The species, parameters and functions of the model can be found in Model Files.
Model Analysis
First, we took a glance at the input time series (activated histamine receptor) and the transcription fact (ste12active) which is the output of MAPK cascade.
In this figure, the degradation of activated histamine receptor (RL) and the output of signal transmission (ste12active) is demonstrated. We are surprised that the system -- GPCR and MAPK in series connection has a function of pulse broadening. This function is because the amplification of MAPK cascade, which ensures the output transcription factor is stable while the input is really low. Thus, this part of the cascade ensures the"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

HKUST RICE University
Houston, TX
Their interest in producing biosensors for the “big three” plant nutrients especially using a cell-free expression system coincides with our ideal goal of producing a protein based colorimetric sensor system with hopes of immobilizing the protein in a portable microfluidic device for use in the field. We offered our facilities as a data validation collaboration where we would transform and characterize their systems using various strains across varied conditions but the delivery of the plasmids did not arrive until after the wiki freeze.
Genspace
Brooklyn, NY
The Genspace iGEM team offered to collaborate on characterizing an E. coli Nitrate Biosensor consisting of the YeaR promoter element driving a fluorescent protein and regulated by the NsrR repressor element that inhibits transcription in the absence of nitrates and nitrites. Unfortunately, the assembly of said part was not completed in time for us to test using our strains.

Genetic circuit
Equations
In the absence of IPTG
Equation 1: Equation describing the rate of transcription of LacI MRNA (MLacI):
kmlacI is the transcription rate of MlacI (a measure of promoter strength) and dmlacI is the degradation rate. At steady state:
Equation 2: Equation describing the rate of translation of LacI protein (PlacI)
At steady state:
where klacI is the translation rate of lacI protein and dplacI is the degradation rate of PlacI.Equations 3 and 4 describe the transcription and translation of the protein of interest Pout.
Equation 3: Transcription of Pout
Unlike in the previous case, the output promoter is inducible. In the absence of further information, we model the effect of LacI on transcription/ POPS activity with a Hill function, which represses when amounts are above the threshold K, and activates when PlacI amounts fall below threshold. Such assumption can be revised in the light of contradicting experimental data.
At steady state:
Equation 4: Equation describing the rate of translation of protein of interest   Pout:
At steady state:
When IPTG is introduced
When IPTG is added into the system, LacI can bind to it, forming an intermediate complex [IPTG-LacI]:
k1 and k2 are the dissociation constants of the forward and reverse reactions. Therefore, we can modify Equation 2 to include the effects of IPTG on the LacI system as follows:
Equation 2 modified:
Note that now, the effects of IPTG have been included. The –k2[Plac][IPTG] term contributes negatively, as it removes PLac from the system. The k1[IPTG-Plac] term contributes positively, as it re-stores the levels of PLac in the system.  The equations that describe the evolution of IPTG and IPTG-LacI are-
Equation 5: Rate of change of IPTG in the system:
Equation 6: Rate of change of intermediate [IPTG-Plac] complex in the system.

Science research speaker series
We invited 5 science researchers to come to our campus to give lectures about their research.  This was done to expanding our knowledge about how actual scientific research is done.  IN addition, it was great to talk to the speakers about our project and to run our project ideas by them
Teacher Bioethics Panel
We hosted a teacher panel to discuss, debate, and congregate knowledge from different fields including but not limited to philosophy, science, and policy. The teachers engage in a passionate exchange of ideas do discuss questions regarding ethics and the progress of synthetic biology. From this event, we extracted the prime cause for the public to avoid using GMO products and trajectory of scientific research.

Today was our official iGEM kickoff with one of our Platinum sponsors, the Alberta Ingenuity Fund (AIF).  This was a great way to meet some of the AIF people that are generously sponsoring our the Alberta iGEM teams this year.  We watched a presentation on iGEM, the experience, the jamboree and competiton in general.  This kind of woke us up to how competitive iGEM is and also gave us some motivation to really get our project in gear!  We talked about the upcoming workshops that AIF will be hosting.
There will be Dragon's Den in May as well as an Ethics Workshop at U Calgary.  In July/ August there will also be a Wiki workshop as well as a presentation skills workshop.  We asked some questions about these workshops and discussed the general timeline of the Summer.  After the meeting, we had lunch and got to informally talk to some of the AIF representatives about our project and iGEM in general and we got to talk to our team mates about the project, starting to come up with some ideas.  The kick-off was overall quite exciting, especially as for many of us, this is the first time we've participated in iGEM.  It looks like"

Laboratory Biosecurity
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
It has now become necessary to expand this traditional approach to biosafety through the introduction of laboratory biosecurity measures. Global events in the recent past have highlighted the need to protect laboratories and the materials they contain from being intentionally compromised in ways that may harm people, livestock, agriculture or the environment. Before the laboratory biosecurity needs of a facility can be defined, however, it is important to understand the distinction between “laboratory biosafety” and “laboratory biosecurity”.
“Laboratory biosafety” is the term used to describe the containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release. “Laboratory biosecurity” refers to institutional and personal security measures designed to prevent the loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins.
We must understand these concepts and cooperate to gather appropriate information.
Declaration of Helsinki
Medical applications are often seen in iGEMs projects. The effect of the application of GMOs on human beings is still unknown. Moreover, we must also consider patients’ health and privacy. Concerning this sensitive issue, World Medical Association established Declaration of Helsinki.
Declaration of Helsinki says as follows:
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional.
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee"

Since PNB was founded, Colciencias has been working in developing policies and defining action plans, in a way to adapt to biotechnology’s fast development global scale, meeting the country’s needs and enabling the opportunities that this technology brings to Colombia (Colciencias).
CorpoGen is a private non-profit organization that has established itself as a center of excellence in scientific research and technological development in Colombia. The Corporation meets with a multidisciplinary group who shares infrastructure and resources to integrate three causes: scientific research, formation of human resources and the development and sale of biotechnological services and products (CorpoGen).
The Biotechnology field has the government projects as its main financing source; it allocates money to science, technology and education. Other resources come from private companies, production, credit and venture capital.
The Biotechnology field will try to establish Colombia as a world class industry  within the next  8-10 years (Pena 2008),  supporting  biotechnological initiates in different regional with ongoing projects Besides,  has been supported strengthening and the creation of research  and development involving different areas in the value chain of biotechnology in various sectors: agribusiness (agriculture, livestock and food industry); pharmaceutical and health; cosmetics and toiletries; environment and energy; plastics and rubber; textiles and leather goods; metallurgical and auto parts; industrial and medical gases; printing industry; among others, contribute to the development of the biotechnology industry.
In the next 8-10 years, the biotechnology industry should be established as an engine of development for the country from the generation and expansion of knowledge and the strengthening of its economic and social impacts, through the appropriate use of scientific and technological resources available. Also, be one of the most competitive areas for Colombia and those who make major contributions to technological development, improving quality of life, job creation and environmental preservation (Pena, 2008).

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html,".
Contrary to the previous case, some patents may protect wide discoveries (also known as foundational patents). For instance, the patent granted to Myriad Genetics covered the whole gene functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and all applications that could follow on possible ways to diagnose and cure breast cancer. This kind of patent stood against innovation, preventing any creative use of those genes by any other actor than Myriad Genetics, or leading to any other use linked to this DNA sequence (possibly there would have been many, considering the complexity of biological regulations).
As a consequence, the patent system may allow the formation of major entry barriers on some industrial domains. It is notably the case in some markets of the pharmaceutical industry in which new companies cannot easily enter anymore because they would need to buy the licenses of many expensive patents from the incumbent firms.
Last but not least, the philosophical questions raised in the last two centuries concerning patents are to be considered. As this is not a philosophical essay, we will content ourselves with a brief summary. According to the American economist Thorstein Veblen (1908), a patent is illegitimate as it privatizes a collective work any invention crucially depends on the previous ones : how would a trolley have been invented if the wheel had not been invented before ? Veblen emphasizes this idea when he argues that:
The initiative and technological enterprise of individuals, such as shown in inventions and discoveries of more and better ways and means for instance, proceeds on and enlarges the accumulated wisdom of the past. Individual initiative has no chance except on the ground afforded by the common stock, and the achievements of such initiative are of no effect except as accretions to the common stock. And the invention or discovery so achieved always embodies so much of what is already given that the creative contribution of the inventor or discoverer is trivial by comparison. (1908)
This thinking still applies nowadays on different themes. So the question remains : why should a sole actor gather all the economic benefits from this collective process?
Consequently, in some cases, having an economic alternative to the patent system may actually be a good thing. In this perspective the leading economists Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz assert that :
The patent system is only one part of a society's innovation system, through which the production of knowledge is financed, incentivized and organized. Too much attention has been focused on IPR (intellectual property rights), and too little on alternatives, e.g. open source systems, publicly financed innovation and prizes. (2010)
In a recent paper, Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz (2010) argue that the"

Introduction
Over the summer we worked with nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). We developed a B. subtilis strain capable of oligo-mediated genome engineering and used this strain to alter a NRPS. We also investigated methods of screening for novel products with desired activities.
Background
Nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) are large multimodular enzymes that synthesize nonribosomal peptides, which are short bioactive peptides with a broad range of functions, including antibiotics, immunosuppressants and anticancer drugs.

MAGE subtilis
Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) utilises cyclical recombination with short oligonucleotides in order to achieve a high allelic replacement efficiency and can be used to quickly generate cell populations with varying phenotypes. We introduced oligo-mediated genome engineering into Bacillus subtilis and used it to alter a nonribosomal peptide synthetase.

Tyrocidine
Tyrocidine is a mixture of non-ribosomal peptides. It can only be used topically due to its toxicity. We sought to express the tyrocidine synthase cluster in B. subtilis to make novel derivatives with oligo-mediated recombineering.

Lab-on-a-disc
Lab-on-a-disc is a potential screening method for our MAGE NRPS products. After screening for antimicrobial activity, prospective MAGE edited NRPS products could be tested for different beneficial properties. One example is a quick screening method for cytotoxicity.

Intein
When one method fails the Synthesizer team has to innovate! We explored an alternative approach for generating short, cyclized peptides with similar length to tyrocidine by using self-splicing proteins. These short, self-splicing proteins that have no function in the proteins they are a part of, besides catalyzing their own excision after translation, are called inteins. The splicing creates"

Finally, the cultures were spun down and compared as follows: the RFP pellets obtained under blue-light versus dark condition, and wild type samples versus mutant samples.
Quantitative approach
TrpR mutant and wild type cells were co transformed using 5 µL of each plasmid (trpL-RFP in pSB1C3/ pSB1A2 and each LovTAP construction in pSB3K3). As controls RFP constitutively expressed under J23102 promoter was used and wild type cells transformed just with trpL-RFP. For each transformation one  tube containing 5 ml of  LB medium with Kanamicyn and chloramphenicol or Kanamicyn and ampicillin, was inoculated from  a single colony of DH5α. Cultures were grown  overnight (~14hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 100rpm under blue light (470nm) conditions. Then cultures were diluted 1:1000 into 5ml of fresh LB media with antibiotics. These were grown for approximately 4.5 hours under the previous conditions under blue light (470nm). After this step the OD600 was measured from each culture.  Based on this OD measurement, the cultures were diluted to the same OD (0.15) in 5 ml of LB fresh media. Then three 200 µL aliquots from each culture were transferred into a flat-bottomed 96 well plate.
Samples were loaded in the plate as is shown in the next picture:
An initial measurement of OD600 and fluorescence (530/25 nm excitation filter, 590/35 nm emission filter) by triplicate was done. Using the light emission device to irradiate the incubator, the plate was maintained during 17 hrs at 37°C with spinning at 35rpm inside the incubator but with a mask in the samples selected for the dark conditions.  Then, a second measurement of OD600 and fluorescence was done. Initial data with the second measurement were compared.  Background absorbance and fluorescence were determined by measuring wells containing only media, and the values obtained were used to normalize the other samples.

Phage propagate primarily via two different mechanisms:
Lytic
Lysogenic
A lot of phage therapy today focuses on using phages lytic in nature to eradicatebacterial populations. However our phage utilizes lysogeny to suppress toxin productionand leave the clostridium ​difficile ​in the gut as a commensal bacteria.
The rational fear for this is:
Able to fend of potentially more harmful opportunistic pathogens
Take up space in the gut
By not rapidly lysing whole populations of bacteria, the release of relatively highconcentrations of potentially harmful enzymes and other intracellular componentsis avoided which might further exacerbate the dysbiotic environment in thegastrointestinal tract.
How are we doing this: We are synthetically engineering a temperate phage to express geneticconstructs that we will use against Clostridium difficile to stop them from synthesizing toxins.The first genetic construct is antisense RNA, and the second is dead Cas9

Using Precision Metabolic Engineering to Save Lives
Micronutrient deficiencies plague impoverished and developing nations throughout the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 2 billion people - representing more than 30% of the world’s population - suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. However, diagnosis of micronutrient deficiency has proven to be extremely expensive and often time-consuming. To address this growing concern, medical professionals and synthetic biologists have created simple, inexpensive biosensors that serve as handy diagnostic tests to use in the field. Nevertheless, these versatile tools still suffer from errors that can yield inaccurate results and even lead to faulty diagnosis. With this in mind, the 2016 Lambert iGEM Team focused primarily on how to enhance existing biosensors and subsequently aid in the diagnosis of micronutrient deficiencies throughout the world.
The Styczynski Group at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech) is working on developing a zinc micronutrient biosensor. After collaborating with the lab at GaTech, we gained a better understanding of some of the problems that biosensor development often faced. Oftentimes, biosensors do not consistently yield accurate responses to specific signals because of severe leakiness that may exist in the system or fluctuations in the affinities of biosensing promoters used in the system. Moreover, the overexpression of one pigment (or GFP) over another can cause misreadings. Such was the case with GaTech’s zinc biosensor - the overexpression of the pigment Violacein over the other pigments caused the system to be difficult to interpret.
Conference at Georgia Tech with Dr. Styczynski and Monica McNerney
Consequently, we studied protein degradation and devised a “Switch” that attempts to prevent this sort of overexpression and subsequently fine tune the overall accuracy of biosensors in general. We used SsrA tagged reporters in an inducible plasmid construct to characterize the relative strength of degradation as well as learn more about the protease ClpXP. To further characterize ClpXP, we used three different strains of E. coli cells (DH10, Keio Wild ClpX Knockout, Keio Wild ClpP Knockout) from the ECSC Yale Keio registry. The Keio strains are specific E. coli strains that express distinct gene knock"

The “Specify” page was designed to encompass all parts of microfluidic design specification using LFR and UCF files, and this page is integrated with the uShroom mapper tool to convert designs to a MINT elaboration. In this IDE, users can define a microfluidic chip with specific inputs, outputs, and functionality. Designers can also define microfluidic chip parameters such as gradient generators, serpentine mixers and cell traps here. The Specify IDE provides a terminal for interfacing with uShroom mapper, and an editor for writing and editing files. This editor also provides syntax highlighting for LFR and UCF files, and error checking for improperly created files. Also, the Specify IDE has a user interface element for creating new microfluidic operators, making it very easy for designers to add new parts to their chip.
Neptune's Design Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptunes “Design” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through MINT. The “Design” page was created to encompass all the subtleties of elaborating a microfluidic chip using MINT files and configuration files. In this IDE, users can edit the fine aspects of their chip. A developer in this IDE has control over the sizing of each channel, port, valve and primitive in their design. Here users can also modify parameters related to how Fluigi compiles and outputs a design schematic. Parameters like chip dimensions are also defined in this section. The “Design” page also provides a visual preview the microfluidic design generated, allowing designers to see their chip layout as they modify their device. Design schematics generated on the “Design” page are immediately integrated with the build, assembly, and control sections of Neptune, allowing for clean navigation through the workflow.
Neptune's Workspaces | Kestas Subacius
Neptune was designed to be a easy-to-use desktop application. To this end, a file system had to be developed for Neptune that would allow for designers to store their designs locally on their computer, and to modify these designs through Neptune. Neptune was implemented like many other IDE’s, where designers can select workspaces on their computer,"

Extract using a needle and puncturing the side of the tube, placing the needle at the bottom of the tube.
Extract about 2 mL of phage at a time. Add about 1.5 to one eppendorf.
When the needle is removed place another eppendorf under the hole to catch any leaking phage and fill it with the remainder of the phage in the needle.
V) Results
The phage didn't band anywhere. After running a spot test it appears that the phage where present in every aliquot extracted.

Choosing Target Substrates and PCR Primers
Possible target substrate:
Single Colonies
Bacteria Solution
Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction

Perfect Printware think that our design (the draft that they have) is virtually impossible to print.
We could get them to do a simpler version for more money (£20+ on white shirts).
The purple is causing problems.
We could change supplier.
Spectrum Imaging have said that they cannot do it for us.
We need to prepare to do it ourselves (print+iron).
A late design decision to go from '09 to just 09.
Poster
Jess has created a draft poster design which uses Mat's diagram as a central focus to split the poster into sections about each sub-project.

1.2 Results and Conclusions
Based on the scores obtained in the steps described before, we constructed figure 2. In figure 2, the classification in the three categories, natural EPO, artificial EPO and other DNA, is displayed. Here, the alignment scores to natural human DNA are displayed on the x-axis and the alignment scores to artificial EPO are put on the y-axis. The blue sector shows the natural human EPO sequence and derivatives with a 6% misread rate ( Loman et al., 2015 ) resulting from sequencing. All have a positive alignment score to natural EPO.
The green points represent the DNA sequences of 150 bps from the genes other than EPO. The red points are the gene doping DNA which consists of a diverse set of codon varied EPO sequences as well as animal EPO sequences.
From figure 2, it becomes apparent we chose the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The k-nearest neighbours algorithm is good at identifying local structures in datasets, which is essential with the large spread of scores that have been attributed to the gene doping sequences. Additionally, the value of a learning algorithm is highlighted because of the variable properties of gene doping DNA. The algorithm was tested with alignments based on four scoring weight distributions (figures 2-5). For the figures with all weight distributions, please see the dropdown below figure 2.
Figure 2. The classification of natural EPO with 6% misread rate ( Loman et al., 2015 ), artificial EPO and any other DNA based on alignment scores with natural EPO and artificial EPO sequences in the database. The weights attached to local, global and overlap alignment are 1-10-1 respectively.
Weighing Alignment Scores
In order to determine the influence of the alignment algorithm on the classification abilities of the program we varied the weights attached to the scores from each algorithm systematically. The best performing algorithm is shown in figure 2 and adheres most value to the global alignment score. With this weighting, we were able to distinguish more than 80% of the sequences designed by our team and the cyber security specialists at the Hackathon . The classification resulting from the other weights was worse. The following figures display the scoring with the different weighings.

The primer is the reverse complementary of that sequence so we can use it as a reverse primer, which we used along with a suffix forward to introduce the trpL promoter into pSB1C3 plasmid by PCR.
Both LovTAP activator and repressor activity were of interest to characterize. So, the following constructions were designed.
LovTAP repressor activity: Reporter system
1.trpL promoter fused to GFP protein(BBa_E0240):
2.trpL promoter fused to RFP protein(BBa_E1010):
LovTAP activator activity: Reporter system
trpL promoter fused to lambda Repressor cI (BBa_P0451 + BBa_K098991) regulating GFP protein (BBa_E0240). Whit this system a double repression is generated to have a final activation response.
Characterizing LovTAP
Once LovTAP with the three weak constitutive promoters (J23117,123114 and J23105) and the strong promoter (J23102) was correctly obtained in plasmid pSB3K3, and the reporter system trpL+RFP was also finished  in plasmid pSB1C3 ,  the co-transformation procedure was done,  in order to have the whole system inside E.coli cells, both trpR wildtype and mutant. Besides, trpL+RFP construction in plasmid pSB1A2 from Lausanne team was kindly sent it by Edinburgh team. Both trpL-RFP reporter systems were used, being the Lausanne system the reference, expecting to obtain similar results. The difference between the reporter systems is that the constructed in plasmid pSB1C3 doesn’t have the transcriptional double terminator.
In order to test if LovTAP works correctly two protocols were implemented: the qualitative and the quantitative approach.
Considerations to take into account:
The RFP protein does not include a degradation tag, so the time required to notice a clear difference between light and dark states will be long, because although LovTAP starts to repress, the RFP produced previously by the cells will be still present.
The plasmid in which LovTAP is being express is pSB3K3 with"

Bio&Pretzels
Since 2014, the student council of our faculty organizes so called Bio&Pretzel talks, in a semi-formal atmospherere with beer and pretzels. The speaker, usually a professor or assistant professor, gives insight in his scientific field for a general audience: school students, freshmen of the university, relatives of the students, but also for ongoing scientists themselves. The aim of these talks is to inform the general audience, but also to give insights for ongoing scientists still looking for their scientific profession. Thus, it was a great honor for us as the iGEM team to have this opportunity. We talked about synthetic biology in general and the awesome applications which might be possible in future, and of course the responsibility which comes with it. We also outlined the idea of the iGEM competition, and presented our own topic. We told the audience about the importance of Vitamin B12, from which nutrients it can be uptaken, and how we could improve the efficiency of production with our synporter.
Our talk was received very well by the audience, and numerous questions from the scientific fraction were asked and answered. Probably the most important non-scientific question of the evening was, if, as beer is also containing a lot of vitamins, beer would be a good source of Vitamin B12. Sadly, we had to clarify that a human would need to drink 100 L of beer per day – which we do not recommend at all for a healthy and balanced nutrition.
Germany Meetup in Marburg
In August, we joined the Germany iGEM Meetup, organized by the iGEM Team Marburg . This Meetup gave us a great opportunity to learn to know each other, and to share our projects and ideas. During a whole day of colloquia, every team hat 10 min time to present their topic in a presentation.
Besides of that, we discovered the beautiful town of Marburg – the town of the fairy tales, and the town with the highest pub density in Germany. Also during the city tour with many stops at all the awesome sites, we got a further insight into the other teams, their strategies and their ideas, and so even plans for possible collaborations were developed in the late hour at the common table.
During a bubble soccer cup, we could also compare the physical strength of our team against the others. Answering the curious question of our bystanders, what exactly bubble soccer is, directly gave us a great opportunity to explain them synthetic biology.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Chemical Diffusion Model_-_-_TEXT.html," chemicals will diffuse through the PDMS layer as gas molecular.
For nonsteady-state diffusion, we use Fick’s second law to describe the process
\frac{C_x-C_0}{C_s-C_0}=1-erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}})
D(2-nonanone) = 6.78*10-6cm2/s in PDMS.
D(diacetyl) = 6.78*10-6cm2/s in PDMS.
Calculation details are shown in The Calculation of Diffusion Coefficient D
Concentration C is related to the position (distance x within PDMS) and the time variable t [2] .
For t=0, C=C0 at 0≤x≤∞;
For t>0, C=Cs (the constant surface concentration) at x=0;
C=C0 at x=∞ And then there is a general solution: Where Cx represents the concentration at distance x after time t.
\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}
=constant, so if this constant can be calculated, the equation of distance x and time t can also be gotten.
In our model, C0=0, so the equation is changed to \frac{C_x}{C_s}=1-erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{Dt}})
Cx represents the concentration at distance x that C. elegans can feel.
Cs is the initial concentration of the chemical gas.
We need to know the fractions of the chemicals in the gas because only the gas molecular can across the PDMS.
For ideal mixture of the two pure liquids, the compositions of the liquid and vapor follows from Dalton’s law that the mole fractions in the gas, yA (the mole fraction of diacetyl) and yB (the mole fraction of water) [3] , are
y_A=\frac{p_A}{p}\qquad y_B=\frac{p_B}{p}
pA and pB are the partial vapor pressure of component A and component B in the mixture, they follow the Raoult’s law:
p_A= x_A\cdot p^*_A\qquad p_B= x_B\cdot p^*_B
where p*A is the vapour pressure of pure A and p*B is that of pure B. The total vapor pressure p of the mixture is therefore:
p= p_A+p_B =x_\cdot^*_A + x_\cdot^*_B= p^*_B+(p^*_B-p^*_A)

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," example they have very few laboratories that are doing amplification test and that would be the same for chlamydia.
Daniel C.:
What is the reason? The expense? Or the lack of proper laboratory equipment?
Dr. Meyer:
They don't have many laboratories in these countries and the laboratories that use the test are of course expensive and most of the patients that need this test are not able to pay for it and there is not something like a public insurance that will cover this cost.
Daniel C.:
How expensive would a test be?
Dr. Meyer:
Probably it's not the same like here in Germany. This is different in all countries. In Germany a chlamydia test would cost about 20 euro with a public insurance. This is not the same in other countries it could be even more, and if you have a private insurance it will be definitely more, so it may also be 30 or 40 euros or dollars for a chlamydia test. You can do this test in developing countries only if this is sponsored by NGOs.
Daniel C.:
We were browsing some of your papers to prepare ourselves. And we found a method for confirming chlamydial antigens, using fluorescence antibodies against LPS [lipopolysaccharides] and or DFA. And we were wondering: How can a fluorescent antibody against LPS be specific for chlamydia.
Dr. Meyer:
Yeah, definitely. There is still room for improvement, the awareness could be higher. There have been efforts to raise awareness in the last few years and I think to a certain degree these efforts have succeeded, but compared to other countries and in the first place I would like to mention Scandinavia, the awareness in Germany is not high enough.
Daniel C.:
[What is] your opinion about our project?
Dr. Meyer:
OK, this is a part of a review paper. Itˋs a test that has been used in the past very frequently and it is based on antibodies directed against the chlamydial LPS antigens and and these antibodies are labelled with fluorescent molecules. You are right, LPS is present in all gram-negative bacteria. But the LPS structure is different. The chlamydia do have a very special LPS that lacks the side chain and it is very truncated it is a very small one, but you are right, it might cause difficulties with specificity. The same is true with the antibody test that are based on LPS. You can get a lot of crossway activity due to antibodies against LPS of other bacteria. It is important to consider that all"

While commercial naringenin can be added as the substrate during the biomanufacturing process, we find it desirable to achieve de novo biosynthesis given its strategic location in the biosynthetic pathway, which provides us with the basis for the synthesis of many other high-value flavonoids. Besides reducing costs, this would eliminate the need to introduce expensive chemical precursors [7], which is consistent with our team’s vision of involving less chemicals in the biomanufacturing process.
Serendipitously, there was a recent breakthrough involving the production of naringenin from xylose via a synergistic co-culture system comprising E. coli and S. cerevisiae [6]. Subsequent literature review also revealed the advantages of co-culture biosynthesis, with each independent strain devoted to the functional expression of different stages of the biosynthetic pathway, allowing for reduced metabolic burden, flexibility of employing suitable hosts, and adjustable biosynthetic strength [8]. Inspired by these revelations, we decided to adopt a co-culture strategy as well, especially considering the length of the biosynthetic pathway and how we intended to use xylose in our feedstock.
Figure 5. Recombinant expression of enzymes for de novo  naringenin synthesis in E. coli.
a, The biosynthetic pathway of naringenin starts from the native amino acid, tyrosine. The non-native enzymes PAL, 4CL, and OsPKS are cloned into E. coli to convert tyrosine to naringenin, while MCS is also overexpressed to produce sufficient amounts of malonyl-coA which is consumed in the process. Naringenin chalcone spontaneously cyclizes to naringenin.
b, OsPKS and MCS are placed under a lactose-inducible promoter and their expression is induced by IPTG, while 4CL is constitutively produced.
Therefore, we sought to produce naringenin from tyrosine in a single E. coli strain, which could then be co-cultured with cells responsible for the synthesis of our final compound, thus completing the pathway. This process involves catalysis by four enzymes - phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), Oryza sativa polyketide synthase (OsPKS), and malonyl-CoA synthetase (MCS) [9] put together in a single plasmid (Figure 5a).
Currently, our de novo construct carries three of the enzymes necessary for n"

Codon Optimization
The genetic code is a degenerate one; there are more 3-part combinations of nucleotides than there are amino acids. The topic of codon optimization-that is, the cell's preference for one codon sequence over another in translation-has been heavily researched in an effort to determine the optimal genetic sequences for an organism. This project looks at the effects of repeated amino acid sequences of varying lengths and codons and their effect on the cell.
Codon Optimization

Overview | Design | Results
Data Collection
A 6-repeated sequence of a single threonine codon was successfully ligated into the initial construct. The resulting fluorescence was measured using a TECAN machine. The results are displayed graphically below.
The figure above demonstrates the fluorescence of both mCherry and GFP when the ribosome translates four 6-repeat sequences of a single codon of threonine. mCherry levels fluctuate while GFP fluorescence remains the same. Further characterization with repeating sequences will provide more quantitative data, but preliminary testing suggests that with constant levels of GFP, the cell is able to send tRNA strands complementary to each threonine codon without disturbing GFP production. Thus, the codon sequence with the highest mCherry expression indicates the most preferred threonine codon.
Additional Testing
Several more repeated sequences of identical and non-identical single amino acid codons are intended for testing in this construct. To view the completed and prospective sequences , please visit our Parts page

MethanE.COLIc projec t arises from sustainability and conservancy of human health and safety. Therefore while we were constructing the organismic device we also wanted to inform people from all age and we wanted to increase the public awareness on our project; methane gas based (firedamp) explosions and the greenhouse effect of methane gas.
Our aim is to inform people in each age. After brainstorming and searching, we planned the content of information and activities according  to following subtitles.
Future Plan
Methane explosions called as grisou are one of  the main problems from the beginning of the coal mines.  All countries have tried different systems to solve this methane problem. When we joined iGEM 2011 competition, our aim is to find a solution to that problem for humanity by cheaper and energy saving way. After a long literature research, we found how seriously dangerous the methane gas is and how people deal with this big problem on coal mines. Below are the countries that have faced with serious methane explosions throughout their history.

Todays companies deal with this problem by;
Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer from MEGTEC capable of handling 60,000 scfm of VAM. At a methane concentration of about 0.7% a unit this size generates 50,000 carbon credits per year. This unit costs about US$ 1,5 million Elizabeth Obediente from CO2IMPACT at a methane upgrading facility at a coal mine in Alabama. The gas is stripped of impurities and upgraded to 96% methane per volume and then compressed and then sold to the natural gas pipeline. Ventilation Air Methane (VAM): VAM units cost about $20-$30 USD per scfm.
At some mines, downtime is considerable, causing expensive losses to the mine. Ventilation cost cuts can be up to half of the original cost of the ventilation system. In one study, a mine with 400 ft3/ton of methane using vertical wells to pre-drain will result in an estimated US$ 11 million over 20 years in reduced ventilation costs, not including carbon and energy revenue[iii] (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1999"

Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement as certain steps (such as scraping the dried kaolin containing the bacteria or counting the colonies in plates with kaolin) were both laborious and difficult to reproduce accurately.
Munich
A few months before our European Symposium had taken place, TU Delft shared a project description on Facebook featuring a summary of all the science behind our project. Shortly after, the team of Munich contacted us indicating that, coincidentally enough, our two teams were to make use of the protein Cas13a in our projects. Because of this, TU Delft and Munich saw a great window of opportunity opening, as the possibility of collaborations that could substantially help both projects was there.
Wet lab Collaboration iGEM Munich 2017
Both TU Delft and Munich's project had a common goal: the realisation of a detection device featuring Cas13a. Consequently, the stability of their Cas13a in their device was also one of the challenges in their design, as it would determine the shelf life and storability of their final product. As a part of this year’s project, TU Delft was also researching and developing an alternative stabilization method by making use of the tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). Therefore, TU Delft shipped a purified batch of TDPs to iGEM Munich, so that they could also assay and evaluate these; and, perhaps, eventually integrate them into their project.
TDPs in Munich!
However, the collaboration with Munich evolved after TU Delft had realised the first experiments with their purified Cas13a and TDPs and had observed that whenever our Cas13a was dried in combination with the TDP CAHS 94205, the resuspended Cas13a+TDP solution would start cleaving RNA  with and without target RNA at a similar rate, thus losing its specificity (see Figure 1).

We asked  Munich to assist us by repeating a similar drying experiment with the same CAHS protein and their Cas13a, in order corroborate our results and help us find the cause of such an unexpected finding. As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is"

Inefficiencies
The process of photosynthesis itself is much the same as in plants. Importantly, it suffers from similar shortcomings. In particular, Rubisco is the central carbon-fixing enzyme in cyanobacteria as in plants. Rubisco is, of course, very inefficient as it has a high affinity for O2 as well as CO2. In fact, cyanobacteria have evolved a specific mechanism to combat this problem. Rubisco is sheltered within intracellular compartments called carboxysomes that concentrate CO2 and prevent oxygenation. It is currently thought that the carboxysome acts as a diffusion barrier to CO2, preventing CO2 from escaping and excluding O2. However, the carboxysome evolved millions of years ago and so is not fully adapted to modern atmospheric conditions. This means that it operates at sub-optimum efficiency. Thus, photosynthesis is not as efficient as it might be.
There are three other major rate-limiting factors that affect photosynthesis in Synechocystis:  the availability of PQ; the availability of PC; and the availability of Ferredoxin/ NADP. The first two factors affect Photosystem I; the latter affects Photosystem II. However, there is no quick or simple way to increase the availability of any of these. Moreover, since PQ and PC are also involved in respiration, for which they are also rate-limiting factor, any gains would be split between the two processes. Thus, the best way to increased the efficiency of photosynthesis in synechocystis is to increase the availability of CO2 to Rubisco, which is the weakest link in photosynthesis.
Figure 2.Charcoal sketch of Synechocystis PCC6803.
Problems
Synechocystis is rarely used in Genetic Modification and there are very few BioBricks available for use in this chassis. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, unlike E.coli, Synechocystis 6803 is not monoploid. In fact its ploidy (number of copies of its chromosome) is entirely dependent on conditions, varying from 1 copy in prolonged Phosphorus-deficient environments to over 50 copies! [1]
Equally the growth rate is very low. The maximum recorded growth rate of Synechocystis gives a doubling time of 5.13 hours and this is only achieved with almost hourly dilutions to preserve the exponential growth stage, otherwise Synechocystis rapidly reaches a steady population size"

This year, HKUST human practice group made a handbook about the basic information people should know when starting a human practice team. We decided to make this project in mid-August, mainly due to the fact that we did not truly understand the objectives of human practice. By the time we realized this, we did not have enough time to develop a project that could have a substantial impact. If only we had a clear guidance on taking the first step of starting a human practice project, things would have been much better. Our main objective of making this handbook is to give an insight into future iGEM teams across the globe to create meaningful projects.
Our handbook contains a simplified version of the definition and purpose of human practice, also some ideas on how the human practice teams can deliver their main project. Beside those, there are examples of some of the best teams which won the best human practice award along with tips and tricks from these awardees as well as the judges.
We sincerely hope that our handbook can help the future human practice groups in helping to create their unique pathway in promoting synthetic biology to the public, which is the essence of human practice.       You can download the handbook in PDF format here .
