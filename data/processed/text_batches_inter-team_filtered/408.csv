The Exclusive Interview of the Founding Captain of Jilin University’s iGEM Team
In our last interview, we have introduced the founding captain of iGEM SCUT team——Zhang  Junjie to you. This time, I’m going to introduce you the founding captain of Jilin University’s IGEM team, Han jia, a blossoming man of science who have always wanted to become a Public educator. In the following passage I will share you why he wants to become an educator, what he has done to contribute to the dynamic synthetic biology as well as his experience of importing IGEM to his university and how he forged his own team.
The meeting lasting 2 days was organized by HZAU, WHU and HUST iGEM teams. The contents consisted of three main parts: senior iGEMers’ reports, project presentation by each team, and the discussion of debugs in experiments. On the morning of 23th  August, Dr. Tang Jun, the professor of HZAU participated in the opening ceremony and gave a welcoming speech. Then we watched the video made by the chairman iGEM Head Quarters specially for the meeting. It was really helpful and wonderful. After the opening ceremony, the seniors Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang coming from Peking University and Ocean University of China gave us two important speeches, sharing their abundant experience about iGEM. It really paid to learn.
1. The growth process of Han
HanJia began reading a lot of educational books, such as pedagogical psychology at a young age, and became interested in pedagogy. Afterwards he started to become an enthusiast on studying the educational joint projects，and he even involved in many fields of study including economics，ethnics ，psychology, philosophy, management, arts, and medicine, this reading process of absorbing various aspects of knowledge has greatly enriched his study of the life science. When Hanjia first went to the university, he started to be active in child education & community services together with his like-minded friends, and from then on, he had set his heart on a career in the cause of education. Although he gave up his dream career temporarily for many reasons afterwards, he learned great deal from this practices and he indeed made a lot of practical and useful proposals to his old school : Jilin University and Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. To conclude，he is"

Investigating Intellectual Property in iGEM
Working with novel concepts such as tunable consortia and distribution of the Dsz pathway, the UBC team became curious of whether iGEM projects would be owned as intellectual property (IP). We also realize that almost all research projects require the use of some sort of IP-related component. Even if iGEM teams are not planning to patent their own work, they will likely come across something (e.g., reagent, strain, etc.) that is already patented by someone else. To use these materials properly, we need to understand how to navigate around the legal aspect of patents. The purpose of this part of our Human Practices project is to convey IP knowledge to the community in an iGEM-relevant fashion. We surveyed various iGEM teams about their interest in such an IP primer and asked them about what they already knew, what the would like to know, and how they would like the information presented to them. In constructing our guide, we have met up with professions in the field of biotechnological patenting and incorporated the results of these meetings here. In this respect, our project will serve as a connection between iGEM and experts outside our community. We do not intend to make an argument for or against the idea of intellectual property.  Our aim is to create a user-friendly platform for all iGEM teams to learn about relevant IP issues.  It will present information in a manner that will allow users to make an informed decision about what stance to take when confronted with IP-related decisions.  In addition, the guide will help teams navigate through the processes of obtaining or using patents and build a foundation upon which they can then proceed with their projects.
Our Survey
Our survey methodology was relatively simple. We wanted to confirm our suspicions that other iGEM teams knew as little about ""patents and stuff"" as we did. We then came up with a set of questions for other teams"

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," a pSB1C3 plasmid work in the following way: when pTacI is induced by IPTG, it drives the transcription of the PsiR gene coding for the PsiR protein which is predicted to be a transcription factor able to bind D-Psicose. If D-Psicose is present in the cell, the transcription factor will bind preferentially to it and thus it becomes inactivated. The repression of the related promoter pPsi will be released which will enable the transcription of a fluorescent protein, mCherry. If D-Psicose isn’t present in the cell, PsiR will bind to pPsi, preventing any transcription of mCherry.
Biosensors Characterization
The characterizations of all the biosensors have been performed following the protocol described in the ‘Protocol’ session of our wiki and presented in the Parts Registry pages of each biosensor ( BBa_K2448025 , BBa_K2448026 , BBa_K2448027 , BBa_K2448028 , BBa_K2448029 , BBa_K2448030 , BBa_K2448031 and BBa_K2448032 ). All tests were performed in technical duplicates and biological triplicates (Figure 2). Fluorescence measurements (mCherry) have been normalized on cell density (OD600nm). Raw data are for all biosensors are available here (Download)
Figure 2. Picture of a 96 well plate for the characterization of BBa_K2448025 after 14h incubation.
The main goal of the characterization is to determine which biosensor is the most suitable for our screening process. In order to be able to efficiently use our biosensors for real applications, it’s mandatory to evaluate certain parameters:
Optimal Measurement Time
The characterization of the biosensors allowed us to determine many important parameters. For instance, running the experiment for a long period (almost 18 hours) gave us an estimation of the optimal measurement time.
To estimate this duration, we looked at the raw data of all the biosensors and observed that it takes on average around 9 hours to get an observable signal for the lowest concentration of inducer. It means that sensitivity threshold and consequently maximum accuracy is reached 9 hours after induction.
Since we want to detect and measure D-Psicose concentration between 1 mM and 300 mM, we need a biosensor able to get maximum accuracy in this range of concentration in a minimal time. Taking into account the raw data, we can estimate for the majority of our biosensors that if D-Psicose concentration is above 10 mM, a"

Therefore, maybe the ability of the teacher can not reach the standard and the teaching quality can not be guaranteed. Besides, more and more young people tend to work in the developed cities and for a better benefits so they do not like to work in the behindhand countryside where need them. As we know, teachers play an important role in fostering the youth. Thus, lacking of the professional teachers seriously affected the development of the education in the countryside. (Yang,2010)
The unfair phenomenon is also reflected in the rate of the admission to universities between cities and countrysides. For example, it would be a little bit hard for the students from countryside to get into the top universities in China, while it may be easier for the students from the city. The distinct distance results from the different levels of education quality between city and countryside. We can’t compare the students from the countryside with the students from the city, because their study and living conditions are far from the same. As a result, plenty of the students from the countryside can’t obtain a good job even though they had studied in a university. With time passing by, they will build up a mind that it is useless to study so they often drop out. In that case, it can cause many side effects to the development of the countryside.
Education equality is a urgent problem, we still have a long way to go.

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#yohda#_-_-_TEXT.html," There’s always a chance of failure of microorganism to escape and contaminate environment, especially because the size of microorganism and bacteria is very small. Although there are chances of failure, Prof. Yohda as a scientist wants a higher degree of Synbio development in Japan. He’s excited about synthetic biology development because it will cope problems many industries. People need to take more risks and accept this novel development.
What do you think about our project and synthetic biology itself?
Your idea is a very fascinating and novel idea, I’m impressed and I think that it would be successful if you were really developing it. From the beginning on the human genome project, I’ve always been impressed. Let’s start with the history of synthetic biology. Do you know Asa Comba? He’s a famous Nobel Prize winner because he invented purified polymers from E.coli. His son also won Nobel Prize, Roger Comba about ten years ago before his father passed away. Roger’s son, Thomas Comba is also very famous because he purifies another polymer from E.coli when he’s an undergraduate student in University of South California San Francisco. As soon as Asa Comba invented polymers, there was a news regarding enzymes that could be used to synthesize bacteria. Afterwards, Kary Mullis invented PCR machine and it helps many people in synthetizing DNA. After that people start putting the DNA in the bacteria. We’ve had a long history of biotechnology, and synthetic biology is a part of it. To make real life, we have to know the detail about our life––our own cells. It’s very difficult to be designed. Genome is a blueprint but to make it works we have to make many tools. In case of Craig Venter synthesizing chromosome, we kinda have a machine to replicate. We need more tools for the application of Synbio. iGEM and other competitions is not synthesizing life, it’s a part you can’t put apart from biotechnology. I know you’ve been doing project with Synbio and tries to make more tools. It’s nice, and it’s really applicable and you should try it. But I think, your idea is difficult and complicated, so if you’re able to attain the result that would be very wonderful. However, idea is always important. Membrane protein is rather difficult to express. Recombinant technology has been developed but still some protein is hard to be expressed. About 2 years ago, a professor in TUAT has succeeded to crystalize the PCR, and developing it towards becoming an important drug target. After all, we need"

Gel electrophoresis of pSB1C3.
EZNA gel extraction protocol on recovered pSB1c3 vector
Refer to section 1.13 for the protocol.
Start with excising the band that corresponds to the base pair length of pSB1c3 vector.
Following the gel extraction spin protocol above, extracted Vector DNA needs to be ‘cleaned up’ of restriction enzyme and agarose. The protocol for this can be found from the last enzymatic protocol in EZNA gel extraction kit. This process is to be done in Day7.
Growth and culture of E. coli transformed with 24/06 PCR Product (J and G)
Refer to section 1.6 for the protocol.
* LB has to be clear. The LB on the shelf was cloudy and therefore contaminated from last week so start with a new bottle
** Colonies were of variable size which could mean that some of the colonies are contaminated. Therefore, when picking the 6 colonies, pick 2 small, 2 medium and 2 large colonies

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"axanthin selling in the market is extracted from rice?
The total cost of the production is made up of the following six parts:
1. The cost of the raw material
Most astaxanthin sold in the market nowadays are extracted from Haematococcus pluvialis. However, extraction from Haematococcus pluvialis requires a high level of industrial technology and the autotrophic stage of Haematococcus pluvialis last for a long period of time, resulting in high cost of the astaxanthin. For example, astaxanthin produced by Snobel requires high cost (probably take up 30% of the total cost). But, the  extraction of astaxanthin from rice requires lower cost of the raw material, because rice is easiler to grow and extract, in other words, astaxanthin can be extracted from rice without expensive and advanced technology.
1.1 Extract astaxanthin from shrimp
The alkaline extract:
The alkaline extract is provided for recovering astaxanthin, astaxanthin carotenoids, astaxanthin esters, chitin and proteins from crustacean tissues containing such[1]. But in the process of the alkaline extract, a large amount of reagents like alkaline and acid are used and the waste water produced during the extraction can do great harm to the environment. What's more, it is not astaxanthin but astacene or the degradation product of astaxanthin which is produced from extraction, because astaxanthin is not stable in the present of alkaline during the high-temperature processing.
Extraction with oil:
The oil extraction is an effective method to extract astaxanthin and chitin were extracted at a yield of about 86%, and carotenoids were extracted in cod liver oil at a yield of up to 74% (There are 17.0% to 32.2% of chitin and from 3.4 to 14.7 mg/100 g of carotenoid pigments, mostly astaxanthin and its esters, within the byproducts from shrimp and different parts of crab contained.).[2] The oil extraction is no doubt a safe and effective method to produce astaxanthin while extracts are not easy to be separated from high boiling oils. As a result, both the concentration and purity of astaxanthin are not high and this production can not be applied in most fields only if further separation and purification(for example, a molecular distillation treatment) are taken, which will rasie cost greatly.

Week 18 August 12- August 19
Our wet lab group was divided into three groups: extracting mRNA, detecting the expression of protein and detecting the mRNA. We tested four circuits we had designed. We got the positive correlation between the quantity of mRNA and the free energy of stem loops.
Figure6 The correlation between the quantity of mRNA and the free energy of stem loops
At the same time, we designed more stem loops with various free energy and inserted them into new circuits.
For human practice, we went to Qingdao Science and Technology Museum to hold a lecture for about 100 people to popularize synthetic biology and the importance of quantification in our daily life.
Figure7 We held a lecture for the delegation from Tibet
Week 19 August 20-August 27
For the dry lab, we wanted to get the relationship that the concentration of mRNA changed with the time. We firstly tried to understand the process of degradation of mRNA, the transcription rate of mRNA and the cleavage efficiency of RNase E.
For the wet lab, we continued to design new stem-loops and inserted them into circuits.
Week 20 August 28- September 4
We had our data of the expression of proteins in four circuits which showed the relationship with the free energy of stem-loops.
Figure8 The protein fluorescence of upstream GFP to downstream mCherry of different circuits, background subtraction has been normalized with control group.Ratio  = {[RFPterm/GFPterm]/[(RFPcontrol/GFPcontrol)mean]
Meanwhile, we held the summer camp for students from different universities. We introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to them by organizing lecture, operating experiment, designing their own posters.
Week 21 September 5- September 12
We went to Guangzhou to attend CCiC and communicated with about 30 iGEM teams there.
We had two new circuits and three parts of our wet lab group started to test them. These two circuits had new stem loops with different free energy and we tried to further verify the relationship between quantitative expression of proteins and the free energy of stem loops.
Figure9 We had two designed stem loops which respectively had the same free energy with the origin one.

On the other side of the lab, Jazzy and Marijke were able to freeze dry bacteria and revive them successfully, thereby enabling safer transport and storage of our bacteria.
This brings us closer to our goal of creating a safe and easy to use application for testing bacterial stress. Meanwhile, Daphne finished her project (to produce 32 stress detecting strains) by                                                     isolating                                                     7 new stress promoters and coupling them to GFP. These                                                     new constructs will be tested for their stress detecting capacity in the upcoming month.

Result of a disk diffusion experiment with a constitutive (always on) blue chromoprotein on the right. On the left the negative control, so a                                                     strain that contains no chromoprotein, and in the middle                                                     a lesser succesful strain is visible. Our next task is getting a blue colour only when stressed.
Disk diffusion for dummies:
Disk diffusion is a method that can be used to easily determine whether a compound is lethal to bacteria. To do this, small discs containing                                                     a potential antibiotic are placed on growing bacteria.                                                     The compound in the disc will then slowly spread out. If the compound is lethal to these bacteria, a “halo” will form around the disc where bacteria can not grow.
Dutch iGEM Meet-Up: BBQ and PubQuiz

Experimental state 2 (E2)
Figure 3. Diagram for experimental state 2
Note : Strictly speaking, the factor K should better be obtained from experimental data rather than assumed to be 1 for such simplification could lead to much deviation from real value.
The Calculation of ΔGtot
In most cases, the difference of delta G among the four pathways are mainly reflected by the ΔGmRNA-rRNA. There are two ways to calculate the ΔGmRNA-rRNA:
With the help of RBS calculator;
Use the method in literature Computational design of orthogonal ribosomes.
There are some differences between the input and output of the two method.
1st method:
input:
standby + RBS + Spacing + Start Codon + Protein-Coding,
16S 3' last nine bases;
output: ΔGmRNA:rRNA, ΔGstart, ΔGspacing, ΔGstandby, ΔGmRNA;
Software: RBS-Calculator;
Strength: taking more factors into our consideration and are more accessible to real condition;
Weakness: not sure of the input sequence.
2nd method:
input:
ASD sequence,
SD sequence (each are 6 bases long);
Output: ΔG under different conditions;
Software: RNA-Cofold in Vienna RNA web servers;
Strength: only need to input the SD and ASD sequence which is very easy;
Weakness: not as accurate as the first method.
Similarity of the two method：The core program of RBS-Calculator is based on Vienna RNA.
There are also two points that should be focused on during our modeling:
the specification of input;
the analysis of errors if there are any in the output.
As for analysis of errors, the most frequent errors are the Long-Range Paring which occurred when the head and the tile of the mRNA sequence complement with each other within the sequence itself. In such case, the ΔGmRNA result is not accurate. We usually use RNA-Fold to calculate the accurate ΔGmRNA to avoid such error.
Calculation Results of ΔG
Prediction of Protein Expression Amount
We should, first of all, measure the relative protein expression amount (fluorescence intensity) and to obtain the parameters in the model through regression. After the obtaining the model parameters, we can predict the amount of protein expressed and to compare them with that of wet lab results.

The figure below demonstrates the results for the mid-log growth:
Figure 2:  Fluorescence Measurements (Mid-log growth results)
As before, the average values shown by the blue bars demonstrate the intended effect (i.e., increasing IPTG increases RFP for the control, while the opposite is true for the Lsr-based inverter).  However, the error bars are now seen to overlap, which erodes confidence in this conclusion.   The smaller number of cells in each aliquot when grown to only mid-log phase (compared to stationary phase) limits the ability of the fluorimeter to accurately measure fluorescence as it will be operating closer to its noise floor.  It is important to note that the same steps noted above to improve accurate system measurements for overnights will also apply to mid-log growth (i.e., stronger Ribosome Binding Sites, greater cell concentrations in each aliquot, and increased sample processing gain).
Evaluation of the RDP: Lux+Rudolph Device
The RDP: Lux + Rudolph device was constructed using the Synbiota Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP) protocol in order to evaluate a prototype for the biosensor that detects L-Acyl-Homoserine-Lactone (AHL) and glows red in response.  This is accomplished as follows: the AHL small molecule (213.23 Daltons) is produced by some bacteria in quorum sensing applications to signal the presence of high concentrations of bacteria.  The LuxR regulatory protein binds with AHL and stimulates promotion by the pLux promoter.  Placement of a red fluorescent protein (RFP), such as the Rudolph RFP submitted by Genspace at iGEM 2014 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1429001  ), downstream of the pLux promoter (along with a suitable Ribosome Binding Site) results in increased fluorescence in the presence of AHL and completes the device.
RDP-compatible parts for the upstream Lux-based device (based on BBa_J37019) and the downstream Rudolph RFP (based on BBa_K1429001) were created using a protocol supplied by Synbiota and template DNA from the Biobrick distribution"

What's necessary?
We spoke with a representative of COFEPRIS (The organism that protects against sanitary risks) to ask the necessary steps for the launch of Lactobachill in Mexico; they showed us the required steps which are the following:
Steps
1. Fill the format of authorizations, certificates, and visits
This document is filled with data of the project representative, data of the physical place where Lactobachill is produced, product specifications (classification, common international denomination, measure unit, therapeutic indications, concentration, usage instructions, etc), sanitary registry of supplies for health and export and import information.
2. Gather enough information to prove the safety of Lactobachill in humans
This is accomplished via toxicological studies (acute, chronic, study of the constituents of food that might be affected due to the genetic modification) preclinical studies, clinical studies, allergenicity studies, any interaction that might occur between the modified organism and the food matrix, nutrimental equivalent study as well as all the important parameters for the genetic modification.
3. Payment

Figure 8: A vial of latex dissolved in methanol(70%).  Note the white fibers throughout the solution
Our work vs prior iGEM work
Prior iGEM teams that have experimented with latex include the 2015 Brazil USP team and the 2013 Denmark Team.
The 2015 Brazil USP Team targeted devulcanization and decomposition of latex in landfills.  Through expressing RoxA, a rubber deoxygenase, and Lcp, a latex clearing protein, their project focused on developing an organism that could compost rubber in landfills to reduce landfill acreage demand.[27]
The 2013 Denmark team focused on latex production through similar pathways as our own.[28]  However, our project has the novelty of incorporating regulatory elements and additional prenyltransferases and their cofactors to de-regulate latex production at the network scale.  In particular, our process is novel in that we supplement our cells with magnesium, glucose, and SRPP protein cofactors to augment the enzymatic activity of both HRT1 and HRT2 prenyltransferases.  Furthermore, our system also produces latex in high yield, as demonstrated in Figure 7.
Figure 9: Denmark 2013 Latex production- unlike our system, the 2013 Denmark E. coli appear to have a lower production of latex.[28]
Conclusions
As of present, we have filed a provisional patent for our invention with the USPTO.  We are currently in the process of conducting material and chemical verification tests to evaluate the characteristics of our rubber.  Additionally, we are conducting tests on the average length of polymer yield.
On the materials aspect, we are also experimenting with vulcanization of our rubber with sulfur to see if we can alter the material properties of our rubber.
Through metabolic engineering, we were able to successfully produce an organism capable of producing polyisoprenes in large yield.  By optimizing the endogenous MEP/DOXP pathway in E. coli through overexpression of rate-limiting proteins and coupling it with expression of rubber transferases (prenyltransferases) used by H. brasiliensis for polyisoprene production, we were able to obtain a rubber-like substance that exhibits the basic properties of latex.

What are CRISPR Capsules?
Our team is investigating the utility of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in the delivery of the Cas9-complex. All Gram-negative bacteria produce OMVs and use them to deliver toxins, communicate with other bacteria, mediate membrane composition, and extract materials such as metal ions from their environment. OMVs have been successfully engineered to carry heterologous proteins 1 , which makes them an attractive candidate for systems that require the delivery of a functional protein or complex to recipient cells.
Why do they matter?
One application of CRISPR-Cas9 is that of treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections; however, in order for Cas9 to do its work, it has to get to the site of infection first. At the moment the most effective methods of delivering Cas9 to target cells are either limited to DNA delivery (bacteriophage delivery 2 and hydrodynamic injection 3 ) or require extensive vector engineering in order to facilitate controlled delivery and uptake (lipid-mediated transfection 4 ).
We hope to use signal peptides and protein fusions to direct Cas9 protein into OMVs so that the functional complex can be delivered to and act on the resistance genes in antibiotic-resistant bacteria without extensive lipid modification to facilitate uptake. With sufficient further development, CRISPR Capsules could be used in conjunction with traditional antibiotics to allow treatment of resistant infections.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", alternative birth control method for women in need.
India
Foundation for Mother and Child Health
Through a connection with our PI, David Bernick, we met Piyasree Mukherjee, CEO of the Foundation for Mother and Child Health in India. According Ms. Mukherjee,  her community possesses differing views on birth control. Some deem birth control a “money trap” because it requires device replacement or multiple rounds of a prescription. Others are skeptical and/or not knowledgeable about birth control because of the lack of information. Our team knows that birth control is expensive, but this was the first time that we heard that women felt gouged by necessary recurrent purchases of birth control methods. We will continue to update this information when their questionnaire responses arrive.
Italy
Aurora, Previous Resident & Student
During her time in Italy, Aurora found it difficult to use her preferred form of birth control and was instead pushed to use an IUD. IUDs, although common, are accompanied by potential painful side effects; Aurora described her first IUD experience as “super painful”. Read More >> IUDs typically last 3-6 years, and when Aurora eventually needed to get her IUD replaced, doctors informed her that her cervix was too small for the second IUD, so she received medicine to soften her cervix. She withstood torturous cramps during the process and relayed to us, “if it hurt that [much] putting it in, I’m worried about getting it out”. We asked Aurora about religious implications of birth control in Italy, and she described Italy is a heavily Catholic country where in most cases, religious leaders discourage use of birth control methods because they view it as sin. Regardless of the fact that Italy has easier access to contraceptives compared to most other countries we’ve heard from, the country’s religious overtones halt many from pursuing birth control for fear of harassment and ostracism. Aurora is yet another individual who proves that a more discrete birth control method like ours would greatly benefit women in countries where stigma on birth control still exists.
Mexico
Rosa, Citizen & Research Team Lead
Through our connection with the ITESG team in Guanajuato, Mexico, we interviewed women to discuss their experiences with birth control. We sent questionnaires to these locals and interviewed one woman named Rosa. Rosa described her younger self as “uneducated” on the proper use of birth control. As a result of her being unaware and her continued lack of birth control, she became pregnant at a young age and had a child she couldn’t properly care for. Read More >> Another woman"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#realWorld_-_-_TEXT.html," a manufacturer we could streamline the process further by satisfying the criteria laid out in the IVD directive. This is being investigated currently.
A product life cycle is split into stages:
Proof of concept/Feasibility
Optimisation
Verification
Validation
Launch
Post Market surveillance
Withdrawal from the market/end-of-life
We are in the early stages of the above list, with Proof of concept/Feasibility being our main achievement thus far. Optimisation is being carried out currently by testing our device with variable levels of luminescent input. Verification will be carried out by clinical trials with homogenised sputum samples, a portion of which would be analysed by microbiological means (serial dilution and culturing for CFU count and sequencing/PCR for bacterial species identification) to ensure that our device is accurately and reproducibly giving readings of bacterial species and load.
The audit concludes with some general questions on the use of the device. We have answered these below.
Q. Microbiological concerns – are the specimen receptacles single use?  How long can they be stored before the bin needs to be emptied?  Will all the samples be from the same patient?
A. The receptacles (plates containing our biological components) will be single use and will be emptied from the bin and disposed of following autoclaving on the day of use. The samples will not all necessarily be from the same patient, this will depend on the number of patients being visited in a day. Neither the team nor medical staff have identified any potential issues with this approach.
Q. How will consistency be maintained between device batches?
A. During the manufacture of our receptacles and prior to freeze-drying, each inoculum of our biological component will be measured carefully for optical density and a sample will be assayed for activity in the presence of a synthetic signalling molecule. The latter process would be scaled-down to the minimal reaction size required to give a significant result in order to be economically viable.
Q. What kind of shelf-life/in-use stability are you looking at for this device?  How will it be transported and stored?
A. It is difficult to project a shelf–life for this device but based upon the simplicity of the majority of the hardware (plastic casings etc.), if the biennial maintenance checks suggested in our requirements  document are carried out for the electronic components, this product will potentially be viable for many years before replacement becomes necessary.
Q. How can an operator check the test is working – will you provide calibrators or controls?
A. Both a positive and a negative control would be supplied with the device"

Lisa Pratt, NASA Planetary Protection Officer
Amy Kronenberg and Emilia K Mann at the NIAC Symposium.
We also spoke with Dr. Lisa Pratt, NASA’s planetary protection officer , about concerns that may arise from the fact that we are using a biological material as our main building component. Pratt informed us that we needed to ensure that no spores would be able to form from our mycelium blocks, and to ensure that there will not be the creation of a superorganism due to the interaction between the mycelium and the substrate it eats. We were also reminded that there are specific parameters in regards to harvesting water from the Martian surface. But most importantly, Pratt emphasized that many of these regulations will be subject to change as real human missions to Mars are planned and that we therefore must remain adaptive and anticipate any potential issues.
Jim Head, a professor at Brown University in the Department of Geoscience, gave us excellent recommendations on potential landing sites for Mars as well as other important logistical information key to the mission architecture of our design.
Lastly, Amy Kronenberg, Biophysicist Staff Scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley Labs, as well as a member of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts advisory board, gave us great insight and critique on our radiation protection. We had initially planned to use melanin, but she encouraged us to focus on finding ways to increase the number of protons (hydrogen) present to protect from cosmic radiation as melanin is only useful for UV radiation which the mycelial structures themselves should do. As a result we shifted our focus to creating a design that contains a thin outer layer of water.  She also provided us with important literature [0].
The information and feedback we received from these experts greatly informed our mission architecture––helping us to design a mission that not only fits NASA’s requirements but also protects the planet in order to ensure the integrity of scientific missions to Mars.

We initially gravitated towards using mycelium as the core material in the design our habitat for Mars because of its self-perpetuating property--it can grow, given a substrate to bind, into the shape of any mold it is placed in. The results of our work demonstrated that we could produce  a cost-effective, replicable habitat for Martian exploration.
However, as our research progressed and we spoke to more experts working with the material, we learned there was so much more to mycelium than"

Figure 1. The Syntesizer platform.
Nonribosomal petides (NRP) are a diverse class of short, bioactive peptides isolated from plant, fungi, and bacteria. Clinical uses of NRPs include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, antifungal, and antitumor drugs [1]. They are synthesized by highly modular enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Through repeated rounds of condensations of more than 500 different amino acids in an assembly line manner, they synthesize a range of different peptides with diverse bioactivities [2]. Discovery of novel NRPs may lead to development of novel drugs, but is limited by development cost and time of drug discovery [3,4]. Some existing nonribosomal peptides on the market are associated with severe side-effects [5] or reduced activity due to resistance [6], while the implementation of other potential NRP drugs are limited due to their toxicity [7]. Improvement of existing NRP drugs, an area which is largely unexploited due to the complexity of the synthetases, has great potential for pharmaceutical improvement. The DTU Synthesizer Team built a novel platform for generating improved NRP drug libraries. The platform in Bacillus subtilis combines bioinformatics and implementation of advanced multiplex genetic tools to generate drug libraries using recombineering with short single-stranded DNA.

The fact that Tyr294 is located near the cyclopropane ring in the active site of ACC deaminase strongly suggested a direct catalytic role for this residue in the ring-opening reaction. The reactivity of Tyr294 may be enhanced by hydrogen bonding to Tyr268, which is only 2.8 Å away. Previous studies shows that these two tyrosine residues are strictly conserved among the known ACC deaminase homologues. The conserved presence of the two-tyrosine system in ACC deaminase homologues suggests a significant function for this tyrosine pair. To probe the possible involvement of the two tyrosine residues in the reaction, previous studies where the Y294F and Y268F mutants were prepared, suggested that both exhibited chromatographic behavior and spectral properties identical with those of the wild-type enzyme. The PLP content in the Y268F and Y294F mutant proteins was also the same as that observed for the wild-type enzyme. These mutant proteins were capable of binding ACC in the active site. However, no ACC deaminase activity of the Y294F mutant enzyme was detected using the coupled lactate dehydrogenase/NADH assay, and no keto product was generated as assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy after a 24-h incubation period with the substrate. The activity of the Y268F mutant  also dramatically diminished.
After a detailed analyses of the structure and kinetics of ACC deaminase 1TYZ, we came to conclude that the crystal structure of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboyxlate deaminase complexed with ACC is in optimal state, and therefore any mutation done to residues such as Try 294, Glu295 that are in in close proximity to the cofactor Pyridoxal Phosphate will completely destroy the structure of the enzyme rather than promoting its activity. It was also concluded from our homology modeling that the gene of ACC deaminase from Pseudomonas sp. which we extracted from a root endophyte, was the closest match to the 1TYZ ACC deaminase used for structural modeling.
Homologous Alignment Modeling
After analyzing the structure of 1TYZ using the protein program PYMOL, we used Phyre2 to produce 3D protein structures of three different ACC deaminase genes from one bacterium and two fungi. After producing a pdb file for each of the genes, Phyre2 also produced a homology comparison to each of the ACC deaminase structures submitted to the"

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer"

Product
Buyer persona: María is a 19 year old, Mexican university student. She has been studying for a year now and she always gets very nervous and stressed during her midterms, and because of this, she has intestine problems (like constipation and colitis).
Product price: The price for the frozen yoghurt will be of $8 MXN, because of the costs and the mean of the yoghurt industry, to maintain the company competitive in the market.
Business Model Canvas
1. Customer Segment
Mexican university students
Age range: 18 to 25 years old
High and medium-high socioeconomic levels
2. Value Proposition
Development of a probiotic to reduce intestinal inflammation, thus causing a healthy digestive system, which in turn helps to treat stress and depression.
This is a probiotic that will be implemented in frozen yoghurt, including 3 different toppings: granola, chocolate cookies, and dried fruit, to provide an easy-to-go option for customers.
The added value for this product is that no other probiotic in the world blocks excess intestinal pro-inflammatory molecules, and it will be packaged in small cups made out of bioplastic (made from avocado pits), thus aiding the Mexican company that manufactures this bioplastic.
Future plans for the company: Once we recover the investment made at the beginning of the project (ROI, Return on Investment), we want to reach people from all backgrounds by selling our product for high and medium-high socioeconomic levels that suffer from depression, and by using our surplus to plan and execute activities for everyone to know about depression, and what it entails (treatment, symptoms, positive thinking, etc.).
3. Channels
High-class supermarkets in urban areas (Superama, Fresko, Chedraui Selecto)
Drugstores (Farmacias del Ahorro, Farmacias Guadalajara, YZA)
Online purchases in the company’s website (the company’s website includes a blog where people can make communities and foster positive publicity for the brand).

The culturing plate was used for UV exposure of the cultures. At intervals of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mins, the plate was removed from the box, and the full 100uL sample was removed from each of 2 wells (1 for each strain). The samples were transferred to 2 wells on the dilution plates, and the culturing plate was returned to the UV box for further exposure.
From the exposed samples, a dilution series (10-1, 10-2, 10-3,10-4, and 10-5) were created. For each of the 100- to 100000-fold dilutions, 6 drops of 2uL were spotted onto one quadrant of a petri plate (LB agar; arabinose added for HB101+pGLO) using a 10uL multichannel pipette; plates were then incubated for approx. 36hrs at 37oC, and colonies were counted as an average of each of 6 spots.
Second experiment, Sept. 6th, 2015
Liquid cultures of transformed pGLO HB101 and untransformed HB101 (grown overnight in TSB at 37oC w/ shaker) were prepared by transferring 1.8mL of culture to a microcentrifuge tube and spun for approx. 5 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and 1.8mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to each tube and vortexed gently to resuspend cells. This washing procedure was repeated 3 times. Finally, cells were resuspended in PBS to approx. OD600 = 0.8.
UV box (ExoTerra fluorescent bulbs and fluorescent nail curing light; Insulfoam sides) was set up in flow hood w/ 10.5 inch tall plastic contained placed upside-down approximately centered under the lights, and a horizontal reflector was placed on top of the container. The lights were turned on 5 mins prior to start to ensure that the fluorescent tubes had sufficient time to warm up. Combined UV-A and UV-B light intensity was measured at approx. 1.75mW/cm2, and temperature was 32oC.

Starting from that the exhibition will travel to Heidelberg and should be shown afterwords in various places in Germany and all over the world. The first international exhibition is expected (but not 100% sure yet) to take place in Vienna, integrated in the “Bio:Fiction Science, Art and Film Festival” from May 13th-14th 2011 at the Museum of Natural History.
3. Presence in Media and the press review
As far as we can say now, media has a great interest in our project. The well known german radio station WDR is producing an feature about Super Cell.
As most german iGEM Teams the radio station „Deutschlandradio“ and the internet TV station „Biotech TV“ presented our project in their program. Also the regional media in Thuringia is very much interested in our Art&Science project – for example the local radio station F.R.E.I. produces a series of interviews, accompanying the project from the first ideas to the jamboree and the first exhibition.
Important to point that, as explained, the most important phase of the presence in public and communication with the society will start with and after the Jamboree – so that the presence in media is anticipated to advance.
Safety - or: what happens when an idea is born...
With our project Super Cell we aim to contribute to a societal discussion about synthetic biology. We don't want to be judgmental but bring synthetic biology out of the laboratories to be discussed in public. By connecting it with our everyday life, we hope to foster an open discourse about chances and dangers, and potential protective mechanisms. A informed general public is needed to react on the many ethical and cultural challenges coming with Synthetic Biology.    Some of our products are quite controversial, nevertheless probably most of the products presented in Super Cell would find a brought sales quantity.
When an idea is born it starts to walk and becomes autonomous. Can we take that responsibility? What happens if a “real” business company gets inspired and translates one of the controversial ideas into a real product?  Hopefully by then the now started discussion yields fruits and consumers have the competencies to deal with “synbio-products” to include them into a self-determined life.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," little survey on the streets of Helsinki. The goal was to find out what people actually knew about synthetic biology and cyanobacteria. We wanted to see what kind of need there was for informing the general public about all the possibilities synthetic biology offers, as well as, from our project’s point of view, the need to inform about the dangers of cyanobacteria. The interview can be viewed below with subtitles in English. It seemed that the general conception of synthetic biology was something quite foreign and that there is a need for raising awareness of the hazards of cyanobacteria.
LUMA centre
Presenting our project to high schoolers.
We met some high school students who were candidates for the Finnish team of the International Biology Olympiad. Our team gave them a presentation about our project and synthetic biology. The students got to design their own little iGEM projects and hopefully learned about molecular biology and synthetic biology. They also asked questions about our studies and how one needs to prepare oneself to study them. Hopefully we were able to inspire them to continue with the biological studies in the future and perhaps even try themselves in the field of synthetic biology.
Math seminar at HY
In addition to Luma we gave a talk on “Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology” for math students at the University of Helsinki. After giving them a “Biology 101” lecture, they got to hear how modelling was done in our project. It was great to see that so many people were interested in our project as well as modelling in regards of synthetic biology. It might be that some of those students present there will be the members of Aalto-Helsinki 2017, who knows.
Talking about modelling in synthetic biology.
Media
Our project was on display in the media. We had quite a few articles written about us and we were even a part of a radio program. As we had also gotten sponsorships from certain companies they posted about us and our project on their web pages which was nice.
The University of Helsinki’s Faculty of Science wrote an article about our project and especially what the two mathematicians of our team had learned from this synthetic biology project. The article was later posted also on the university’s main news page. Articles are unfortunately in Finnish.

He helped us to enhance our presentation and gives us pieces of advice such as emphasizing the cold shock part as a marketing priority (for vineyards, specifically). Mr Bocquet has been very helpful for the human practices part of the iGEM competition. He provide us contacts in order to have the best expertise for our project.

We discussed about the dangers of cold temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost with the help of particular devices. This year, the frost during the spring resulted in a loss of 70% of the grapevines in the region of Bordeaux and a loss of 25% in Champagne. Several techniques to counter these losses are used by professionals in this sector. However it is often expensive and water consuming. At the end of the meeting, Mr Pauthier offers to us the possibility to do some experimentation in their institution. If the proof of concept is successful, a partnership will be done between the iGEM Paris Ionis team and the Comité Champagne in order to perform some tests in the field.
Climate change conversation with Mrs Sylviane Leplatre engineer in agronomy and oenologist giving advice to the winemakers in the region of Paris - 08/17/17 The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France and more specifically the south of France affected by very hot summer. We discussed about the dangers of cold and hot temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost and heat with the help of particular devices. Mrs Leplatre think that our project is a good idea because global warming affecting the vineyards are the problem of the year. It was the first time that the south of the France has suffered from frost."

Additional a optimized medium was chosen in the hope to enhance the protein amount. Activity assays were done for all four laccases ( ECOL , BPUL , BHAL and TTHL ), especially in regard to optimal pH and temperature effects. Additionally a comparison of all four produced laccases concerning their activity has been done. In addition an active eukaryotic laccases of Trametes versicolor was produced with a self-designed Shuttle-vector in yeast Pichia Pastoris.
Immobilization
The immobilization method on CPC-beads was further optimized. It has been proved that an incubation time of 6 hours is actually enough for immobilization. Furthermore, two additional laccases were successfully immobilized: from
Bacillus halodurans C-125 (named BHAL) and from
Thermus thermophilus HB27 (named TTHL).
Moreover, activity tests were carried out on all four immobilized laccases (ECOL, BPUL, BHAL, and TTHL). All of them showed activity. For immobilization results see here
Substrate Analysis
After the regional jamboree Team Activity Test, Team Immobilization and Team Substrate Analysis got laccases from the same pool from the Cultivation Team. With these laccases the degradation experiments of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol were repeated for the laccases BPUL and ECOL. The new laccases BHAL and TTHL were characterized for estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation too. Estradiol and ethinyl estradiol was futher analyzed on LC-MS/MS
For more information about the new results click here . Possible resulting degradation products after treatment of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol with TVEL0 were further analyzed via LCMS-MS. The results are shown here .
Cellulose binding domain
A lot of efforts were made, to change the order of the fusion proteins, to change the promoter and the RBS and to insert a different linker between the cellulose binding domain and the reporter GFP, but to the last day of lab work no green glowing colony to work with and execute the binding assay could be generated. <p class=""more""> Read '''the Boston file'''

BIT,2014,Team:BIT-China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," means you apply to ligase genes?
We do have difficulties in assembling biobricks.We have tried many ways to solve this problem including 3A Assembly，Amplified Insert Assembly and gene splicing by overlap extension PCR.
3A Assembly (which stands for three antibiotic assembly) is a method for assembling two part samples and selecting for correct assemblies through antibiotics. 3A assembly uses the restriction sites on the prefix and suffix to assemble part samples. This new composite part will maintain the same prefix and suffix as its ""parents"" and contain a scar, where the cut and re-ligated restriction sites were stitched together.
Amplified Insert Assembly is a method of ""BioBricking"" two biological parts (i.e. pieces of DNA) together. This method combines the ease and flexibility of 3A assembly with the reliability of standard assembly. In comparison to 3A assembly, this method can take up to two hours longer Splicing overlap extension by PCR is a convenient method to obtainrecombinant gene.
Q11:Is your lock too simple?
A: Our system is not just three genetic circuits. It was because that the time was limited so we just design three circuits for the IGEM competition. We will keep on discovering new “Transcription factor”and “Chaperone” to extend our system.
Q12: Gene sequencing
A: Although the sequence of the human genome has been completely determined by DNA sequencing, it is not yet fully understood. Future projects and areas of research related to the human genome are seemingly endless.
Q13: How does the AHL generated? What is its specific role is? How do you control the amount of the AHL to make the concentration of the bacteria at an appropriate value?
A: Bacteria can release a class of freely accessible small molecule bacterial cell signaling factors to the surrounding environment - Homoserine Lactone (AHL), AHL can be used as a self-inducing agent in the Qs system. The flora density can be induced by self-induced molecular. About the solution of the AHL, We can optimize the concentration repeatedly and use modeling to simulate the cellular state.
Q14:Since your system is so huge, then will your have room to add something more?
A: Certainly. At first, we put our system into E.coli. by two plasmids. After our system work normally, we will integrate our system into the genome of E.coli. by some experiments. Genome is just like a huge plasmid of E.coli. At that time the scientists will have room to do some other work on E.coli.

Collaboration - Help Other Teams
We have helped UC Davis iGEM team this year. Part of UC Davis’s team project aims to develop and implement an experimental data depot for biobrick characterization data. We have joined the collaboration to produce a multi-lab, extensive characterization of a commonly used part library based on their protocol and requirements.
We measured the fluorescent kinetics in an 18-hour period to characterize several members of a promoter family. The parts we choose to characterize are J23101, J23112, J23113, J23114, J23115, J23116, J23117, J23118, J23119 in iGEM 2013 Kit Distribution as well as J23108, J23109, J23111 in 2012 iGEM Kit Distribution. Then we preliminary processed all the raw data and send them to UC Davis’s iGEMers together with the information of the plate reader we used and the measurement conditions.
The results (as a downloadable table in UC Davis' project) are partly shown as

5).Assume that the concentrations of DBT and HBP stay the same in all the three different phrases as the stirring rate of bioreactors reaches certain degree.
Hypothesis:
1).Because DszA and DszB are both inhibited by HBP, the catalytic rates of these two enzymes fit the models as below respectively:
In the equation, kAcat,kBcat are the conversion coefficients of enzymes A and B respectively, and Km,A,Km,B are the Michaellis constant of enzymes A and B respectively, and IC50,A,IC50,B are the concentrations of inhibitors that lead to a 50% reduction in the enzymes’ activities respectively.
2).Because enzyme DszC is inhibited noncompetitively by HBP, and it is also inhibited by catalytic substrates HBP, the catalytic rate of enzyme DszC is:
In the equation，kCcat is the conversion coefficient of enzyme C ,and Km,C are the Michaelis constant of the enzyme C, respectively, and KI is the inhibition constant of HBPs to DzsC enzymes,  shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
3).Estimate the variations of different components in 4S pathway, using differential equations:
2.4 Result Analysis
1).The optimal proportion of DszA, DszB and DszC..
Using MATLAB, we simulate different components’ concentration change with different DszA, DszB and DszC’s concentrations.
Using Matlab2015a, we found that:
when the proportion of three enzymes is A:B:C=1:2:4 or A:B:C=2:1:4, the decreasing rate of DBT is well suited, showing that DBT is well degraded. However, with the proportion of A:B:C=1:4:2 or A:B:C=4:1:2, the effect is not so obvious as the previous one.
In addition, taking HBP into consideration, methods with the proportions A:B:C=1:4:2 and A:B:C=1:2:4 will achieve better results;
However, intermediates are produced with greater amount in the conditions of A:B:C=1:2:4 and A:B:C=2:1:4. Because of the molecular movement effect, the reaction is harder to control.
In conclusions, we decided to multiple the proportion of enzymes, then we have:

After understanding of protein composition required for fire retardant effectiveness, we would like to find a novel protein candiate with fire retardant properties. We decided to use protein data mining approach in bioinformatics for our purpose.
 
We contacted  and asked iGEM team, NCTU-Formosa for collaboration with data mining and programming. Chao-Di Chang, who is an advisor of team NCTU-Formosa  in 2014, taught us a lot in the field of bioinformatics and protein databases such as NCBI, UniProtKB and dbPTM. The super advisor, Prof. Wen-Liang Chen gave us many great advices and shared experiences in the previous iGEM projects and Jamboree.
 
This year, the members of NCTU-Formosa helped us finding out the fire retardant target in the protein data bank. And Yi-Ru Liu of team Mingdao wrote a programming code (see here) and NCTU-Formosa gave us a lot of comments on the code. With the thanks of NCTU-Formosa, we found the ideal target with high serine and arginine contents in protein composition from Uniprot database (see the result).

A MinElute column was put into a vacuum manifold and the sample was decanted to it for binding the DNA. Vacuum was applied until all liquid residues were drawn through the column. Afterwards 750 μl buffer PE were added to wash the column and vacuum applied. Te remove residual wash buffer the QIAquick column was put into the provided 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). The MinElute column was placed into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20 ml water (55°C) were added toe the center to elute the DNA. After 1 minute incubation the tube containing the column was centrifuged for 1 minute. The microcentrifuge tube now contained the eluted DNA.
Plasmid-DNA isolation
Miniprep
Plasmids were isolated by the use of the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit. According to the instructions included, all necessary solutions were prepared and steps conducted. First, overnight cultures (1-2 ml) have been pelleted by centrifugation at >8000 rpm
(6800 x g) for 3 min at room temperature (15–25°C). Supernatant was discarded and pellet resuspended in 250 μl (procedure 2: 200 μl) buffer P1 in a microcentrifuge tube. Afterwards 250 μl (procedure 2: 400 μl) Buffer P2 were added and the tube inverted 4-6 times to mix the solution until it became clear. The sample was lysed for 2-3 minutes before adding 350 μl (procedure 2: 300 μl) buffer N3 and inverting the whole solution 4-6 times. Following the neutralization, the sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. Supernatant was decanted to a QIAprep spin column and vacuum applied to the manifold until the solution was drawn through the column. To wash the column 500 μl Buffer PB were added and again vacuum applied. In addition the QIAprep spin column was washed by adding 750 μl Buffer PE and applying vacuum.

iGEM Collaboration
A Three-Tiered Approach: Local, Regional and Global Outreach
For the human practices portion of our project, we wanted to continue the work of previous University of Virginia teams, while also pursuing a project unique to our current group.  In other words, we wanted to do a lot this year.  We decided to organize all of these projects into a multi-tiered system where the different tiers focused on the local, regional and international communities.  Locally, we organized a Synthetic Biology Night at the University of Virginia, which was open to students from the University as well as locals interested in science and synthetic biology.  Regionally, we continued to partner with Renaissance High School in downtown Charlottesville and began a new partnership with a public school in Albemarle County.  We also met with Lynn Clements, the director of projects for the Rapidan Service Authority, to tour a regional wastewater treatment plant and discuss the need for and feasibility of our project’s implementation in wastewater treatment systems.  Globally, we created a Synthetic Biology Awareness and Acceptance survey and asked iGEM teams to distribute it in their communities across the world.

Once we The next step was to generate the organic chemical mechanism to go from the azo dye waste products to the new quinols. They had to be generated via organic chemistry as opposed to synthetic biology because if they could be produced by biological mechanisms they would not work as xeno molecules (please see science of xeno section).
Replacing the Natural Quinones
In order for our organism to become an autotroph to our xenobiological quinones it was necessary for us to remove the natural quinones. The best approach it seemed was to do a gene knock out for a biosynthesis step of ubiquinone and menaquinone. The metabolic pathway provided a number of options
In order for our organism to become an autotroph to our xenobiological quinones it was necessary for us to remove the natural quinones. The best approach it seemed was to do a gene knock out for a biosynthesis step of ubiquinone and menaquinone. The metabolic pathway provided a number of options.  A search of the literature showed that a knockout of ispB successfully killed e-coli colonies as it is [1]essential for E. coli's . ispB codes for the protein that attaches the hydrophobic side chain on the quinones, allowing them to dock in the membrane. As ispB is used to synthesise all electron buffer quinones, it was the perfect knock out as it meant that only one was required.
See paper here: http://goo.gl/MlMY3c
Antisense RNA Gene Silencing
Our first step was to try a proof of concept knockdown technique: antisense RNA gene silencing. We designed primers to obtain the reverse complement strand of a section of the gene we want to silence. When this section is transcribed it interferes with ispB affecting its translation.
The design for the primers that would amplify the gene contained the bbk prefix and suffix. The forward primer contains suffix, reverse primer contains prefix hence sequence inserted as reverse complement into the vector
The gene was then cloned into pSB1C3 under the control of lac inducible promoter to observe effect on growth.
The knockdown showed to be unsuccessful in reducing bacteria growth and therefore cannot be use to create a xenobiological organism. The next step to try was a full knock out using the crispr technique

Prof. Dekker as a pioneer in biophysics gave us a glimpse into his research on synthetic biology. We were really excited to see the extent of possibilities that exist nowadays.
Dr. Stemmering was a positive boost to our fading belief in the usage of our project. We thought that the introduction of our genetically-modified yeast in other countries or cultures would     be difficult, if not impossible. In his presentation, he assured us that a GMO which is helpful and solves a problem would be accepted in other cultures as well.
Prof. Murphy brought to us to the idea of using data in a much better way, and how to try to connect the information technology creating gigantic throughputs of data with actual results      that can be used. For us as young researchers, the work with these new data technologies is of extreme importance.
After the presentations and a great meal, we met up for a poster presentation from every attending team. This was by far the best opportunity to spark up collaborations with other      teams. Through this poster presentation we finally got the idea that we could make an awesome Wet Lab collaboration with the iGEM Team Cologne/Duesseldorf.
Delft was all about making new friends, contacts and collaborations as well as just thriving on the awesome iGEM spirit. So all in all it was a really great experience.
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Leuven
European Practice Jamboree
We attended the European Practice Jamboree, organized by the iGEM Team KU Leuven as our last event before the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
After a short train ride, we arrived in the beautiful town of Leuven, Belgium.
At first we thought we were accidently beamed to New York City, because the conference centre from KU Leuven looks exactly like the Guggenheim museum in New York.
We were welcomed with snacks and coffee and a short introduction by the vice rector of Science, Engineering and Technology Professor Gerard Govers.  Johan Robben, former PI from Team Leuven,      held a short stand up Q&A about the history of iGEM at KU Leuven and the importance of asking for funding in the right places, since most professors have very limited funds. However,      the higher up administrative staff might have access to bigger and different grants.
The first lecture was by Professor Jos Vander Sloten who talked about challenges in biomedical engineering. These challenges range from the design stage to the finished product and its      application by customers. Professor Sloten emphasised that personalised medicine might be expensive but"

We were fortunate enough to be invited to present a talk about concepts in molecular biology and our project during the second instalment in this series. A huge thanks to Matt from the 2015 Sydney iGEM team for arranging this opportunity!
The talks were aimed at high school students, and our audience comprised of students between 13 and 17 years of age. Members of both the 2015 and 2016 UNSW iGEM teams also joined us at this event, and it was the perfect way to share the foundations of our projects with each other and start a relationship for collaboration purposes later down the track.  You can read more about it here !
Rotary talk
Building upon our relationship with Ku-Ring-Gai Rotary club, we were invited to speak to the Rotary members at their weekly Monday evening meeting.
This was a unique opportunity as our audience was comprised of a different demographic to what we were used to, primarily seniors. It still required a stripped back version of our presentation, with enough background information in molecular biology weaved in to ensure they understood the basis of our project.
Our speech was very well received, and there were a lot of questions asked that challenged us to think about our project from a different perspective. A huge thanks to the Rotary for having us, and again a special thanks to Matt from the USYD iGEM 2015 team for organising this!  See the write-up we got in their weekly newsletter here !
Open Day
We had a booth at the University of Sydney Open Day, which was held at the beginning of semester 2. We were able to speak to incoming students about microbiology, synthetic biology, research, and the iGEM competition, which drew interest from future science students who were excited about potentially being in an iGEM team in the coming years. We also had various activities and exhibits at the booth to further generate excitement.
Oz Harvest
Oz Harvest is a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in food recovery and education.
Oz Harvest volunteers collect leftover food and unsold produce from restaurants, cafes, and grocers all across the country, and use it to make meals for the homeless. Their work has two strengths – firstly, they aim to reduce food wastage; and secondly, they aim to help members of society who would otherwise go hungry. Our project has a major parallel with their work, in that the biotechnology we produce would significantly reduce the wastage of fresh produce.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

SOB was pH adjusted to pH 7.54
100mL SOB was aliquoted and 1.6078g agar was added and autoclaved, and then used to make 5 plates. The agar did not dissolve when stirred, but did dissolve in the autoclave. These plates were left in the hood for the weekend.
At first, we tried to make only 500mL of CCMB80, but we used 1M HCl, which decreased the pH much too rapidly, bringing it to around pH 5.8 after 1 drop. So, we doubled the amount and used 0.1M HCl. The final pH was 6.35"

Project Description
Molecular Device that Biodegrades Pesticides
Different gene parts are being assembled, in order to construct a device that is able to mineralize and biodegrade recalcitrant pesticides. The device will be tested against different concentrations of different recalcitrant pesticides. Specific chassis will be assembled with gene parts from different metabolic pathways in order to finally reach mineralization of the pesticide. Different parameters, such as DNA concentration, fluorescence of reporters, growth of bacterial device, and reduction of pesticide concentration, will be used to assess the efficacy of the device. Computational modeling will be used in order to complement the laboratory work.

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using their lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. Results from this experiment were variable and followed no set pattern.
B. B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. Steep deviations were common for all cell lines at higher inducer concentrations. The results from this experiment were inconclusive.

Polish film posters sum up the entire plot in one visual play-on-words, like Jaws 2 , a shark with two jaws. We looked at contemporary graphic designers playing with this genre (like the Face Off poster above, part of a series). The Ghanaian posters are totally wild hand-paintings that aren't tied to reality. Meanwhile the tradition here in India of the hand-painted film poster still exists, despite increasingly ubiquitous printed billboards. The hand-crafted poster is an interesting genre, each slightly different, context and craft dependent... a bit like synbio in practice!
What other local genres can we look to?
Amar Chitra Katha is a slice of Indian comic heritage. The comics, many drawn in the sixties, are still published today and recount Indian mythologies and epics, both Hindu and Buddhist, in incredibly beautiful comic form. They are the backbone of many kids (and adults!) knowledge of mythology.
We picked up the Stories of Shiva and Devotees of Vishnu at Blossoms Bookhouse; now we're starting to look for tales, ideas and concepts in the stories. What parallel tropes, images, language can we find with synthetic biology? How are the myths and stories of science constructed?
Saturday 19th June: The Guardian of Your Genome
Image from the BBC's 'The Ghost in Your Genes'
This morning we watched The Ghost in Your Genes, a BBC Horizon documentary about epigenetics , the study of inherited change in gene expression. Do we carry the burden of our ancestors' lifestyles? The documentary suggests that the environmental experiences of our parents and grandparents could flick epigenetic switches that are passed down to us, changes that we will pass on to our children. Famine, toxins and lifestyle exposure at key stages of our lives (in the womb for females, and before puberty for males, stages when eggs and sperm are being manufactured) could have significant impact on our future descendants. Evidence suggests that removing an egg from the womb as part of routine IVF procedure could be enough to trigger certain switches, the change in context stressing the cell. A moment of change affects future generations. The film suggests that we are the ""guardian of our genomes"", that our behaviour doesn't just affect our own health.
We started discussing parallel metaphors, like that of Karma , the consequence of acts which can be passed on to future generations, and issues of context and location in biology. Considering some of the ideas we have come up with this week, many have been about giving context to bacteria - E.cloudy, Crime as emotion"

Symptoms occur at the end of ischemic cascade
Every year, about 1.5 million Americans have heart attacks resulting in a total of 500,000 deaths. A heart attack occurs every 20 seconds which is equivalent to a death per approximately every minute. (1) Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in most Western countries and a major cause of hospital admissions. In 2011, heart attack was one of the top five most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the U.S., with an aggregate cost of about $11.5 billion for 612,000 hospital stays.
As a result of the high surface tension of the bloodstream, these rigid plaques can damage and rupture the vessel walls. Subsequently, the rupture induces the vessel cells to secrete pro-coagulative factors which initiate the activation of clotting. The impairment of the conveyance of blood supply gradually results in the death of the tissue. This state is broadly described as hypoxia.
The Importance of Ischemia
The scientific description above may not reflect the importance of this topic; yet the reality is different. Ischemia is related to the most serious conditions of today's medical problems. The well-known heart attack, which is responsible for most of the deaths worldwide, is actually an ischemic condition. In addition to this, the loss of a specific region of the brain because of poor blood perfusion is highly associated with ischemia too and is famously known as stroke.
In fact, every year, about 1.5 million Americans have heart attack causing 500,000 deaths. A heart attack occurs every 20 seconds which results in a death approximately every minute. (1) Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in most Western countries and a major cause of hospital admissions. In 2011, heart attack was one of the top five most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the U.S., with an aggregate cost of about $11.5 billion for 612,000 hospital stays.
The phrase ""heart attack"" is often used non-specifically to refer to myocardial infarction or to sudden cardiac death. An MI is different from, but can cause cardiac arrest, which is the stopping of the heartbeat. It is also distinct from heart failure, in which the pumping action of the heart is impaired. However, an MI may lead to heart failure.

CRISPR Biobricks
During the summer we planned to build several biobricks. In first place we wanted to assemble a composite biobrick made of a pBAD/araC (BBa_I0500), a medium RBS (BBa_0032) our his-tagged CPF1 protein and a double terminator (BBa_0015). The arabinose induced promoter was chosen to avoid expression leakage since expression of endonucleases might lead to cell toxicity (Figure 1a). Secondly, we planned to build a pre-crRNA endowed of a double terminator (BBa_0015) that could be used to target any sequence the user wants to cleave (Figure 1b).
Figure 1: Assembly of the CRISPR biobricks
The spacer of this Biobrick was designed so that it could have been easily replaced with a simple digestion in order for future teams to design and synthesize only their 24 nucleotides long spacer sequence targeting the desired DNA, instead of the full CRISPR array. This pre-crRNA was designed in Full Length Repeat- Spacer- Full Length Repeat, where the repetitive regions were copied from F.tularensis subsp. Novicida 7 strain U112 (Genebank CP000439.1), and a random replaceable spacer sequence of 33 bp was inserted (33 base pairs were used because this was the length of the spacer introduced in between F.tularensis CPF1 CRISPR array. The spacer was endowed of the recognition sites for bsaI restriction enzymes. In this way, straggered cut with different overhangs occurs in the repetitive region, so that by designing the spacer with the correct overhangs, scarless insertion of any spacer into the array is possible (Figure 2). Designing of this sequence was inspired by the design used by Bikard et al. in 2013 for Cas9 CRISPR array plasmid.

Summary
Since the European Jamboree in Amsterdam all four laccases (ECOL, BPUL, TTHL, BHAL) were produced in a 12 L scale and purified to get a high amount of the enzyme for a further characterization.  They were analyzed and compared concerning their activity at different pH and temperature effects. Furthermore they were all screened regarding to their ability of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation.  The immobilization of the four laccases using CPC-beads was optimized and the activity tested.  All of them were active.  Additionally a shuttle vector for Pichia pastoris was constructed, which works as expected. The eukaryotic laccase TVEL5 was successfully cloned into the vector, produced and secreted. Finally lots of efforts were made to construct a protein fused to a cellulose binding domain, but until now, no working fusion protein could be produced.
Laccases
The iGEM Team successfully produced four active bacterial laccases and an eukaryotic laccase (click for the results):

Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.

Hi, my name is Makay Murray (and yes there is to letter ‘c’ in my name, but everyone thinks there should be) I’m currently collecting pre-requisites for Radiology which I plan to take in 2013. I was invited onto iGEM by Isaac and felt that actually working with bacteria in a lab would be very enlightening to know the deeper workings of cellular activity and how to manipulate these natural processes to create something new. While at school I am also the host of a CKXU 88.3fm radio show entitled University Power Users where I talk about stuff that I think students should know but will never be taught in any classroom. When I’m not at school I’m either working at Able Dental Group as a IT tech or enjoying the wonders of technology by playing various videogames like minecraft, DayZ and Halo.

Hey, I'm Zak. The only real reason I get up in the morning is the ever-looming eventuality that humanity will integrate with technology, creating a vast, swarm-like intelligence bent on the consumption of whole stellar systems. To help advance us towards our inevitable conquest, I am studying neuroscience and have decided to take part in the iGEM competition this year! This firm belief also explains my obsession with all consumer technology. I occupy the time between now and our eventual fate with bike rides, camping, and dance parties. Oh yeah, and resistance is futile.

2. When our team member did field investigation, most farmers were still utilizing their own simple plastic device to spray herbicide on the farming land. Simply, there are two disadvantages brought by this method. Firstly, this method is extremely inefficient for application of herbicide, because the limited strength of senior farmers. Secondly, this kind of method may lead to the uneven application of herbicide, therefore, in some area where the herbicide concentration is rather low, there may still grow many weeds. Meanwhile, in the area where the herbicide concentration is high, it may result in compaction of the soil and unforeseeable damage to plants which will be grown on the same region in the future. So in our device designing period, we have taken this into consideration so that we have projected a novel device which can supply our bio-herbicide directly to roots of our plants so that no bio-herbicide will be spoiled, and the distribution of it is rather even.
survey \( \longrightarrow \) model
One of our modeling is set to estimate the amount of weeds in a certain region and weeds’ distribution. To fit most closely to the reality, before we started modeling, our team member had conducted the field survey to acknowledge the mean number of weeds in a certain area. By making several quadrats in the field, our team member count weeds in every quadrat to obtain the first-hand information. And these data is incorporated into our modeling through our chosen method and formula.

Environmental Education At WenCheng Elementary School
In the early days, our hometown was painted as the magnificent landscape where birds were twittering and flower were bathed in gentle sunlight. However, in order to reap staggering profits, large amounts of trees have been cut down as endangered animals have been hunted, thus the large-scale deforestation and imbalance in ecologic environment are leading to the tragic outcome that vast range of grassland is being intruded by desert, that harmony landscape is being substituted by boundless scatter of sands.

Single Cell Discoveries: Dr. Mauro Muraro and Dr. Judith Vivié
Just 2 weeks after the official launch of their company Dr. Mauro Muraro ad Dr. Judith Vivié, co-founders of Single Cell Discoveries, represented their company on the networking market at our conference.
On the 11th September 2018, the official launch of Single Cell Discoveries was celebrated.  Just 9 days later, they have presented  themselves at the networking market of the iGEM Biotechnology Conference! Single Cell Discoveries was founded as a spin-off from the KNAW’s Hubrecht Institute. Both founders worked there as single cell facility manager (Judith) and PhD researcher (Mauro). In these capacities, they collaborated with many scientists from different backgrounds to set-up and analyze single-cell sequencing experiments. Noticing the common problems many researchers faced when setting up single-cell experiments, they decided to join forces and start Single Cell Discoveries, a one-stop-shop for single cell sequencing.
Veterinary Medicine, companion animal: Dr. Louis C. Penning
Veterinary Medicine is more and more an integrated part of biomedicine. The One Medicine concept appreciates the large similarities in disease causes and treatment options in human and animal medicine. Therefore large animals, like horses and dogs, are regained value as predictive models for human medicine, as these animal were in the past. Pavlov reflexes and insulin, are well known examples of “first in dogs” measurements. My group exploits the downside of inbreeding to dissect genetic background or (rare) diseases in men, and uses relevant dog models as pre-clinical models. A exciting examples of this is the dog model for the rare human diseases called Wilson’s disease. Currently we are transplanting autologous and genetically engineered organoids into the liver of the animals in order to achieve functional liver recovery. The fasten implementation we consults liver patient organIsations on a regular base.
