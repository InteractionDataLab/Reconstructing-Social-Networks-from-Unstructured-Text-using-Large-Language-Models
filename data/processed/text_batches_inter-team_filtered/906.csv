Biological Modules: Logic Gates
An electronic full adder is composed of 5 logic gates: 2 XOR, 2 AND and 1 OR.
Transcriptionally regulated logic gates exist and have already been described. However, a major breakthrough in Synthetic Biology appeared during 2013 with two publications (see below) related to recombination-based logic gates. They inspired us and are the basis of our work.
Switching Gate Principle
A careful analysis of the full adder diagram demonstrated that the OR gate can be designed with no recombinases (see below). Therefore we only had to design the AND and XOR gates and we decided to use four different recombinases: TP901.1 integrase, Bxb1 integrase, PhiC31 integrase and FimE. The first AND and XOR gate have been design from Bonnet and al. 2013 , the second ones from Siuti and al. 2013 . Each recombinase is a one way recombinase, it means that its recombination sites have been designed to ensure an one-way switch only. When a sequence between two recombination sites has been"

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) about 2.3 million children die by reason of VAD and still 250,000-500,000 children per day get blind, mainly in developing regions like Africa and Southeast Asia  (see Figure 2). To reduce the high rate of vitamin-A-deficiency and malnutrition, Prof. Potrykus had the vision to increase the amount of micronutrients in food crops. Prof. Beyer and his knowledge of regulating the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in the model plant daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus) helped him executing his plan. The following table (see Table 2) gives a short overview over the fundamental historical developmental steps concerning the realization of the project idea.

Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment is the preparation of a SDS- page, to make a subsequent western blot and to compare the samples, taken at different expression times.
Operational sequence:
The SDS- gel was prepared as previously described (12%). 20µg protein crude extract of each sample were loaded on the gel. Running- time: ca. 2h at 120V. Additionally to the prestained protein marker, we used an un- prestained marker, which contained a 45 kDa protein. Afterwards, the gel was immediately used for the western blot.
Western blot of samples of the expression of CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and eGFP
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
Aim: Analysis of the expression of CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and eGFP (positive controll)after SDS-PAGE (120V, 1.5 h)
Procedure: preparation of solutions: as described in the materials
PBS-T0.1
PBS-T0.1 with 3% BSA
Blotting:
blotting of proteins on ImmobilonP Membrane (activating in methanol for 10 min)
gel and membrane in transferbuffer for 20 min
50mA, 1 h
Blocking:
wash 3x7min with PBS-T0.1
the membrane is blocked over night in PBS-T0.1 with 3% BSA at 4 °C on a shaking device
Sequencing of structural genes of Xanthohumol including the promoter
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Check wheather the gene constructs have mutations in the promoters
Results: The following geneconstructs were sequenced including the promoter:   P194 4Cl- in pYes P263 APT in pYes P197 OMT+ in pYes P198 OMT- in pYes P200 PAL- in pYes P236 PAL+ in pYes All of these sequences did not show any mutation in the promoter. Therefore the fact that our proteins were not detectable might be a result of errors during the transformation. Hence the transformation will be repeated. Parallely our gene constructs will be cloned into a pYes vector backbone of the Limonen group who could successfully express and detect their proteins.

Albert Brown
Throughout my summer, I mostly worked in the lab. With the guidance of the advisors Fatima, John and Alex, I was able to learn a lot about working there, and have been able to carry things out independently when required (such as cloning or further producing our final constructs). The Dundee collegiate wet team members aided greatly in learning the initial ways of how I should go about doing my work; I was also particularly helped by John when performing experiments with the constructs to see if our osmY-hfq fusion was being secreted.
Bartosz Witkowski
Throughout our 8 weeks of iGEM, I worked mainly in the labs to do cloning and experiments. With the help of our lab advisors, John, Fatima and Alex, I was involved in the cloning of our BioBricks and further characterisation by doing experiments such as western blots. I also helped with successfully cloning the spiRNA and working on the motility assays. During the early stages of our lab work I was also helped a lot by the Dundee collegiate team as they showed me how to carry out basic procedures and the art of using a pipette. When I wasn’t in the lab I was working on the wiki content, the presentation or learning some of the concepts behind maths modelling.
Matthew Simmons
I worked mostly in the lab; with the help of the lab advisors, I put most of my time into producing our secretion system, which secreted the fusion construct cloned with help from Bartosz, Albert and Mia. Thanks to them, I was able to learn a lot on how to do the various procedures required to produce our construct. In the beginning of the summer the Dundee collegiate team greatly helped me develop the skills needed"

Biobricks-
Seventh and last trial, first for this week – with the former changes, working in different lab the insert vector ratio has  been changed.
Details:
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
Protocol  changes:
Transformation by  electroporation.
The gel products  extraction, ligation and transformation was done at Prof. Lital Alfonta's  lab with instruction of her lab members.
This time, the insert to  vector ratio was raised to 4:1 instead of 3:1
Results:
The  restriction worked, but again- No colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  it was the last chance for preparing and sending the Biobricks to iGEM, unfortunately  we have no more time to try and make this work. We suspect that step that  prevented successful transformation was the ligation.
Intelligent Medication
Goal:  Fourth try of trying to silence eGFP in CT26 eGFP – we repeated the exact  protocol form the third try, but this time we will only try to analyze results  by real time PCR.
Details:
Same  as in third try.
Results:
The results were analyzed USING THE ??CT method. The cells transfected with our scRNA hairpin contained only 44.4% eGFP mRNA in comparison to untreated cells (with a high standard deviation of 26.1%), while cells transfected with our positive control siRNA contained 38.2% mRNA.
Conclusions:
The ability of our scRNA hairpin to perform silencing when it is unbound by the detection part of our construct is of crucial importance. These results show that it can silence a gene of interest, and in a similar efficiency to that of our positive control. However, the high standard deviation, will require us to repeat the experiment. It is also important to note that the efficiency of both samples is affected by the transfection efficiency, which is dependent of the transfection reagent. Optimizing the transfection might lead to better results and higher silencing efficiencies.

New Database Language
A new language called MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is proposed for automatic modeling of biological system. Due to introducing of novel concepts of species and reaction templates, which are two main components in MoDeL, interactions between species need not to be completely provided and thus making automation possible. [Learn More]
Demos of Automatic Modeling
To show results of our program, some classical genetic regulatory networks are provided as demos, including toggle switch, repressilator as well as quorum-sensing oscillator. Each selected demo, representing a certain pattern of reaction network in biological process, is carefully designed to cover all our features as much as possible. [Learn More]
Human Practice
We started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer to explore the approaches of promotion of synthetic biology. “the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community. All three parts are carefully designed and organized. [Learn More]

I tend to perhaps err on the side of just putting it out there
An important factor that he highlighted that we, and other iGEM teams may not have considered is that encouraging the public to engage with the field might not be such an active process and may be more passive. We need to
rely on the fact that the science itself is utterly fascinating
and the public will seek it out if they have any kind of interest in it.
This interview informed us greatly as to how to better engage with the public. The video itself (at the time of writing) has 338 views, which is the highest viewed video on our channel. We therefore believe that a good way of engaging more people with our work and with synthetic biology, is by engaging more public figures with the field. This is what we ended up doing with our Desert Island Science podcast series (shown above), by interviewing celebrity scientists like Professor Chris Lintott and Professor Jim Al-Khalili.
Furthermore, Prof. Dawkins also gave us some really brilliant advice on how best to approach the public with such a complex and diverse field like synthetic biology. Whilst encouraging us to be clear and concise with our wording was just reassuring for us in what we have already done, the fact that he highlighted that we can be more passive in engaging the public with our field was more of a revelation because it meant that we could spend less time trying to find new, unique ways of publicising our work and more time making good quality content."

The paper/acetate: sensing core
By applying this latex nanoporous coating to a cheap, biodegradable, readily available material like paper, or an equivalent cellulose blend, there is scope for various applications. This will be the core technology of all biosensor designs, as the paper can be cut or distributed in many forms. A schematic for this method can be seen below. After GMO cells are grown up, they are mixed with the latex solution and rolled on sheets of paper using a Meyer roller pull-down system. They are then cut into sticker shapes before being coated with adhesive and stuck on produce.
Product design: Consumer Needs
The latex and cell coated paper sensing strips are the core of the final product design. The fundamental strength in this design is the versatility of applications for these strips.
In developing the final biosensor construct, many different things had to be considered. The most influential factor in designing these devices, and the reason for designing multiple devices, was because of feedback from the potential consumers of our product. Experts from Zespri, Avocados Australia, and Fresh Produce Group, all had unique views on how the biotechnology should be manifested into a final design, based on differing needs.
Avocados Australia was optimistic about a sticker design to help consumers select fruit at the ideal stage of ripeness without damaging the fruit through manual handling.
Zespri prefer to control the ripeness of their produce before it hits the shelves of a supermarket, so consumers can purchase fruit of a consistent stage of ripeness and quality. For this reason, Zespri requested a way to monitor ethylene levels in specific shipping crates in an easy and user-friendly way, technology that would eliminate the need to unbag and re-bag thousands of kilos of kiwifruit for the pure purpose of manual inspection.
Fresh Produce Australia implored the importance of manual handling in their section of the processing chain, because it serves the purpose of eliminating bruised or infected pieces of fruit, as well as acting as a ripeness checkpoint. Once fruit has been unpacked from a shipment, it undergoes rigorous quality assurance checks, is ripened to optimal conditions in ethylene ripening rooms, or is stored under refrigeration. The fruit is required to be inspected for size, colour and other physical features as well, all of which cannot be done by technology. For this reason, whilst our technology might be useful for ripeness monitoring, it would not replace the manual handling stage of this process. Instead, FPA suggested"

Introduction
Spatial factors have a great impact on the results of population competition or cooperation. To understand spatial effects better, we develop our discrete probabilistic solid model.
This model is then used to simulate cell growth in real medium. Also, it is used as the core algorithm in our E-coli war game.
Our Method
Modelling--solid medium
It seems we can use Partial Differential Equation (PDE) directly. However, it will be too complicated to execute PDE fast in program and also difficult for visualization of the changing process, not to say adapting it to our game.
Thus, we choose another method as our solid model fundamental: cellular automaton(CA).
[wikipedia] A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously. [1]
Using the idea of CA, first, we discretize whole space in a medium and total time we take to nourish cells; second, we set placement rules, i.e. events that will happen after a cell is put onto medium; third, we set iteration"

6. Mg++ and additives: Mg++ concentration of 2.0 mM is optimal for most PCR products generated with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. When used at a final concentration of 1X, the Q5 Reaction Buffer provides the optimal Mg++concentration.
Amplification of some difficult targets, like GC-rich sequences, may be improved by the addition of 1X Q5 High GC Enhancer. The Q5 High GC Enhancer is not a buffer and should not be used alone. It should be added only to reactions with the Q5 Reaction Buffer when other conditions have failed.
7. Deoxynucleotides:  The final concentration of dNTPs is typically 200 μM of each deoxynucleotide. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase cannot incorporate dUTP and is not recommended for use with uracil-containing primers or templates.
8. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase concentration: We generally recommend using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase at a final concentration of 20 units/ml (1.0 unit/50 μl reaction). However, the optimal concentration of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may vary from 10–40 units/ml (0.5–2 units/50 μl reaction) depending on amplicon length and difficulty. Do not exceed 2 units/50 μl reaction, especially for amplicons longer than 5 kb.
9. Buffers: The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer provided with the enzyme is recommended as the first-choice buffer for robust, high-fidelity amplification. For difficult amplicons, such as GC-rich templates or those with secondary structure, the addition of the Q5 High GC Enhancer can improve reaction performance. The 5X Q5 Reaction Buffer is detergent-free and contains 2.0 mM MgCl2 at the final (1X) concentration.
10. Denaturation: An initial denaturation of 30 seconds at 98°C is sufficient for most amplicons from pure DNA templates. Longer denaturation times can be used (up to 3 minutes) for templates that require it.
During thermocycling, the denaturation step should be kept to a minimum. Typically, a 5–10 second denaturation at 98°C is recommended for most templates.
11. Annealing: Optimal annealing temperatures for Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase tend to be higher than for other PCR polymerases. The NE"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," for the spores that contain sequestered cadmium, not all the cells would have sequestered cadmium, and it is also essential that we still have some cells germinating, so that our population of bacteria can continue to live and grow, reaching a balance, and not simply deplete totally.
Therefore, a mechanism is needed to allow us to choose to turn on germination, when the cell is not a ""metal container"". In order to do so, our team intends to use IPTG as a switch for germination, and the non-germination spores used in our project is the double-knock out mutant, sleB and cwlJ.
Population simulation
Due to our project being based around taking a section of our bacterial population, and making them sporulate, but not germinate again, we need to make sure that we do not kill off our entire population. Thus we need to be able to tune our system, so that we can have a large enough percentage of metal sequestering spores to make a positive environmental impact, but also a small enough percentage, so that the population will continue to live and grow.
The novel part of this sub-project is to model the dynamics of a bacterial population, on the cellular level, as well as integrating this agent based model with biochemical models. Furthermore our simulation is able to run on distributed systems, making use of a large number of computers at once.
This section of the project is a model simulation , which describes a high level working of our complete system. It also includes detail from other models, as it uses these in its decision making processes. The model has been developed in the Java programming language, but also uses other technologies including running CellML models.
Promoter Library
Some of the promoters we intend to use for our BioBricks will require different strengths. Part of our project will involve making a library of Sigma A promoters for Bacillus subtilis and measuring their varying strengths; with this data we will use a sigma A promoter variant for a BioBrick according to the desired strength. As stated in the instructors meeting on the 22/04/09 , we could measure the expression of fluorescent protein.
We designed variances of sigA consensus sequence by degenerating it between and around -35 region and -10 region.

Tuebingen,2016,Team:Tuebingen#CloneWars_-_-_TEXT.html,"’d need something, that can bind plasmid-DNA, but does not bind genomic DNA. This can only be achieved through a sequence specific binding, so we’ll have to use nature’s toolkit for this.
There are a lot of very specific DNA binding proteins out there, for example the zinc-finger proteins, which are already well characterised from their use in zinc-finger-nucleases. However, proteins are not very stable and putting them directly on a column is - while obviously possible - pretty much the opposite of what makes an method easy to use or cheap.
So how can we use proteins to bind plasmids, without having them prepared? Well - as always, we could say - our friends the bacteria can help us. If we already need to design a plasmid with a specific binding sequence in it, why not make that plasmid express a protein, that directly binds it? That way we only need a way bind our protein of interest with a specific tag. For strong binding and maximum efficiency we can use biotin and fuse our DNA-binding protein with streptavidin.
The combination of 3D printing and some good old chemistry gives us the possibility to create our own columns with a biotinylated surface, that should be able to pull our plasmids from E. coli lysates.
Design
The idea is simple: by integrating an inducible kill gene into the backbone, we can specifically select for our desired combination.
Using different inducers and kill switches, which can be found in the registry by loads, we can create a series of plasmids which can also be combined to bring more than one plasmid into the same culture of bacteria.
Kill cassettes
The first idea which comes to mind when thinking about kill switches is the combination of Holin and Endolysin (Young, 2002), which was already used by several iGEM teams. However, other proteins such as PezT (pneumococcal epsilon-zeta toxin, Mutschler et al., 2011) , part of a prokaryotic toxin/antitoxin system, were already used in iGEM as well, e.g. by Team Hamburg in 2015. PezT is smaller than Holin, which makes it easier to integrate into the plasmids, and also makes it easier to transform.  We decided to look at both variants.
Looking at different induction systems, we chose three well-known systems: the LacI and LacZ cassettes, as well as a rhamnose"

Stony_Brook,2017,Team:Stony Brook#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," can be divided on the basis of two groups: those produced by gram-negative bacteria (colicins and microcins), and those produced by gram-positive (divided into five classes). Our phylogenetic tree of 93 bacteriocin sequences was composed of 14 class I bacteriocins, 64 class II bacteriocins, 4 class III bacteriocins, 6 class V bacteriocins, and 5 colicin bacteriocins that served as an outgroup. Each color on the tree below represents a clade grouped on the basis of relative divergence time (≤ 0.17).
Class II bacteriocins, which are small, unmodified membrane-active peptides, can be further divided into four subclasses. There was a correlation between subclass and homology for class IIa and class IId bacteriocins, but not for class IIb and class IIc. For example, all class IIa bacteriocins related to the pediocin family, such as enterocins, had very close divergence times (yellow to orange region). The protein structural analysis supports these results, as all these bacteriocins contain the conserved N-terminal sequence KYYGNGVXCXXXXCXV(D/N)WGXA, with the sequence between the two cysteines consisting of one or two charged residues, and a serine or threonine residue [2]. Class IId bacteriocins, which are leaderless peptides that are synthesized and secreted without a further processing [3], were especially important because this subclass includes our starting bacteriocin, lacticin Z. Fortunately, like class IIa, most of these bacteriocins shared homology (cyan to light-green region).
There was also little correlation between evolutionary history and bacteriocin class for classes III and V (no common colored region). However, because bacteriocins are grouped into classes based on their internal cross linking and primary structures [4], this was likely due to the small number of bacteriocin sequences we analyzed, all of which happened to be diverse by chance. In contrast, most class I bacteriocins, which are small post-translationally modified peptides, showed a close evolutionary history (dark-blue region).
Results: Divergence and Clustering
The figure below represents the same tree, but with each color/clade grouped under one arbitrary name. The parenthesis denote the number of sequences in each group. Relative divergence times are shown on the branches, with the largest divergence time being from the colicin outgroup to the enterocin group (9.79).

SYSU-CHINA,2018,Team:SYSU-CHINA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," global effect on the immune system, rendering the patients more vulnerable to        opportunistic infections by bacteria, fungi and viruses. It has been demonstrated that rheumatoid arthritis patients have higher rate        of respiratory infections(Hoshi et al., 2012) . In addition, a recent study suggested a        correlation between CRS and rate of infection(Hill et al., 2018) . Although no causative        conclusion can be drawn that the immunosuppressive treatment for CRS leads to those infection, the risk of immunosuppression-       associated infections should not be overlooked, and it is desirable to mitigate adverse effects in CAR T therapies without global        inhibition on the immune system.
Suicide Genes
Compared to the systemic effect of immunosuppressive drugs, genetic modification of the infused CAR T cells is able to provide a more        precise control on the infused cell population alone. A straightforward method is to engineer suicide genes in CAR T cells and remove        transferred cell population when giving drugs(Marin et al., 2012) . The first suicide gene        evaluated in the clinical trials is thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus, which can induce cell death by DNA synthesis        inhibition upon treatment with ganciclovir. Inducible dimerization of Fas or caspase 9 serves as a second strategy for selective        depletion of modified cells. The inducible caspase 9 (ICas9) molecule contains an FK506 binding domain and is able to mediate        dimerization of caspase 9 domain when adding AP1903, and ultimately induce cell apoptosis(Budde et        al., 2013) . A third method is achieved by programming the cells to express truncated epidermal growth factor receptors on the        cell surface, which can be targeted by antibody and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Wang et al., 2011) .
However, these methods could deplete CAR-T cells and halt the expensive treatment. Repeat the treatment may be a burden on the        patients, both physically and financially.
Controllable Receptors
Another strategy is to engineer the CAR receptors, rendering them requiring additional signals, typically a small molecule drug, to        fully activate. Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2015) first demonstrated the such strategy by        constructing a split synthetic receptor, with one chain containing the extracellular scFv, hinge and costimulatory domain and the        other containing the activation domain of CD3zeta.

LCG-UNAM-Mexico,2008,Team:LCG-UNAM-Mexico#Notebook#2008-August 2_-_-_TEXT.html,"First of all, we think you are confused about what our project really is. We  want to make bacteria to modify the extracellular nickel concentration in  response to an external signal (AHL in this case), and of course, be able to  predict to what extent the concentration of the input signal will affect the  amount of nickel in the medium. To achieve this, it is true we have to  synchronize our cell population at the beginning. This is easy to do and  doesn't represent any technical problems.
We are very conscious of the facts you tell us, first: we know the half-life of  the lactones is relatively long (24 hrs as you say). That's why we are  including AiiA under a constitutive promoter in our model, which degrades AHL  very efficiently. This will ensure AHL does not saturate the medium. Second, we  know AiiA does not diffuse freely through the cell membrane. However, we don't  need that to happen, as each cell will degrade its own AHL (yes, we are  assuming that all AHL will enter a cell within a window of time).
In other words, we do not need to  synchronize the bacterial population more than in the first step. We are  considering that some cells may respond earlier than others. However, we are  assuming that, as we are not changing the physical nor chemical conditions, the  proportion of cells responding ""earlier"" will remain constant, thus  allowing us to draw some conclusions of the behaviour of the population as a  whole. We hope you see why the synchrony is no longer important for our  project.
To summarize what we plan to do, AHL will enter the cell and form a dimer with  LuxR (which is under a constitutive promoter, so AHL is the only limiting  step). This will start the transcription of cI*, which will repress the  expression of RcnA. RcnA is the nickel efflux pump, and thus we are aiming to  predict the amount of AHL necessary to get the desired extracellular nickel  concentration.
We are doing small moves. At first, we only want to make one successful assay.  We hope that in the near future we will be able to use the response time of the  system to generate a succession of desired nickel concentrations, thus  generating a song.
We hope this letter answers your questions,

- Done! To summarize our other efforts from the collaboration page, we:
- Organized a pen pal program, featured on the iGEM website, to facilitate the establishment of collaborative relationships between teams around the world
- Provided Cambridge-JIC iGEM with fluorescent constructs with which to test their imaging process, and
- Measured fluorescent samples to provide data for UGA-Georgia iGEM’s project.
Demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state of the art in cost, efficiency, precision, resolution, and/or other relevant capabilities of your measurement technique or a previous iGEM team measurement project.
- By incorporating the dual reporter system and the associated mathematical theory developed by Michael Elowitz and coauthors, we demonstrate a measurement concept never before conducted in iGEM-- measuring noise for its own sake rather than as a consequence of a measured signal. The use of Elowitz et al’s theory to decompose the intrinsic and extrinsic components of transcriptional noise provides novel and unprecedented insights into the behavior of the promoters on the Registry, providing iGEM with a new metric by which to characterize these parts.
Demonstrate the ease of accessibility and/or portability of a new or existing measurement technique of your choosing. Document the use of the measurement technique in a lab other than your own on your team wiki.
- Done! Because we wish to instill a shift in the mindset of how iGEM teams view transcriptional noise, the reproducibility of our measurements is of utmost importance. In addition to providing detailed protocols and primer sequences on our Wiki, we also created a part, the galK Integrator , with which other teams can integrate reporter constructs under any promoter of their choosing to measure the intrinsic noise in the promoter.

OPEN PROBLEMS
Through the model we described the E. amylovora's behavior changes caused by the aiiA enzyme insertion. Nevertheless, the project is based on the combination of three enzymes to reach our goal and inhibit the E. amylovora's virulence factors. We are aware that there is more to do, so with a little help from our friends from IONIS Paris, the yhjH enzyme model is now a future project. They helped us to 3D model the yhjH enzyme (shown below) and to take certain conditions under consideration to its proper activity. Thanks to this edition model, the unregulated gene inhibition over a regulated one can be taken as a basis, and together with the 3D simulation, a second model could be achieved.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html,"ides as it may nurture a form of scaremongering: communication must be managed with care.  We can take the very heated and publicized debate around the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an example. This protein makes the editing of the genome quicker and cheaper than ever, thus opening new perspectives for genetic manipulations applied to animals, and ultimately humans. This technical breakthrough has had the side effect of shining the spotlight  on  the very fundamental issue of what is acceptable or not when it comes to manipulating our genes at will as well as the risks involved in trying to do it. When using the CRISPR technology, one of the important technical difficulties is the presence “off-target effects” that can lead the protein to cut in an unwanted spot in the genome. The imprecision of the technology could have dramatic consequences if used in a medical environment. However, we can hypothesize that an overly alarmist media coverage of these “off target effects” could lead the general opinion to be definitely opposed to any further research concerning CRISPR-Cas9, especially future therapeutic applications. From this assumption, a solution would be to not even be discussing those “off target effects” until they are resolved by the researchers. “Managing transparency is a work the scientist could do and would be a lot more productive than not saying things, or exposing extreme points of view in order to tame the public’s concerns” claims Prof. Gaia Barazzetti, ethicist specialized in bioethics. “I believe  that publicly speaking about risks - if scientists ever agree on a way to do it - could be a good opportunity to build trust with the general public”, she continues, stressing that a constant race for spectacular innovation is not the only way forward in science. Time should be taken to talk about risks and how to reduce them, she adds. Conversely, according to Prof. Duboule, public exposure of the current technical issues encountered by a technology such as Cas9 tends to move the debate away from the really important questions. “For me, those [off target effects] are secondary problems that will be solved in the coming decades. The real question is: how will we apply this technology?”
The desire for a constant and transparent flow of information is certainly praiseworthy, but how exactly could it be achieved? Traditional media such as newspapers, radio and television can participate in this process, but they tend to focus on science only in the case of significant scientific breakthroughs or important scientific fraud and polemics, as they need to stay entertaining and relevant for their respective audience. “There is unfortunately no room  in mainstream media"

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," cell culture from glucose uptake assay. Conditions indicated on the graphs are: Basal (no insulin added); Ecotin Proinsulin (from whole cell lysate with trypsin treatment); Cytoplasmic Proinsulin (from whole cell lysate with trypsin treatment); YncM Winsulin (cell culture media only). Refer to protocols page for experimental details. Error bars represent SEM, horizontal bars indicate statistical significance (* = p<0.05, ** = p<0.0001) calculated with GraphPad Prism using unpaired 1-tailed T-test, n=3.
To validate physiological activity of Cytoplasmic proinsulin, Ecotin proinsulin, and secreted YncM Winsulin which were detected in the highest concentrations in the ELISA, we performed glucose uptake assays using both mouse and human adipocyte cell lines. Measurement of the rate of glycogen synthesis as part of this assay found that cells treated with Ecotin and Cytoplasmic proinsulin had significantly higher activity than cells at the basal level. The results of this assay also gave a strong indication that secreted YncM Winsulin is biologically functional, however the results for YncM Winsulin were not considered statistically significant and hence could not be definitively proven. This could be due to the fact that we did not have sufficient insulin remaining from the His-tag purified B. subtilis media to perform the assay at the recommended concentration of 10nM insulin. It is possible that insulin was lost during the His-tag purification step, or that only small amounts of insulin were secreted by B. subtilis in the first place. Both of these possibilities will be tested further.
A more in depth evaluation of our future direction can be found on the results page.
Overall, we believe that this project was a success!"

Module 2 - Encapsulsation
The E.ncapsulator has been designed to be able to withstand  the rigours of stomach acid and freeze drying. This is achieved by the synthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid and the cryoprotectant trehalose.
Module 2 Timeline
Rationale
To ferry polypeptides through the stomach, each of our microcapsules must withstand a heated protease–rich acidic environment in the stomach. Few chassis have the potential to withstand this harsh environment. Since our microcapsules are inanimate, we cannot rely on any of the active acid–resistance strategies that living bacteria are able to deploy.
  About proteolysis.
To tackle this seemingly insurmountable problem we adopted a two phase approach.
Phase 1: Identify a suitable chassis with the genotypic potential for acid–resistance.
Phase 2:Manipulate endogenous acid resistance pathways to control the acid resistant phenotype.
Phase 1: Which Chassis?
Our rationale for looking for natural sources of acid resistance is that it is easier to hack existing pathways than to transfer large numbers of genes into a different chassis with a dissimilar genetic background.
Based on natural sources of acid resistance, Lactobacillus, E.coli and B.subtilis were shortlisted as potential chassis.
Of these three organisms, E.coli was chosen as it is safe, easy to work with and possesses a broad range of acid resistance strategies.
E.coli and acid resistance:
While E.coli has endogenous acid resistance pathways, colonisation of the gut is based on a ""numbers approach"". In essence, the majority of E.coli cells in"

OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and all other components were assumed insignificant initially to this value. An ideal light pulse was introduced at an instant and removed thirty simulation seconds later. From this rudimentary simulation it can be drawn that the nonlinearities of the phosphorylation and transcription factor binding kinetics effectively smooth the sharp light input.  By design, the light switch ON yields phosphorylation of OmpR and repression of the pucB/A genes which would give rise to LH2.  Conversely, when left OFF, the concentration of pucB/A recovers and increases until the steady state determined by its translation and degradation rates.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," and put a constitutive promoter or e coli is not producing LacI. Do you think that the second reason is possible? i'm almost sure is not the first one, ha. Anyway i was looking in the registry and i couldn't find a biobrick with LacI controlled by a constitutive promoter (no PTet because that promoter is in the cascade). so we should assembly one ourselves.
As the solution. There are 4 steps to be taken:
Sequence the promoter
Post in iGEM forums, maybe other users are also experiencing the same problems.
Contact the other teams who posted that they are using LacI
Contact iGEM HQ.
Daniel will take action on those points. Worst case scenario, LacI will be removed. Furthermore, Daniel contacted some iGEM teams to ask how did they do the lock-and-key ribo-regulators. So far, 2 different lock-and-key pairs are designed, characterized (medium and low RBS) and the 3rd one is communicated with the other iGEM teams.
Lastly, one organizational note: Daniel will start his MSc project at the beginning of September.

Figure 2.The first stage
In the first stage, the main members of TJU-IGEM make appointment with the leaders of Students' union. We had a relaxing and friendly chat in the resting place in Tianjin University. Our team members introduced IGEM from the basic concept to the schedule of competition. The concrete and feasible plan was put in place. Both sides set the time for the IGEM introductory session after negotiating. This campus talk aimed to attract students in Nankai University to join IGEM. After that a new team could be build sooner. In addition, our leader gave guidance on team member cultivation and funding preparation. The chairman of Students's Union of Nankai University appreciated our detailed introduction and explanation. In the ending of our meeting, we provided them enough material including our past wikis and pictures. Considering strong research abilities of NKU and useful experience of TJU-IGEM, we both have enough confidence in a new team to construct.
Figure 3. The second stage: visit the laboratory
In the conference room at Nankai University, we organized a propaganda activity named ""start your IGEM journeys"". A lot of aspiring students from various kinds of majors who want to take part in the next IGEM competition participate in our activity. In the beginning of the propagandist conference, we introduce the background of IGEM and give a brief description of the whole process of the competition. Then, we conclude the previous wonderful case of Tianjin IGEM team, of course, we also talk about the failed experience to announce them not to make the same mistakes again. In the end, as successfully pave the way to the final jamboree, we also arranged a Q&A session to address the Nankai students who doubt on the other parts of the competition. As soon as the conference is end, many students express their wishing to join us.
In addition to the meeting, Nankai students expect us to give some experimental guidance. So we decide to have another exchange activity in the laboratory. This time, we visited each other laboratories and work with them in the lab. We hope that through our presentation as well as the intriguing experimental process an increasing number of individuals will be impressed by the natural miracle and devote themselves into the field of molecular biology.
A reserve Nankai IGEM team is established! After a series of activities, many students are registered for the IGEM team. We decided the final list through the selection from our team and Nankai CAST.

Purpose
This year the Calgary iGEM team undertook our project with human practices in mind.  While we had established a research objective to produce a biosensor and bioreactor system, we wanted to ensure that our system was relevant to the industry where it would be employed.  As well, we wanted to ensure that academic, government, and industry professionals' concerns were taken into consideration during the design process of our system.  In order to best accomplish this, we conducted interviews with two leaders in oilsands reclamation.  We approached a major oilsands company, Suncor, and talked to Christine Daly, an Ecologist who works in Environmental Cleanup.  We then approached Ryan Radke, the president of BioAlberta.  BioAlberta focuses on bringing biotechnology to our province and develop these in an industrial setting.  His experience allowed us to better predict if our project would raise concerns"

THE IDEA
Our aim in this part of the project is to detect when the yeast starts to ferment. To do this, we are going to use two gene constructions. The first construction consists of the ADH2 promoter fused to the YAP1 protein coding sequence. In the second construction the TRR promoter is fused to the GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) coding sequence.
We use the ADH2 promoter (alcohol dehydrogenase) to sense the glucose/ethanol concentration. When this promoter is activated, YAP1 is expressed. This protein will attach to TRR promoter (thioredoxin reductase), which will become activated if the constitutive yeast protein SKN7 is in its oxidized form and also interacts with the promoter. This activation will enable transcription of GFP. H2O2 has to be added in order to oxidize the SKN7 protein.
Outline
- We ordered the DNA constructions: pADH2-YAP1 protein and pTRR-GFP protein which comes in the bacterium plasmid pUC57.
- We already had the Yeplac181 and Yep352 yeast vectors in our laboratory.
- We carried out four transformations in E. coli, one for each DNA molecules (the two constructions and the two vectors), in order to clone them. See the Transformation Protocol Using Heat Shock .
- We obtained several E. coli colonies in four dishes and took some colonies of each DNA (two constructions and two vectors) to grow them in liquid medium overnight  at 37 ºC in a shake chamber.
- The next day we extracted the DNA molecules. See the Mini-prep Protocol .
- We obtained the purified constructions (both in pUC57 plasmid) and the purified yeast vector (YEplac181 and YEp352).
- We digested the four DNA molecules with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI. See the digestion protocol .
- We"

In order to meet the Registry standards, we aimed to clone these elements into pSB1C3. To do so, we proceeded as described on figure 8. Two separate rounds of digestion were carried out using EcoRI, NcoI, PvuII and PstI to, and the resulting fragments (AcsA, AcsB, AcsC and AcsD and linearized pSB1C3) were submitted to a three-part ligation after dephosphorylation of the vector backbone (rAPid desphosphorylation, Roche). An equimolar ratio amongst all three parts was established during the ligation procedure, which in turn proceeded at 4 degrees overnight. The NEB High Efficiency Transformation protocol was used on NEB 10B cells (New England Biolabs) to propagate the resulting plasmid. Transformed cells were plated and incubated overnight at 37 C. 5 ml LB supplied with 50 ug/ml Chloramphenicol were inoculated with a selection of colonies for further analysis (refer to Results for additional information).
3.4 Assembly of pSB-AraC-pBAD-AcsAB
AcsAB was cloned into pSB-AraC-pBAD by Biobrick cloning. The destination vector was linearized using SpeI and PstI (New England Biolabs), and AcsAB (previously digested with XbaI and PstI, and gel extracted using the Minelute Gel Extraction Kit, by Qiagen) was ligated at a 1:1 ratio throughout an overnight ligation at room temperature. The resulting part was transformed into chemically competent DH10B Escherichia coli and plated on LB Agar+Chloramphenicol plates, grown overnight at 37 C. 5 ml LB falcons supplied with 50 ug/ml Chloramphenicol were inoculated with a selection of freshly grown colonies for further restriction analysis (refer to Results for additional information)
3.5 Assembly of pSB-LacI-pLAC-CD
Similarly to 3.4, AcsCD was cloned by BioBrick cloning into the pSB3K3 low copy expression vector containing the LacI-pLAC regulatory elements. Vector and insert were ligated at a 1:1 ratio overnight at room temperature. After transformation and plating on LB Agar+Kanamycin (25 ug/ml), colonies were screened by Greenta"

Tianjin iGEM
This year, the Tianjin team in China worked on Clock Mechanisms, which would utilize some circadian clock proteins discovered in Synechococcus elongatus (strain PCC 7942) (Anacystis nidulans R2).
We XMU-China also made efforts in Circadian clock “Kai”. Unfortunately, three kinds of protein which we used can not be produced in our lab, because the DNA ordered from IDT was disabled.
However, when we talked about circadian clock with members in Tianjin Team, we were lucky enough to be informed that they could provide us with the DNA we needed. Thanks to their donations, our study on rebuilding circadian clock “Kai” in E.coli can proceed.
More details about Tianjin’s work can be found in https://2018.igem.org/Team:Tianjin
Newsletter
This year we have newsletters with other iGEM teams from schools of all over the world, like Boston University (BU), Technische Universiteit Delft（TUDelft）,TUST, ECUST, JNU and so on. Those letters are precious and beneficial since they enable different teams to share projects and views with each other, especially on topics like team information, team introduction, project description, etc. There is a link that you can see the new version of the newsletters . Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project improving araBAD_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the induced state however, the differences in the levels of GFP expression varies significantly with some of the promoters being more active and others less active than the original promoter in strain 300. This confirms the value of SPL in the engineering of the strength of promoters. Indeed, the variability created within our very small subset of tested isolates already spans a wide range of promoter activities while still retaining the most important characteristics of the arabinose promoter, its tightness.
Figure 4 Characterization of SPL changed araBAD promoters fused to GFP in DH5$\alpha$ cells. Strain 300 has the unchanged BBa_I746908. Induction at 0.2% arabinose concentration. FU - fluorescence unit, LSU - light scattering unit.
Finally we compared the relative activity [5] of both the rationally designed promoters and SPL. Figure 5 depicts that 6 of the mutated promoters are characterized by a higher activity than the original promoter. The most active one, 3h, is twice as strong. 15 promoters have lower activity.
Figure 5 Comparison between relative promoter activities [5] for all characterized promoters.
Conclusion
Rationally changing the arabinose promoter as well as using the Synthetic Promoter Library proved to be succesfull in terms of improving the dynamic range of this promoter at the saturation level of inducer. This approach extends the last year DTU team efforts to improve constitutive promoter ( SPL for constitutive promoter ). It provides the framework for selecting an inducible promoter of a desired strength in a high-troughput manner. We believe that this approach can easily be applied to other inducible promoters.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

The principle via which we form a Bacillus biofilm coating is applicable to a number of hosts. Next to that, research could be done to perhaps alter the chaplins so the coating could be functionalized for drug delivery, cell adhesion or anti-bacterial activity.
Concrete protection
As the Newcastle team enters this years’ competition with a B. subtilis machine that fixes cracks in concrete, preventing corrosion and water- or frost-induced damage to buildings, roads or monuments; we have a great addition to their project (or the other way around). Hydrophobic coatings are used to protect concrete structures from corrosion damage, especially when reinforced with metal bars. Our B. subtilis biofilm would be able to do the same thing by filling up cracks and reducing water inflow by chaplin production: thus preventing damage by water or ice.
A combination of both projects would make for great bacterial machinery: As the crack-filling bacteria repel the water and ice that is damaging concrete structures further damage is prevented and repair is accelerated.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2014,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Part2 Maximize_-_-_TEXT.html," be a Craftsmen
A compact machine requires bold ideas and careful practicing. Here comes how we built our Crown.
Construction Method
Above all, we use 3 sets of Connectee1 to build polymerization system. There are four main parts in a Connectee1 for testing.
ssDsbA: SsDsbA is the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent signaling sequence of DsbA. SsDsbA-tagged proteins are exported to the periplasm through the SRP pathway. With ssDsbA fused to the N-terminus, fusion proteins with Lgt are expected to be anchored onto inner membrane of E.coli.
FP: To visualize the localization of fusion protein with fluorescence test , we added FP in the Connectee1 and placed it just after the ssDsbA. We chose mRFP,CFP,YFP in our system.
Lgt: Phosphatidylglycerol prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) is an inner membrane protein act as an membrane anchor of E.coli with seven transmembrane segments and has been successfully overexpressed in E. coli without causing harm to cells.
TAL effectors：As mentioned earlier，we choose three kinds of combinations to build three different TAL proteins, which is based on the parts that the team of Freiburg offered in 2012. These three TAL proteins can identify three different 14bp nucleotide sequences on a Connector. Note that we added a His Tag at the end of TAL protein to facilitate separation and purification.
For the three kinds of corresponding Connector2, we did not introduced ssDsbA-Lgt section to keep them in a free intracellular state.
In the final production of our construction, we add an easy-to-hand interface sequence between the Lgt and TAL protein in Connector1 or just before the TAL protein in Connector 2, as sites to adding enzymes.
Co-Transformation & Induced Expression
Expression vectors used in the project for membrane protein expression are modified versions of pRSFDuet-1, pETDuet-1,pACYCDuet-1(NOVAGEN), which are originally regulated by T7 promoter. These plasmids can coexist in one cell.
The Connector is pBluescript II KS(+) .
We used the four reformed plasmids to co-transform and induced the Connectors to express. Now the structure of the crown appears in the E. coli cell membrane or cytoplasm.
Test methods
We use formaldehyde to stabilize the connected"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Achivements_-_-_TEXT.html,". By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way.
Figure 4: Flowchart representing the phage display outline.
3. Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reported to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.
Figure 5: We would be able to detect the wormd in feces with this method.
4. Modeling
Optimization of the Time Between Treatments
To make sure the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimized usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimized use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model constitutes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.

We shared project and current progress with each other through Skype. What’s more, we had a further discussion concerning image processing.
Meetups
Online conference about heavy ion pollution
We had an online conference about potential collaboration about China’s current situation of water pollution. There are 8 teams participated in the conference: TJU , UCAS, XMU, SCUT-A ,                             SCUT-B, FAFU , JLU , and us SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We first introduced our project to each other including lab experiment, Human Practice, current progress and problems as well as willingness                             to cooperate. Then we shared the information we had obtained lately, including some conclusion we had drawn after interviewing, investigating and reading literature.
Online conference held by XMU
This conference is mainly held for communication. We participated in that using Skype with UCAS, XMU, NCKU and SCUT-A.
We learned that SCUT-A was dealing with a color analysis application which is similar to what we have achieved in our app. We shared the theory of our app with them and offered them suggestion on developing such app. NCKU mentioned CGU who was doing some                             image processing work and suggested us that CGU may provide us some advice on developing app. We then had an online conference with CGU which we will write about later.
What’s more, NCKU gave us advice on bacterium conservation. When we mentioned we use paper to hold bacteria, they suggested us that we could apply the technique of lyophilized. It was helpful and we took it into consideration when                             we discussed the possible methods to conserve the bacteria.

Community open day held by Tongji University
This year, we went to fablab in Tongji University and participated in the open day hosted by Tongji University. We brought our project to the activity and shared it with other schools and residents who came by that day. The community                             open day attracted many people stop to listen.

We can then use KpnI in a similar way to attach a β-glucosidase at either end.
Then attach INP.
Genetic instability
In order to display several different proteins on one bacterium using the first strategy, it will be necessary to have several copies of the INP gene fused to different enzymes. The presence of repeated sequences on a plasmid can lead to genetic instability.
This will not be a problem in the JM109 lab strain, which lacks an important recombination enzyme. As for the use of this technology in industry, it will be possible to overcome this problem simply by synthesising coding sequences with as many altered (but synonymous) codons as possible. We have written a software tool for designing such sequences... see the genetic instability page.
Proof of concept: YFP
As far as we know, nobody has used BBa_K265008 for cell display. We could prove that it works by simply displaying the Yellow Fluorescent Protein on INP. Indeed, something similar was achieved by Li et al (2004) and Li et al (2009) for a different version of the gene.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,", its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of tree nodes' weight make it possible to sort the forest. For convenience, we add a virtual node ROOT, whose weight value could also be obtained under the general rule, as the root of all trees in the forest and make a conversion from forest to tree. The tree structure could be uniquely determined by recursively sorting all children of each nodes by their weights.
Back to the question above, if two chains have the same unicode_c, which should be arranged ahead? The answer lies in the exchange of them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees. The tree structure (with virtual root) is also possible to change. If the tree structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the tree structure changes, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange the two chains with equal unicode_c. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm could be used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code is actually a representation of the path from current node to the root, we can restore the tree structure from the set of Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes set of leaf nodes could uniquely represent a tree structure. We could generate a string, unicode_t for tree structure by splicing the Huffman codes and their weight of all leaf nodes sorted by their weights and adding a asterisk between two adjacent codes, for example:
[000:0:1][001:1:3][010:2:3][011:2:4]
Based on this idea, we could obtain the tree unicode_t for any possible order by exchanging equivalent chains and choose the order which make the minimum unicode_t value. By checking the unicode_t value of permutation, chains are grouped in a number of equivalent classes, which contains one or more chains. Chains within each equivalent classes are equivalent: exchanging order of any two chains will not change the tree structure.
It is easy to compare two Chain-Model structures with the help of chain sorting. We only need to compare unicode_c value of chains in the chain list"

2. ""Works Like"" - Prototypes that function properly but do not look anything similar to the final product.
Our prototype falls under the first category. Contact us to check out our product prototype at the Jamboree.
Development of Packaging
For an interesting in-depth step by step design process of our product prototype, development of packaging and formulation please check the Applied Design page .
It is important to have a unique and an attractive package for a cosmetic product to be considered by the consumers. The packaging creates the first impression. Here is our design of the eco-friendly wooden box for product packaging. For mass production, a wooden package is most probably too expensive, but for the project we wanted to focus on a beautifully designed piece as well as a concept for a package that can be used after the product has ran out. In the future the package could be a polylactide (PLA) tube or a coated paper tube which would be easy to recycle or burn.
Quality Testing
We carried out quality testing experiments including a shelf-life study and the stability of our product. The Urlinski company, which designs and manufactures the equipment for production of cosmetics and medicines, pointed out that the biggest problem with preservative-free biomaterial based products is contamination. In our experiments we noticed, that some of our samples got contaminated in room temperature. We concluded that biobased products get too readily contaminated, especially if the product is kept in room temperature and handled with bare hands. Thus we tried out different formulations for our product with an approved cosmetic preservative: benzyl alcohol (3%) and carried out a shelf-life study. Another advantage of including benzyl alcohol into formulation was the fragrance it added to the product.

Production Scale-up Estimation
From the 500 ml batch, we were able to produce around 30 mg of the DCD-1L peptide. Our next step was to estimate the production cost for a semi-medium scale up process.

Vanillin in Novel Plants Project
Vanillin is one of the major compounds in the vanilla flavor. A phenolic aldehyde, vanillin is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, beverages, as well as a fragrant compound in different products. The demand of Vanillin exceeded the natural production, so annually most vanillin is produced via chemical synthesis.  We intend to produce vanillin in different plants as a natural alternative for vanillin production.

Introduction
Whether it’s a child’s first ice cream cone or the secret ingredient of a five star chef, everyone loves vanilla flavoring. Europeans first became aware of vanilla around 1520 and ever since then countless products featuring the beloved aromatic have been created. Vanillin, one of the major compounds in the vanilla flavor, is often produced by chemical synthesis due to the scarcity and high cost of natural vanilla extract.  Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-lysase, more commonly known as HCHL, is an enzyme that converts feruloyl-CoA to vanillin and acetyl-CoA. HCHL is naturally produced by Pseudomonas putida Kt2440, a gram-negative rod-shaped saprotrophic soil bacterium. As plants naturally possess large pools of phenolic compounds used in lignin biosynthesis, we hope to be able to express HCHL within plants to convert feruoyl-CoA to vanillin.
Background
In order to express this enzyme within plants, HCHL must be cloned from Pseudomonas putida and modified for codon optimization in plants. This modification will involve the use of the Kozak sequence, which through experimental observation has been recognized as playing a major role in translational initiation. Additionally, a double stop codon along with the CaMV 35s promoter and Nos terminator will be utilized.
Method
In order to transform plants we first obtained cultures of Pseudomonas putida kt2440. We then PCR amplified the genomic DNA in order to amplify the HCHL enzyme. The 35s promoter and NOS terminator were amplified from p cambia p1201 vector.  The 35s promoter was amplified with 2 sticky ends, at the beginning of the sequence with an EcorI restriction site and at the end with Xba1. The HCHL gene was amplified with a  Xba1 restriction"
