Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," biobrick for HylA E.coli secretion system (BBa_K1166002) from the iGEM 2017 distribution kit. Firstly, we removed the stop codon at the end of the sialidase gblock sequence using PCR and thereafter cloned sialidase without the stop codon upstream of the secretion system (BBa_K2235011). To confirm successful cloning, we double digested the plasmid (figure 7). Two bands were observed, one at ~7000 bp, corresponding to the size of T7 promoter-RBS-Sialidase-HylA E.coli secretion system, and one at ~2000 bp, corresponding to the size of the plasmid backbone.

The newly cloned plasmid was transformed into E.coli and expression in flask was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. The enzyme was extracted from the medium using IMAC purification. SDS-PAGE results (figure 8) shows no secretion of a protein resembling the correct size (≈ 55 kDa).

Hypothesis 4: Endo-β-galactosidase can be secreted using HylA secretion system in E. coli
Due to time restraints this part of the project was never reached and focus was instead put on the parts of the project which were showing more promising results.
Hypothesis 5: Successfully expressed sialidase shows enzymatic activity on mucin
With the goal of testing the enzymatic activity of sialidase on mucin, an assay was developed and optimized. The objective was to measure the concentration of sialic acid released after digestion, which was quantified using high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC).
Using industrially purchased sialidase to treat bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) gave a positive result. Sialic acid was proved to be digested from the mucin. Therefore, the next step was to repeat the experiment with sialidase that we expressed in E. coli. A range of different sialidase concentrations were used and their respective sialic acid digestion quantified (figure 9). We"

Collaboration
Our interlab study was done in collaboration with two other teams (ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-XSHS). Before beginning the experiment, we carefully studied and discussed the official protocol provided by iGEM measurement together. Worldshaper-XSHS lends us their 96-well plates and LB media when ours are not adequately prepared. Moreover, the experiments performed at the College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of their instructor (Dr. Fangliang Huang, who is also the instructor of 2018 iGEM Team ASTWS-China). We appreciate the use of their plate reader they offered us. On the other hand, we helped worldshaper-XSHS and ASTWS-China analyze the data when their first submission failed.

Then the culture was centrifuged, supernatant was taken out to further culture NahR biosensor. Induction ratio was then measured by Flow Cytometry.
The comparison of induction ratio (calculated as previously mentioned) of adaptor-equipped and unequipped NahR, showed that NahF highly improved the induction performance of biosensor NahR induced by salicylaldehyde and 5-chloro-salicylaldehyde. NahF expressed under constitutive promoter BBa_J23106 performed best for both the aldehydes(Fig. 11a). Therefore, BBa_J23106-NahF Adaptor was used for further experiment. Dose response curves for salicylaldehyde and 5-chloro-salicylaldehyde of NahR equipped with Adaptor NahF were obtained (Fig. 11b,c). Comparing them with the dose-response curves for salicylaldehyde and 5-chloro-salicylaldehyde of NahR following the same test protocol (Fig. 11b,c), we demonstrated that Adaptor NahF also functioned to lower the detection limits (the concentration of inducer at which an output three times the basal single is generated) of salicylaldehyde (from 300 μM to 1 μM) (Fig. 11b) and 5-chloro-salicylaldehyde (from 300 μM to 3 μM) (Fig. 11c). NahR's dose response curves for corresponding acids processed by NahF were obtained as well, showing that adding Adaptor NahF does not significantly influence the original characteristics of the NahR biosensor. (Fig. 11d).
In summary, Adaptors XylC and NahF functioned not only to optimize existing biosensors' response to several originally detectable compounds, but also expand detection profile in a new way besides modification on coding sequence such as mutagenesis or DNA shuffling. The advantages of the new concept that using adaptor to expand detection profile lie in that adding enzymes does not influence the original characteristics of the biosensors they adapt to, and this methodology does not require labor-intensive mutant screening work.

ERX463573 is the accession code of the experiment from which these raw read files came. The experiment this came from was about a Population of Bacillus thuringiensis which were coevolved with Caenorhabditis, which is a kind of nematode, as host.  From the study we know to expect at the very least the following two proteins: Cry35Aa4 and Cry21Aa2 .
According to the Cry protein toxin list it is known that Cry35Aa4 is a binary toxin with Cry34Aa4 , and as such we may expect to find this protein, or one like it, as well.
Visualizing the result
The easiest way to visualize the results from the three separate components of the tool is to use a Venn diagram .
Figure 1: A Venn diagram showing the overlap of the output of the various methods used to predict whether or not certain genes from the genome are Cry proteins or not.
As Blast had only 5 results it is easier to examine this method in detail. Two of the five were indeed proteins we expected from the paper: Cry35Aa4 and Cry21Aa2. Both of these were also picked up by the Hidden Markov Model method of cry protein detection as shown in figure 1, but not by the RandomForest method.
Next we found a protein that matched very well with the Cry34Aa group, which is a complimentary protein to Cry35Aa4.
The two other proteins which were found: Cry38Aa1, which has no known insecticidal target, but is highly similar to proteins that do: Cry15Aa1, Cry23Aa1, and Cry33Aa1. 5
and ""Gene_5518"" which was 85.87% identical to: Cry14Ab1. This protein is only mentioned in a patent by Sampson et al. 2012. 6 This protein is quite interesting because it might be a completely new protein or a variation of Cry14Ab1 specific to nematodes.
Tool overview
We use a combination of existing tools to come to the prediction of novel cry proteins. The entire pipeline consists of four scripts in total, one of which is entirely dedicated to analysis of the Random Forest model and not further used in the main program. The others are there to group the Machine Learning specific functions, the functions that handle known cry proteins, and the functions that handle raw sequence data. Figure 2 gives a graphical representation of the pipeline, though some modules have been left out for the sake of readability."
BIT,2017,Team:BIT#HW3_-_-_TEXT.html," hypoic. But we don’t know how much oxgyen they will release and whether oxygen carrier will influence E. coil. So, there still need more experiments and study.
  ③: Reserve oxygen in the chamber
When injecting E. coli bacteria, we can reserve some oxygen in chamber. But the chamber is tiny, we must have enough E. coli bacteria to achieve out detection, so there won’t have much room for oxygen. And the gas we reserve maybe will influence other parts of detection, so there still need more experiments and study.
     
1.2 E. coli freeze drying experiment.
1.2.1 Experiment purpose
 To achieve fast and convenient detection on chip, we designed a chamber on microfluidic chip to cultivate bacteria. However, it brought new problem-the storage and transportation of bacteria. Based on the question, we came up with an idea. Make the bacteria into dry powder with the method of vacuum freeze drying. An then, when we need to use the chip, just inject some medium, recover the bacteria and it can work for you.  From room temperature to low temperature, ice crystals may generate, and then puncture bacteria cells. So we need to find a reagent to protect bacteria. At the beginning, we choose glycerol. Soon, we found glycerol is too sticky too let the powder out. We decided to use skimmed milk whose quality fraction is 10% to have a try.
1.2.2 Method
 Freeze the suspension of bacteria and protective reagent at -80℃ for an hour. Open the vacuum freeze dryer and push the button of “Compressor” after 5 minutes. Freeze the cold trap of the dryer at -53℃ for an hour. And then, put the pre-frozen suspension into the cold trap. In a vacuum state, the water in suspension will sublime into water vapor leaving the system. Dry powder is left.  We also need an index to evaluate the effect of vacuum freeze drying on bacteria. So we designed such an experiment: we use E coli transformed into BBa_K2305004 as material. After the bacteria was made into dry powder, dissolve the powder with LB medium, resuscitate the bacteria in a shaker of 37℃ and then measure the growth curve. By comparing the curve trend before and after freeze drying, we can make the effect clear.
1.2.3 Experimental results
 According to the curves(Figure 1.6), we can include that:   (A).If the skimmed milk is steril"

UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#notebook#c0051debug.html_-_-_TEXT.html," studied and most used proteins in synthetic biology we wanted to start our search for potential promoters by asking whether or not we could detect any putative promoters in the coding region of cI by in silico methods.  We tried a number of on-line tools for automated promoter detection but did not come up with any meaningful results.  Next we contacted Drew Endy at Stanford to tap into his knowledgebase of phage biology.  He forwarded this request to Thomas Schneider at the NIH who used the Delia programs to search for sigma70 binding sites.  Surprisingly, a few potential ""good"" scoring candidates were found.  Armed with this data, we decided to see if we could experimentally confirm one of these sites as a potential transcript start site using the technique called 5'-RACE.  Initial results follow.

5' Race PCR
In order to locate the transcript start site of ""mystery C0051"" promoter, we conducted a 5'-RACE experiment on three cell lines.  (1) C0051-PSP (C0051 in a promoter screening plasmid - red cells), (2) E1010-PSP (RFP in promoter screening plasmid - white cells) and (3) DH5alpha cells.  Using RFP specific primers, we were unable to generate any cDNA from either constructs 2 or 3 - our negative controls.  We were able to retrieve transcript from the C0051-PSP strain indicating that RFP was indeed transcribed.  When we sequenced the resulting cDNA (see figure below) we noticed that the poly-A tail (added during sample prep for amplification) was located just upstream of the scar between the barcode and the ribosome binding site (Bba_B0034).  Therefore, our initial 5'-RACE experiment indicates that the transcript likely initiates within the bar code region rather than within the cI coding region.  A second sample/clone verified this result
Figure legend: Sequencing chromatogram of 5'-RACE experiment.
As shown, the transcription that we are seeing clearly starts at the beginning of the barcode region
Test #4
Modified C0051 in PSP exhibited white phenotype.  Click above for the full-screen image.
From all the test so far, it is clear that a certain interaction of the cI coding region and the barcode are acting together to produce some kind of promoter function.

(3) Reactions: We test this kind of worms by using 5W LED blue light (470nm) with 1000mA LED driver.This strain has an obvious reaction to the blue light. When we give light to this kind of worm, we can see it step back in about 2 seconds in average. It means this reaction is fast and instantaneously. It is remarkable that when the light is off, the worm turn to normal rapidly. But the speed and the movement of the worms will not be affected by blue light.
5.2.5 Turning angle measuring
As we know pmyo2 is express in pharyngeal of C.elegents, so the light will stimulate the head of the worms directly to the head. As a result, observing the movement of their heads is very significative. As we all know, the head of the worm is always shaking, so the turning angle (the angle of each shake) is a very useful data which reflect the response of the head. In this part, we use turning angle of their heads to evaluate the reaction of their head.
We choose pmyo2 worms as our experimental objects in this part. The results are showed below.

Creating a brainstorm is simplified, how to put theory into practice matters more. For understanding water deposal reality socially, we visited two organizations, which both have authority background in Xiamen area.
Xiamen Yundang Sewage Treatment Plant
Jul 1st
2017
First, we visited the Xiamen Yundang Sewage Treatment Plant, a company with the capacity of 300 thousand cubic meters of sewage treatment per day, to preliminarily understand today's treatment of domestic wastewater. We were shown around the whole process of sewage disposal and a variety of large-scale equipment. The technical manager told us heavy metal concentration in daily life sewage was actually very low, however, the industrial wastewater contained significantly much more ions of heavy metals, thus they normally do not need to concern about heavy metal treatment methods.
All in all, we drew the conclusion that our target groups are those industry plants, environmental offices and citizens in water polluted areas.
Zenland Mineral Water Company
Jul 5th

Next, in order to further investigate the standard and commonly used methods of drinking water detection, we visited the Zenland Mineral Water Company which is located in the Wulao Mountain in Xiamen University. In the water quality monitoring laboratory, professional staff told us that the water quality inspection in China was mainly in accordance with the national standard law. Interestingly, no biological assay was applied in large scale, to this extent we believed that our inspirations would be a major innovation in water disposal industry.
-----* Laws and Relations *-----
Laws regulate the human world steadily and sustainably, without which we may fall into disorder. Thus, we have investigated heavy mental pollution in particular areas of China, and regulations referring to genetically modified organisms to see what we have already done and what we should do.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," can complex with Int independently of DNA as a “PhiC31-style” system. We sought to investigate the differences in the dynamics of these systems.
We first modeled switch systems where Int and RDF are driven by separate promoters (Figure 2). We should note that Bonnet et al did simulations describing the same switch systems in their original design of the RAD module [3].
Figure 2. We modeled the dynamics of Bxb1- and PhiC31-style promoter switch systems with Int and RDF driven by separate promoters.
Questioning the Model to Inform Model-based Design
We wanted to know the ranges of integrase and RDF expression that would flip switches of each style to identify potential differences in the ways they should be applied.
Model Construction
State variables (all time-dependent):
I = Integrase
R = RDF
mx = mRNA corresponding to protein X.
SPB = Switch in “PB” state, where we have attP and attB sites flanking the promoter
SRL = Switch in “RL” state, where we have attR and attL sites flanking the promoter
I2 = integrase dimer
I2SPB = integrase dimer bound to one att site in a PB state switch
I2RXSPB = integrase dimer bound to one att site in a PB state switch, with X RDF proteins also bound (X = 1 or 2)
I4SPB = one integrase dimer bound to each att site in the PB state switch
I4RXSPB = one integrase dimer bound to each att site in the PB state switch, with X RDF proteins also bound (X = 1 – 4)
In the PhiC31 style switch but NOT the Bxb1 style switch, the following complexes are also included:
I2Rx = X RDF proteins bound to an integrase dimer, X = 1 or 2
Parameters:
αI = transcription rate of Int
αR = transcription rate of RDF
δx = degradation rate of mRNA corresponding to protein X
βx = translation rate of protein X from mx
ρx = degradation rate of protein X
k1 = forward rate constant for association of a protein to a complex
k-1 = reverse rate constant for dissociation of a protein to a complex
krec = rate of switch flipping through recombination when bound to appropriate complex
Note that rate constants k1 and k-1 are assumed to be the same for formation of all complexes, since rate constants for the complexes are not known. krec is assumed to apply to flipping of the"

07 SEP 2015
1. gBlock 2 original fragment was tested by running agarose gel but still no bands were observed.
2. HiFi assembly was performed to assemble all 5 gBlocks (PCR products of each gBlock, except gBlock 2 which we used its stock) with the backbone pSB1C3, along with a positive control. Both products were transformed into DH10B competent cells on CM30 plates with 10 uL of 20% arabinose stock and 10 uL of 0.1% tryptophan stock added.
08 SEP 2015
1. Transformation results of HiFi products with the positive control were confirmed that only the positive control showed >30 colonies while HiFi product transformation failed even with arabinose and tryptophan added.
2. HiFi products were tested by running agarose gel and several bands instead of one single band were observed.
3. Using the same HiFi products, transformation into DH10B competent cells was performed again under the same setting but this time 0.02% arabinose and 0.001% tryptophan were added during the recovery step.
4. The PCR product of gBlock 4 was amplified by PCR and the products were stored overnight at 4 degree Celsius.
09 SEP 2015
1. Second transformation results of HiFi products were confirmed that 14 small pink colonies were found.
2. The PCR gBlock 4 overnight products were collected and tested by running agarose gel but no bands were observed.
3. PCR was performed for gBlock 2 but this time we used Taq polymerase with dNTPs. Ta 53.9 degree Celsius was used for the 30-second annealing step. Yet, no bands were observed after running the product on an agarose gel.
4. HiFi assembly was performed again but this time we used the stock of both gBlock 2 and gBlock 4 with the PCR products of gBlock 1, gBlock 3 and gBlock 5 and pSB1C3. The HiFi product was transformed into Dh10B competent cells with 0.02% arabinose and 0.001% tryptophan added on a CM30 plate.

The basic conjecture underlying HDMR is that the component functions arising in typical real problems are likely to exhibit only low order l cooperativity among the input variables such that the significant terms in the HDMR expansion are expected to satisfy the relation: l<<n< for n>>1. An HDMR expansion to second order
<math>\begin{align} f(x)=f_{0}+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j}), \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
often provides a satisfactory description of <math>f(x)</math> for many high dimensional systems when the input variables are properly chosen. This is also the formula we use to achieve HDMR expansion. Similarly, reactants of two at most are usually involed in biochemical reactions. Thus, we can simplify the differential equations to the following form:
<math>\begin{align} \frac{dx_{k}}{dt} &=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i},{\mathbf{p}} _{i})+\sum\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j},{\mathbf{p}} _{ij})-kx_{i}+C_{k}\\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
<math>\begin{align}s.t.\text{ algebra equations}  \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
for <math>k=1,\ldots ,n.</math> The left side term of the equation above represents the changing rate of variable <math>x_{k}.</math>We assume that each term on the right side represents one step biochemical reaction which is equivalent to the rate term defined in SBML. It means that changing rate of one variavle is determined by different rate terms. <math>C_{k}</math> is a constant number. <math>f_{i}(\cdot )</math> and <math>f_{ij}(\cdot )</math> have similar definitions and represent reaction rates that vary according to kinetic laws. <math>{\mathbf{p}}_{i}</math> and <math>{ \mathbf{p}}_{ij}</math> contain the parameter values of the kinetic"

Codon bias table generation for A. baylyi:
Background:
During the ideation process for the project for 2018, we decided to study the degradation of lignin to produce vanillin which has higher economic value. For this, we conducted a literature survey regarding the degradation of the aromatic rings of lignin.
We found several organisms capable of degrading such aromatic compounds. Some organisms such as E. coli and L. lactis. are popular synthetic hosts and require transformation. After a brief literature survey, we found several ‘naturally competent’ microorganisms. However, most of them were reported to be pathogenic and are known to harmful for human use. Being a laboratory that conforms to a biosafety level of 1, we could not work with those organisms.
After several discussions and literature surveys, we decided that the best organism that conforms to our biosafety level and is a naturally competent host is Acinetobacter baylyi. The ADP1 strain of this organism is naturally competent, non-pathogenic, and has the property of degrading aromatic compounds. This strain can be purchased from DSMZ. While perusing literature for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 we couldn't find substantial material, as information was sparse and not many tools were available to undertake synthetic biology experiments with this organism. This motivated us to build a toolbox for Acinetobacter baylyi that was generic and hence could effectively be used by research groups working with other organisms as well.
Problem:
A primary requirement for experimentation in synthetic biology is a fluorescent reporter protein. Hence we planned to codon-optimize two reporter proteins, GFP and mCherry, for A. baylyi. When we approached companies for codon-optimized reporter proteins they got back to us saying that they did not have a codon bias table available for A. baylyi for our strain.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Procject#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," utlises homologous recombination to facilitate genetic modifications at any desired target by flanking the mutated sequence with homologous regions. One system for recombineering in E. coli is the λ phage derived λ Red, consisting of the genes encoding three proteins, Gam, Exo and Beta. Gam prevents degradation of linear dsDNA by inhibition of nucleases, Exo degrades dsDNA in a 5'-3' direction yielding ssDNA, and Beta facilitates recombination by binding to the ssDNA [14].
Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE)
Wang et al. developed a method for rapid and efficient targeted evolution of cells through cyclical recombineering with ssDNA (oligo) in E. coli. Using this automated method, they more than five-fold improved lycoprene production in E. coli in three days  [15]. Through MAGE it is possible to simultaneously target many different loci or target the same locus with a pool of multiple and/or degenerate oligos. By using multiple oligos targetting the same locus, it is possible to generate a library of mutants varying only at the target locus in a short amount of time. The genetic variation in the population of cells will be a function of the degenerate pool complexity and combinatorial arrangements of the modifications at different loci and can be used to modify e.g. the active site of an enzyme [15,16].
The MAGE protocol utilises the λ Red recombination system in combination with an (temporary) inactivation of the mismatch repair system and consists of seven steps that can be done with standard laboratory equipment [16]. As MAGE utilises oligos, only the Beta protein of the λ Red system is required. When E. coli is targetted with single-stranded oligos, Beta stabilises them inside the cell and facilitates homologous recombination into the genome (Figure #MISSING). Interestingly, this targetting is many-fold more effective, if the oligo is targetting the lagging strand compared to the leading strand [14,15,17,18]. Based on this observation in multiple organisms, it is propsed that Beta binds to the lagging strand of the replication fork and stabilises oligo integration between discontinious Okazaki fragments [14,18].
Figure #MISSING Proposed mechanism for function of Beta in oligo recombineering during DNA replication. Beta stabilises oligo that is incorporated between discontinious Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand [17]. Adapted after"

iTesla Collaboration
Collaborating with another iGEM team
This year, we were happy to work alongside iTesla to create an iGEM Guide for Community Laboratories interested in hosting an iGEM team. As high schoolers participating in iGEM through community laboratories in our city, we have witnessed unique situations and overcame challenges that other teams may not have come across. We created this guide with the purpose of encouraging community labs from around the world to compete in the iGEM competition.  In July, we found out about another iGEM team that was similar to us. iTesla, based in Seattle, Washington, was also a high school iGEM team that worked inside a community laboratory. After contacting them through email, we arranged to meet on Skype. During this meeting, we discussed the idea of an iGEM Guide, and the various aspects of iGEM that a new team would need to know.
Reaching out to the Community
Before creating our guide, we reached out to fellow community laboratories from across the world to ask a few questions related to iGEM. After explaining the concept of the iGEM competition, we posed our questions. They read as follows:
1) Have you ever considered having an iGEM team? If so, what were the perceived barriers? (ie. fundraising, finding students or mentors, etc.)
2) Would a report detailing our experiences in creating and maintaining an iGEM team be useful to you? This would involve sections such as recruiting, training and fundraising.
Out of the 29 community laboratories that we contacted, we were fortunate enough to have 11 labs contact us back, despite the language barriers there may have been. These 11 laboratories range from locations as far as China and Belgium to as close as Canada and the U.S. states. Some of these community labs have expressed that “they would love to read [our] report to know more about iGEM” while as others expressed their concerns with iGEM and"

Further Support
Our team would not be where we are today without the support of The Institute for Genomic Biology and its director Doctor Harris Lewin. The IGB has continually supported our undergraduate research though funding and lab space.
We have received generous product donations particularly from Promega, and also from Thermo Fisher, Corning, Midsci, and Life Technologies. Please see our home page for logos and links!
We are also extremely grateful for other on campus support that we have received from the Design Council or College of Engineering and The Student Organization Resource Fee (SORF).
Collaboration
The University of Illinois Bioware Team has collaborated with a number of different iGEM teams this year.
UIUC Software
We have worked closely with our sister team in many aspects, including recruitment, system testing and diagnostics, fundraising, etc.  Neither team would be where they are now without the significant amount of collaboration that happened this year.
Project Advice:
Email threads and video conferences were held with Peking University and Purdue University to discuss problems and to trade suggestions and advice.
Surveys:
The team participated in surveys hosted by the University of Warsaw team, the Middle East Technical University Software team, and the University of Edinburgh team to assist in their own bioethical projects.

Data Base
Often, gene related information is available on the Internet, but people don’t always know where to look or how to search efficiently, and almost every time it is so difficult to interpret because it is not clear the function of these genes. Editing them usually leads to non desired modification. Plant proteins usually are involved in many metabolic processes simultaneously, so modifications in a particular protein could lead in a non viable plant. In other cases, those modifications lead to a fruitless variety, which many times has not an agricultural benefit. So that, many times is so difficult to know which gene a plant breeder must edit despite he knows what phenotypic trait he wants to obtain.
In HYPE-IT, we have worked hard looking for genes which knockout leads to an interesting phenotypic trait. Web pages of scientific articles are full of papers where gene functions are identified, but not always are identified by knocking them out. We have only selected those articles where they have done the gene silencing, either by RNAi mediated silencing or by CRISPR/Cas9 editing, and they obtained a viable fruited plants. This allow us to avoid transgenesis because we don’t need to insert exogenous genes to obtain an enhanced plant variety.
Our database gather more than 20 different genes, which knockout leads to many different improved characteristics. All these genes are well referenced, so has been demonstrated plant viability in all the cases. However, there are many proteins that are homologous between them, so we can admit that they have the same function in other plant species. After doing Blastp exams, we finally obtained more than 200 targeting genes. This is a huge Database with a high interest for plant breeders and seedbeds.
Some gene examples of our Database are:
Ga20 oxidase, that leads to a smaller phenotype in maize or rice. All the energy that the modified plants would have used growing up, they would harness it increasing their grain properties and production.
TFL (terminal flower), is a key regulator of delaying flowering and regulating plant growth. Its knockdown leads to more flowering varieties.
ACS4 is a protein involved in the route of ethylene synthesis. It catalyzes the synthesis of 1­-aminocyclopropane­-1-­carboxylic acid (ACC) from S­-Adenosyl methionine. Its knockdown leads to andromonoecy varieties.
HYPE-IT Database also include important gene related information, such as the name of the gene and the protein targeted, the paper we have"

This week we did PCR of the backbone pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF-3 again. It failed again. Are our primers wrong?
However, we persisted tirelessly with another PCR of pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF-3, this time with a Tm=59º C. It worked for ADF-3+!!
We purified the DNA sequence of ADF-3+. Afterwards we did PCR again, but this time to amplify the backbone of ADF-3 that has the promotor pBAD, and to amplify the vector backbone for ADF-3+.
The PCR of the backbone of ADF-3 that has the promotor pBAD looks successful! Later we proceeded with the corresponding DNA purification.
Joyfully we proceeded with the Gibson Assembly to join ADF-3 to its backbone with pBAD. We transformed the E. coli, but no colony survived.
August 6 – 12, 2012
We did another PCR, but this time amplified ADF-3 with a Tm=56º C ;  The vector backbones of ADF-3+ and ADF-3 with Tm=60º C and touch-down PCR of the vector backbones of ADF-3+ and ADF-3 with T annealing = 54º C. Tragically, none of them worked.
The next day we did PCR again with Tm=59ºC of ADF-3 and the vector backbones of ADF-3+ and ADF-3.
The PCR of ADF-3 was successful! Later we did the purification of the DNA.
Afterwards, we completed the Gibson Assambly of ADF3 with the backbone PSB1C3 and the transformations of the E. coli.  The next day finally we had some transformed E. coli! Immediately we proceeded with colony PCR to verify if the transformed bacteria correspond to our designs. Unluckily, the colony PCR was negative (the DNA strand that we obtained had a smaller molecular weight than what we expected).
So that we repeated the PCR for the vector backbones of ADF-3 and ADF-3+. The bands were from the right length! Afterwards we proceeded with the Gibson Assembly of ADF-3 with its backbone, and of ADF-3+ with its backbone. Both Gibson Assemblies were positive! Finally we continued with a colony PCR.

En fait il permet de savoir si un bactériophage est modifié ou non et si l’insert est exprimé ou non. Lorsque le virus est modifié, la cassette de kanamycine induit une résistance à la kanamycine, donc la bactérie devient résistante et lorsque le virus n’est pas modifié, les bactéries sont tuées par la kanamycine.
Cette BioBrick peut être utilisée comme un  reporter ou comme une simple cassette de résistance.
Le double terminateur permet l’arrêt de la translation d’ARN avant la cassette de résistance, donc c’est déjà créé pour insérer un gène codant avec son RBS avant la cassette de résistance.
C0012 + B0014
Cette BioBrick contient un répresseur LacI et un terminateur (BBa_C0012 + BBa_B0014). Le répresseur LacI réprime le promoteur pLac de l’opéron lactose d’E.coli. Donc le répresseur de LacI est très fiable pour contrôler l’expression d’un gène en utilisant un promoteur pLac. En fait quand LacI n’est pas exprimé, pLac est activé, et quand il y a expression de LacI, pLac est inhibé. Un système pour induire la transcription de LacI peut facilement être créé et cré un mécanisme de rétrocontrôle pour l’inhibition de pLac.
Histoire:
Dans E.coli, pLac fait partie de l’opéron lactose. LacI est constamment exprimé et réprime pLac. En présence de Lactose, LacI est inhibé et pLac est actif et permet la transcription de beta-galactosidase. Le lactose peut être substitué par IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).

Week 1 May 12- May 19
After studying lots of papers and brainstorming for about one month, we confirmed our project for this year, which is about a regulation method at post-transcription level. We came up with the idea that controlling the quantitative expression of proteins by inserting different stem-loops into circuits.
Our wet lab, dry lab and also design group started to work!
Week 2 May 20- May 27
We established our team consisting 12 students from different grades and different majors and then registered our team, OUC-China.
For our wet lab, we came up with problems when we organized the logical thoughts of our project therefore we went to Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences to consult professors.
Week 3 May 28- June 4
We confirmed our pre-experiment design. Firstly, we needed to make sure that our parts like GFP and mCherry could work well. Then we did experiment to verify that the stem loop wouldn’t cause terminate, resulting in the downstream protein could express approximately constantly in circuit with and without stem loops. Moreover, we did pre-experiment to ensure that our dual fluorescence reporter system can work well.
Also, we started to learn how to operate some software, like Primer Premier, Snap Gene, Oligo, etc. to design our own circuits.
Figure1 The expression of our part GFP and mCherry
Figure2 The figure shows the fluorescent of downstream mCherry in the circuit with or without stem-loop, and there’s no significant difference between them(P=0.01). Error bars indicate s.d. of mean of all sequences.
Week 6 Jun 5- June 12
After consulting professors and studying papers, we decided to use E.coli as our chassis.
We compared northern and RT PCR to decide with method would be more suitable for our project. We found that RT PCR was easier to operate, had more accurate data and finally we confirmed to use RT PCR to detect mRNA.
We also went to Peking University to communicate with the Peking iGEM team. We visited their own lab and both presented our project and"

Imaging:
Fluorescent samples were then visualised with OpenScope using two set-ups:
Standard set-up, using single LED illumination (470 nm, 100mW) and GFP epi-cube
Non-standard set-up, using high brightness LED (470nm, 3W) and GFP epi-cube
Results:
Earlier testing using the standard set-up (single LED illumination, GFP epi-cube) indicated that visualising fluorescent beads was possible with OpenScope (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1: GFP-coated fluorescent beads visualised using OpenScope under standard set-up. Images were captured on 14.09.15 using the Webshell, and are unedited.
Testing using the commercial fluorescence microscope confirmed that the samples had phenotypes as reported by William and Mary. Both constructs resulted in GFP expression in E. coli. J23106+I13504 demonstrated increased fluorescence intensity relative to J23117+I13504.
A control slide (sample taken from the agar of the control plate, untransformed cells plated on Amp) was first tested to establish a fluorescence-free baseline (Fig. 2a). The duplicate J23106+I13504 samples were then tested using the standard set-up and non-standard set-up. Fluorescence was detected (Fig. 2b and 2c).

Soukup1999
Fusions like that are called aptazymes. For this a catalytic domain has to interact via a communication module with an aptamer (Fig. 6). In presence of the ligand the aptamer undergoes conformational changes which results in an activation or inactivation of the catalytic activity. In our project we use different aptamers and combine them with catalytic nucleic acids to use them in various applications. In order to develop the necessary tools we need a fast and efficient way to generate new aptamers and aptazymes. To meet these needs we have developed two parts of software: One that generates aptamers from scratch (MAWS) and another one that joins them with an existing catalytic nucleic acid (JAWS) in an optimized way. This method not only is faster but also cheaper than existing methods.

The Spinach Aptamer turns on fluorescence of its ligand upon bind it.
Besides the above describes functional nucleic acids SELEX revealed aptamers which not only bind to a ligand but also are able to turn on fluorescence of different non-fluorescent dyes. An interesting example for an aptamer with such a special function is the Malachite Green Aptamer.
Grate1999
In presence of malachite green the aptamer turns on the fluorescence of the dye.
Babendure2003
In 2011 Jaffrey selected the famous Spinach RNA aptamer (Fig. 7). It binds a small molecule that resembles the fluorophore of the green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Paige2011
Upon binding of the small molecule to the Spinach a green fluorescence comparable to that of the GFP is emitted. In our project we use variants of these fluorescent aptamers and engineer them to be dependent on small molecules of our interest.
Though we so far mainly discussed functional RNA there are also both DNA aptamers and catalytic DNA which were selected using SELEX as well. As for today the concept of functional nucleic acids in nature has only been found for RNA. Nevertheless"

Truncation Project
In vivo application of Cas9 and its variants faces issues with delivery. One of the best methods of Cas9 delivery is through recombinant adeno associated virus (rAAV). However, rAAV has a packing limit of approximately 4.7 kB. The Cas9 gene alone is more than 4.1 kB. This leaves very little room for optimal promoter and polyA signal, as well as for sgRNA expression. Recent applications of Cas9 variants fused to effector proteins would also not fit into rAAV vector. Thus, there is strong interest in searching for smaller Cas9 proteins that can perform on par with the well-characterized SpCas9.
A continuation of last year’s dCas9 truncation project, this year, we seek to further truncate the Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 protein to achieve an even smaller protein still capable of sgRNA and target DNA binding. We also mutated key residues to improve dCas9 affinity for DNA, demonstrating partial recovery of our truncated dCas9 (tCas9) towards wild-type activity.
To assess tCas9 ability to bind to sgRNA and target DNA, dCas9 is fused to VPR, a tripartite transcriptional activator. Gene activation activity is then assessed against WT-dCas9-VPR. 2 methods of gene activation are performed. In our proof of concept, exogenous reporter gene activation is performed to rapidly give information of activity of tCas9s. For demonstration, endogenous gene activation is performed, giving a closer approximation of real-world application.
Truncation methodology
Prior attempts at truncating tCas9 (Freiburg 2013) were unsuccessful largely due lack of structural information. The publication of the crystal structure of Cas9 (Nishimasu) allowed for identification of domain and subdomains. Based on crystal structure and homology information, Cas9 contains 2 nuclease domains. In dCas9, these domains were mutated to be non-functional.
In this project, we rationally removed domains and subdomains that do not directly contribute to sgRNA binding or target DNA binding. Tr"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," am looking forward to participating in the wet lab component of iGEM this summer. This will be my first time trying out independent research in the lab. I'm excited to be a part of such diverse group of students and can't wait to see what we can come up with! In my spare time I am involved in swimming, gymnastics and enjoy many kinds of music.
Asim Chawdhry
I am an undergraduate student pursuing a double major at the University of Calgary. I am currently in my fourth year of a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Biological Science, and my third year of a Bachelor of Commerce degree with a specialization in Marketing. This has been my first experience working with iGEM, and I have primarily been involved in the wet lab with the hydrocarbon decarboxylation team. I believe that iGEM provides a great opportunity for students from several different disciplines to get together and combine their knowledge and interests, and work towards a common goal. Whenever given the opportunity, I love going out to the mountains to ski! I am also an avid car enthusiast.
Chenzhe Qian
I’m in my last year of Computer Science and Biological Science in University of Calgary. This program combination is always confusing people. Not many knows what can happen if computer meets biology, a magic. Here is the answer, iGEM! This is my first year in iGEM and I love it. This is the place where I can do exactly what I want to do. I am interested in bioinformatics, genetics, microbiology as well as programming. In past two years, I’ve involved two modeling projects. One is aim to model human kidney in 3D for education purpose, and the other one is using individual-based model to simulate ecology system. In my spare time, I like to do some reading, writing, drawing random things or maybe thinking for nothing.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
Fig. 14. Comparison of CFUs formed by KillerRed exposed to light and kept in the dark for each sample taken from the ministat. The efficiency of the kill switch decreases over time as shown by the increasing number of CFUs.
Fig. 15. Comparison of CFUs formed by KillerOrange exposed to light and kept in the dark. The efficiency of the kill switch decreases over time as shown by the increasing number of CFUs. The effect is not as obvious in KillerOrange compared to KillerRed as the starting efficiency of KillerOrange is lower.
Discussion
The continuous culture of KillerRed showed a 15 fold increase in the percentage of viable cells after 168 hrs. A similar pattern is shown for KillerOrange but with around a two fold increase. Both KillerRed and KillerOrange show greater numbers of colonies forming over time (Fig. 14 & 15). This number approaches the amount produced in the dark condition by 168 hrs. The average fluorescence reading for 0 hr KillerRed samples was 506.3 A.U (recorded at an average OD of of 0.745). After 168  hrs the average fluorescence reading  was 436 A.U (at an average OD of 0.96). It seems unlikely due to the readings being  similar that a mutation has occurred in the kill switch itself. As fluorescence is proportional to the amount of ROS  being produced, up regulation of native E. coli enzymes that mitigate the effects of ROS may be the cause of the increase  in cell survival. Future transcriptome analysis could provide interesting data on the mechanism of this change, this was  unfortunately beyond the scope of this project. This shows that there may be many ways for bacteria to circumvent the effects of a kill switch given the high selection pressure they pose."
SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Policy&Practices#Survey_-_-_TEXT.html," National Day Golden Week holiday, we conduct the survey around Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center through two main ways: Distributing on the street and Filling out online.
Through the efforts, we acquire 153 effective questionnaires.
These are some essential information of the interviewee.
From the pie chart, the percentage of male and female is so closed that we might get information more accurately.
Comparing with the three pie charts above, it is obviously that the majority of our responders are students who held a bachelor degree. This is followed by the high school degree. Only a minority held a master degree or a PhD (both 5% nearly).
It seems that the majority of responders have a higher education background, which makes it more easily to finish our questionnaire as they might have a learnt about ABR from the courses.
The most responders are the young and the middle-aged. They are more frequently use antibiotic and will pay attention to the drug's mechanism of action.
Before questions, we give a common basic knowledge on Antibacterial Resistance (ABR) & Synthetic Biology.
Later, interviewees are asked to choose the behavior when they contact the antibiotics.
Questions are divided into three classes, including how well you know about ABR, the way you use antibiotics and how many do you know to decrease ABR.
These are the data analysis from the questionnaires.
Question 1, Do you know something about antibacterial resistance?
A. Yes, I know. (85.99%)
B. No, I have not heard anything about it. (14.01%)
Question 2, Do you know the relationship between antibiotic misuse and antibacterial resistance?
A. Yes. I know how the antibiotic misuse makes ABR. (64.97%)
B. Yes. However I do not know the mechanism. (23.57%)
C. No. I do not know anything about it while I am interest to learn more. (8.28%)
D. No. I do not know anything about it and I think it is not necessary to do that. (3.18%)
From the two questions mentioned above, the public have a general knowledge of ABR, and more than 95% know or want to know the relationship between antibiotic misuse and ABR.
From the data in the past years of China, the phenomenon of antibiotic misuse is so serious. One of the primary causes is that people do not realize what will occur if they use antibiotic wrongly. As the time went by, the public awareness is improved. This makes people reduce the use of antibiotic consciously when it is unnecessary.

Method
In our experiments of A, we used the background information that the concentration of amino acid glucose and other nutrition inside the tumors is much higher than that in normal tissues. We knocked out the gene which encoding arginine of VNP, expecting that after the targeting, the VNP will mostly colonize the tumor areas, where the nutrition is the most abundant. In the future, we will introduce this kind of VNP into the mice with melanoma to see whether our modified VNP can really work on the life prolonging of the mice with cancer.
In our experiments of B, we got some anaerobic promoters, which will improve the bacteria's ability of targeting inside the oxygen-poor cells and tissues including the tumor where the quantity of oxygen is much lower than that in common tissues. In other words, the result provides us with a new future direction of cancer therapy ------we can introduce the efficient anaerobic promoters into VNP, which will target inside the tumors and decrease the side-effect of the VNP to the lowest. In order to prove our assumption, we will have our experiments of introducing the VNP with the promoter we designed into the mice with melanoma to see whether the lifetime of the mice can be prolonged with the help of our designed promoters. We hope it can really work!

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#InVitroAssay_-_-_TEXT.html," points in time were measured: nothing could be concluded from this. Restriction digestion of pSB1A3 with an insert was performed in order to use this for the pSB1A_Cry3Aa_TEV_HIS construct. An attempt to create this construct was made by ligation and transformation into E.coli DH5alpha. this yielded many colonies. A colony PCR was done with 90 colonies, however none appeared to have the right insert. All plasmids ligated back with the original insert or without any insert at all.  More mealworms were dissected. From this BBMVs were made and incorporated with fluorophores. More CF leakage experiments were performed with TritonX-100. This compound did not give a large and always inconsequent change in fluorescence when added to BBMVs. Furthermore, it changed the fluorescence of carboxyfluorescein itself.  Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin plates were poured.
Week 6. (08/08-14/08)
E. coli with the plasmid pSB1A3_RFP, kindly provided by Carina, were grown. The plasmid was miniprepped and restriction digested. This failed, because the yield of DNA was too low with the miniprep. Leakage of fluorophore from vesicles was tried with different detergents. Tween-80 and dish soap influenced the fluorescence of CF itself negatively. Buttermilk handsoap had a very small effect on the fluorescence of carboxyfluorescein itself and could induce a fluorophore release.
Week 7. (15/08-21/08)
No lab work was done this week
Week 8. (22/08-28/08)
B. thuringiensis was grown on sporulation salts and incubated with normal BBMVs from T. molitor. Addition of this sample to BBMVs incorporated with fluorophores had no effect. pSB1A3_RFP was miniprepped again, then digested and treated with alkaline phosphatase. All fragments to create pSB1A3_Cry3Aa_TEV-HIS were ligated and transformed. No colonies were present. The cells were probably not competent, since the positive control did not give a single colony. SDS-PAGE with BBMVs from T.molitor was performed and showed the presence of different proteins. Fluorophore leaking of triton X-100 again showed to not work.

Software
This article will explain in detail how the software part of     CryptoGErM works. To encrypt the message and translate it to DNA we     wrote several Javascripts. They are used in the demonstration of our    software on the Encoding and Decoding pages.    The following sections cover the same steps the software takes to    turn a text into DNA. First encryption, then translation to DNA    and finally packing it into a complete message sequence. The    examples will use Hello world as the message text, and secret for the encryption key.
The software is divided into several modules, each in their own     file. Two of the modules were not written by us, but used under an     open source license. The encryption code, provided by the AES     module was written by Chris Veness at Movable-Type.co.uk .     The CRC implementation for computing checksums was written by     Github user chitchcock and     published as Github Gist     #5112270 . All other code was written by us and is licensed     under the MIT     license .
An offline version of the software can be downloaded: CryptoGErM.zip .
Encryption & Decryption
We use the AES module for encryption and decryption, specifically:    AES counter mode. This mode allows us to encrypt (and decrypt) messages    of any length. It does this by splitting the message up into blocks    and adding a counter to every block. The first block contains an    initialization vector, which is randomized every time and also the    number of blocks that follow it. As a result of this every block    has a different cipher text, even if there are repetitions in the    original message. In fact, the cipher text for the entire message    is different, even if the same message is encrypted again.
Encrypting our example message Hello world with the    key secret is now as easy as calling Aes.Ctr.encrypt(message, key) with (possibly) this result: ÑTyûWáû~zHP�Kúã. The    next step is to turn this cipher text into DNA.
The AES module is in aes.js and the counter mode addition is in aes-ctr.js .

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," Xbox DVD pickup as the laser source, as it provides 405 nm, 650 nm, and 780 nm laser point source, with possible laser alignment and intensity control by using a customized PCB board . However as we experimented with the pickup, we found out that the hologram was greatly destructed by the grating (more specs?) within the pickup. Thus we opted out on the pickup and PCB idea. Instead, our setup now consists solely of a simple (LED source + pinhole) / (Laser source + lenses + optics fiber), a micromanipulator and stage for alignment, and a Picam with RapsberryPi 3 for the recorded holograms.
 
Fig: Electronics Setup
 
As shown in the picture above, RaspberryPi 3 is connected to power, Pi cam, and the LAN cable for internet connection. A webcam server is then setup with local host configuration such that a live stream from the Picam can be accessed via a browser on another PC. The webcam server is also customized with a GUI to record images or videos, adjust camera settings such as ISO, resolution, and save the recorded data on the server for downloading later.
Working Principle
The working principle of digital holographic microscopy relies on the interference pattern, i.e., the hologram, which encodes 3D information in a 2D picture, and the 3D reconstruction algorithm, to extract the 3D information from the recorded holograms. The interference pattern comes from the joint wavefronts of the object beam and the reference beam. As indicated in the picture below, a coherent collimated light source is splitted into two beams, the object beam passing through the lens and the object to be observed, and the reference beam pertaining the phase and coherence of the light source. The joint wavefronts form the hologram, and is recorded by an image sensor. The 3D reconstruction algorithm then functions as a digital lens, cutting the joint wavefronts in minuscule distances near the object, rendering a stack of cross-sectional wavefronts. Based on the stack of wavefronts, or interference patterns, the image of the object can be reconstructed in different depths, thus achieving a axial resolution for 3D imaging.
Simple DHM setup: From left to the right: A laser beam is splitted in object and reference beam with a beam splitter. A series of optics focus the beam on the sample and magnifies the interference pattern. A second beam splitter superposes reference and object beam on the camera screen (picture taken from [17]) .

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," help determine one’s ethical priorities. Collecting data from different stakeholders allows the mapping of interests and priorities of different groups in society. This will allow for sensible regulation and understanding once blue bio energy gets to the stage of application.
Situation in 2030
In 2030 the world population is still growing, and as the consumption pattern of citizens does rather increase than decrease, resources are depleted faster than ever. Energy demand is increasing and solar and wind power are not sufficient in providing an alternative for fossil resources. Governments, however, agreed upon reducing greenhouse gas emissions and use of fossil fuels significantly by 2050. Therefore, new ways of generating electricity in a sustainable way are needed. In order to realise this, a lot of research is carried out, which has resulted in the idea of generating electricity by using the concentration difference between salt and fresh water. This principle, called blue energy, requires the use of ion selective membranes. These membranes allow for selective diffusion of one type of ions from salt to fresh water, resulting in a charge difference between the two compartments. This charge separation over the membrane is compensated for by a flow of electrons. Blue energy originates from research by the Wetsus Institute, and was afterwards applied by REDstack, which uses synthetic ion selective membranes. After it was found out that a selective biofilm of modified Bacillus subtilis could be used, public debate was triggered on whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified bacteria at all, and if an exception for this demanding situation must be made. Three possible future scenarios showing the developments from 2030 until 2050 are described. In the first scenario, the use of genetically modified organisms remains unaccepted. In the second scenario, the genetically modified Bacillus subtilis is allowed for use in the Blue energy setups under secured conditions. In the third and last scenario, the developments occurring when genetically modified organisms are freely accepted are shown.
Scenario 1 - No GMOs
Science and technology + Sustainable development
Synthetic biology and specifically genetic modification of bacteria are not new, but have always taken place safely within the boundaries of the lab. As new ways of generating electricity need to be found, scientists are pleading for more allowance of GMOs. New discoveries in the lab indicate that a lot of potentially interesting products can be created using genetic modification. These discoveries can help solve problems that were never solvable before. However, the general public as well as governments do not agree with the use of synthetic biology in society. The private sector is interested in finding new ways to fill the rising energy demand, but is also very cautious about the opinion of the public. Many"

Decanted by hand into falcon tubes to give four 5ml cultures.
A Restriction Digest was carried out on the Tlia and KerUS minipreps, as well as the FadR vector that was miniprepped last week.
TliA and KerUS were cut with xbaI and pstI, whilst FadR was cut with speI and pstI.
Thursday 10th July
Run Vector, TliA and KerUS DNA on a gel to ensure it has been cut correctly. Once confirmed the DNA was then extracted from the gel.
Add 12.5μl 5X loading buffer to the DNA samples (50μl each) - total of 62.5μl in each eppendorf tube.
Load each sample, using two wells each if necessary.
Run at 100V for 60 minutes.
Visualise the gel.
The bands for TliA and Vector DNA were the correct size.
The band for KerUS showed that the DNA had been cut incorrectly. The two samples of DNA that have been cut correctly are now extracted from the gel.
The gel extraction was then nanodropped to determine DNA concentration.
Vector: 14.3ng/μL
Tlia: 190.9ng/μL
A ligation reaction was carried out using the following amounts of reactants;

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"mpR-regulated promoter was found to exhibit leaky expression comparable to the expression levels mediated by the constitutive promoters. When cloned into a low copy vector, the leaky expression was reduced prominently. Thus, to obtain proper regulation of RelE expression by the OmpR-dependent promoter, a low copy vector is required.
Transposon Hotspot Formation in LacI-Regulated lambda pL Hybrid Promoter Reporter System
During cloning, formation of a transposon hotspot between the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter and a reporter system was observed, making this promoter inapt for the dormancy system
To control the gene expression of RelB, the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 , was chosen. Due to a putative formation of a transposon hotspot between the promoter sequence and the GFP reporter, which is described further here, another inducible promoter was chosen to regulate the expression of RelB.
Induction and Subsequent Inhibition of the pBAD Promoter
Expression by the pBAD promoter can be regulated tightly by induction and subsequent inhibition.
The pBAD promoter holds great potential to regulate the expression of the relB gene in our system, as it is capable of both an induction and repression. The HKUST-Rice iGEM team from 2015 found that the pBAD promoter exhibits an almost all-or-none behaviour upon induction with arabinose when located on a high copy vector, but allows for gradual induction when cloned into a low copy vector. Thus, it was evident that this promoter on a high copy vector would be inappropriate for the regulation of RelB expression. Based on these findings, a low copy vector was used to investigate the ability to inhibit gene expression subsequent to induction of pBAD.
RelB expression was simulated by fluorescence microscopy using a pBAD-YFP reporter system, BBa_I6058 . For this purpose, an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used with an exposure time for YFP at 200 ms. Transformed E. coli MG1655 cells were cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, to avoid catabolite repression from glucose residues present in LB medium. Two cultures were incubated, of which one was induced with 0.2 % arabinose from the beginning. At OD600=0.1, designated time 0, the cultures were split in two and 0.2 % glucose was added to one of each pair. Samples were obtained at time 0, before"

Freiburg,2015,Team:Freiburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"iburg tried to measure the binding of the purified HER2-antigen to the His-affibody lysate in iRIf.
Figure 1: Amido black stained Western Blot of His-tagged affibody. No signal could be detected at 10 kDa (size of the affibody)
As the iGEM Team Stockholm 2015 also works on a diagnostic tool, we thought it would be great to combine our two approaches. For early detection of cancer biomarkers, Stockholm tried to establish an affibody based bacterial biomarker assay (ABBBA). We planed to measure the binding of the purified HER2-antigen to the corresponding His-tagged affibody Stockholm sent us, which we immobilized on our Ni-NTA surface. Unfortunately, we realized that the HER2-antigen was also His-tagged, so it was not suitable for an anlysis on a Ni-NTA surface. The HER2-antigen would bind to the surface, precluding a detection of its binding to the affibody.
To circumvent this problem we spotted the HER2-antigen on a PDITC surface and measured the binding of the affibody to the protein. Due to the small size of the affibody (under 10 kDa) it's not possible to observe the binding with iRIf because the detection limit of the system is around 10 kDa.
A third possibility would have been to spot the His-tagged affibody on a PDITC surface and flush the slide with the antigen. Therefore, it would have been necessary to purify the affibody, so we expressed it freshly from the glycerol stock Stockholm sent us. We performed a Western Blot of the pellet and the soluble fraction after lysis of the E.coli cells that expressed the affibody. To identify the expressed protein we used Ni-NTA conjugated HRP antibody. Additionally, we stained the membrane with amidoblack to determine successful transfer of the proteins onto the membrane (figure 1). Unfortunately, there was no signal detectable by chemiluminescence at the expected molecular weight. Therefore, we did not proceed with purification.

Education
Interactive Virtual Reality Laboratory
At the beginning of May, we started out with the innovative idea to create a Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory training environment. In this way, we want to innovate in education for highly interactive, less expensive and more encompassing laboratory preparation. The idea started with one of our team members who had relatively little laboratory experience because this is an expensive component for the education programs. We went into our own lab to measure everything, from the height of the benches to the dimensions of the pipet tips. In figure 1 you can see the result, our lab in real life and in virtual reality compared. We can make people experience our project with an app. Try it out yourself at our stand in the Exhibition Space during the Giant Jamboree. If you can’t wait, you can already take a look at our video shown below!
Figure 1. Left: our lab, right: our VR lab
Advantages of our Virtual Reality Laboratory
There are several more good reasons for VR development in laboratory education that prompted us to develop this, amongst which:
Diverse safety measure incorporation
To identify the usefulness of VR for safety training we had a talk with Erwin van Rijn, the safety coordinator at the Bionanoscience Department of the TU Delft. He recommended to focus on general lab training for beginning life science students. In this training we incorporated safety procedures, which can be extended in the future.
Less dangerous
Fellow students sometimes complained to us that during their first times in the lab they would not always exactly know what they were doing. Therefore, beginning students might experience difficulties with exactly determining the risks involved in every procedure that they carry out. Even though this is what we always try to overcome by good preparation, practicing in the lab is often different. Therefore, practicing in VR is a good opportunity better evaluate the risks involved in real life laboratory practices.
Costs
A talk with the program coordinator of Nanobiology at Delft University of Technology, Serge Donkers, revealed that laboratory education is highly expensive, partly due to the extra laboratory space and equipment that is required."
Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"flumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.
Theophylline is a medication, which might help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor. Side effects are dose-related, and low doses are recommended.
Antibiotics can act against respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis and pneumonia.
Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:
Lung volume reduction surgery
Lung transplant
Bullectomy7
Asthma
Asthma medications are divided into two main parts, long term, and short term medication, where the first acts to reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting and the second one acts to give rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack. Asthma has very similar medications as COPD such as the inhaled steroids, bronchodilators and Theophylline.
Other long-term control medicines include:
Cromolyn
Omalizumab
Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists
Leukotriene modifiers
Short terms include:
Ipratropium (Atrovent)
Prednisone
Methylprednisolone
Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists8
Airway clearance techniques
In addition to medication, techniques can be taught by a physiotherapist to help restore clear airways in all of our targeted diseases. Such exercises includes: active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing, autogenic drainage, a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs, modified postural drainage, a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs and airway clearance devices, a handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways9.

Gently shake each tube and centrifuge it at 4000rpm for 10 minutes at 7 Celsius. Remove the supernatant from each tube with a pipette and place it in a new tube with the same label. Be careful not to get the chloroform or bacteria when you remove the supernatant.
Store the supernatants at 4 Celsius.
3) Spot test to determine phage concentration (7.30-8.1)
Dilution series between -2 and -6 was performed for each of the 8 samples (M9 and LB each at 0ug, 100ug, 200ug, and 500ug).
Spot test was performed by plating 0.5mL of E coli BL21 liquid culture overnight and 5mL of x1 top agar, and spotting 5uL of each dilution sample.
4) Spot test to determine phage concentration (8.2 and 8.5)
Each sample was further diluted to -7, -8, and -9.
Spot test was performed by plating 0.5mL of E coli BL21 liquid culture overnight and 5mL of x1 top agar, and spotting 5uL of each dilution sample (-4 through -9).
5) CsCl gradient
The mutagenized phage was handed over to the phage purification team for CsCl gradient separation. Due to multiple factors (gradient design not optimal, switch in CsCl vendor, etc). All phage banded at the top of the gradient. Adjustments to gradient design will be made based on the results from this experiment.

2) Applying the mutagen
The OD reading was 0.275. After another 30 minutes of incubating, the bacterial concentration should be about 2E8. This means we wanted to add 2E7 phage, which is roughly 10ul of the ""10ul 7.19"" stock.
3) Spot test to determine phage concentration
Every plate had contamination. The contaminant colonies are randomly spread out on the plates, implying that most likely the top agar used was contaminated. We also observed that these colonies are bigger than usual at places where phage plaques should be observed. This can be explained by the fact that T7 will have lysed BL21 at places where the plaques were forming, leaving the spot open for contaminant growth.
Even with contamination, we can tell that most of the"

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Project Idea#Pre study_-_-_TEXT.html,", designing new vitamin D analogs able to stimulate melanocyte differentiation and to enhance tyrosinase activity is of a particularly high interest in vitiligo.
The mechanism through which vitamin D exerts its effects on melanocytes is not yet fully understood. It is believed that vitamin D is involved in melanocyte physiology by coordinating the melanogenic cytokines (most likely endothelin-3 (ET-3)) and the activity of SCF/c-Kit system—one of the most important regulators of melanocyte viability and maturation.33” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.20)
“Furthermore, a proposed mechanism involving vitamin D in the protection of vitiliginous skin is based on its antioxidant properties and regulatory function toward the ROS that are produced in excess in vitiligo epidermis. It is also believed that vitamin D coordinates calcium fluxes in melanocytes, a similar function to that exerted in other cell types such as human keratinocytes, hepatocytes, and murine B16 melanoma cells.33,72,73 Based on these observations, it has been suggested that vitamin D is involved in the correction of the aberrant calcium fluxes that accompany the melanocytic loss in vitiligo.33,34,74,75 Several other studies emphasized the complex anti-apoptotic action of vitamin D on melanocytes76 and keratinocytes.77,78 It is likely that vitamin D can protect pigment cells against apoptosis, one of the cytotoxic mechanisms proposed among those causing melanocyte disappearance in vitiligo.” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.20
Nina: We need to apply the vitamin d into our bacteria that has been documented having the shortes pathway.
Andreas: Keep in mind that vitamin D (in the human body at least) is produced from a precursor that requires (UV?) light to be converted into vitamin D. Maybe this does not apply to bacteria, I don’t know.

We improved and characterized variants of the E. coli lldPRD-operon promoter based on the natural version ( BBa_K822000 ), on which there is only a limited amount of information available in the Parts Registry and in the literature. The characterization of a synthetic promoter library yielded promoter variants that far outperform the wild type LldPRD promoter.
We characterized the autoinducer inactivation enzyme (aiiA) . With aiiA the quorum sensing system has 10 000x lower sensitivity.
We characterized sTRAIL to induce apoptosis in cancer cells.
We characterized the natural plldR promoter and came up with the hypothesis that LldR has combined repression and activation .
We designed a chip for future application of our MicroBeacon E. coli.
We participated in the interlab study .
Our experiments complied with the safety instructions at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering D-BSSE in Basel where our lab is situated.
Modeling Achievements
We separately modeled two different signals of our cancer detection system, the Lactate Module and the AHL Module .
We defined and estimated all relevant parameters for our models .
We integrated the two modules into a Combined Compartment Model to simulate a logical AND gate.
To account for the diffusion and degradation of signaling molecules under real-world conditions we designed various Reaction-diffusion Models .
We optimized our model by integrating experimental data gathered by the characterization of our LldR promoter constructs.
We showed that the successful detection of cancer cells with our system is feasible in principle .
Human Practices and Collaboration Achievements
We interviewed several medical doctors and integrated the insights we got into the design of our device.
We thought and performed a biological experiment with primary school children and learnt about their enthusiasm for science.
To get the publics attention we published two articles about iGEM and our project, one in a regional newspaper and one in the ETH-student magazine ""Polykum"" . In addition we did a survey in the streets of Basel and asked the people about their perception of synthetic biology.
Talking to an ethics expert helped us consider important ethical questions such, e.g. if it is defensible to use engineered organisms for diagnostic purposes.
We conducted an interview with the founder of a startup biotech company and discussed with him if MicroBeacon would be a promising business idea .
We talked to a patent expert and learnt about patents"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.

To increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and                             to improve the tolerance of yeast to high levels of ROS, we optimized our yeast, which will                             be shown as follow:
Increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS
Overview:
After literature searching, we selected two genes, yno1 and ndi1, as candidates                         for overexpression to increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS. According to our data, both                         of these two genes can effectively increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS.
To determine whether overexpression of ndi1 or yno1 can increase the endogenous                         ROS accumulation in yeast, we constructed an expression plasmid, based on pESC-Leu, in which                         the cloned ndi1 or yno1 is driven by GAL1 promoter. Thus the target gene can be                         induced by galactose and repressed by glucose.
Fig. 1,2 Transformed the plasmid into yeast
After transformed the plasmid into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we first measured the ROS                         production of yeast cells cultured in non-screening or screening media by Fluorescent                         microplate reader. We mixed yeast cells with DCFH-DA, which can be oxidized by ROS to become a                         strong green fluorescent substance DCF (dichlorofluorescein) that cannot penetrate the cell                         membrane.
Fig. 3,4 results of ROS accumulation through overexpress yno1 or ndi1
Fluorescent microplate reader analysis showed that overexpression of either ndi1 or yno1 may cause significant ROS production as revealed by green fluorescent substance DCF, and the                         fluorescence intensity in ndi1-overexpressing"

Northwestern,2012,Team:Northwestern#Outreach#Video_-_-_TEXT.html," other and produce the most honest portrayal of their work at the various jamborees.
Because the products of synthetic biology have a marketability, science must be careful to ensure that the results of research produce something useful. It must yield a better world and helpfulness to humanity. On a spiritual level, it questions what creation means. Often synthetic biology is meant to help people from different parts of the world. They may view the creation of a new organism different than a different culture. These questions must be asked as well.
If synthetic biology has all of this potential for both public good and private exploitation, who is meant to regulate this field?
This part of the video addresses the fact that the public need to be a part of the scientific process. This means that the public must be educated about the things happening in the lab, and scientists need to write more for non-academic settings. This common understanding at the basic level between the two groups should allow increased discussion between the two groups and allow the public greater access to the science being conducted in the lab. Hopefully the public can then assist the scientists in discussing what happens in the lab, and have the final products assist them in the greatest capacity.
What other questions do we need to address to conduct proper public-oriented science?
This gives some more meaning to the regulatory agencies. If science were only monitored and questioned by other scientists, research would be out of touch with what is important to the public. Like Professor Zoloth stated, science is constantly shifting the social boundaries that society has erected, and it is the job of philosophers and others to wonder about these changes.
It is good that others ought to think about this. So what guidelines should oversee synthetic biology?
This theory is that scientist should self regulate themselves to perform their jobs to the most honest way possible. This needs to be instilled early, perhaps in the undergraduate years. Being a good scientists means working as a team and performing to the best of their abilities. If a strong set of norms act as a deterrent enough to prevent the deviation from being completely honest. A culture of honesty and truthfulness would be great for research science, and hopefully reflect well in the minds of the public.
Who decides what projects are funded?
If government is both the protector and regulator of scientific funding, they should be part of the decision making process. The people who have the most to gain should also have the most to see lost in the failures and mistakes of science in their filed if they completed a large part of the decision making in the lab. Risk should be considered in this way if there is to be consequences to a failure of a project. However"

The modified indC (indC*) was amplified introducing the RFC[10] prefix and suffix (Primer KH21/22). The four PPTases and indC* coding sequences were cloned into pSB1C3 using standard BioBrick Assembly.
Due to faulty primer design of RB71, the resulting plasmid pRB22 was incorrect as well. We ordered a corrected version of RB78 and assembled the plasmids again in the following week.
Week 18
T-Domain Shuffling
We again assembled pRB19 from pRB14 and did all T-domain-exchanges in this plasmid. After we picked and prepped positive colonies we performed co-transformations with pRB15-18 to see which PPTases are able to activate any of the T-domains inserted into indC.
To obtain experimental validation that the strategy to use two separate plasmids works and to verify that the PPTase plasmids are free of template backbone we co-transformed TOP10 cells with pRB21 and pRB15-18.
In parallel we assembled pKH4, which is derived from pRB14. The sfp coding sequence was replaced by a nonsense part of pMM65 using the cutting sites BamHI and NheI. In this way, we were independent from the success of the assembly of pRB19.
BioBricks for the Registry
After the corrected primer RB78 arrived we assembled pRB22 and cloned the BioBricks pKH6-10 for the part submission.
Week 19
Domain Shuffling – PPTase Plasmids
The PPTase plasmids pRB15-18 have been reassembled with pSB3K3 from a different plate of the partsdistribution, using a CPEC approach. This week we validated those plasmids. Additionally, we assembled them by restriction cloning.
T-Domain Shuffling
Last week we assembled pKH4, which is a pSB1C3 derived plasmid coding for indC but lacking a PPTase. We validated the plasmid and used it as the template to assemble pKH5 in which the T-domain of indC were replaced by ccdB. In parallel and as a backup strategy, we assembled pRB19 using restriction cloning.
As a second backup strategy, we assembled pRB22 and pRB23 using CPEC with single fragments that were amplified from a P. luminescens cell pellet.
Both pKH5 and pRB22 were correct as seen"

This is our first regular meeting after the final exam. Considering some teammates have gone home, we simply concluded our work before and afterwards.
After analyzing many documents about Salmonella, we decided to start with improveing the character of facultative anaerobic of the bacteria to enhance its property of tumor targeting.
From the documents, we realized that the reason why some bacteria are highly anaerobic is related to anaerobic promoters.  The most used anaerobic promoter applied in experiments to express the target genes at present is promoter nir B.  However, we found other anaerobic promoters had few differences from Pnir B based on the data.  Therefore we supposed there might be better anaerobic promoters than Pnir B in terms of expressing specific target genes, and set our next goal to find newer and better anaerobic promoters.
In order to realize this goal, we start with reading the following documents that might bring us some illumination.

We used E. coli cells carrying the empty vector (pET-15b) as a control and compare it with the E.coli cells carrying pET15b-ATF2 after addition of isoamyl alcohol. To compare the production of isoamyl acetate, we carried out a bioassay using Drosophila. Because Drosophila favors the fruit odor like isoamyl acetate. [1]
After the addition of IPTG and isoamyl acetate, the culture was impregnated into the filter and placed in a case containing 10 Drosophilas. We monitored the behavior of Drosophila. This is the result. For 1 hour, 7 flies gathered to the ATF2. These results clearly indicate that ATF2 produces isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol.
This is the result. For 1 hour, 7 flies gathered to the ATF2. These results clearly indicate that ATF2 produces isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol.
4,The comparing with the ability of ATF1 and ATF2
In addition, according to the previous study [2], the ability of ATF2 protein to produce isoamyl acetate in yeast is higher than that of ATF1 protein.
It is known that both ATF1 and ATF2 protein are involved in producing isoamyl acetate.
In 2006, MIT iGEM team submitted ATF1 coding sequence. (BBa_J45006) Our new part, ATF2 coding sequence, fall under the category of the improvement of function existing BioBrick Part, BBa_J45006. Herewith, our team, KIT-Kyoto 2013 iGEM team, meets the additional requirements for a Gold Medal.
Future
Our main parts designed this time were these two, but we have an idea that we insert GFP, RFP, or CFP in these parts. By using fluorescence protein reporters, we can see the expression of the enzyme more exactly. However, there are many kinds of fluorescence proteins. Which protein is the best in our future projects? We examined how each fluorescence protein affects the growth of E. coli cells.
2013 KIT-Kyoto iGEM team assessed influence of fluorescence proteins on the growth of E.coli. We used BBa_I13521, BBa_I13522 and BBa_I13600 in order to measure the growth. We made growth curve of various transformants expressing reporter genes. The purple line"
UFlorida,2018,Team:UFlorida#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," to help those suffering from diseases of the gut, but The Ferminator is not limited to fighting off biological villains! Beyond the scope of therapeutics, butyrate can be used as an industrial precursor to biofuels and has many implications in space exploration. This SCFA is very important due to its extensive health and biochemical characteristics. The creation of a microbe that can be induced to produce abundant amounts of a beneficial metabolite is our primary ambition. Once this goal is reached, this symbiont can be streamlined to enhance and progress many fields of work including therapeutics, industry, science, and engineering.
Therapeutics
IBD is an overarching term for both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which can cause diarrhea, weight loss, fever, abdominal pain, and fatigue. The causes for these diseases are unknown; however, previous research has linked butyrate with relief of these symptoms. Our engineered bacteria could serve as the basis for a therapeutic that introduces butyrate into IBD patients. Our belief is that upregulation of butyrate throughout the GI tract could provide many benefits for patients.
This model could also be used in the development of a therapeutic to treat colon cancer. Butyrate has been shown to induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells while leaving normal intestinal tissue intact. Introducing an affinity to bind cancerous cells may optimize the known anti-cancer effects of butyrate production. This hypothesis assumes that facilitating proximity to targeted colon cancer cells will increase the effective therapeutic butyrate concentration in the cancer cell microenvironment to induce apoptosis.
Industry
Directed evolution can be used to create biosynthetic pathways, and previous research has shown that this technique can be used to produce a variety of chemicals. Butyrate itself is involved in the production of biofuels and has the potential to make many of our common industrial practices significantly more efficient. As our world faces a sustainability crisis, researchers are working to find alternative fuel sources. One promising use of butyrate is to produce butanol, which can hypothetically replace ethanol and other fuels. Using our engineered bacterium to streamline butanol production could be a step towards solving the world’s energy crisis.
Space Exploration
Our engineered strain could also lead to major advancements in the capabilities of space travel. Periods of living in space can take a significant toll on the human body, including a large impact on gut microbiome health that arises from both physical and mental stress. Over the course of longer-term stays, astronauts can suffer a great deficit in gut butyrate production. There is potential to develop a butyrate probiotic specific for space exploration"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Software#Synbio_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d instantaneously be available on our app.
We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Limit of detection
To determine the limit of detection of the NAD+ bioassay the NAD+ concentrations were decreased until the fluorescence enhancement was no longer distinguishable from added H2O. This was the case as soon as the NAD+ concentration came below 2 nM. Deductively, the limit of detection of the molecular beacon based and LigA associated NAD+ bioassay was set at 2 nM NAD+. Furthermore, this confirmed the linear dependence between the initial velocity and the NAD+ concentration (Figure 19).
Figure 19: Initial velocity calibration curve for NAD+. The initial velocity, calculated from the average fluorescence enhancement rate in 200 s after NAD+ addition, is plotted versus the employed NAD+ concentration. Data is fitted with linear regression for NAD+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 nM (R² = 0.991, n = 4).
Selectivity test
The specifity of LigA for its substrate NAD+ is important in order to couple the NAD+ detection with investigated processes including NADH-dependent enzyme reactions. The verification of the selectivity is an important matter to exclude any unspecific reactions which might"
UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#RelatedWork_-_-_TEXT.html," through the process of creating new genetic constructs by combining DNA sequences known as genetic parts or biological parts. Users can create their own account on the web site to add their new genetic parts, customize the build-in parts libraries for their own needs, and save their designs for future reference. Upon completion of the design process, the design DNA sequence can be saved as a text file for synthesis by a gene synthesis company or simply for further analysis in sequence analysis applications. GenoCAD also provides a construct validation feature (using a context free grammar (CFG) analysis) that allows users to import the sequence of a design and check its validity. GenoCAD relies on a linguistic model of the DNA sequence. The site currently supports a single proof of concept grammar that has been described in a paper published in Bioinformatics. Ongoing development efforts aim at implementing support for multiple grammars in GenoCAD.
Strengths of this tool are primarily its attempt to validate the sequence and categorize parts via production rules based on 26 syntactic categories (i.e. gene coding region, terminator, stop codon, promoter, ribosome binding site, etc).

Gene Designer
Gene Designer
Gene Designer [2] by DNA 2.0 is a stand alone graphical software package for manipulating biological designs.  The software enables you to combine building blocks such as regulatory DNA elements, amino acid sequences, affinity tags and cloning features. Additionally you can optimize expression by codon optimizing proteins for any expression host. There are two design views for the user, Icon and Sequence. The icon view encapsulates the DNA sequence as a specific icon indicating what type of part it is. The sequence view is an annotated DNA sequence corresponding to the Icon view. Gene Designer supports a wide variety of computational manipulations to the design such as codon optimization and can identify various DNA regions. Designs can be imported/exported in FASTA format for use with other tools and flows. There is not currently support for external databases (but is forthcoming in version 2.0).
Here is a list of features as given by DNA 2.0:
Manage genetic elements, constructs and libraries of constructs via drag and drop
Create/Edit/Split/Merge/Save genetic elements (AA and DNA sequences)
Back-translate open reading frames using a codon bias table
Add/Remove restriction sites or other motifs (locally or globally)
