To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

Cutting Copper Samples:
We cut 50 pieces of 2 x 2 cm copper pieces using scissors. 5 of those pieces were sanded to make the surface rough in order to test if solid media can stay on it since the experiment did not work last time with the smooth surface.
Liquid Media:
1 liter of liquid media (AFM) was developed. 6 flasks were filled to the 100mL mark with AFM, with the intention of three flasks containing copper w/bacteria and the other three containing copper w/o bacteria. 32 uL of OD 0.0031 bacteria were added to the bacteria flasks after copper masses were measured. Two additional flasks were also used: one would be filled with 100mL of sulfuric acid (at pH 1.95) and a piece of copper without bacteria; the other would be filled with 100mL of deionized water and a piece of copper without bacteria. Two blank PCB pieces were also placed in two separate flasks. 10.3 uL of OD 0.0031 bacteria was added to one of the two flasks after the PCB masses were measured.The PCBs were covered with just enough media to fill the top of the copper surface, or at least we tried. The flasks with AFM were put into the shaker at 220 rpm, room temperature. The two PCB flasks were left sitting on the table next to the shaker in undergrad lab, not shaking.The water and sulfuric acid flasks were placed in a shaker at 225 rpm and 30 degrees C.  Note that the amount of bacteria and the OD used were calculated such that we have an initial concentration of 1 x 10^-6 cells for the liquid media.
Solid Media:
Calculations were first performed to determine the amount of solid media needed to place a thin layer (1 mL) so diffusion of ions can occur as quickly as possible. Calculations showed that we needed 7.85 mL per petri dish, but at the end, we used 12.85 mL of solid media to entirely cover the surface of each large petri dish with the copper samples submerged. We did this because of the inaccurate assumption that the copper samples were completely flat. The petri dish containing scratched copper pieces just had media on top of them. A total of 8 petri dishes (labeled "

An electrophoresis gel was made to verify the length of the fragments. After the confirmation of the bands, they were purified by using the EZ-10 Spin column DNA gel extraction kit. The concentration of the isolated parts was measured with the nanodrop.
For the ligations, the calculations were made using the ligation calculator of the UT_Dallas 2011 iGEM team ( https://2011.igem.org/Team:UT_Dallas/ligation ). The ligations were incubated at 4°C for 16-24 hours. After the incubation, the ligation product was transformed following the electrotransformation protocol.
Again after transformation, a single colony from each of the selection plates was selected and inoculated in 20mL LB broth with appropriate antibiotic. The samples were incubated overnight at 37°C with 250rpm. Later, they were centrifuged at 4,000rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 1mL of LB media. Of each sample, 425uL were used for a glycerol stock, which was stored a -80°C. The remaining 575uL were used to make minipreps. The DNA concentration and purity were measured with the nanodrop.
The digestion analysis of the parts was as following:

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Libraries_-_-_TEXT.html,"promoter strength is visualized as specific flourescence therefore relative flourescent units (RFU) are devided by OD600. The promoters are arranged dependent to their strength.
The specific relative flourescence of the original Anderson Promoters in backbone J61002 shows strength variations compared to the original strength of Anderson Promoters from the Registry . The strongest promoter of the 14 measured ones is J23101. J23119 is not the strongest promoter as expected but only the fifth strongest.
Induction test of K15851xx
Our IPTG inducible promoters show no significant increase of flourescence after IPTG induction.
Discussion
We analyzed the original Anderson Promoters in DH5alpha cells of E.coli. The fluorescence values in the registry however were evaluated in strain TG1 which may explain the different measurement values.
Our lacI binding region (lacO) is copied from R0010 and is different to J33207 . It is also different to the lacO region behind the inducible T7 promoter in pSBXXX0 ( Heidelberg 2014 Part: BBa_K1362091 - ...97).
More precisely, we used a sequence of 35 bp although the lacO site of part J33207 is only annotated with 28 bp. Additionally our lacI binding site differs from J33207 in one base pair.
This derivation in the sequence might be a reason that our promoters are not inducible.

Phase 1 Results
The goal of phase 1 to establish a consistent method of gene activation through dCAS9-VPR and well characterize the components of our system. Using MIT's CRISPR  optimization tool, we generated 20 sequences to be used as our gRNA and target site. The dCAS9-VPR complex, the target sequence and reporter gene, and the gRNA expression vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.

Cas9 expression and FPLC purification
Day 1
Cas9 was expressed in a recoded E. coli strain lacking TAG stopcodons and release factor 1(C321dA; ref), but higher expression can probably be achieved using a bacterial strain more suited to protein expression.
10 ml overnight cultures were prepared of C321dA transformed with Cas9-expresso, dCas9-expresso, Ala10TAG-expresso + pEVOL, or Ala840TAG-expresso + pEVOL. Cultures were grown in LB in the presence of 35 µg/mL kanamycin (expresso constructs) and 25 µg/mL chloramphenicol (pEVOL constructs) when appropriate.

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

A specialist doctor, Andrew Linford, was kind enough to show us around the burn unit in Jorvi Hospital. We got a tour around the unit which was designed to serve the burn victims in every stage of their recovery. We learned about the different techniques and products used when treating burns but since the usage of antimicrobial agents was minimal, especially in the early stages of a healing burn, we decided not to focus too much on this subject.
At the wound policlinic, we met nurse Ulla Väänänen and dermatologist Kirsi Isoherranen. We had a lovely visit, during which we were allowed to follow the appointments of three patients with different kind of wounds and truly learn about wound care in detail and in practice. In addition to meeting patients and following the procedures, we were also introduced to a massive amount of wound care products and even got to take samples and brochures with us. We felt that we might not be able to compete with such a massive amount of products. Additionally, in deeper wounds, biofilms and some bacteria might prove to be a problem, so we felt that wound care might be too much of a challenge for our peptide.
Nurse Ulla Väänänen showing what kind of problems she has faced with current wound care products.
We had also noticed from literature that Dermcidin is active against Probionibacterium acnes, which is a common species on acne patiens, who also have lower Dermcidin levels than people without acne. This seemed intriguing, so in order to learn more about acne, we visited Antti Lauerma, who is a doctor of medicine, professor of dermatology and an allergologist. During our meeting, we learned that acne isn’t actually as studied as one would think of such a common disease. Even if people are usually well aware of its existence, they might not know that much about it. There is also still some widely distributed misinformation that we could hopefully help to correct with our project.
We also learned a lot about the other current treatments and that some things about acne are still not known - even the exact cause of acne in general. For the application of our project, one of the most important pieces of information was that according to Lauerma, recent studies show that although Propionibacterium acnes can be found on the skin of acne patients, it is more likely a result than a cause for"

HFUT-China
We help the team HFUT-China to solve some biological problems and help them to validate their software, building a better platform or forum for iGEMers to communicate, especially about the parts. Here’s our suggestions about their search engine—Bio-Designer-Dolphin.
The searching engine—bio-designer-dophin, is very powerful. It consists of 4 different parts. The first one, the searching section, is the most useful tool on this website. Just type in the key words you are interested in, the Dophin will tell you all projects in iGEM competition over the last 12 years that are associated with your key words. For example, this year, our project is about bio-cathode, so the first try I did was to search bio-cathode. A few seconds later, all projects about bio-cathode would come up to me. No matter the awards they got or the biobricks they had submitted to the HQ would be sorted out. Then you can have a general understanding to this project. This function is so great as there have not been any search engine that is serve for iGEM competition especially. Besides, it also provides us a platform to design our project online, drawing out the gene circuit with any biobrick you want. Though it still has some problems if we want to search out the proper biobrick we want to use when we are designing. Thirdly, it also have a section called “Gene relationship”. In this part, the Dophin will show you the genes that have close relationship to the one you concern. This two parts can help us design and optimize our gene circuit more conveniently. The last section is called “System”. It’s a tool that you can use to search out the characterizations of some chemical compounds.

Conclusion
Introduction
Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material (plasmids) between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. It is also the way by which we planned to grant C.C. the ability of color print. As the significance of this process is self-evident, we established a model to explore the mechanism of concentration change of bacteria during conjugation, answering the question that how many E. Coli & C.C. one should put into the system initially to ensure more C.C. yield. This model serves as a useful guidance of this experiment.
Fig. 1 Conjugation (From Wikipedia)
First, according to the types of bacterium (E.Coli/C.C.) and their content (with/without plasmids), bacteria involved in this scenario are divided into 4 categories as shown in Fig. 2. Each category has a few numbers to represent its property of growth: $r$ stands for the rate of birth, while $d$ stands for the rate of death.
To be specific: $r_1$ and $r_2$ represent the rate of birth of E. Coli and C.C., respectively. Accordingly, $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively represent the rate of death of them. $d_3$ stands for the rate of death causing by lack of plasmid.
Fig. 2
Then, we made several assumptions.
Assumption
All kinds of bacteria involved are uniformly distributed in the system where conjugation happens. Using one number, the concentration $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$, to describe a specific type of bacterium, respectively (n4=0 in the case of conjugation).  That means, the concentration varying among different locations is ignored, which, significantly simplifies the math in the model without hampering the major part of the biological process to be evaluated.
To be specific, eliminating the variable of location automatically make the form of possible governing equations going from PDE to ODE: a huge simplification math"

Stochastic Modelling of the RelE-RelB Dormancy System
RelE and RelB Regulate Dormancy and Influence Their Own Expression
Modelling of the effects of different RelE and RelB expression levels were performed as an important aspect in the implementation of the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system. The toxin RelE constrains bacterial growth by mRNA degradation, thereby inhibiting translation, whereas the antitoxin RelB inhibits this toxic effect by forming complexes with RelE. As seen in Figure 1, three different protein complexes are formed, namely RelB2, RelB2RelE, and RelB2RelE2, containing zero, one, and two RelE molecules respectively Guang-Yao Li, Yonglong Zhang, Masayori Inouye, Mitsuhiko Ikura, Structural Mechanism of Transcriptional Autorepression of the Escherichia coli RelB/RelE Antitoxin/Toxin Module, In Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 380, Issue 1, 2008, Pages 107-119, ISSN 0022-2836 .
Figure 1. The three toxin-antitoxin complexes RelB2, RelB2RelE, and RelB2RelE2.
The expression of both RelE and RelB is regulated by the relBE promoter, which is influenced differently by each of the complexes, as seen in Figure 2. When small amounts of RelE is present, RelB2 and RelB2RelE repress transcription through relBE by binding to the operator sequence. However, when high amounts of RelE are present, the toxin mitigates this repression by reacting with complexes bound to the operator sequence Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 .

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#substrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the degradation product). This idea seemed improbable, because ethinyl estradiol cannot be oxidized at that position, but  its degradation product also had two hydrogen less than the native (it is impossible to  oxidize the hydroxy group of the five-ring to a ketone without losing the ethinyl group or breaking the ring (Fig. 19)). The second model was that the laccase radicalizes the hydroxy group of the phenolic group of the estradiol and ethinyl estradiol, as described in literature, building a phenoxy radical in the first step. In the second step hydrogen is split off on the tertiary carbon in para position finally leading to a quinone like structure (Figure 19).  Without knowing the mechanism behind this reaction, this seems the most probable model of the degradation.
Figure 18: First possible structure of the degradation product (component A) after laccase treatment. The secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone and the product corresponds to estrone. This structure was designed with ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 after discussion with Prof. Kuck on our MS/MS data.
Figure 19: Suggested chemical structure of the oxidized ethinyl estradiol. The phenolic part of the molecule has changed in a quinone like structure. This structure was designed with ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 after discussion with Prof. Kuck on our MS/MS data.
The second peaks in the chromatograms (component B and D) embody molecules with two oxygen more and two hydrogen less than the native. We postulate that this might be a transition state where O2 is radically added to the phenolic ring in otho- and meta-position.  To that point, there is no data to consolidate this adoption.  Component B and D were also fragmented in the tandem mass spectrometry for further analysis, but the resulting peaks could not be differed from the background noise.
Further substrate analysis via HPLC
HPLC analysis of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons
The results of our negative control measurements of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons showed that the PAHs decayed without laccase treatment after one hour in Britton Robinson (BR)-buffer. This is shown in Figure 20.
The next step was to check which substances in the reaction approach may cause the decay. Therefore naphthalene was dissolved in methanol (which is the solvent for the substrate and used for stopping the reaction), acetonitrile (which could be used as alternative solvent) and BR"

Since engaging in the beauty industry, they suggested that we can not only use our system to produce the enzymes that are needed to process raw material, but also directly produce some ingredients, which can be added to skin care products. And our polycistron system can even attempt to mix two materials proportionally in production. In addition to using E·coli as our engineering cells, we may also be able to apply the system to other chassis, such as yeast, to explore the most convenient way on factory production. We will also keep in touch with Youdu for a long term and hope that our system can really achieve industrial integration.
Fig.18 Qingdao Youdu Biotechnology Co.LTD applauded our polycistron system.
In the process of interaction with biotech companies, we gained a lot and integrated it with our project. We organized our biotech companies research reports into documents and shared our experience with other iGEM teams. Known that our project is about basic research, Tianjin University contacted us and we set up a fundamental research results transformation team together with several Chinese iGEM teams, Tianjin, ZJU, NUDT. We were glad to share our experience with them.  Finally, we have finished a report on the transformation of basic research results, hoping future iGEM teams can learn something from it.
3. INTEGRATING PROJECT WITH A GAME——< Csy4 GO!>
""The principles of all fundamental scientific research are obscure for amateurish people.""
""The form of the game < Csy4 GO!> is interesting!""
In the process of human practice, we tried to explain our projects to more people. But we found that they felt it difficult to understand, especially some amateurish people. In order to let more people understand the principles of biology in an interesting and effective way, we spent lots of time designing a game - < Csy4 GO!>, which is a good combination with our project.
3.1 The game introduction
The leading role of < Csy4 GO!> is a little cute enzyme named Csy4 which is the main target of our project. Naturally, Cys4 is very active and able to protect the host from being harmed. We enumerate the functions of Csy4 from six parts--Immune, Secretion, Transport, Constitute, Recognition and Catalyze. Our game < Csy4 GO!> is based on these six parts. When we start the game, there will be six situations for players to choose, each situation includes one interesting story.

Lethbridge High School iGEM
For the 7th consecutive year, we collaborated with the Lethbridge High School iGEM team . We provided mentorship and assistance with wet lab work. Since both of our projects involved working with protein capsids from viruses, we helped each other design our constructs for these components. We also connected the high school team to previous collegiate team members who worked on our tailings pond projects since the current high school project is focused in that area. Collegiate team members Sydnee Calhoun, Chris Isaac, Luke Saville, and Kristi Turton acted as advisors for the high school team providing guidance in all areas of their project.
University of Calgary
To show that V.I.N.C.En.T. has the power to help other iGEM teams, we worked with the University of Calgary iGEM team. They are working on a system to make CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing even easier and more precise. Check out their wiki for a more detailed description of the awesome work they are doing.
To help the Calgary team deliver on their project, we sought out a protein nanocompartment that was capable of encapsulating the Cas9 protein. We found that by fusing Cas9 to the scaffolding protein of the P22 bacteriophage PNC it was possible to load it with Cas9, complexed with a desired guide RNA, and deliver functional concentrations of the gene editing protein to cells [1]. We requested samples of the DNA encoding these constructs from the Weidenheft lab at Montana State University, expressed the protein components in E. coli and delivered these protein samples to the U of C team for them to load with their custom guide RNA and evaluate their applicability in their project. Those tests are currently ongoing, and we are excited for you to hear about the results in Boston!

This way, we had a simple and standardised workflow for the construction of our expression plasmids. Golden gate reactions were transformed to E. coli DH5-alpha cells and plated on X-Gal/IPTG plates to allow for blue/white screening. The verified constructs were transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) to overexpress the proteins in the presence of IPTG.
Fabric Binding Domain fusion proteins
An important part of our project was to specify the localization of the potential stain removing enzymes. We hypothesized that by increasing the time of contact between our enzymes and the substrate, we could more efficiently remove stains.  In nature, peptide-based binding domains play an important role in the localization of an enzyme. Using the same principle, we fused proteins to the peptides we found to have a binding affinity for cotton, wool, silk and linen. ( More information on the Fabric Binding Domains. ) These peptides were thoroughly tested to see whether they were able to bind to specific type of fabrics.
To quantify the fabric binding affinity in the context of a fusion protein, we assayed their behaviour when fused to GFP. For the near future, we would like to test a larger number of enzymatic agents fused to a variety of fabric binding domains. This way, we have paved the way to expand the way stains can be treated with biological solutions.
Results
Outline of the project
Figure 2 Outline of the enzyme project. The enzyme sub-project has two main parts: the first one is the testing of a set of polyphenol degrading enzymes on their ability to degrade Anthocyanins, and the second one is the directing of that ability for stain removal purposes by fusing the enzymes to the Fabric Binding Domains (FBD) found by our team.
First, the different genes are codon optimised and cloned in E. coli. The heterologously expressed enzymes are then tested with their natural substrate to check whether they are functional of not.
Once their functionality is confirmed, we move on to the fusion of the enzymes with the FBD. To test whether it is feasible to fuse proteins with the FBD without disrupting their activity, we first create GFP-FBD fusion proteins for each of the FBDs and test their fluorescence. We also test the affinity of the resulting fusion proteins on different fabrics. This allows us to confirm whether it is feasible to construct fusion proteins in which both the enzyme and the FBD's activities are functional.
Having confirmed that fusion proteins are able to maintain both their enzymatic activity and their binding activity, we create fusion proteins with our polyphenol degrading enzymes and"

Part 3. Pouring the plates (if you are making LB agar)
While pouring the plates it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in room WB303, with a sterile environment provided by a lit bunsen burner.
Note: While you are waiting for the autoclave, steps 1- 3 can be done in the meantime, in addition to the clean up from Part 1.
Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials. Light the bunsen burner.
Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they should be sterile. Don't throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the top, and expose the plates as minimally as possible. Note that this protocol makes approximately 25 plates.
Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with your name – iGEM 2015 – date prepared – designated stripe* (if are using antibiotic). Once labelled, you may stack the plates to free up workspace.
Allow the LB media to cool before pouring. The LB will start to settle at about 30oC.
If you are preparing selective media, add antibiotic to the mixture. Use the recommended antibiotic concentrations (see table below) Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. If you don't know whether or not you are preparing selective media, ask.
Antibiotic
Recommended Concentration
Chloramphenicol (CAM)
25ug/mL
Ampicillin (AMP)
100ug/mL
One stripe along the sides corresponds to CAM, two stripes corresponds to AMP
Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar. When pouring the agar, pour until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly, to prevent the formation of bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribute the media evenly on the plate.
After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 4-5, as this takes up less space. Don't stack the plates too high – we want to prevent spills.

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Stony Brook iGEM Gene Circuit activity
Traditional gene circuit activities allow students to combine elements from a pre-made genetic toolbox. Our iGEM Team built upon this to create a expanded gene circuit activity in which students would be able to create their own tools to make a genetic circuit, stressing key features in science, such as creativity and problem solving. First, this activity was precluded with a presentation on iGEM and basic concepts of synthetic biology. Then, students were able to think of promoters and genes that they would want connected together to solve issues in the world, which they would then restriction enzyme digest and ligate together. This tied together their creativity and the information they learned from the presentation. For example, one of the students created a biosensor for bicarbonate in the oceans to determine areas with increasing acidification. We also have made available on our wiki a PowerPoint® presentation of this activity that we used at one of the schools. We hope that other teams can utilize this activity to learn from the students as we did!

Collaboration with Queen’s University iGEM 
During the summer we collaborated with Queen’s University iGEM team in Canada to create an informational pamphlet and brochure about directed evolution and the methods by which to perform directed evolution. Both our team and Queen’s University iGEM team considered incorporating directed evolution into our corresponding projects. Upon doing some research into directed evolution, we found a lack of resources regarding this topic online and thus, we sought to ameliorate this issue. Both teams collaborated to make create a pamphlet that provides detailed information regarding the methods by which directed evolution can be performed while taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of the methods discussed. In addition, the accompanying video about directed evolution present much of the same information as discussed in the pamphlet but does so in a more concise way. We hope that this resource is beneficial for future iGEM teams and other researchers interested in performing directed evolution in their labs. Through this collaboration we expanded our knowledge of synthetic biology and we learned how to collaborate with other student scientists within the community in a meaningful way.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," sub cloning our target gene onto the vectors successfully, we transformed the plasmids into either E. coli or S. cerevisiae to test the expression and function of corresponding protein, which means they should be integrated in the out membrane or cell wall. Therefore, we conduct Western Blot so that we can prove our result specifically. After that, we need to verify that the heterogeneous cells do adhere to each other through the combination of biotin and mSA. With rhodamine- polyethylene glycol-biotin and FITC-streptavidin, we conducted immunofluorescence staining on both E. coli and S. cerevisiae. By measuring florescent signal form two kinds of cell, we had a visual validation of parts work. Meanwhile, we explored the optimal condition for their co-culture and drew a conclusion after preliminary experiment. We inoculated the yeast in the medium containing galactose and inoculated E. coli after 30 hours cultivation.
For more solid a proof of their adhesion, we used Immunofluorescent Localization to demonstrate their relative location and took photos with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for their microstructure. What’s more, we acquired some quantitative data such as the percentage of linkage and expression with FCM. As a result, we can say that our adhesion platform was established successfully.
E.coli strain construction
We assume expressing monomer streptavidin on the outer membrane of E.coli will help us using biotin-avidin system to link E.coli and S.cerevisiae. In part registry, we find BBa_K523013 constructed by team 2011_Edinburgh(http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K523013) encoding INP-eYFP. We acquired INP using PCR from this part. Then we choose the constitutive promoter J23106 from part registry because it can express protein continuously so that we can have a relative steady co-culture system. The mSA part is from team 2016_Peking that give us much help. Monomer streptavidin is much smaller than that of wild type and is easier to be used in circuit. Based on above reasons, we designed plasmid J23106-INP-mSA-pSB1C3 (We call it JIM for short ) and transformed it into E.coli DH5α strain.

Tec-Monterrey
Purpose of collaboration:
Provide data about the chemical makeup of water sources in Israel, present projects and receive feedback.
Description:
The collaboration with the Tec-Monterrey team was initiated through Instagram.We set up a skype meeting to meet, discuss our projects, and help each other.
On August 15th 2018, we participated in a skype talk and learned that the Tec-Monterrey team is focused on water pollutant and collecting data regarding the chemical makeup of water sources in different countries. We were glad to help and to assist the team with data collection form Israel. We contacted Professor Ovadia Lev, whose research focuses on identifying organic-sulfur compounds in water pollutants and got the required data for Tec-Monterrey team.
Through this collaboration, we learned about our local water sources in Israel. We found that in Israel pollutants in drinking water is very rare and that most of the water in Israel is recycled.  Most of the water from plants and sewage is recycled in water treatment plants that is being used for agriculture. We learned that by testing various micro-pollutants and determine their levels, the recycled water will be used (or not) for agriculture.We sent a concentration of the findings obtained in extensive surveys conducted in partnership with the Water Authority laboratory.

I'm Xinyu Zhou, team leader of Lanzhou, a senior student major in biology in Lanzhou University. My personal interest is about cancer protein. Though I'm a second-time iGEMer, it is really a challenge for me to be a leader 'cause I have to focus on several things at the same time. Thanks to my brilliant  teammates, they're very reliable. We've done a very good job so far. I believe we can make it in Boston.

Discovered that Wolbachia is difficult to isolate and culture as they do not seem to have plasmids and have been proven extremely difficult to transform.
 
Not much research on Wolbachia has been done due to the lack of transformation techniques of this bacterium. However, literature shows Wolbachia alters reproduction in the host, but the mechanism is still unknown.
 
*Other potential methods of tackling bedbugs need to be addressed.

Helping TUST prepare for their first year of competition.
To begin with, we gave them construct suggestions, communicated with their team adviser. In 24/3/2017, we were invited to TUST to carried out recruiting propaganda for them, and provided our construction guide.
2017.08.01
In 2017.08.01, TUST and Tianjin held a meeting together, during the meeting, TUST gave an account of their recent progress, we suggested them to add some new synthetic routes and elements, and probably new strain instead of simply Xylinus for fibrin.
Later on
Later on, TUST came again with their modeling problem, we gave them suggestion that we can share the Fluorescence method and modeling method with them, design Fluorescence experience and modeling together since it’s their first year competition.
Helping NKU with their plasmid construction
1. NKU asked us to help them construct a plasmid. Using pEX18Gm as the supporter, we ought to added Lyase gene sequence（which they had already provided） and xyR-xyA sequence from pAX01 as well.
After construction
After construction, they sent us plasmid pAX01 and the plasmid which contains Lyase gene sequence, we helped them with ligasion and transformation.
Test the mini system for OUC
Mini system is a system composed of a mini promoter (about 100bp) and a mini terminator, and it is applicable for yeast. Because of the similarity of our biological chassis, they reached out to us and wanted us to run some control experiments for them. Using the same protocol and their mini system, we need to transform the system into our Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to test if the plasmid will still function the same.
Protocol
2. Protocol: initial OD600 = 0.01          Test OD600 and threshold fluorescence every other 5-6 hours              Exciting light λ=502/Emissive light λ=532

Kent,2014,Team:Kent#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," to check the plasmid was present. Unfortunately when   viewed under UV, only the DNA marker was present, showing the plasmid   was not present in the sample. 
Week 5
Day 17 (21/07/14): 
Today   we took a colony of GFP transformed cells and inoculated them in LB   media. These were left to grow overnight at 37°C ready to be used in the   miniprep   procedure tomorrow. We also transformed the new competent cells we had   made with YFP, and left these to grow overnight also at 37°C on   chloramphenicol agar plates. An agarose gel was also prepared ready to   carry agarose gel electrophoresis tomorrow with the plasmid we hope to   obtain from the miniprep, to check the plasmid is present.  
We finalised the zingiberne synthase and alpha-farnesene sequences, so that they could be ordered and we can then begin to assemble our Biobrick.  
 
Day 18 (22/07/14): 
Today we carried out the miniprep   of the GFP transformed cells that had been growing overnight to obtain   the GFP plasmid from them. This plasmid was the run on the agarose gel   we had prepared yesterday. Unfortunately whilst running this gel began to melt. We also used spectrometry to determine the concentration of plasmid we had obtained, and we had a high concentration. 
We   also sent emails to five different local and national newspapers to   begin trying to spread the word about synthetic biology. We also emailed   an iGem team from Paris and Sheffield iGem about collaborations.  
We also met with our supervisors and discussed the ordering of sequences, Boston trip, outreach and other iGem events. 
Ellie, Claire and Lisa developed sequences for R-linalool synthase and Patchoulol synthase.  
Day 19 (23/07/14): 
Today our sequence for zingiberne synthase was ordered. It will hopefully arrive in eight days. We confirmed the sequences for patchoulol synthase and R-linalool synthase, and found parts in the repository that we need to order.  
Taylor   carried on developing the wiki, creating a ‘landing page’ that people   will see when they look at our site until it is completed. 
Brogan and Rosie found quotes for hotels and flights for Boston, and also emailed newspapers and planned outreach.

Prhl(RL)-GFP (BBa_K1529301)
Prhl(RL) is a promoter that is activated by C4HSL-RhlR complex.
We improved Prhl promoter (BBa_R0071) by changing LuxR binding site of Plux promoter (BBa_R0062) to RhlR binding site.
To characterize the function of the Prhl(RL) promoter (BBa_K1529300), we constructed this part,  Prhl(RL)-GFP (BBa_K1529301) , by inserting a Prhl(RL) promoter into the upstream region of GFP coding sequence .
By using reporter cells containing Prhl(RL)-GFP, we measured the fluorescence intensity of the cells induced by C4HSL.
We confirmed that our new Prhl(RL) promoter was actually activated by C4HSL through an induction assay. (Fig. 5-1-1-1.)

Prhl(RL)-CmR-LasI (BBa_K1529302)
We constructed this part by combining  BBa_K1529300, BBa_K395160, BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0078. Prhl(RL) promoter has no leakage and higher expression than Prhl promoter (BBa_R0071). CmR and LasI are inserted into the downstream of the promoter
To confirm CmR production, we added chloramphenicol into the medium containing Prhl(RL)-CmR-LasI cell and measured optical density for about 8 h to estimate the concentration of the cell. (Fig. 5-1-2-1.)
Moreover, by co-culturing the cells containing this part with the cells containing 3OC12HSL dependent C4HSL producer part (BBa_K152"

Human Practices
    When designing our 2009 iGEM drug delivery system The E.ncapsulator, we were faced with the issue of ingesting genetically modified organisms. In fact, our system uses Escherichia coli to produce a curative polypeptide. The bacteria then auto-encapsulate in a coat of sugars which will subsequently allow the produced polypeptides to arrive intact to the gut. The third module is when the bacteria over-express a set of restriction enzymes. This has the effect of killing the bacteria because their DNA is destroyed. Without their DNA, the bacteria are unable to produce the proteins that enable them to survive and they therefore die, leaving behind a bag full of the curative polypeptides.
    This third module was consciously added to the E.ncapsulator system in order to ensure that no living, genetically modified bacteria would be ingested.  This module was the result of discussion among the team about the issues surrounding genetically engineered organisms, their ingestion and the risks involved.
    However, our human practices project doesn't stop there. In fact, we have recorded video interviews (scroll down) of the members of the team and written two documents looking at the following three themes:
    1. The importance of making science understandable for a large audience
    2. What are the materials engineered in Synthetic Biology?
    3. Risk and responsibility of Synthetic Biology and the importance of dialogue between science and society

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#Cholera - Detection#Winterexp#Period3#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," - KK The three phage groups presented today. I realized how very quickly each of our groups has specialized to the point that I have to concentrate deeply to understand what seems to be second nature to members of the phage group. That’s good! It means each of our groups is moving along nicely. The objective of the phage project is to make a library of sizes - the biggest and smallest phage capsids possible using phages that have already been well characterized and approved for medicinal purposes. One group is working on selecting for the largest phage possible, one for the smallest, and another group is developing a method to purify both phages as they are made. Afterwards, we laid out singles of our three E.Coli strains with Lambda prophage incorporated into its genome. Tomorrow Kelton and I are going to go in and check on them after our Intro to Medicine class.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We believe that iGEM strongly contributes in the development of synthetic biology, and have studied how its influence, potential and practice could be expanded . Therefore, we have written an analysis about iGEM with recommendations that can be used by, for example, the iGEM headquarters to optimize the potential of iGEM even more. or example, our complete analysis includes recommendations such as increased external collaborations between teams and the introduction of a biosafety-focused track.
Product analysis
Our project can be transformed into multiple applications. Here we explore and analyse the different potential real-life applications of our developed technologies.
Risk Assessment Tool
While doing the safety analysis of our own project, we took inspiration from the way risks are systematically analysed in other research disciplines. It appears that in many disciplines, such as aerospace engineering and chemically engineering, risk analysis is done in a more standardized manner. Therefore, we have decided to develop and easy safety analysis tool that, we hope, other iGEM teams (or research groups) could use as a standard to evaluate the safety risks associated with their project. We also used the tool ourselves to analyse the potential risks of our own project.
Risk Assessment
Based on the results of our safety analysis, we concluded that our project could carry multiple risks that are important to identify and minimize, before transforming it into real life applications. The risks analysis, for example, showed that the antibiotic resistance of our microorganisms is a potential risk that have to be eliminated before the biolenses are allowed to leave the lab. One possibility to do this, is by sterilizing the biolenses and in that way make the microorganisms inside the biolenses inviable. In this section we have tested tree methods, respectively diffusion limitation, autoclaving and UV-sterilization.
Experts’ Opinion
It is important for us to understand the context of the industries in which our technologies could potentially operate. For that purpose, we decided to meet and discuss with different experts from our field of research, including physicists, experts in the field of imaging techniques or safety. Our conversations helped us improving our project significantly. For example, physicists have helped us to understand the physics behind our project and improve our models therefore, and because uniformity was important for many potential applications with microlenses, we decided to alter the cell shape to spherical.
Business plan
One of the potential applications of our project, is the use of biological micro lenses for the development of novel solar panels. The efficiency of solar panels can be increased by using an encapsulation layer of microlenses which result in more light capturing. We focused on this application to develop an"

Venn Diagram comparing the skills required to operate BSim 2009 and the new GUI
The 2009 edition of BSim was written using an object-oriented programming language called JAVA. This was an excellent tool in which to construct BSim, as it made it very easy to produce agent-based models. However, modelling a specific system in BSim required the user to edit JAVA code.  We envision a future in which BSim is a widely used and accessible modelling framework. To achieve this we needed to create an interface that allows users unfamiliar with JAVA to create simulations in BSim. This would allow BSim to be utilised by the entire synthetic biology community, rather than just specialist modellers.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) -What's new?
Past iGEM projects at BCCS-Bristol required knowledge of JAVA, mathematics and biochemistry. The 2009 edition of BSim relied heavily on the user’s knowledge of all three. By removing the need for JAVA knowledge, we have opened up BSim to a much wider category of users. The GUI only requires users to be able to express their biological system mathematically; it can then translate the user’s description of a system into JAVA code.
Who is the GUI aimed at?
The GUI is primarily aimed at users without any knowledge of JAVA. However, it is also of use to more advanced programmers, as it writes JAVA files that can be further modified using a text editor. This means advanced users can use the GUI to set a simple simulation which can be further tailored to their needs using JAVA. This saves a lot of time, as setting up a new simulation in BSim 2009 could take dozens of lines of code.
Simplifying BSim 2009
The main aims in creating the GUI were to reduce the time and background knowledge required to produce a BSim Simulation.
Creating Simulations in BSim 2009
The figure below shows the process of writing a simulation in the 2009 edition of BSim. All the steps of this process require knowledge of JAVA, and therefore are not accessible to the synthetic biological community in general. Additionally, there are too many steps in the process; slimming down the number of steps will make BSim easier to use.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n"

BALTIMORE BIO-CREW
Bio-Engineering E.Coli To Degrade Plastic and Save The Baltimore Inner Harbor
About Our Project
Plastic pollution is a significant problem that not only affects the environment but human health as well. There have been many implementations created in order to eliminate plastic in the Earth’s waterways, but none of the approaches have been successful in collecting microplastics.
Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic debris that occurs after years of plastic degradation in the environment. They also come from cosmetics and cleansers. Even though microplastics seem like they would cause fewer problems, there are extremely harmful due to the toxins that are still present in these tiny particles of plastic.
In 2014, researchers at Keio University and Kyoto Institute of Technology discovered a bacterium called Ideonella sakaiensis. This bacteria can use the enzymes PETase and MHETase to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is the most common type of plastic debris found in marine environments. Instead of using the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, we inserted the enzymes into K-12 E.coli cells for safety reasons.
The genetically modified bacteria is expected to be able to degrade plastic into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. We are investigating ways in which these monomers could be used as a possible energy source. The Baltimore Bio-Crew intends to use these engineered E.coli, or the enzymes separated from them, in a bioreactor to degrade PET plastic that cannot be recycled; in a laundry filter to degrade synthetic fibers that come off of clothes; or contained inside of a device to degrade plastic in marine environments such as the Inner Harbor.

China_Tongji,2015,Team:China Tongji#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," that we can use pmyo-2 because it expresses specifically in pharyngeal muscle, which may lead worm turning when irradiated by appropriate light.
Pmyo-3: Encodes MHC A, the minor isoform of MHC (myosin heavy chain) that is essential for thick filament formation, and for viability, movement, and embryonic elongation. Expressed in body muscle, the somatic sheath cell covering the hermaphrodite gonad, and also expressed in enteric muscle, vulval muscles of the hermaphrodite and the diagonal muscles of the male tail(from Wormatlas).          We decided to use pmyo-3 to construct a plasmid which can let our ChR2s express in worm’s body muscle which is directly related with worm movements.In this way, we may achieve our purpose.
Pttx-3: Encodes a LIM homeodomain protein required for functions of the interneuron AIY. Expressed at AIY neuron only, in this case the targeted illumination system was used to stimulate AIY only when theworm’s head swung in a particular direction. This work provides new functional evidenceof the chemosensory circuit’s complexity and robustness, and is an example of ‘closed-loop’ optogeneticsstimulation based on behavior.
Pmec-3: Encodes a founding member of the LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, Mec-3) homeodomain family of transcriptional regulators. During C. elegans development, mec-3 activity is required for proper differentiation and maturation of the mechanosensory neurons. Mec-3 is expressed in the mechanosensory neurons(from Wormatlas). We hope that this may make C.elegans move backward when we irradiate the appropriate light.
3.3.2 Q: WHY choose those rhodopsins?
A: For ChR2: (Excitation)
It is the most basic one,and at the same time is the easiest one for us to get. So we choose ChR2 to confirm that our experiment can be completed.
For iC1C2 : (Inhibition)
Activated by brief blue light stimulation at low intensities, remains open in the dark for an extended period of time and gets deactivated by red light. Without the need for continuous light delivery.
For chETA:(Excitation)
(1) Faster deactivation kinetics;
(2) High-fidelity light-driven spiking over sustained trains at least up to 200 Hz;
(3) Reduced multiples and plateau potentials;

7/7/14:  The inoculated UV+pSB1C3 colony #2 was mini prepped. It was poured into a 50mL conical tube, spun down at 3900 for 15 minutes, discarded the supernatant, resuspended the pellet in 25mL PBS, split into four 25mL conical tubes with approximately 5mL in each. Then the protocol ""Plasmid DNA Purification Using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a Microcentrifuge"" was followed for all of them. However, they were accidentally eluted into the tubes with the white pellet that was garbage and shouldn't be used. So, the liquid was taken out. 1mL of P1, 1mL of P2, and 1.4mL of N3 was combined in a separate tube.700uL of this was poured into the four tubes of liquid taken out from the white stuff. Then the procedure was followed again, centrifuging and washing...Each was eluted with 50uL and nanodropped. The results were very poor. So, we inoculated more of it overnight to mini-prep again tomorrow.  The vio operon PCR products were purified and eluted with 30uL. It was nanodropped and the result was 5.5ng/uL with a really high (2.2) 260/280 probably because the PCR wasn't very clean and efficient because the vio operon is so large.  The two colonies of HSP/GFP+pACYC184/pBR322 that were co-transformed with DH5alpha only had one colony, so they were co-transformed again using the NEB 5alpha compotent cells onto two amp/chlor 50ug/mL plates. Their protocol was used. Also, the pBAD ligated into the input backbone (pACYC184) was transformed the same way and put onto chlor50ug/mL plates.     7/8/14:  The inoculated UV+pSB1C3 colony #2 was mini prepped.

Lyme Disease Conference
This year, two members of the Warwick iGEM team attended the annual Lyme Disease Association conference was held at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge University. The theme of the conference was ‘Moving Forward’, and focused on the progress that Lyme disease research has made.
The first speaker was Dr Norma O’Flynn from the National Guideline Centre, who elaborated upon the procedure applied by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, when determining management processes to improve health and social care. She discussed the different factors considered before a policy can be issued, and how this procedure is currently being applied to Lyme disease.
Dr Sandra Pearson, Lyme Disease Action, tackled the issue of Borrelia persistence, followed by Dr Monica Embers, from the Tulane National Primate Research Centre, who had modelled the changes in immune response over the course of infection and post treatment using rhesus macaques. Dr Embers also discussed her research into the challenges of diagnosing and curing Lyme disease. She reviewed the current testing methods for diagnosis – with early serology tests including IFA, ELISA, western blots and PCR, and later stage diagnostics testing for antigens/antibodies in CSF, urine and the blood. Dr Embers identified several issues with the current system - these tests are not specific or sensitive enough to diagnose patients at all phases of the disease, antigenic variability may prevent antibody recognition and western blots have a degree of inaccuracy when detecting the antibodies present. She proposed a more sensitive analysis technique that her team had been developing – a 5-antigen Bioplex assay.
During the afternoon session, Dr Jinyu Shan presented the University of Leicester's alternative diagnosis method – engineering bacteriophages to effectively kill Borrelia by overexpression of holins and endolysins (phage-encoded enzymes). According to Dr Shan, the pilot study indicated the novel diagnostic test had a 75% senstivity and 100% specificity on serum samples as small as 400 µl, as well as being able to distinguish between Lyme and relapsing fever Borrelia strains.
Being able to interact with research specialists, GP’s and actual Lyme disease sufferers was a fantastic opportunity to gauge first-hand the opinions of different demographics in response to our project. We spoke to several researchers investigating epidemiology, novel targets for diagnosis, and new treatments, as well as several patients who had recently finished their course of antibiotics following diagnosis.

This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part in the conference, we shared our ideas and studies in synthetic biology and made a great deal new friends with different backgrounds. We sincerely acknowledge NCHU Taichung for their warm services and we gained a lot through the conference.
2. The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community
This year, we participated into a great party hosted by ShanghaiTech University——Conference of China iGEMer community (also known as CCiC). During this conference, amazing presentations were performed to show out every team’s creative project. In addition, during the panel session, members from each team came up to the stage to share their experience in this iGEM competition, either the happiest one or the most sorrow one. And also we communicated with a lot of teams about every we learnt from iGEM. Last but not least, during the conference, we met iGEM HQ Ms. Lizarazo who was really nice and kind. We had a long conversation about the whole iGEM competition, and we shared many stories about our team, which was an amusing meet-up.
Collaboration with other iGEM teams
1.HUST-China
This year HUST-China’s project is related to Shewanella, which we used in 2017, so they contacted with us for some help. We provide WT Shewanella, plasmid pYYDT, and E.coli wm3040 with them, and we also shared some experimental experience and gave some suggestions to them.
2.Peking
This year we got in touch with team Peking from Peking University during the 5th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer community) and discussed about our projects. After that we kept in close touch, exchanging ideas about project and modelling, which we’ve learnt a lot from each other.
3.Fudan
Team members from team Fudan came to USTC and we had an amusing meet-up. We communicated about our projects and provided advice with each other.

Drylab
Dry lab continued with construction of the box. In addition, fish tags were being printed using high resolution 3D printers.
Policy and Practices
We took the YOURS kids to the Bathe hatchery. We spoke to Bob Sweet who explained how they keep an eye on various conditions in the fish's environment through the use of chemicals. He talked to us about the fish they raise, the types of diseases the fish face such as ferunculosis, and the overall day-to-day things the hatchery has to worry about like maintenance. The YOURS students also learned about how the fish are raised and transported in detail and were allowed to feed the fish. We learned that the hatchery has chosen not to use fish tags and instead clips fish fins to keep track. Sweet’s opinion of the future for the fish/agriculture industry was that the environment would put greater stresses on wild fish and therefore depending on farm-raised fish would be beneficial in supplying the demand for more food in a world with a rising population. We were also directed to speak to Andy Norse at Rome Hatchery who was more aware of chemicals used to treat water to prevent diseases, and we followed up with a call on Monday to plan a Skype meeting with Andy.
On Saturday, Grace and Saie went to the local Ithaca’s Farmer’s Market to find locals with opinions about GMOs and fish farming for our Humans and SynBio Facebook page.

Since our project is based on ontogenetic tools to manipulate the neuron activity, we submit five basic parts which are essential for achieving our goals. This collection provides several parts which are used as promoter in certain neuron, light sensor, activation indicator and location reporter.
One of important constructed plasmid is Pord-10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry. Part BBa_K2492004 (Podr-10)provides an neuron AWA specific promoter which drives channelrhodopsins and calcium indicator specifically expressed in AWA. Part BBa_K2492001(CoChR) provides channelrodopsin(CoChR), which serves as a light switch. In order an part to manipulate neuron activity through ~470nm excitation light, we choose this part, which is benefit for sensitive to blue light. BBa_K2492003(GEM-GECO) is an calcium ions indicator part, it provides the function of monitoring and responding to the concentration of calcium ions. This part provides us with more direct visualisation of neuron activity. Part BBa_K2492002 codes mCherry, which indicates the position of neuron AWA. This fluorescence reporter direct reveals the position of transgenic neurons and roughly estimate the expression level of injected plasmids. Part BBa"

Q1: Is it better to export a graph following SBGN standard?
A1: Currently, we are working on it. The basic drag-drop function has been accomplished in our software of current version. In the near future, we will complete this function.
Q2: Can you export the robustness analysis along with the SBML model in one sheet?
A2: It is not easy to implement such information in a single SBML file. In current version, we can realize a robustness analysis by importing a SBML file which two sheets will be generated. In next version, we will try to incorporate such information to a general form. With such change, there is also a need to modify libSBML as a result.
Database
Q1: Does the database contain too little biobricks?
A1: Since the concept of standard components that contain enough information is relatively new in synthetic biology. The acquisition to the information is rather difficult for us because we have to learn each bricks in detail. In the current version, we construct one that is suitable for our illustrative examples as well as our USTC wet team’s new submitted biobricks. A relatively “full” database needs collaborations of different teams who should submit information of the same format.
Q2: Is the search algorithm fast enough for the database?
A2: For lager database, searching algorithm is quite important. It is also an open problem in computer science. To our extent, we seek collaborations inside or outside our campus.
Q3: How do you manage these data efficiently?
A3: To manage a large database, manage software is needed. Luckily, Berkeley tools team are focusing on this problem. We may talk some with them during the competition.
Q4: Is it too difficult to obtain the kinetic parameters and reaction type?
A4: Firstly, in the next version, we will make a web server that makes our database open access. Then users can freely update the database by submitting the data in a general form. Secondly, we can also apply a text mining technique to get detailed information for published papers.
Link to SBW
Q1: Why not incorporate SBW in this software to make it more powerful？
A1: As SBML has become a standard description format for modeling a biological system. Considering the output of our design obeys this standard, a combination with SBW tools such as cell designer should be incorporated in our software for analysis and simulation purpose. We have left a button “SBW” and have written the interface template in our software.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," name, is the large simulation!) is inoculated with 8.2e4 bacteria that grow over the course of 15 hours to become 5.1e8. They achieve quorum sensing at 20 hours, after filling a 5mL agar disk with 1.6pmol AHL (see video ). This is a huge amount in comparison to the previous simulation.
Conclusions
A comparison between the two simulations at 5mL volumes is telling. The growth curve is the same in both by design: same inoculations, same growth rates and same final populations. In the surface growth case however, as AHL diffuses slowly from the bacteria to the rest of the agar plate, it has the chance to achieve higher local concentrations. That’s why quorum sensing is achieved at 20 hours, versus 41 for the spatial equilibrium model.
This observation has significant repercussions on the applicability of our project. Bacteria that manage to colonize a solid surface seem to have a much higher probability of achieving quorum sensing under conditions of competitive growth, where their total population size will be limited by resource availability, such as in the colon. Of even greater practical importance, it shows that transfections to monolayers of Caco-2 cells in the lab, which we use as a cancer model, by quorum sensing bacteria have a reasonable chance of success.
The simulations were designed in this way to allow for easy experimental validation. Unfortunately, material shortages prevented the realization of the suggested experiments and the experimental validation of our model is deferred.
Figure 13 left: The geometry of the first simulation on the tiny agar disk with the bacterial colony fully grown. On the left is the disk’s axis and on the right is the rim. The bacteria sit on the disk’s surface.
Figure 13 right: Geometry for the second simulation. Notice the much larger agar disk. The large scale difference makes the bacteria invisible at this zooms. Their position can be inferred by the fine mesh around them.
Figure 14: Quorum sensing is achieved by an E. Coli bacterium, part of a colony growing on a tiny agar plate at 11 hours. This bacterium was created at 3 hours and lived until the end. Because of its central position, it is the first bacterium in the colony to transition into quorum sensing.
