To make a workable prototype of the PowerLeaf, proper engineering of the hardware is necessary. This includes elements such as anodes, chambers, circulation of important nutrients, removal of wastes, and the use of appropriate materials. We worked out the optimal type of plastic for the system with the help of a local expert. You can read about our work regarding the plastic here .

Just like in the movies, you only get to meet the brilliant minds behind the project in the closing credits. Some might leave the cinema without sitting through the credits, but we hope you will sit through ours, as you will get to know us on a more personal level. We probably have more in common than you think. And do not forget that behind every great team is an equally great amount of external attributions . The contributors have supported and inspired us, especially when things have been rough and deadlines closeby. When you finish this section, we kindly ask that you turn your attention to our various collaborations , all of which have been amazing experiences. They truly show of that wonderful iGEM spirit!
Finally, we do not want you to miss out on the ‘after-the-credits-clip’ that summarises the fun we had during this fantastic iGEM adventure. This is will be the moment you will get that long-awaited ‘thank you for listening, we hope you enjoyed our wiki and project’.
Team
Welcome to the team page! Here you will get to know us on a more personal level. Our team is made up by 12 students from 8 very different majors. As friends, we experienced the most amazing summer together, filled with various fun activities, both in- and outside the lab. We would like to mention a few. We had road trips, dinners, Game of Thrones nights, heck, we even celebrated Christmas in July! All of this was shared with our amazing supervisors, to whom we are truly grateful.

ACHIEVEMENTS
In this part, we listed our achievements. Some of them may seem kinda meaningless, but that’s how we built this project step by step!
We have summoned all the geniuses at school and started the project.
We have registered our team and also had a great summer .
We started all the lab work in a wetlab, all the modeling work in a computer lab and we slept in a bed! (most of the time, at least).
Meanwhile we have explored the humanity value of our project.
We have explored safety implications by interviewing a professor of biosafety and integrated this by designing a system working with dead bacteria.
We have submitted 5 documented parts to the registry : The first two are from 2011 Lyon-INSA-ENS Team. The rest are from this year's work, of course with the full BioBrick prefix and suffix so that you can have fun with them later.
We have improved the characterization of an existing part (curli promoter from 2010).
We have completed the judging form in order to be sure to complete all the requirements for a gold medal.
We have made a wiki and a poster for our team.
We worked over and over on the presentation for the Jamboree.
We made several collaborations , but we mainly helped the Paris Saclay team to make a mould for their project.
We finished the wiki way before the deadline : Easy wiki !

Key Resources
It is important that we patent our product to ensure the exclusive right to produce and sell it. The intellectual resources are therefore the most important key resources of the company. The patent will be associated with specific knowledge and expertise that is present within the company. Therefore, human resources are important for the company as well. Finally, the production capacity of the company is a form of physical resource that will make the company unique.
Value Proposition
The biological microlens is an extremely small lens that can be used to increase the efficiency of among other things solar panels. In contrast to regular chemically produced MLAs, our MLAs are environmentally friendly produced and eventually they will probably also be cheaper. Therefore, the main value of proposition of our company is the fact that with our product the efficiency of the solar panels of our customers will be improved with an environmental friendly and affordable method.
Customer Relationships
We will focus on creating a long-term relationship with our customers. Both parties have to adapt their production pathway to each other. Therefore, we expect that there will be a mutual dependency for a long period. If we become a licensor this will also result in a long term relationship. After all, the external party will have to build their own production facilities and they will have to produce the MLAs for a long period in order to return their investment.
Eventually, we want to be known by our customers as a longtime partner that delivers high quality products. Since our company is a business to business company, we probably will have a limited number of customers and personal attention will be a key factor to  our company therefore.
Channels
Our company will be a typical business to business company and  there will only be business to business sales (B2B sales). It is expected that there is no interference of an external party such as a retailer. However, when our product will be sold to foreign companies, especially when those companies are located in a country far away from us, it is possible that we need a partnership with an intermediate party to make the distribution logistically possible and efficient.
Customer Segments
We expect that the main customers are solar panel manufactures. Their main goal is to produce efficient and affordable solar panels. However, in practice the efficiency of solar panels is still relatively low. With our MLAs the efficiency of the solar panels will be increased, which make our product useful for them.  There are several different types of relationships we can have with the customers. First of all, it is possible to have a buyer-supplier relationship. It is, for example,  also possible to have a licensor/licensee relation."

Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:
State of system has changed to 'TetR' state from 'LacI' state after adding inducer IPTG at 40000s.
The legend used in the figure is not clear. 13:DNA;(lacI153)4, 11:DNA;(tetR154)2, and 14:DNA;(lacI153)4;(tetR154)2 means binding products of initial plasmid with lacI tetramer at site pLacI gene, with tetR dimer at site pTet gene, and with lacI tetramer and tetR dimer both, respectively. At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually. Details of modeling is available here .
Modeling Details of Toggle Switch
Modeling Details of Toggle Switch
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," implying that the decrease in free RelE is rather slow. It is therefore not only the amount of free RelE that determines the activation time, but also whether the amount of dissociating complexes is high enough to counter the RelB production. Hence, it has no relevance to further test high RelE production in this model, as a high number of complexes will easily be achieved.
Light Sensitivity
One thing the model does not include, is the actual sensitivity to light. Out in the open, the amount of light is rarely an on/off switch, which means there will be periods with varying degrees of activation. Since the bacteria should be active during overcast days, the system requires a threshold, both in the sensitivity of the light-regulated promoter, but also in the activation of the toxin-antitoxin system. Variation of light is implicitly modelled through variation in promoter strength, for instance a half probability of activation translates roughly to a half production rate in the individual bacteria. Because of this, it is important not only to find functioning configurations, but also to investigate the closely related configurations, so that the bacteria neither lay dormant at overcast days, nor make the dormancy system obsolete in moonlight.

Approach
In 2004 the Austen and UCSF iGEM team created a device sensitive to light, laying the foundation for the Coliroid project . In this project, the system is combined with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system in the endeavour to mediate light-dependent dormancy in bacteria. As tight regulation is required for the RelE-RelB system Tashiro Y, Kawata K, Taniuchi A, Kakinuma K, May T, Okabe S. RelE-Mediated Dormancy Is Enhanced at High Cell Density in Escherichia coli. J Bacteriol. 2012;194(5):1169-76. , modelling of the toxin-antitoxin system is essential. The impact of different RelE-RelB expression levels was simulated by modelling. Using the results obtained by this modelling, a hypothetical working system-design was devised.
On basis of the modulated system, the potential of different vectors and promoters in various combinations was tested. This constitutes the foundation for how the design of the light-dependent dormancy system in E. coli has been optimised, and the final approach shaped. Ultimately, the light-dependent dormancy system, which is illustrated in Figure 3, was composed of the following parts:

Huge lack of well-characterized biological parts.
Hard to predict multiple part biological circuits.
The lack of knowledge about sequence to function relationship, which hinders the development of novel synthetic biological parts.
Biological circuit testing is complicated and extremely time consuming
Close
Week 5
We have further discussed the current issues we have outlined during the last meeting.
More
In the end, the lack of well described biological parts and the insufficient knowledge about the biomolecular sequence to function relationship seemed like the 2 most pressing problems to solve right now. That is because basic parts are the core of synthetic biology, and if we cannot understand how the separate elements work or cannot engineer completely novel parts for our needs, it is, and will continue to be difficult task to create complex, yet useful systems that we dream synthetic biology can achieve.
Close
Week 6
We have agreed to initially investigate what are the current state of the art methods for characterization of biological part sequence to function relationships.              This was done in order for us to understand if our system should be based on already existing technology foundations or constructed fully from scratch.
Week 7
As we have narrowed down the problem we wanted to solve, we have then determined the stakeholders that would enable us to solve these problems as efficient as possible and that could help us reflect how our designed solutions would affect the world.

Stakeholders Of CAT-Seq
1. Life Sciences Center in Vilnius - one of the main collaborative research facilities in Lithuania, where academics from all over the Lithuania, and also the world, come together to solve various fundamental and engineering problems. We see LSC as an important stakeholder, as it can immensely influence our project in terms of helping us to forecast the right solutions to problems we are trying to solve.
2. Droplet Genomics - a startup based in Lithuania specializing in droplet microfluidics and single cell research. People at droplet genomics (DG) are worldwide experts in high-throughput research using microtechnologies. As we want to innovate the throughput and precision of part characterization even further, there was no better place to start then at the company which performs state of the art high-throughput research.
3. Thermo Fisher Scientific -  Thermo Fisher’s R&D sector has a long history of working with directed evolution and protein engineering. We are extremely interested in navigating the space of sequence to function relationship, therefore we wanted to establish a line of communication with Thermofisher, in order for them to share their experience and help us"

I have a PhD from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and MSc degrees from the University of Houston, Texas and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am an Associate Professor in the Centre for Bioengineering Research & Education and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a few years ago that the modeling methods used in this research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the fourth time I am involved as one of the facilitators for a U of C iGEM team.

I am a Plant Cell Biology Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. I completed a PhD in Genetics at the University of Alberta and spent a few years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University. My main research focus is on the study of subcellular dynamics, however, this past year my research group initiated a project on the identification of plant genes that are important in the reclamation of tailings ponds. As an iGEM rookie myself, it’s exciting to see a group of students with diverse backgrounds come together and use their individual expertise to approach an important environmental problem.

Background
Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration by reversibly switching to an ametabolic state. This ability is called anhydrobiosis. [1] Tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation olerance. [2] In 2012, Takekazu Kunieda and his team identified five abundant heat-soluble proteins in the tardigrades, which can prevent protein-aggregation in dehydrated conditions in other anhydrobiotic organisms. [1]
In 2017, Thomas C. Boothby and his team segregated three TDP proteins in the water bears and explored their mechanism of action. [3] This is a schematic diagram of the mechanism they have done so far. At the same time, one of the 2017 iGEM teams TUDelft , attempted to preserve the Cas"

Protocols
Extraction of root exudates
Procedure
Seeds of 4 crops were obtained as specimen.
Rice
Soybean
Tomato
Wheat
The seeds were sterilised by rinsing them with Ethanol a few times.
Common garden soil was collected, and sterilised in autoclave to avoid any outside contamination while collection of exudates.
Glass jars were filled upto quarter the volume with sterilised soil.
Sterilised seeds were sown in the jars, (4 jars per crop) and the crops were grown in clean room for 3 weeks.
When the height of crops was sufficient after 3 weeks, the crops were uprooted carefully and soil was mixed with GC (Gas Chromatography) grade water.
After incubating the mixture for 30 minutes, to allow all the exudates to be dissolved in water, the solution was filtered.
Filtered solution was evaporated in rotary evaporator. Vacuum was maintained to allow the evaporation at lower temperature as some of the exudates might be temperature sensitive.

In the LB medium, selection was carried out by the addition of 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 30 µg/mL kanamycin, or 50 µg/mL ampicillin, depending on the resistance, and for M9 minimal medium, the concentrations used were 60 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 60 µg/mL kanamycin, and 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Excitation of RFP was at 561 nm, and emission was measured around 580 nm. Expression levels in both E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 ΔompR were studied to determine the baseline of the leaky expression not influenced by intrinsic pathways including the OmpR transcription factor.
Figure 18. Flow cytometric fluorescence measurements in arbitrary units as a function of time. Left: Cultures were grown in LB medium. Right: Cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. Fluorescence of RFP expressed by the the OmpR-regulated promoter on the high copy vector, pSB1C3, and the low copy vector, pSB3K3, in MG1655 WT and ΔompR MG1655 strain. All fluorescence levels were measured relative to the negative control WT E. coli MG1655, and the weak and strong constitutive promoters are included as references. Standard error of mean is shown, but are in several cases indistinguishable from the graph.
Fluorescence levels in the two different media display similar behavior, as seen in Figure 18. The main difference observed, was that the decrease in fluorescence over time was faster in LB medium than in M9 minimal medium, in concordance with the observations made in previous experiments. On a general level, the data revealed, that MG1655 cloned with the POmpR-RFP reporter system on the high copy vector exhibited a fluorescence level, equivalent to that mediated by the strong constitutive promoter. On the low copy vector, the POmpR-RFP reporter system yielded a fluorescence level comparable to the gene expression mediated by the weak constitutive promoter. On the other hand, expression levels in the MG1655 ΔompR strain were markedly reduced compared to MG1655, indicating that pathways including the transcription factor OmpR interfere with RFP expression under these conditions. Again, the fluorescence levels observed for the PO"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

4.5  T7 Phage Viability Test
I. Purpose
- To determine if our phage are viable
- Practice phage titering and other experimental techniques
II. Expercted Results
- We hope to see plaques in a lawn of E. coli (confluent growth).  This would indicate where phage replicated, lysed bacteria, and are viable.
III. Protocol
- We filled 5 test tubes with 90 microliters of LB each.
- We added 10 microliters of T7 4104 to the first test tube and then mixed.
- We created a dilution series by taking 10 microliters of the first tubes mixed solution and added it to tube 2, and followed the same procedure for each test tube down the line to tube 5.
- We combined 10mL LB, 10mL top agar, and 2mL E. Coli BL21 in a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube.  We plated 5mL of this onto 3 plates.
- Wait for top agar (containing E. coli BL21) to solidify before proceeding to spot test.
- Divide each plate into 6 sections, labeled 0-5. Spot 5μL of liquid from each vial unto different sections of the plate. Vial and section should correspond in number.
- Two plates were used as control
- Agar control: 1:1 top agar/LB -> 5mL plated. This is to make sure that top agar and LB"

We enumerate the functions of Csy4 from six parts--Immune, Secretion, Transport, Constitute, Recognition and Catalyze. Our game < Csy4 GO!> is based on these six parts. When we start the game, there will be six situations for players to choose, each situation includes one interesting story.
You can download our windows version game.
Then the players can control Csy4 to cleave RNA chain in the right order and right place. The player's operation simulates the process of Csy4 protecting host from external damages. In that way players can not only enjoy our game < Csy4 GO!> but also learn about some functions of Csy4. Once the game starting, RNA chain will roll with the background at a certain speed, so the players should move fast enough to make sure Csy4 won't be touched by the top of screen.
Fig.19 The logo of < Csy4 GO!>.
3.2 Purpose of our game
As is known to us, the mechanism of endonuclease Csy4 in microorganisms is difficult to observe with our eyes straightly. But now < Csy4 GO!> solves this problem successfully. The game presents a microscopic view of the world with a more vivid picture. In this way, we can tell the story of Csy4 as well as the CRIPSR system to more amateurish people, thus achieving the goals of propagandizing our project and synthetic biology.
3.3 The designing process of our game
3.3.1 The game started:
At first, we planned two game blueprints. The first is to control Csy4 to specifically cut RNA, which can explain the principle of Csy4. To make the game more interesting, we created the second one. The second is to control Csy4 moving on the RNA chain. To get the destination, they need to cleave on the certain site and keep falling.
Fig.20 The background of < Csy4 GO!>.
Having discussed in our team, we created the general design of our game. Given that no professional programmer in our team can take charge of this work, we asked Mingjie Shen for help, who has the experiences of programming mini-games .  In our first blueprint, we characterized Csy4 the ability of cleaving the RNA by recognizing certain three base sites instead of cleaving RNA by recognizing the hairpin.
Once the game started, there will be some golden coins suspending on the screen, and several kinds of RNA structures"

PMA Biosensor
Scroll down to read more
Banned drugs are unregulated and can contain various contaminants and cutting agents. The past several years have seen a rise in the use of MDMA, more commonly known as ecstasy. During the production of MDMA, either MDMA or PMA will be produced1. PMA is pharmacologically very similar to MDMA, however it is far more toxic to the human body2. Professor David Nutt suggested we should focus on the detection of PMA  after there was a spate of deaths attributed to PMA.
PMA and MDMA have very similar chemical structures, with one key difference. PMA contains a primary amine group, rather than a secondary amine as is the case in  MDMA. Monoamine oxidase A can differentiate between the two as it is specific for primary amines3. Monoamine oxidase A is a copper/topaquinone containing enzyme and will convert primary monoamines to their corresponding aldehydes4. This reaction also results in the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide, which is crucial to the detection element of our biosensor.
When a reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide is coupled with horseradish peroxidase and Amplex red dye, resorufin is produced which has a red colour5. The colour can be detected by eye, but for accuracy, the fluorescence can be measured at 585 nm. The appearance of this red colour will show if PMA is present in a binary way.
For our biosensor, it was essential to experimentally determine the optimal amount of laccase and ABTS to freeze-dry onto the paper, Monoamine oxidase A is encoded by the structural gene MaoA. It was isolated from Klebsiella pneuomiae6 and the sequence was codon optimized for E. coli. The illegal RFC25 restriction sites were taken out and the RFC25 prefix and suffix sequences were added.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2010,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#result_-_-_TEXT.html,", we find the blue points which represent cell nuclears are surrounded by green outer covering under Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Leica), as shown below. After reading the paper published by Stanford on Nature Neuroscience in 2005 (Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity), we could tell the green-labeled membrane has ChR2-eYFP embedded in.
Conclusion: From the photo, we can be sure that ChR2 is expressed in 293T cell and more importantly, it has its correct position in the membrane, which is an essential precondition for its function. At this point, we proved the structural correctness of ChR2.
Function of ChR2 by RT-PCR
Back to top ↑
Idea: Since ChR2 could be expressed structural correctively in another kind of cell, we start to seek for the answer of whether it could work normally as in neurons. As ChR2 could initiate calcium influx, we could test its function by examining the transcription level of some certain genes which are sensitive to the change of Ca2+ concentration. Luckily, we found Zif268, a gene in Mouse Genome, and it would be up-regulated when meeting with an increase of Ca2+. On the other hand, we found discontinuous illumination is better for ChR2’s penetration for cations, while continuous illumination could cause inactivation of ChR2.
Method: We cultured ECHO cells in 35mm-plates and the medium is composed by Ham’s/F12, 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 0.25% Zeocin. After 24 hours, we transfected ECHO cells with pcDNA3.1, the same as above, containing ChR2-eYFP, and we wrapped the plates with foil. 24h after transfection, we carried the plates into darkroom for later experiments. We used a red light source to provide enough light for us to see and blue light pulses (around 460nm) are used to illuminate the cells. Since the blue light source is continuous, we got light pulses by pressing the switch button in a given rhythm. We tested different timescale to see the change of Zif268 transcription level. Besides the semi-quantitative measurement, we later led Realtime PCR to test quantitatively.
Result: According to the different conditions of experimental and control groups, we could see that RNA extraction was successful. From the RT-PCR results, we know the cells transfected by ChR2-eYFP (pcDNA3.1"

Although antivenom treatments are prefered, they comes with their own risks and can cause their own health complications.
Issues with antivenom treatment
There are many issues with the antivenom treatment: We mainly address the inferior products on the market causing side-reactions and the inadequate dosing of the antivenoms.
There are risks associated with antivenom treatment, and these risks should always be balanced against the side effects that can come with them.
Factors such as the specificity and dose should be kept in mind. This is mainly due to the anaphylactic reactions that the patient can suffer from. These symptoms are so far treated with epinephrine, antihistamines, or other ancillaries, with the aim to reduce immunogenic reactions to the antivenom. There should be no doubt, however, that proper and specific antivenom treatment remains the most effective treatment course of envenoming in order to keep the patient alive.
How the snake envenoming detection device will fit into current treatment course:
- Rapid identification of snake species will give valuable insight into the proper course of treatment
- The earlier the treatment can be applied the better
- Exclude dry bites (false positives from skin punctures)
- In field and rural clinic use
- Smartphone compatible [8]

The responsibilities we have for each other vary from the routine simple tasks to the more complicated. However, regardless of how thoughtout the action is, how much good it does can only be judged by the people effected by it.                     In order to be aware of how our project effects the world we have output several events that would help us see from others perspectives. Eventhough, we have not only creatively and carefully planned our actions and what we have reflected to the public, we have also changed the workflow of our own project from what they have mirrored to us.                                     Below, you can have more information on the thoughful approaches we have established while exploring how the importance of our project should be executed along with how it should be improved for the better of the world.
Survey
We conducted a survey on digital platforms to gather more data that could be beneficial for our project and our future HP events; with the attendance of 582 people in total, 519 of whom are from our country.                   Firstly, we started our survey with a question to see the education levels of attendees and have seen that they 73% of the participants were university graduates.
Figure 1: Demonstration of attendees’ education levels.
Our findings showed that 74% percent of the participants owns a car. 30% percent stated that their car ran on petrol, and 34% said that their cars ran on diesel.
Figure 2: Demonstration showing what kind of fuel the attendees’ cars run on.
99% of all of the people that answered our survey stated that they were concerned about the future of Earth; considering the pollution caused by fossil fuels and a shocking 99% percent said that they would rather use eco-friendly fuels even though they may be more expensive. This shows how much people are ready to make a change for a better future.

Introduction
To reach our goal – real-time detection and identification of drug-resistance bacterial strains, we have proposed two ways to fulfill it. First, enhance the ability to sense quorum sensing molecules at low concentration. In other words, detect bacteria earlier, and shorten the time on culturing. Second, accelerating the speed of downstream response after our QS array is turned on, thus we could get the result as soon as possible.
We have designed two kinds of circuits based on the ways mentioned early. One contains a positive-feedback loop, while the other works on a negative-regulation mechanism. We also made basic circuits without any feedback, as the comparison of our designs.
It was said by team Northwestern, 2011 that if the reporter region was put inferior in the circuit, the response would not be obvious enough to detect. However, theoretically speaking, this seems unreasonable. Due to curiosity, most of our circuits were made in two forms, with the reporter putting either forward or afterward, in order to reproduce the phenomenon and try to explain it.
We’ll make detailed description of our designs below.
Fundamental circuit
Similar to Bba_K575024 and Bba_K575033 from team Northwestern, 2011, the basic design is a double-level devise. It contains a constitutive expression quorum sensing receptor, and a reporter regulated by QS regulated promoter.
Fundamental circuit
Once the specific AHL molecule binds on the receptor, the complex will activate its corresponding promoter. At this time, fluorescent protein"

DHA engineering yeast
Abstract
Unsaturated fatty acids
Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. (Pairs of carbon atoms connected by double bonds can be saturated by adding hydrogen atoms to them, converting the double bonds to single bonds. Therefore, the double bonds are called unsaturated.)
The two carbon atoms in the chain that are bound next to either side of the double bond can occur in a cis or trans configuration.
Traditional origin
A.Deep sea fish oil
This is the major source of PUFAs. The disadvantages include complex purification processes and limited resources.
B.Marine microalgae
This is the original source of the PUFAs. The disadvantages are low productivity and unstability output.
The synthesis path of PUFAs
In our project, we use EPA and ARA as substrates to produce DHA and DPA.
Technical route
Thraustochytrids and Isochrysis galbana as materials is used for producing DHA and DPA in yeast in order to provide research materials and scientific data.

How to find the biobricks
Traditional Method:
Its origin is the Database. However, like our strain T-roseum ATCC28210 which was not sequenced yet, we could not get the biobricks.

Junior | Financial Coordinator and Treasurer / Wet Lab / Team Social Media Goddess | Major: Biology
Maddie is a Minnesotan girl in a St. Louis world. She is studying biology and plans to pursue a PhD in pathology after graduating from WashU. In addition to iGEM, Maddie is a member of the executive board for the student theater group Cast n' Crew, a volunteer with Studio: TESLA, and a member of Alpha Omicron Pi. Additionally, she would like to note that according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

Human Practices (Silver)
With Domilox being a safety switch for genetic containment, our human practices also focus on the different aspects of    genetic containment strategies and biosafety through the interaction with different stakeholders.
Here is how we have emphasize biosafety and our project safety in each Human Practice activities:
1. Hong Kong Summer Science Party (Every Sunday: 23/07 - 20/08)
Being the first human practice event in the public, the Science party serves its purpose for us to test out what the public thinks about synthetic biology. During the workshop for children, parents get time to have thorough chat with some of the team members. For a lot of the adults, they feel unable to relate to Genetic modified organisms for research purposes. However, when it comes to topics like genetic modified crops as food sources, people usually have negative views towards it. We took this opportunity to introduce our project while suggesting different situations in which the project will be useful.
With our Domilox safety switch, we try to promote that there could be a safe way to handle GMOs so that it does not have to be something that people fear.
We have received positive feedbacks, such as faith that our project could overcome some of the safety issues affiliated with GMOs. On the other hand, we also received some interesting arguments towards our project. For example, some still consider the method of phenotypically reverting the organism back to its original state to be an artificial method, thus it still has significant safety concerns.
Other results from the dialogue with science party audiences can be found here
2. Interview with Experts
Prof. Terence Lau, Vice President of Hong Kong Biotechnology Organisation
Prof. Mathew Bennett, Associate Professor of BioScience at the Rice University
Current regulations of synthetic biology and genetic modified organisms in different areas has been discussed to verify    the safety of our project. At the same time, other possible methods for project development had also been discussed to    get the best possible design in which will be easy"

iGEM Brazilian Team
Universidade de São Paulo and Universidade Estadual Paulista
Our team is composed of 14 members from different backgrounds, including undergraduate (11) and graduate (3) students from two of the biggest universities in Brazil - USP (Universidade de São Paulo) and UNESP (Universidade Estadual Paulista ""Júlio de Mesquita Filho""). It is supported by 4 instructors and 4 advisors.
We think that being in a laboratory, designing and developing a project in the biology synthetic field turns out to be an open-minded experience due to the contact with others areas besides Biology, such as Physics and Math. It enables students to break boundaries between areas and gather new concepts of different domains in science.
About iGEM
The iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is the largest synthetic biology competition in the world, which occurs every year at MIT. It came out as a one-month during course at MIT in 2003, in which students had to come up with new biological systems. In the following year it turned into a summer competition with 5 teams. After 2004 the competition grew internationally and up to now 193 teams are subscribed for the 2012 iGEM competition.
To the inscribed teams is given a kit of biological parts, also called BioBricks, the teams can create genetic machines by putting BioBricks together and operate it on living cells."

Yeast cells were grown and transformed with help of Daniel Solis Escalante. The cells where transformed with the gel purified Gpa1 knock-out DNA. After 2 days 3 colonies where seen and the colonies where grown in deficient media.
Week 28
Mark was at a festival here, so it was a bit more quiet in the lab.
Week 29
We got microscopy training! Mark, Sietske, Lizah, Eftychia, Marcel, Yifan and Menno were there! Daniel Lam was kind to show us around in the microscopy section of the Nanotechnology building of the university. There we performed a shmoo test (adding alpha factor in a yeast environment), but due to long waiting times the yeast cells didn’t seem shmoo-ish. The I7-receptor was ligated into the IDT vector which had a constitutive promoter (GPD) and terminator. We performed a few rounds of PCR on the yeast knock-out colonies. To see whether our method of preparing was correct we checked also with EukIF and Euk563 primers. This led to a positive result. Varying annealing conditions didn’t lead to results.
Week 30
The colonies of the knock-out where checked again using PCR on the yeast colonies. After a few rounds bands where seen as expected. For this to occur we had to extract the genomic DNA first by beading. We stored the Mat a  –gpa1 –fus1 strain. We further experimented with PCR condition to make an ATF1 and GPA1 knockout cassette (to complete the universal platform study). Also we cloned the banana receptor in the pRS415 vector, but no insert was seen. Because we concluded it is hard to distinguish between a single and double cut (very close together when put on a gel for extraction), we took one positive colony (with insert) and use that as template for further cloning.
Week 31
Mark was at Berlin and Warsaw here, so it was a bit more quiet in the lab.
Week 32
A banana receptor and HKUST I7-olf10 transformed yeast cells were checked on presence of plasmid by PCR on the yeast colonies. This led to positive results. To continue we performed a transformation with the niacin receptor, another banana receptor in –far1 knockout yeast and a wildtype strain. To get a nice representation and conclusion of our knockout strain –far1, -gpa1 we’ve performed a PCR using genomic DNA of the yeast. Further"

①We cultivated the gene-modified green algae in blue light ( The wave length is about 450 nm) and induced the expression of relevant miRNA. When they reached logarithm stage, we measured hydrogen production.
②We also cultivated the gene-modified green algae in the condition lacking in blue light.
When the green algae reached logarithm stage, we used blue light, whose wave length is about 450 nm, to induce the expression of the relevant miRNA and increase hydrogen production. First we used blue light to induce the expression of miRNA and measured hydrogen production every 4 hours. After 8 hours, we re-cultivated the green algae in red light. After 16 hours, again we used blue light to induce the expression of miRNA and measured hydrogen production every 4 hours for 12 hours.In order to proof the efficiency for the light-mediated expression system.

A feature of living cells is the interaction with the environment. It is difficult to assess the impact such interaction for the environment is as expected.
Furthermore, it has to be noted that currently it is possible to manipulate and utilize unicellular organisms, however in the future it is also conceivable to engineer higher organisms. The designation of ""living machines"" then abates these creatures to their pure function.
The concept of ""living"" and ""non-living"" organisms create a hybrid of both and does not answer which properties apply to these exactly. This might implicate associations about properties and facts which do not match the actual conditions in these organism. Furthermore the linguistic imprecision could have an effect on future ethical debates since it can open up possibilities for interpretation.
This has, under the assumption of a future ""minimal cell"" the result of changing perspective on life itself. The clear distinction between animate and inanimate is repealed, life as a laboratory adjustable process is demystified.
Artificial or artificially generated
The “artificial cell“
An often used term in synthetic biology besides ""living machines"" is ""artificial cell"" or ""synthetic cell"". Both terms mean artificial, constructed, pseudo and pose as the opposite of ""natural"" (Oxford dictionary).
It should be noted what is exactly characterize as an ""artificial"" cell, as the term has no clear semantic boundaries. The laboratory-designed organisms are made as well as natural cells of organic material and have cellular structures. “Natural"" cell carry the DNA or RNA necessary for reproduction, evolution, and metabolism information as well as the “artificial cell”.
The artificiality of the cells lies precisely in the laboratory completed synthetic production method, which is why they can be labeled as ""genetic artificiality"" (Birnbacher 2006).
The ambiguous and imprecise formulation can lead, as much as the phrase ""living machine"" to ethical problems. It is indicated that the synthetic modified organisms differentiate from ""natural"" organisms and are in contrast ""unnatural"". Splitting organisms in these two groups leads to an apparent dissection of the concept of life, even though both are ""natural.""
Again, as with the distinction between ""living"" and ""non-living"" this leads the division between ""natural"" and ""artificial"" to an altered prospect on life and a problematic classification and grading of the unit life (Boldt / Müller 2009 ).
Conclusion
Thinking ahead, the possibilities of creating new organisms through manipulation, reduction and modularization leads to man as a kind of ""Creator"". This"

The SDS-PAGE of the purified HUHF showed intense bands at about 25 kDa, fitting to the theoretical molecular weight of HUHF of 24.087 kDa. To ensure the identity of the HUHF the band was cut out of the SDS-PAGE and prepared for matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation with time of flight analysis (MALDI-TOF) measurements. These show distinctive peaks for the HUHF. In addition, tandem mass spectrometry measurements show peptides specific for HUHF, thereby confirming HUHF expression as well as a successful purification workflow. Besides, measurements reveal that the HUHF has been expressed.
Figure 5: Results of MALDI-TOF measurements. The peptide fragments show a recognizable pattern for the HUHF.
In Figure 5 the specific peptide fragments pattern of the HUHF can be seen. The samples were digested with trypsin prior MALDI-TOF . Per tandem mass spectrometry the peak with the m/z = 1345.649 was further examined (Figure 6).Thus, all results confirm that the measured sample contains HUHF.
Figure 6: Results of the tandem mass spectrometry of the peak 1345 of HUHF.
The purified HUHF was used to produce gold and silver nanoparticles. Therefore, HUHF samples were prepared by removing the ferritin bound Fe3+ ions. By applying the iron removement protocol , the Fe3+ ions have been reduced to Fe2+ ions. After the iron ions were removed, AuHCl4 and AgNO3 solutions were added as stated in the ( gold and silver ) protocols. The HUHF with the AuHCl4 solution was incubated for 1.5 hours whereas the AgNO3 solution was incubated for 18 hours while being illuminated by a 60 watts lamp. Afterwards the samples were centrifuged (10.000 g, 10 min) and further purified with a 100 kDa protein columns to remove denaturated HUHF. For demonstration of nanoparticle formation and determination of nanoparticle composition the samples were examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Analysis workflow: The TEM images of the nanoparticles were automatically analyzed in ImageJ. The particles were separated from the background by k-means clustering. Afterwards touching particles were segmented by watershed segmentation. The processed"

Finally, Professor Julian Tanner of the HKU School of Biomedical Sciences gave us an encouraging speech and a summary to all the participants. All these were valuable and useful to our project. We were much clear about the project objectives and also learnt more about the importance of the gel electrophoresis experiments to our project.
This kind of idea exchange is also exceptionally important to our project in the way that we could listen to others what we could do to enhance our works. All opinions are so valuable that we might have omitted before, boosting our confidence in designing our nano-cube for iGEM competition.
Public Engagement
Joint School Science Exhibition (JSSE)
13 members were gathered with iGEM HKU in JSSE.
Project progress were exchanged for both teams.
Previous Next
As one of the most important local competitions, we visited this exhibition to explore and exchange idea with the participants. Moreover, since HKU team has set up a booth there, we met with them to share each other’s progress and further discuss our works.
A project could said to be successful only after it is testified by the experimental data and the public. Though the experimental data suggested that we might on the correct track to detect H3N2 virus, the interaction with HKU team in JSSE allowed us to figure out what to be improved further before we join the Giant Jamboree later.
School sharing session
Members shared our progress of iGEM to our schoolmates.
Sixty schoolmates attended this sharing session to understand more on DNA nanotechnology
Schoolmates listened carefully during the sharing session.
Previous Next
In October 25 morning, we held a sharing session in assembly in front of our teachers and students. Apart from briefly introduced the latest DNA nanotechnology to them, we also present our work done this summer.
School is always a well-established platform to introduce new knowledge to students. Though the knowledge in this sharing session is rather simple than what we have done this summer,  we hope that these fundamental knowledge could arouse students’ interest in nanotechnology. After all, nanotechnology is not that out of reach to the public, at least in our school.

Introduction
Welcome to our Ethics page! In iGEM Uppsala we believe that discussing and thinking about ethics in science is extremely important. That is why we chose it as our main part for HP. We asked about opinions about ethics and iGEM in Interview . We also ask general public and other iGEM teams in Event . Out of that we created Guidelines for other iGEM teams. Within these guidelines you can find four chapters about the main issues we identified. You can also use our handy list of questions that we think every iGEM team should answer before starting their project! You can also see how we integrated this knowledge into our own project in Integrated . In Education you can see our events that links to our Ethics part of the project.  To see the rest of our HP work to our main HP Page
Guidelines
We compiled questions that every iGEM team should answer before starting their work to make sure they are doing their best possible work. We first started to answer these questions while creating our project. Later on we worked on perfecting them by talking to lawyers, ethics experts, our teamates, other teams and the general public. From that we compiled four chapters about ethics and a list of question we believe everyone should answer before starting their project. You can read the whole booklet here .
Interviews
To learn more about synthetic biology, ethics and iGEM we decided to interview Mirko Ancillotti form Ethics department at Uppsala University.
Do you think this is a good way to reach out to other teams and get them to talk about what kind ethical problems that can occur during iGEM?
Yes, I think that the booklet is a very good tool to inform and stimulate awareness about the basic ethical issues revolving around the iGEM competition and GEM products.
What do you think is important to consider (ethically) when starting up/working on a project?
Ethics issues arise in many areas of research, and the kind of considerations needed at the beginning of and through an ethnographic study differ from the considerations due in a study involving animal research. However, some"

How is oil extracted from Oil Sands?
Oil Extraction
Unlike traditional crude oil production, oil sands are first extracted using surface mining which transports the sands to sites where the sand is crushed, mixed with water, and sent via pipeline to a separating facility. There sand is settled out and a bitumen slurry sent via pipeline to an upgrading facility. At the upgrading facility, bitumen is further separated by centrifuging the slurry mixed again with water and naptha diluent. In the final stage of extraction, the bitumen is sent to a coker where it is heated, releasing hydrocarbon gas, and naptha. Such a  water and mechanically heavy process present unique environmental challenges.

We visualize these ODE's in the Simbiology Toolbox which results in the following diagram:

Cell B
The system of cell B is also under control of the cI repressor and is activated similar as cell A. The activation by the temperature raise, leads to the production of LuxR. AHL of the medium can diffuse into the cell, binding LuxR and activating the next component of the circuit. This leads to the production of CheZ and PenI. CheZ is the protein responsible for cells to make a directed movement, governed by the repellent leucine. PenI is a repressor which will shut down the last part of the circuit which was responsible for the production of RFP.
We can extract the following ODEs for cell B from this sytem:

By keeping a low price and great range of applications we give smaller research groups with low budgets the opportunity to work in this field. Another point is the fast response to pathogens to relive medical facilities and reduce victims. Possible competitors are companies that already produce antibodies upon request. Although their range of binders is limited and expensive compared to our product range.

The BeeT project consists of multiple parts, every student has their own part. We tried to integrate all the modelling with the wet lab. Therefore our project has three main categories, sensing the Varroa destructor, toxin production, and safety.
Wet lab
Lisa searched for the Bt toxin inside dead mites. Therefore we needed beehives from which to collect Varroa samples. Dead mites were collected from the beehives of the Duurzame Bij, a beekeeping organisation which tries to do beekeeping without pesticide use by breeding for Varroa-tolerant honeybees. They have some of the only beehives in the country with large populations of Varroa mites. Henk Kok, secretary from the Duurzame Bij, helped Lisa with the mite collection. We learned how to collect live Varroa mites and work with honeybees from Tjeerd Blacquière and Delphine Panz"

Policy & Practices Journal
Week 5: June 2nd - June 6th
Human practices sub-team was formed to focus on the purpose of the project and the positive impact it could have globally.  This week was focussed mainly on brainstorming potential ideas for application of a rapid diagnostic test for infectious tropical diseases.  One of the most prominent ideas was that of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis for malaria and the lack of resources to provide an accurate and rapid diagnosis of these other dangerous diseases.  Throughout this brainstorming we indicated that we wanted to further look into Dengue Fever, Meningococcal Meningitis and pneumonia that are often misdiagnosed as malaria.  In regards to these diseases, we looked into their symptoms and misdiagnosis statistics and existing technologies of diagnosis.  We began to look into potential contacts and experts that would be able to assist us with their expertise on the subject of misdiagnosis.
Week 6: June 9th - June 13th
Throughout this week we continued researching the various diseases, specifically focusing on misdiagnosis of malaria in developing countries and specifically the social and economic effects of this issue. We continued researching diseases that mimic malaria including dengue fever, meningitis, and pneumonia. On June 9th, we met with one of our experts Dr. Abebe Bayih who worked in the hospital setting in Ethiopia  Through our meeting he was able to confirm that misdiagnosis is a major issue in developing countries due to lack"

The extra mutation helps the ribosome to form a bulge proximal to the minor groove of the SD helix formed between the ribosome and mRNA, which increase the orthogonal ribosome’s orthogonality.

Characterization
We develop two kinds of circuits to characterize the orthogonal ribosome.Specifically, the host's ribosome or orthogonal ribosome pool utilised for translation is controlled by the selection of ribosome binding site (RBS).
For the first kind of circuits, there is only one reporter gene GFP on it.

A.
We characterize orthogonal ribosome system in terms of GFP expression under the orthogonal RBS(ribosome binding site) in the absence or presence of corresponding orthogonal 16S rRNA to characterize its orthogonality to the host genome.

B.
As we obtain so many different orthogonal ribosomes, it is natural for us to try to test the interaction between them.  With the increase of the complexity of the gene circuit, we may need two or more orthogonal ribosome to meet the need of diverge different parts into different pool to achieve the goal of the precise control  from input to output.
We characterize orthogonal ribosome system in terms of GFP expression under orthogonal RBS in the presence of different non-corresponding orthogonal 16S rRNA to characterize its orthogonality with each other.

Starting this October, we’ll be visiting local schools and applying a battery of IQ tests to students from all basic grades. After selecting the highest scores, those children will be interviewed with their parents and offered to participate in the program.
DETECT classes will be held on Saturday mornings on our university Campus. Groups will be formed according to previous knowledge of the area and will never have more than five students per instructor. We’ll take the students from basic biology and chemistry up to molecular biology, biochemistry, organic chemistry and genetic engineering. Advancement through the subjects will be at the maximum pace the students can handle in order to keep them challenged. In order to keep the continuous effort that this program will require, we’ve applied for DETECT to be included in ITESM’s Community Social Services system. When approved, it will mean that, as long as there are college students in the Campus willing to mentor gifted children (not just from SyBRE), the program will continue to exist.
As DETECT develops we’ll look into establishing working partnerships with governmental authorities and civil associations so that early-entry to college education is available to the students in the program. Although there is not much of a chance of that happening in Mexico, there is always the option of talking to American universities and see if they would be willing to help. It will all depend on the advancement shown by the first generations of DETECT alumni. It is our driving hope to be part of the formation of the first 12-year old Biotech major in México.

HUMAN PRACTICES
As part of our Policy and practices our team developed several activities through the year.
1. First meeting of synthetic biology in Mexico(Guanajuato, Gto. August, 6th.)
On August 6th, Team Guanajuato_Mx hosted a MeetUp in Guanajuato City. Four Mexican teams attended our invitation: iGEM TEC CEM, Tec de Monterrey, Pumas México and Tec-Chihuahua.
This was a great chance to share our projects not only with other teams, but also to public in general. Several students from nearby cities (León, Celaya, Irapuato, Silao) joined the event where they had the chance to get involved a little bit in the field of synthetic biology.
It was a very enriching experience since we all received feedback from both experts and members of other teams.
PhD Agustino Martínez, our invited researcher, gave us a speech about the projects he is currently working with and at the end we have a round table where we discussed some issues synthetic biology is facing nowadays
Afterwards, during the evening, our guests could just relax, explore and enjoy all the wonders of this beautiful city.
2. Letting us know in “Clubes de Ciencia México”(Guanajuato, Gto. August, 6th.)
Every year during the summer, science clubs are held in Guanajuato city. During one week, students learn about an specific topic, coached by whether Mexican or foreign students from prestigious universities from the USA, for example, Harvard and the MIT. It is an honor for us to say that our members have participated in past editions.
On this edition we had the opportunity to explain to all participants a little bit about our project ""Smart biopatch for detection of infections in burns"". This task was carried out by Cristina Rincón, Montserrat Venegas and Uriel Barboza. Thanks to the local crew of Clubes de Ciencia México and to our member Rodolfo Ferro for giving us this space so that other students know what synthetic biology and iGEM are.
3. A visit to a primary school for awareness about burns"

Week 15 notes
9/6/12
-Reviewed papers for insight into how PUF was purified. Looked through past protocols and planed a rough outline for purification.
9/7/12
-Consulted Brad about purification and need for supplies. Researched further into PUF purification. Confirmed with Dr. Jin that he might have proper purification supplies.
9/8/12
-Performed PCR cleanup and quantified tubes for Angela.
9/9/12
-Transformed and inoculated for Angela. Plated WT PUF-PIN on an Amp plate and mutant PUF-PIN on a Kan plate after Angela transformed the plasmids (pET4.3) into BL21 cells.
Week 16 notes
9/10/12
-Inoculated 25mL of WT PUF-PIN and 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN for protein purification experiments. Concurrently, prepared two separate 1L LB medias for purification of each protein and another 1L of LB for general iGEM use. Inoculated 3mL of WT PUF-PIN in pBAD for Divya.
9/12/12:
-Inoculated two 1L bottles of LB media with 5mL of WT PUF-PIN overnight in one and 5mL of 6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN overnight in the other after adding 1mL of Ampicillin to each media at 3:30PM. Incubated at 37oC and checked OD levels at 4:00PM when there was no change in OD of the cultures from standard LB media.
-Checked the OD levels again at 5:12PM and received 0.0419 for the WT PUF-PIN. It was at this time that it was observed that the 6-2/7-2 culture wasn't growing like the WT PUF-PIN culture was. This was due to Ampicillin being added to the culture rather than Kanamycin.
-Checked OD levels at 5:38PM and received 0.0902. Checked again at 7:07PM and received a value of 0.5558, at which time 2mM of IPTG was added. After 2 hours of incubation, the cells were spun down at 10000g for 15 minutes. The pellet was then resuspended and centrifuged multiple times in one 50mL conical tube"

Collaboration
We help the team HFUT-China to solve some biological problems and help them to validate their software, building a better platform or forum for iGEMers to communicate, especially about the parts and help USTC-software to optimize their applications. In addition, we help the team NPU-China for their modeling. We help them to simulate the bio-network to decide how strong promoter they should use for their enzymes' expression. Moreover, we also get help from team ShanghaiTech who provided us CdS quantum dots to validate our system. In turn, we help to improve the characterization of the CdS quantum dots for them. Last but not least, we attended the CCiC and The 5th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference to communicate with other iGEM teams!

Since the discovery of Penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been successfully used to treat bacterial infections.  In the past several decades, bacteria have begun evolving resistances to the antibiotics.  The emergence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae has been declared a serious threat to public health by the CDC, while other pan-resistant species, such MRSA and resistant variants of tuberculosis still pose imminent risk to public health.  Due to the ability of bacteria to share advantageous mutations through conjugation, antibiotic resistance is spreading rapidly between bacterial species and pressuring companies to produce new antibacterials. Unfortunately, antibiotics have a poor return on investment, encouraging many companies to abandon antibiotic research in favor of more profitable drugs. One such alternative to antibiotics is the less expensive and more adaptive treatment option of phage therapy. Whereas, antibiotics target conserved metabolic pathways that are shared by many bacterial species and results in damage to commensal bacteria in a patient, phage therapy can specifically target a species. But even this method does not provide the specificity to distinguish between individuals in a species.
A new therapeutic treatment for bacterial infections is necessary.  A paper by Gomaa et al showed that a type I-E CRISPR-Cas could be used to specifically target and kill bacteria. The CRISPR-Cas system consists of two important parts: the Cas endonuclease and guide RNA (gRNA). The Cas endonuclease and CRISPR gRNA form a complex that searches genomic DNA for PAM motifs with upstream sequences that share a complementary region with the gRNA.  If found, the Cas cleaves the DNA, resulting in a double stranded break. The gRNA is coded for by a spacer sequence that can be modified to direct the Cas protein to a different target sequence. Goma et al found that"

Community
At the start of the summer we hosted Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC); a weekend long event held by one of the Nordic iGEM teams in their home country each year. In the spirit of the iGEM Competition NiC is held to connect and share ideas and knowledge with synthetic biology in focus.
This weekend was packed with novel ways to learn and collaborate and we decided to extrapolate the themes of the conference into our Human Practices projects.
Workshops
Everyone attending the NiC conference had the opportunity to participate in two workshops consisting of interactive presentations, case studies and discussions.
How does this fit into our community?
We found the workshop structure to be a great way to engage individuals of multiple different interests in a broad range of subjects and were really inspired to use this scaffold in other ways.
Since the Biomakers community were so keen to develop skills and to be able to have an up and running lab, we thought this was a great way to gradually introduce concepts, skills and discussions. The result was the Evolving arm of our iTECH model.
Speculative design
During NiC, Linnea Våglund and Leo Fidjeland from this year's iGEM Stockholm team presented the concept of design within synthetic biology. Attendees had time to get creative with brainstorming activities to exchange ideas within this field.
How does this fit into our community?
Inspiring an interest in the possibilities afforded by biology for the scientists of our future
The bridge between design and biology is ever diminishing and this was a really well- received concept within NiC. We reflected that innovation and creativity are important skills to nurture and invest in so we decided to try and spark interest at a basic level in the concepts we had all seen from a new angle thanks to Linnea and Leo!
There is no better better place to look for 'out-of-the-box' creativity than young children, so as a result, we developed the basis for our primary school education programme. Here the focus was on getting students to think of and design futuristic products which could be made out of spider silk and, considering the material properties of the spider silk, why was it particularly suited to their model.
See our Public Engagement and Education page for some brilliantly insightful and creative ideas from the scientists of our future, which resulted from our teaching resources .
Unsolved ethics
An introduction on ethics in synthetic biology was presented by Marko Ahteensuu, followed by group discussions. In this workshop there was the opportunity to learn about ethical issues that may arise from synthetic biology, acknowledge principles underlying these issues"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," PAM sequence and the gRNA has bound the complementary sequence, the staggered cut will occur around 18 bases 3′ of the PAM and leaves 5′ overhanging ends ( Zetsche et al., 2017 ).
Our gRNAs were transcribed using T7 polymerase starting from a ssDNA with the coding sequence downstream of a T7 promoter. An appropriate design of the gRNA-coding ssDNA consists of three separate parts in the following order:
T7 promoter (5’-ctTAATACGACTCACTATAgg-3’): This is needed for the transcription and the sequence will not appear in the final gRNA. To increase the polymerase efficiency, it is recommended to add 1, 2 or 3 G’s right after the promoter ( New England BioLabs ) as well as adding CT upstream of it ( Baklanov et al., 1996 )
Scaffold (5’-TAATTTCTACTAAGTGTAGAT-3’): This sequence can change according to the Cas12a species - the one shown here is specific for LBa Cas12a ( Zetsche et al., 2017 )
Spacer: It is the gRNA sequence that is complementary to the activator sequence (TS). For the ctDNA group we chose to use shorter guide sequences (17 bp rather than 20) for detecting both single base polymorphism and chromosomal rearrangements, based on the work done by Li et al., 2018 , where they proved that shorter guide sequences yielded higher cleavage specificity
The T7 polymerase needs a double stranded region to bind to. It is thus necessary to order a primer for this region. The rest of the sequence can stay single stranded for a lower cost.
Figure 3. Recognition of the target sequence (activator), via complementary binding of the gRNA
Fluorescent readout
Following Chen et al., 2018 , we designed a Cas12a detection assay based on the cleavage of DNaseAlert (IDT), which are fluorescence-quenched oligonucleotide probes that emit a fluorescent signal after DNAse degradation: when DNases are present, the linkage between the fluorophore and its quencher is cleaved, which leads to the emission of a bright signal upon excitation at 535-556 nm ( Integrated DNA Technologies ).
By exploiting indiscriminate cleavage of the Cas12a protein that is triggered upon target recognition, we were able to obtain a fluorescent reading following the cleavage of our reporter molecules. This allows for a"
ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Wetlab#Switch Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," even possible to engineer these proteins to bind to a DNA sequence of choice (4-7), we decided to use the IS lac repressor mutant, which binds to the lac repressor binding site like the wild type but does not lose affinity for the binding site in the presence of IPTG or lactose (8). Since expression of the mutant lacI has to be tightly controlled to avoid repression of lac-controlled gene expression despite presence of inducer, it was decided to put it under control of the tet repressor (9, 10). The pulse generator consists of two parts, a constitutively active TetR generator (unlike in the case of the lac repressor, which is expressed under control of its own promoter, E. coli does not produce tet repressor) and a lacI IS mutant gene under the control of the tet repressor. The constitutively active TetR generator supplies the TetR repressor, which binds to the repressor binding site in front of the lacI IS gene and releases the binding site upon induction with tetracycline. Induction with tetracycline leads to expression of the lacI IS mutant and this protein binds to the lac repressor binding site in front of the activated gene of interest despite presence of lactose or IPTG activator. With this system, IPTG induction initiates expression of the protein of interest while tetracycline induction rapidly terminates the expression of the protein.
Design of the LacI IS Mutants
Since the discovery of the lac repressor over 40 years ago (11), it has been subjected to extensive genetic studies, which have identified numerous mutants with different defects in activity (8, 12-25). The determination of the atomic structure of the lac repressor by itself (26) and in complex with IPTG (27) by x-ray crystallography furthered the understanding of repressor activity on the molecular level and allowed to assign mutations to different functional regions of the molecule. Mutations in several regions of the lac repressor can lead to the lacI IS phenotype: Mutations at the N-terminal domain of the core, mutations of the dimerization interface and mutations of the residues, which establish the IPTG contact. We decided to create lacI IS mutants by mutation of two residues, which form part of the IPTG binding site: R197 and T276.
Figure 3: A Lac repressor tetramer, residues R197 and T276 are shown in red. B IPTG bound to the inducer binding site of the lac repressor, residues R197 and T276 are shown in green."

Fig.3 inhibition zone of △far1+△sst2 and △sst2+△far1+△ste2
Conclusion： Knock out the gene sst2 can eliminate the inhibition of the signal so that the strain △sst2 can amplify the signal when cultured with α factor. From the results above, the strain △far1+△sst2 didn’t stay at the phase G1, because the gene far1 knockout eliminates the growth arrest. Gene ste2 knockout makes the strain don’t response to the α factor.

Research the impacts acted by the various concentrations of α factor to the growth tendency of these strains in the liquid medium.
The research of the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the growth of Cen.PK2-1C, △sst2 of CEN.PK2-1C.
Plan and method
The growth tendency of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains were determined by the initial concentrations of α factor from 0µM to15 µM. We planned to cultivate every engineered strain with these concentrations of α factor and obtain the value of OD600 of these strains at wavelengths of 600nm during cultivation measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometer which was calibrated by the YPD solution without strains.
Results and discussion
(1) With the concentration of α factor increasing, the growth of CEN.PK2-1C was inhibited more obviously.
Fig.4 growth curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
(2)the growth curve of △sst2 is lower than CEN.PK2-1C. It was strongly inhibited by α factor.
Fig.5 growth curve of △sst2 under different concentrations of α factor.
Conclusion：From the results above, we could see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain would be inhibited by α factor. With the increase of the concentrations of the α factor, the inhibitory effect to the growth of the strains enhanced. Obviously, knocking out the gene sst2 makes the strain respond to α factor more sensitively.

Week 11 (July 10 -July 14, 2017):
From the confirmation digest and gel electrophoresis from last week, E. coli with pET29b(+)-phaBA colony 1 seemed to have the correct insert. Therefore, we wanted to sequence the colony to confirm that the correct insert was in the plasmid. To do so, we designed and ordered primers for pET29b(+)-PhaBA and prepped our samples for sequencing.   The E. coli transformed with pET29b(+)-phaC (colonies 1-4) did not pass the confirmation digest screening, but to double-check for the plasmids, we isolated, digested (NotI, HindIII and HincII), and ran gel electrophoresis on the plasmids from 6 more pET29b(+)-phaC transformant colonies (5-11) using with restriction enzyme digest. The results are shown below.

We planned out the rest of our experiments for the summer and set tasks to complete. We transformed our DH5α competent cells with each of our plasmid inserts. We ran digests to confirm that the transformants actually carried our plasmids. We also developed a protocol for sequential digest of our pET29b(+) vectors because the NotI and HindIII restriction sites are very close together on the plasmid.   PhaC-J insert from IDT was digested with HindIII and SalI, ligated with pET29b(+) vectors, transformed into competent DH5α cells, plated on Kan resistant plates, and left to incubate overnight at 37°C."

Como se menciona anteriormente, se ha demostrado que el galio tiene efectos citotóxicos. Dicho esto, también se afirma que los sideróforos son altamente específicos para organismos patógenos particulares, por lo que un método de terapia basado en ellos, solamente afectará a los patógenos, sin dañar a la propia flora intestinal del hospedador.

Abstract
Biosensing Water Contaminants
with Genetically Engineered
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
As one of the most important natural resources, the declining quality of fresh water is a world-wide issue. Pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and heavy metals are rarely monitored and the need to detect and remove these compounds in an inexpensive way is what motivates this project. The marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could be a part of the solution through its unique ability to interact with electronics. The Mtr pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 is an external electron transportation pathway that is able to transfer electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode, thus generating electric current that is utilized in bioelectrochemical systems. We are utilizing S. oneidensis MR-1 △MtrB, the MtrB gene is removed, to prevent electron flow to an outside source through this key protein. We are then inserting a plasmid into this strain that contains the MtrB gene under control of a promoter that activates transcription of the protein when induced by compounds such as pesticides and metals in the water. This will allow for controlled electrical expression that can be used in microbial fuel cells to create a biosensor for the detection of these compounds. This biosensor will then be engineered to be manufactured on a large scale to be used for research, education, humanitarian efforts and even consumer use. Although the proof of concept is currently tested in a single chambered bioelectrochemical system, an affordable and portable paper microbial fuel cell system is currently in development.

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," mass spec will only detect fragments which ionize well. The Magainin 1 Star peptide consists of four repeats of the Magainin 1 sequence (corresponding to the arms of the star). If the two tryptic fragments within Magainin 1 do not ionize well, then indeed the entire peptide would not be read.
Finally, it is possible that the protein has been cleaved or degraded. This would account for the slightly lower-than-expected mass on the SDS page gel.
Nonetheless, it is a possibility that the peptide fragments are present but not detected. Replication of the in-gel mass spec would be useful in clarifying this point, or provided the purity of the sample is acceptable, it may be possible to run an intact mass spec. Digestion with alternative enzymes may also provide a more robust sequence coverage, particularly for the USP peptide.
Conclusions
We designed several novel star peptides based on several rational design criteria. Further, we began the optimisation process required to express these peptides in E. coli.
To this end, we constructed an expression system based on the SUMO protein and standard BioBrick parts. The function of this system was confirmed, as it appears it does produce HIS-tagged SUMO fusion protein in E. coli, as expected. Nonetheless, we hope to continue to characterise our parts, likely through further purification and measurement of the mass.
Given the success of SUMO in the protein expression community, we hope our BioBrick will encourage further use of the fusion domain within iGEM. In addition, we hope that our ideas and concepts will inspire future iGEM efforts to explore the applications of synthetic biology for material science. We continue to believe that bacteria have great promise for the in vivo construction of unique biomaterials, and we look forward to seeing how the synthetic biology community will develop in this area.

The first presentation of the afternoon served as an introduction to the field of synthetic biology and examples of applications in previous iGEM projects. Discussions were focused on considering problems in the world that can be addressed through synthetic biological approaches. This presentation was similar to the one given at our team's 2011 Synthetic Biology Informational .
A plasmid modeling activity followed the first presentation of the afternoon. This activity was found on the Community Bricks website and was originally designed by the 2011 iGEM team from British Columbia. Segments of multi-colored lengths of pipe cleaners (“genes”) were given to groups of three to five attendees, along with information sheets that described what the pieces represented and three different scenarios that can be addressed using synthetic biology. Participants had to consider parts that would allow the microbe to survive in the given environment, parts that would carry out the desired task, and parts to be used as safety devices such as ""kill switches."" This gave participants a concrete idea of what it means to engineer a biological system, as well as what might be required to solve a specific problem and how safety systems might be implemented. An iGEM team member was assigned to each group to lead them through the activities, letting them know of the rules for each round and what was to be accomplished. Students were given prizes for successfully completing the activity and presenting their “plasmid” to the audience.
The second presentation was a more in-depth talk about the synthetic biology process . From identifying genes in nature to isolation to characterization, topics were covered in a logical progression to give the audience a better grasp on what iGEM does, and how teams do what they do. This section was focused on giving students from a variety of backgrounds (mostly engineering students) a clearer understanding of molecular genetics techniques and their importance to synthetic biology.
A simple DNA extraction activity followed the second presentation. This activity was supplied and instructed by one of the team’s advisors, Dr. Dave Westenberg. Every participant was given a plastic tube filled with one gram of wheat germ. Through a series of reactions with simple reagents, every student was taken through a stripped-down protocol for extracting DNA from cells. The steps were “quick and dirty” using warm water, soap, and then alcohol to perform the required reactions. Wood swabs were used to transfer the DNA (mixed with some carbohydrates and proteins) “glop” from the reaction tube into a clean Eppendorf tube, which students were encouraged to keep as souvenirs.
