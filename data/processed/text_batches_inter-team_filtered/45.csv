Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," the coil genes into pSB1C3 were attempted again. Based off of the colony PCR there were some potential completed parts for the plasmid switches. Verification digests of the miniprepped plasmids from these colonies combined with sequencing revealed the successful plasmid switch of the E-coil with a His-tag (Figure 8).
Figure 8. Confirmation digests of the K-coil, E-coil with His-tag, K-coil with His-tag and the E-coil parts within the pUC57 vector using the NotI enzyme are present in the respectively labelled lanes. These digests were used to confirm if older coil stocks were suitable for construction. Also present are the confirmation digests of the K-coil, E-coil with His-tag, and K-coil with His-tag after an attempted plasmid switch into pSB1C3. The expected bands were observed for the plasmid switch of the E-coil with the His-tag. Due to the faintness of the bands they are indicated with orange arrows (reference stock plasmid bands are also indicated). Positive and negative control lanes are present on another gel. The gel was a 2% agarose gel and was run at 80 volts for 90 minutes.

Today it was our first test with mercury!
The team had a short discussion about how to add mercury to medium. Based in articles, we decided to do, what we call LM (medium Lúria-Bertani + mercury chloride). Taking it from the stock solution, we added 400 µL of mercury to LB medium (peptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L and NaCl 5 g/L and, in case of solid medium we added 15 g/L of bacterial agar, pH 7,0 - 7,4) at the concentration of 20 µIg/mL. We chose just this concentration because our objective now is to know if the bacteria can resist metal only with bio bricks. If it does, the mercury values will be adjusted for other tests.
We made an inoculum in LM 20ug/ml:
- Using only DH5a, without resistance to Hg.
- DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
- DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
- DH5a with BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3
- DH5a with BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3
To be our positive control, we also made an inoculum in LM 20ug/ml a sample from a stream in Manaus, called “40” (a stream that is known for being polluted with industries residuals) and Negro River. We named these samples A1, A2, A,3, A4; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1.

We cannot rule out the possibility that the greater apparent fluorescence may be due to the co-spun thread simply having more mass
Spinning Apparatus Project
Required Materials:
2 12V Stepper Motors
1 Arduino Uno R3(knockoff brand)
Breadboards
2 Easy Driver v4.4
2 12V DC adapters
Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a system of two stepper motors spinning at different speeds to stretch and wind silk.
Today's Progress:
As seen below, I was able to hook up the Arduino to the Easy Driver, and then to a Stepper motor.
The system worked incredibly well, however during the process of changing Easy drivers to test if both worked, a problem occured and I was unable to replicate the successful rotation.
After Troubleshooting, I have determined the problem does not lie in the arduino, and so I have ordered 2 new easy drivers, with the belief that poor soldering on my part caused the failure in replication, as well as poor disconnection practices of the power sources( the external 12v DC adapter as well as the Arduino)
The Easy Drivers will arrive on Saturday, Progress will continue at this time."

The PhyscoFilter for Erythromycin
In order to check the activity of the erythromycine esterase B we pursued two different approaches: on the one hand we produced the enzyme recombinant in Escherichia coli and purified it. The purified protein was used for in vitro activity tests determining the depletion rates. The reaction was stopped at predetermined times by addition of three volumes acetonitrile and freezing in liquid nitrogen. On the other hand we added the substrate erythromycin at a concentration of 0.2 g L-1 to 3 mL of a polyclonal suspension of transgenic moss plants expressing the erythromycin esterase B in the cytoplasm. After 24 h of incubation at normal growth conditions 100 µL of the supernatant were used for further analysis.
Both samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS). The samples were measured at a Waters Xevo TQ-S using a Waters Acquity BEH C18 2,1 x 100mm column (1.7 µm, 130 Å pore size) and the following method: Solvent A: 0.1 % formic acid in water, B: 0.1 % formic acid in ACN and a linear gradient of 99 % A 0.5 min isocratic to 99 % B in 6 min. Column temperature 40 °C, flux 0.4 mL min-1, maximal pressure 703 bar. The tuning was executed with solutions consisting of the pure educt at concentrations of approximately 0.1 mgL-1.

Measurement of Gene Expression：
We used RT-PCR to see whether expression of the PDE5A gene was suppressed by our shRNA devices.
Fig.11 PED5a transcription level after transfection with three different shRNA
The results showed that the expression of PDE5A was silenced by all three shRNA devices.
Measurment of cGMP level:
Fig.12 cGMP concentration after treated with three different shRNA
When we measured cellular cGMP levels, shRNA3 showed better potential. Therefore, we chose shRNA3 as our best PDE5A silencing device for further study (part number: BBa_K1720005 ).
4.sGC and shRNA cotransfection
Measurment of cGMP level:
In the next step, sGC Overexpressing and PDE5A Silencing Devices were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Again, we used Elisa kits to detect the sGC activity and cellular cGMP levels. Whereas either device functioned well by themselves, a synergetic effect between the sGC overexpressing device and the PDE5A silencing device was also observed!

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Academia - How to design a perfect cloning chassis for synthetic biology
In this years iGEM project our goal was to accelerate synthetic biology. As one of its most abundant methods, the process of cloning was targeted for improvement by our strain engineering subgroup. Therefore, engineering Vibrio natriegens, the fastest growing organism, as a cloning host became one of our main objectives. When we started to design our cloning strain, we asked ourselves, what changes need to be achieved to fulfill the demands for a next-generation cloning chassis.
For example, what genetic properties are desirable for other iGEM Teams, research groups, and the synbio industry to consider establishing a new strain in their laboratory?
Figure 1: Meeting with Prof Dr Zurbriggen.  Our Skype conversation with Prof Dr Zurbriggen.
This question led us to contact an external expert for academic cloning applications, Prof. Dr. Matias Zurbriggen (Institute for synthetic biology, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf), to discuss our first design ideas for our Vibriclone strain.
At first, he mentioned general concerns about V. natriegens. He would be worried about the mutation rate for the"

a.iSWU 2017
We attended the China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU) this year and have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms.
When attending to SCU-WestChina, we suggested that they could change the microbial chassis of their dialysis part from Salmonella Typhimurium to Bacillus Subtilis to better ensure safety. And we are glad it helped.

When attending China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU), SCU-China shared their 3 alternative projects, one of which is about oral vaccine of rabies. Our professor suggested that such immunology experiments are extremely time-consuming and the results of such experiments usually are non-predictable, which may be exceedingly hard to finish the project of oral vaccine rabies in no more than 3 months. They finally picked up the project Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli, and hope they can make a great job on it.

This year, we aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria--Staphylococcus aureus. However, we had difficulties synthesizing the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids, and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, XJTLU-China had the similar construction and provided us with their group I Staphylococcus aureus’s agrC and agrA genes.

6. What are the first 3 words that come to mind when you hear Synthetic Biology?
Common Responses: man-made, fake, biology, confusing, complicated, medicine, genetics/genes/genetically modified organisms, bacteria, controversial, engineering, crops
Some of our favorites: nerd, awesome, boring, cyborg, “pretty goddamn cool”
We also noted that many people responded along the lines of “what is that?” so it is evident that a subset of our sample population didn't have a background on synthetic biology itself.

7. Are you aware of the human genome project?
8. What are your thoughts on artificial nature/intelligence? If the government asked for your support in this area, would you give it?
It seemed like many people would support research in artificial nature and intelligence, however, with reservation. Most support was contingent on regulation, ethical boundaries, and safety. It was also good to see that those who didn't have the proper background knowledge stated so and that they could not make an educated opinion without this information.
Some of our favorites: ""Yes, its awesome. It has so many possibilities"". ""AI will take over the world!!! I would ask the government for bionic arms"".

    Since the mechanical cipher machine is not convenient when it comes to vast input. We designed a software enigma, which has a clear user interface and easy to manipulate. It can be used to decipher the codes behind the postcards we designed(see below).
Postcards with cryptology themes
Applicable age range: All ages
    We designed two kinds of postcards to attract people’s attention, and expand their knowledge of cryptology and our project. The first kind has our project name on the front, and the codes which can be deciphered with the help of our software Enigma. And the second kind has the some illustration of the history of cryptology on the front, and the codes which can be deciphered using historical ways(such as Caesar cipher).
Activities & Experience sharing
    So how did we integrated those tools into public engagement activities? We organized some public engagement activities to test the effect of it in the real world. We attended STEM festival in Suzhou. We set up our stall in the exhibition hall with XJTLU. We have a poster to introduce the idea of synthetic biology and our team. In that case, we used the room escape computer game. People are attracted by it and asked us about the knowledge behind the game, then we introduced some basic knowledge about synthetic biology to them. Then, they understood the game better and “escape the room” easily.
    We also went to the Wuhan science & technology museum. We set up our stall in the information exhibition hall, which is a hall set up for people to learn more about how information processes. And this is exactly the problem we are dealing with! And our stall can provide a biological aspect of information processing, which enriched the knowledge of the hall. Here we played the puzzle game with children using candies, which helped them to understand what we have been doing in a funny way. The video based on synthetic biology was also played beside the game area. Many kids were attracted by it and asked us to explain the details of it.
    We attended a national famous skill sharing activity in China, Oneyouth Talk. We presented our work and introduced synthetic biology to the public. And after the presentation was over, many people talked to us, and gave some valuable feedbacks. There was also a fair in the location of the Talk for people to sell some interesting made by themselves.

Who: Owen
Aim Restriction analysis of overnight cultures 1,10 and 14 of the colony PCR pSB1C3-Zcas and pSB1C3-His-EGII from transformation 30-9-18
Use plasmid miniprep kit to isolate plasmids. See restriction protocol . One restriction analysis is performed using NotI creating 2 fragments and one using EcoRI to create a linearized backbone. The second reaction is only performed for pSB1C3-Zcas.
Results
Lane 1-6 contain restriction analyses of pSB1C3-His-EGII. Cutting pSB1C3-His-EGII should gives a fragment of 2kB and a fragment of 1300 bp. This can be seen in the first 2 lanes and a very faint band at 1300 bp in the third lane. Lane 7-9 contain pSB1C3-Zcas restricted with NotI. This should give 2 bands, one of 2kB and 1 of 1300 bp. No bands are present at 1300bp. Lane 10-12 contain pSB1C3-Zcas restricted with EcoRI. A band at 3.3 is expected. This can be seen in all 3 lanes, but there is also a band at 2kB. This band has the same size as linearized pSB1C3. As the bottom ladder bands are less faint than the upper ones, we hypothesized that the imager might detect higher bands better. To test this we turned the gel upside down and imaged it. Bands at 1300 bp can"

But beyond a certain threshold level, AHL begins forming a complex with LuxR, preventing its degradation. This complex now binds to the Lux promoter that regulates Latarcin synthesis. On binding, the promoter immediately switches ON and begins to produce a large amount of Latarcin. A small portion of the synthesised Latarcin destroys the host, and the rest can now be isolated and purified.
APPLICATION
It is estimated that food worth $1 trillion is wasted every year. This accounts for about one third of the world's food. Of this loss, 21% is caused due to microbial food spoilage. Thus finding a niche in the food preservation sector, we decided to develop a food wrapper that can extend the shelf life of mainly fruits and vegetables.
Inspired by 2012 iGEM Team Groningen, we propose a delivery system containing spores of genetically engineered Bacillus enclosed within two layers of PVDF membrane. (We chose to work with E.coli to carry out cloning experiments , due to its ease of handling. However, we propose that Bacillus spores be used in making the Food wrapper) The system is designed in such a way that only the PVDF membrane in contact with food will allow Latarcin to pass through. The purpose of the outer membrane(filter) is to prevent the entry of microorganisms, thus avoiding chances of further contamination.
To serve as a nutrient source for the bacteria, LB broth is contained within a compartment made of PVC, which is sandwiched between the two PVDF membranes. When mechanical stress is applied, the delicate PVC membrane disintegrates, allowing the bacteria to come in contact with the LB broth. When this happens, the dormant bacteria start multiplying.  Once the bacteria reach a substantial number,  due to the quorum sensing mechanism, the mutant latarcin will be  synthesised.
This results in abundant production of Latarcin by the host bacteria.  Latarcin diffuses through the inner PVDF membrane and reaches the food. On encountering bacteria present on the food, Latarcin effectively kills them via the carpet mechanism. Because of its half life of 10 hours, any unused Latarcin is therefore degraded, making the food safe for human consumption.

Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part)For the two deterministic models we did before, parameters finding and adjusting were performed to make the models more rigorous. And Ruipeng Wei did sensitivity analysis to find out which parameter hold the greatest importance in the model of T7 platform and recognized how the intein’s splicing efficiency influences the amount of reporter protein.
(Device Part)We were struck by a serious problem that we need to provide a lot of energy that cannot be afforded by such a simple amplifier to amplify the current strength. So we needed to get another way out. And it took time to search for supports and recalculate.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

4/9/2018
Experiment: Gibson Assembly of gene cassettes
As seen on the gel picture from Monday (September 3rd), we have two clear bands. These were gel extracted using the protocol . The resulting DNA concentrations are 38.1 and 38.6 ng/µl respectivly for band.
Experiment: Colony PCR
5 successful transformants from each plate was extracted and used for a colony PCR following the colony PCR protocol . We used the verification primers for this PCR to examine if length of the transformed constructs. This will be used to verify the digestion and ligation. In parallel, we experimented with an alternative technique for colony PCR. We scraped multiple colonies from the same plate off and treated it as if it was a colony. By doing it this way, we hope that we can screen plates faster, as we are looking for a band of the correct size in the gel.  A possible limitation of using this technique with the verification primers is that other plasmids, such as the RFP will show bright bands, while our gene of interest might be very dim. This can be avoided by using other primers, but we will discuss this at a later point.

Premixing a 'master-mix' might be problematic?
The annealing temperature was too high
The extension time too long
Too long amplification sequences
An error was made mixing the master mixes for the colony PCR
The lysated contain insuficient DNA or otherwise make for a bad template

MAGE becomes multiplex and automated, when the oligo recombinering steps are repeated multiple times. In short, the cells are first grown to mid-log phase, followed by induction of beta. The cells are then chilled to 4°C and washed in multiple steps to improve their competence. The oligos are added to the cells which are then electroporated. The cycle is repeated every 2-3 hours (in E. coli) allowing the cells to recover in between rounds of electroporations (Figure #MISSING) [16].

Chip-based oligonucleotide synthesis
Traditional column-based oligo synthesis is costly for large scale MAGE experiments. Synthesis of 1,000 90-mer column-based oligos costs about 36,000 USD [19]. An alternative to this method is to use Microchip DNA arrays to synthesize the oligos on, with the advantage that the price scales with the number of chips instead of the number of oligos. Thus it is possible to have up to 12,472 130-mer oligos synthesized for 2,000 USD and up to 92,918 oligos for 5,000 USD (http://customarrayinc.com/oligos_main.htm).
This method however comes with a few disadvantages. The oligo amount comes in the picomolar range and is delivered as a single mix of all the oligos. Because of these disadvantages, an extra processing step is required before they can be used in MAGE experiments.
The oligos are synthesized with two 20 nucleotide flanking sequences (barcodes). These barcodes must include a thymidine immediately upstream and a DpnII restriction site immediately downstream of the oligo, while the rest of the barcodes can be designed for amplification with a specific primer. By using different barcodes, it is possible to design one oligo chip for multiple MAGE experiments. The thymidine allows amplification with an uracil-containing primer. In these primers U is substituted for T in the primer. The barcode can then be excited from the oligo using USER enzyme, D"

Le concept de vectorisation
Principe de vectorisation [1]
L’adressage de molécules thérapeutiques vers un organe, un tissu ou une cellule malade constitue aujourd’hui un défi majeur. Dès le début du siècle, le savant Paul Ehrlich rêvait déjà de « magic bullet » susceptible d’acheminer un principe actif de manière spécifique vers son site d’action. Le rêve de Paul Ehrlich est aujourd’hui proche de la réalité grâce au développement de la vectorisation pharmaceutique.
De nombreux principes actifs présentent, en effet, des caractéristiques physico-chimiques (hydrophilie, poids moléculaires etc...) peu favorables au passage des barrières biologiques qui séparent le site d’administration du site d’action. D'autres molécules actives se heurtent aussi à des barrières enzymatiques entraînant leur dégradation et métabolisation rapides.
D'une manière générale, les barrières à traverser sont des systèmes très complexes faisant intervenir plusieurs éléments (épithélium, endothéli"

1. Exclude the possibility that the pheromone pathway is affected by the native ligand                         pheromone in                         yeast: (Knock out the Ste2 receptor);
2. Exclude upstream G-protein coupled receptor signaling attenuation (desensitization) that may                         result from sustained stimulation. (Knock out Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as                         a                         receptor-desensitizing factors.)
3. Exclude side effects on cell life cycle, cell morphology, etc. due to enhanced MAPK pathway                         signaling in the Pheromone pathway. (Knock out Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein                         serine/threonine                         kinase inhibitor.)
We also shared our original strain CEN.PK2-1C which no knockout of Ste2, Sst2, Far1 was                         performed.

After carefully studied the structure of MerR, I constructed MerR-MBP (Metal Binding Peptide). Additionaly, I helped to construct and standardize the periplasmic metal binding peptide – DsbA-MerR-MBP using a similar strategy as MerR-MBP. After inductive expression of MerR-MBP-His6, DsbA-PbrR-MBP-His6 and DsbA-MerR-MBP-His6, I use SDS-PAGE and western blot to confirm the expression and localization of MBP and DsbA-MBP.

4. Protocol
4.1 Introduction
Our project aims to control C.elegans’ movement by expressing chR2 in their muscle and neuron. In our plan, we will make over 20 parts of 3 kinds of channelrhodopsins with 5 different promoters.
First of all, we need to design the PCR primers with primer 5. Then we run taq PCR or pfu PCR to get our parts out of the C.elegans’ genome or plasmids. After that, we do the digestion of gene parts and vector pPD95.77. Use traditional method to do the ligation and transformation. Besides, we also use seamless cloning to deal with some difficult ligations. The last step in molecular construction is plasmid extraction.
Then we come to the C.elegans part, which includes microinjection, making NGM and ATR plates and seeding plates. All the details will show below.

The rate of open complex formation (parameter II) was slower for most variant promoters than for the wild-type promoter, except for the 34G (consensus) and the 33G promoters. Promoters containing altered bases at position —31 were less affected.
-10 Region:
Similar to -35 region of a promoter, -10 region is another conserved region. Generally, it is involved in DNA melting efficiency—the rate of open promoter complex formation.
The distance between the -35 and -10 regions:
For about 92% of promoters had inter-region spacing of 17bp, plus or minis 1bp. The length of it also plays a role in promoter activity and strength.

pTet: tccctatcagtgatagaga ttgaca tccctatcagtgatagagatactgagcac
In our basic circuit, we aim to find out the relationship between plasmid numbers and inhibitor concentration. However, when plasmids lost, inhibitor drops to a threshold, and resulted in the in-promoter is enough to express killer gene. So what if we want to kill the “slacker” by using different thresholds after well-constructing our circuits? Then we come to devote us to mutation in-promoters context.
Alteration or removal of -35 region sequences of the tet promoter can greatly affect in vivo promoter activity，by targeting the cause, we choose to mutate pTet to set promoters with varying strength. Amongst all the base pairs, the natural promoter was coincident with Darwinist survival of the fittest, it’s because of homological regions.
Promoter mutations construction described shows the function of each base, especially those in conserved regions and played roles in gene expression. On the other hand, promoters like pTac have been widely discussed, pTac and pTet DNA sequences are bending to RNA polymerase with same sigma factor. For our goal of mutating pTet, we decide to mutate it site-directed firstly refers to the results of pTac mutations.
Secondly, we will create new regions to attempt at changing the strength, adjacent to -35 region and -10 region, or altering the spacing length.
However, these two steps are based on our rational design, in fact, we also need to use error-prone pcr to explore if there is somewhere new could affect the gene expression.

The system should require the genetic engineering technology pass the microbiology, plant and animal experiments, environmental experiments and human trials before put into application. We should prevent the abuse and industrialization or commercialization of genetic engineered product rashly. For example, some governments have made announcements to prohibit the production and sale of any crops with antibiotic resistance gene.
4. Carry out public science education
The lack of the biological safety awareness is one of the biggest reasons of the genetic pollution. The majority of Chinese people whose daily life are closely related to genetically modified food can't ever understand the genetic pollution. So it's necessary for us to carry out the popular science education so that more and more people can pay attention to the genetic engineering knowledge.
5. Implementation of a labelling system for genetically modified food
Food containing genetically engineered organisms
United Nations announce if we take people's health and the environment into account, every country has the right to restrict the import of genetically modified food. All genetically modified products in the shipment should be labeled, indicating “this product contains genetically modified material "". International Consumers Association believe that although it is uncertain that genetically modified food is unsafe, but in order to prevent potential hazard to human, we should take preventive measures and establish an identification system. The identification of GMOs can help consumers to make choices. Genetic pollution is really a big problem in the application of genetic engineering. But we must realize the great benefit of genetic engineering. It is likely to bring the best choice for us to solve the global food shortage. Therefore we cannot give up improving gene engineering technology for fear of a little trouble.
6. Risk assessment and management
Conduct the risk assessment and management of transgenic technique and analysis the adverse effects of its products in the trans-boundary movement process so that the importer can make choices easily.
Synthetic Biology
When it comes to our iGEM project this year, the regulation of gene expression systems can not only introduces a new way for protein-specific expression but also plays an important role in preventing genetic pollution. For example, if you want to transfer some exogenous genes that are harmful to the environment or human beings into cells, then biological safety is one thing we must consider about. To prevent harmful genes being expressed in uncontrolled cases, we must do something to prevent possible genetic pollution.  And this year our project can do a lot on this problem.

The new waves of questions about naturalness raises as a new stake when we will have to face an entirely synthetic organism as promised by Craig Venter. We will have the occasion to notice that new accusations and charges are expressed against synthetic biology, through new formulations, claiming the “defense of nature” against manipulations by biologists.
B. Performing Lexicon : The playing God issue?
How are these criticisms formulated? What kind of arguments is called up in order to critic manipulation of nature? We will refer to some different kinds of sources and lectures we have encountered during this ethical reflexion. Most of the threat expressed against nature are formulated through two ways, hardly differentiable, fighting against both scientists and scientific productions of the field. Thus, the first are accused of “playing god” by creating the second, feared and treated as monsters. It is that traditional fear of the Demiurge and the Golem, which are reconfigured in a techno-scientific cultural approach.  We have to remember that threats and warnings are mostly coming from uninitiated areas and we can find their expression on blogs or comments from popular science papers about the stakes of synthetic biology. Non-scientists’ fears, as already mentioned, don't have to be rejected at the first look but have to be consider precisely as social markers and discuss in order to support  our democratic perspective. We will rely on the report of Andrew Balmer and Paul Martin from the Institute for Science and Society from the University of Nottingham (Balmer and Martin 2009). That report relies on another, from the European Union, the New and Emerging Science and Technology program (NEST) written in 2005. The experts (bioethicists and synthetic biologists) recommend and encourage researchers to establish a definition of what life is, in order to rely on it and to show a certain obsolete feature of the threat. As we see it, the main part of the question will be about definitions, but, not only.
What are the formulations of the different fears? Balmer and Martin quoted some :
On the moral front, Mooney [of the ETC Group] says of Venter: ""God has competition.""  To argue that the making of life should remain the province of a divine creator is no argument at all.
Scientists are a step closer to creating artificial life after transforming one type of bacteria into another. … But the announcement has also triggered unease, with some critics warning that the scientists were 'playing god' .

The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR.

Mantis can be grown from a central cell banks in the tropical areas where the disease is spreading and thus does not depend on single companies for the production process.
After the right affinity body is found for a rising disease, the bacterial strain is distributed to central, bigger health centers in developing countries as fast as possible. A primary health center, like the ones located in the capital city of a country, can be a good place to set up the master cell bank. From there, the cells are grown in large culturing tanks, dried and aliquoted in vials, ready for transport to more rural medical facilities. Whereas protein biosensors must be stored and transported refrigerated, dried whole-cell biosensors can be stably stored without the need of a cold-chain [2]. However, one bottleneck could be the cell culturing step.

Cell culturing will require a certain level of training, which is often not available in laboratories in developing countries
This means that addition of a ‘cell culturing course’ to the medical training in developing countries will thus be a necessity. This would however be a step forward in creating a self-sustaining medical structure in developing countries and reducing the dependency on external help from developed countries.

In addition, selected wells change color and can be de-selected before submission. After improving the well selection table, the aesthetics of the UI were redone to make the design sleek and easy to read.

Using the UI
Here is a demonstration of how to use the User Interface.
Back-end Code
The back-end software runs both the XY Plane and Control Syringes. The approach in designing the back-end was to treat information in the context of a series of different outputs coming off of the microfluidic chip. By creating an “Output” class, we created different methods that were responsible for assigning each output a set of dispensing coordinates and pair of corresponding control syringes that open and close the output. We are then able to access each output to get the necessary information to control the hardware. The control syringe and xy-plane software are detailed further below.
Controlling the Syringe Pumps
The Control Syringe Pump software is responsible for moving the servo motors in order to actuate valves on the TERRA Adapter to select for certain outputs to dispense. In addition, the Control Syringe Pump software resets the syringes before the start of any experiment. It does this by moving syringes to three known states:
Origin
Close
Open
The origin state resets the syringe to reference point, the open state opens a valve by via negative pressure by pulling the syringe, and the close state closes a valve by releasing the syringe back to origin and applying slight positive pressure by pushing the syringe. Below is a diagram showing the various states:
As mentioned earlier, the Control Syringe Pump software works with the TERRA Adapter to dispense outputs into the targeted vessel. Each output has a pair of control syringes assigned to it, called A and B, in order to toggle between selection and waste; selection occurs when the control syringe A is open and control syringe B is closed while direction to waste occurs when control syringe A is closed and control syringe B is"

Assumption:
In this project, the simulation was performed in only a single cell.
Bacteria communicate with each other using chemical signaling molecules. The process of producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to the signaling molecules in bacteria is referred to as quorum sensing. Quorum sensing enables bacteria to obtain information from their environment and alter their behavior in a population size that is scaled in response to changes the number of bacteria present in their community. Thus, this method of intercellular communication allows populations of bacteria to work together, in contrast to the traditional unicellular view of prokaryotes.
In general, quorum-sensing bacteria produce and release signaling molecules into their environments which are called auto-inducers. The concentrations of auto-inducers increase in the bacteria environment as the bacteria population density grows. The bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold concentration of the auto-inducer and regulate their gene expression in a population-wide scale in response. As a result, using these signaling systems, all the bacteria in a community alter their behavior at the same time in response to an external signal, and therefore function similar to a multicellular organism.(indexed from Wikipedia)
Many different quorum-sensing systems have been discovered. Some of them are extremely specific for a particular species and some of them are common in all bacteria. In this work, we sought to establish a synthetic auto-inducer (AHL) signaling system.
It is assumed that AHL was produced and degraded at a certain rate to maintain a certain concentration in a single cell. That is to say the number of AHL molecules within a single cell is constant. Therefore, there is a linear relationship between the AHL molecule concentration and cell concentration. The regulating engine was started when the number of AHL molecules reaches a certain threshold, or when the number of cells reaches a certain threshold.
Fig.9 the GRN of the quorum sensing device. The right table shows the chemical reactions of the GRN.
Fig.10 stochastic simulation of the GRN in a single cell
As we could see from the simulation result in fig.10. AHL was produced and degraded at a certain rate to maintain a certain concentration in a single cell. A AHL*LuxR complex was formed once LuxR was produced. Thus the concentration of LuxR was low.

Safety Issues
1- Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
2- Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
did you document these issues in the Registry?
how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
How could other teams learn from your experience?
3- Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
4- Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Some answers and open debates around these issues
1- For Researcher
Since our project is based on using the existent BioBricks for engineering devices, we do not have new safety issues in our project for researchers & students.
For the Environment and Public Safety
The reagents used in the lab do not pose a risk if standards microbiological practices are used. In addition, biological parts used to make our BioBrick are not from pathogenic or toxic sources and therefore pose no risk to the safety of team members, laboratory and general public or for environmental quality.
The potencial risk of liberating a LMO (for example, frost conditions resistance bacteria) into the environment must be observed, since GMO & LMO ecological interactions have not been tested or studied enough. (see about devices)
2- About Devices
About safety on implicated parts in our Project:
AgrColi Project, while Nitrate Biosensor (PyeaR promoter) was developed, was made by trained students following the UoB Safety Committee guidelines and local rules stablished by the laboratories where they performed their work, approved and overseen by the iGEM supervisor Dr. Nigel Savery. Regarding Public and Environmental Safety, the E.coli’s encapsulated within the beads die when there are not appropriate conditions; since the gel they are is biodegradable, there is very little potential danger from the substances or bacteria used to either humans or animals. Finally, it has not raised exceptional safety issues in the past and complies with most bioethics regulations.
On the other hand, in Georgia Tech part (hybB+Omp"
XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," extensively used for decades. The carcinogenic experiment reagents, such as Ethidium bromide the DNA dye, had been replaced by less harmful reagents before initiating the project.  Moreover, we followed the rules and firmly believe that the safety is always priority to our project.
Public Safety
Our project is only a demonstrated project and is not involved in any direct contact between the bacteria and the public. The key is the visual effect caused by the microbes instead of the products of bacteria or bacteria itself. i.e. the biothermomap may only use for non-commercial and non-profit purpose and the bacteria would not be spread out and used by other institutions, except in our lab.
Environmental Safety
No. Theoretically, after the demonstration of our project, our bacteria would be disposed of properly and immediately. No further investigations are required. Even if there are experimental bacteria accidentally entering natural environment, they are highly unlikely to pose a threat given the overloaded bacteria and the harmless nature of themselves.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No. we did not use any new BioBrick parts. All BioBrick parts were derived from the previous iGEM team or the literature and which all had been expressed in E. coli previously and no hazardous conclusion was drawn. The only difference is that integrating various protein genes into one construction forms a relatively complicated bacteria internal environment, which is inclined to weaken the cells.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
No. To be honest, there is NO any biosafety-related group, committee, or review board at our institution. This is probably a universal answer for Chinese biological institutions. We wouldn’t dare to affirm that Chinese government completely neglects the biosafety issue but can tell that the economic benefits always outweigh the costs on the biosafety in the view of a vast majority of proprietors. Fortunately, in our lab, there is a strict safety assessment procedure devised by the lab managers and which is fully capable of ensuring the safety of the researchers. All in all, biosafety is an oversight that we normally have in China. We are obligatory on improving the understanding of the importance of biosafety and in order to change the situation in a large scale, we are hereby looking forward to the assistance of Chinese government.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," widely used for synthetic biology modeling but it requires an overall understanding of the biological network. It is difficult for even professionals to provide such large amount of data. The underlying reason making modeling so difficult is that the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur through different mechanisms. Based on this. we are always seeking feasible ways to implement our automatic modeling idea. The automatic does not mean modeling without any information provided, but however, there indeed exists a minimal data set to enable the automation.
Similar to C++ programming language, we introduce templates to allow generic description of species and reactions of a certain pattern. It is essential to implement our automatic modeling idea since
to share the same
Automatic modeling of biological system, Similar reactions happen for similar reasons. For example, the repression of pTetR promoter by TetR dimer can happen on many different DNA molecules with pTetR, regardless of what other biobricks is constructed on the DNA. With this thought, we add the part of Substituent , which can replace inactive parts of Species in Reactions , making it more general, and actually turning it into a reaction template. Having substituent, a pTetR TetR binding reaction is re-interpreted as the binding reaction of ANY DNA with pTetR(Figure 2) with ANY protein with TetR-dimer binding site. Modeling with templates allows us to describe reactions of new complex even without rewrite the reactions and species in database.
Figure 2: Template of pTetR DNA
Automatic Modeling Database Language
We use a database to store all the information we need in modeling. In order to realize automatic modeling, we construct the database in unified format and make it machine-readable. Every component of database has its specified attributes and values, which makes the format of the database a unique yet standard database language. We call it MoDeL : Modeling Database Language by picking out characters from three words. MoDeL is based on XML language, which makes it flexible and extensible. For more specifications of MoDeL, click here .

July 23: Experiencing setbacks
Lunch meeting to discuss progress
Today, we encountered some setbacks - the executable file of my iGEM Archive Crawler was written in C#, so Linda discovered that it would not work with our CS department's Python server. I spent a majority of the morning trying to rewrite my program in Java - however, the two toolkits I used (HTMLAgilityPack and HTMLWebRequest) didn't seem to have equivalents in Java. I was able to change a lot of the syntax and replace some of the toolkits with code, but it was a very difficult process. In the early afternoon, we met with Orit and she suggested using a Windows server somehow - she told me to hold off on converting to Java until we really have no other options. After the meeting, I went back to working on the primer designer - we decided to redo the user interface so that the first page has less wasted space and can display the three tests that I coded for the backend. Before I left, I checked out the code from last year's primer designer to see their conditions for placing a checkmark or not. Hopefully by tomorrow, we will be close to finishing the front end and back end of the primer designer.
July 24: Adding the backend to the UI
While other students in the lab conducted user studies today, Kara and I worked on the primer designer. We realized that we could not put the alignment tests on the first primer designer page, so we changed the UI to add the test check boxes and text displays to the second primer designer page. After finishing the UI, we began to add the back end code to the main project. We added several new methods on top of the old ones we had - we discovered that we needed to test both the left sequence (also referenced as the forward sequence) and the right sequence (also referenced as the reverse sequence) for each test, so we made 6 different check boxes and text boxes. Once we finished that, we attended the BBQ that the Science Center Research Program was hosting. We all had hamburgers and hot dogs - it was a great end of the day.
July 25: Improving the Primer Designer
We started the morning off testing the backend methods for the alignment tests. Unfortunately, we ran into two errors (ContextSwitchDeadlock and ""not a valid win32 application"") and struggled for a few hours before fixing them. We finally got the three tests to run correctly and then show the results on the second primer designer page. We were also able to improve the first primer designer page - we allowed users to"

Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Regional Jamboree held in Toronto. Moreover, the first-place finish secured the team – made up of Dustin Smith (BSc ’13), Graeme Glaister, Jenna Friedt (BSc ’11, MSc’13), Suneet Kharey, Harland Brandon (BSc ’12) and Zak Stinson – a spot in the international iGEM competition, which will be held at MIT in November.
Providing students with the opportunity to compete against teams from around the world is just one way iGEM benefits its participants, says U of L biochemistry professor Dr. Hans-Joachim (H.J.) Wieden. Considered the driving force behind the U of L’s iGEM teams, Wieden serves as the students’ advisor and coach. He is also a highly respected researcher in his own right.
Director of the Alberta RNA (Ribonucleic acid) Research and Training Institute at the U of L, Wieden was also recently appointed the Innovates Centre of Research Excellence (iCORE) Chair of Bioengineering. Funded by a $2-million investment from Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures, the role enables Wieden’s research team to study how biological systems can be engineered to achieve breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry, biochemistry, health and nanoscience.
“iGEM enables students to get their first taste of research,” says Wieden. “They understand the goal of the project, and learn how to think outside of the box, troubleshoot and apply their knowledge to create scientific discoveries. All of this unlocks students’ creativity.”
What’s more, he continues, iGEM cultivates students’ entrepreneurial potential. The teams manage their own projects and raise funds to support their work, as well as learn how to communicate effectively and connect their work to real-world needs. Finally, as young researchers themselves, they come to realize the importance of supporting the forward-thinking scientists of the future: high school students.
To that end, U of L students have started iGEM teams in high schools in southern Alberta. And those high school students are following in the success of their older counterparts. Earlier this year, in fact, a team of Lethbridge high school students representing schools from across the city, won the Green Brick grand prize at iGEM’s international High School Jamboree at MIT, as well as trophies for Best New Biobrick Natural for their engineered DNA part and Best Wiki, the website used to display their project.

Spatial and/or developmental controlled gene expression of the color protein can be achieved using a recombinase logic AND gate.
VIRAL VECTOR STRATEGY
Gene viral delivery arises as a novel tool due to its high protein expression and yield production. In the last years, it has been reported several virus-derived systems since they can provide us with multiples advantages, for instance, its auto-replicative capacity and its movement from cell-to-cell (through plasmodesmata) to the vascular tissue. Thus, we decided to develop our proof of concept from this approach using auto replicative vectors as a vehicle for the colour protein expression.
In order to approach this, we used a viral vector derived from Tobacco etch virus (TEV) due to the amount of extra genetic material that they can accommodate and the ability to express a large viral polyprotein by viral-encoded proteases (Majer et al. 2017). The Antirrhinum majus transcription factor, Rosea1 was used as a visual reporter gene. Viral vector strategy enables us to detect adequately color halo effect.
Majer and co-workers (Majer et al. 2017) described several proteins from carotenoid pathway that display an alternative output colours giving us the possibility to design our Colour Code System. Furthermore, anthocyanin pigments are quantitative visual marker due to the correlation with the viral load making these proteins suitable for our project.
However, viral vector strategy is not the most convenient one for this project because of its infection process and the superinfection exclusion phenomenon. Once viral vector is expressed, the production of a colour protein is permanent. Moreover, once the viral vector infects the plant, superinfection exclusion does not allow a secondary infection (Julve et al., 2013). For this reason, we will use them only as a vehicle for expressing the colour protein as a proof of concept.
CHROMOPROTEINS
A repository of ten chromoproteins have been characterized, codon-optimized and standardized in E.coli by Uppsala iGEM team between 2011 and 2013. Chromoproteins can be used as bioreporters since they exhibit a striking color when they are expressed. Thus, several teams have implemented them in their projects such as Wageningen UR in filamentous fungi or NRP-UEA-Norwich 2014 and Cambridge-JIC 2014 using plant chassis. However, they cannot see a strong color expression in plants.
In order to expand our Color Code System, we propose using chromoprote"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

""Is our game playing the rules of evolution?""
Lorenz Adlung, Andreas Beyer, Matthias Breuer, Prof. Ursula Damm and Frank C. Kieschnick
Product Description
The Bacteria Game is a simple all-in-one kit to let homegrown bacteria compete against each other. March in lockstep with nature, breed your own creatures and become coach of your very own athletes. Simply use the included breeding kit to raise your own team and challenge your friends.
Included is everything you need to start instantly:
Petri dishes
Bacteria starter set (bacteria culture, agar, toothpicks)
2 Game scenarios
Different Game objects (barriers, forts)
Use the agar to build different landscapes and as a nutrient for your creatures. Inoculate your team on the agar and watch the game begin. Use the included game objects to evolve your team.
Technical Description
The concept of the game is based on the ability of some harmless wild-type bacteria to swim in soft media. Swimming enables the microbes to consume further nutrients if those in their vicinity are already consumed. All bacteria try to get away from the starting point as fast as possible to access fresh media. This mechanism can be employed for a game set-up. Selection and culturing of best swimmers leads to propagation of ideal swimming characteristics, which is why training may help gain a competitive edge. These bacteria can easily be stored in the fridge along with the supplied materials without any risk. The showdown competition is run by synthetic bacteria. Predators and prey communicate and regulate each other's density. Via molecular signals, the predator cells kill the prey while living prey rescues predators. The diverse and colorful crowd surrounding the spectacle was genetically engineered to carry different pigments, which was appreciated at the iGEM competition in 2009.

Blood Experiment Considerations
Aside from safety considerations, there are also other aspects to look at when working with blood. For example, we had to add the anticoagulant heparin to the blood we obtained from a local butcher shop, The Mad Butcher. This was done in order to prevent the natural coagulation process from occurring as much as possible before we could work with the blood in the lab. This is another factor to consider when looking at the results from our experiments. Depending on when we could get the blood or if there was any issues in transporting it, there may have already been a substantial amount of natural clotting that had taken place. Another factor to consider when working with blood is what source you are getting the blood from. It is important to ask if the supplier puts anything into the blood before you receive it. We were ensured by our suppliers that there were no additives that we were not aware of.

Ethics
1. Sepsis and the ethics behind this as this potentially could relate directly to the consequences of using our product on a human: (Acacia) There are already some possible ethical concerns around the use of snake venom as a clotting agent. Though the topical application of venom has benefits, there is a chance for sepsis to occur, especially if it’s being applied to an open wound. We know the consequences of snake venom being injected directly into the bloodstream. These would be the same consequences if sepsis through a wound were to occur. The idea around this project is fascinating, but in this aspect, it would be negligent and unethical not to recognize the possible dangers that accompany the chances of natural occurrences such as sepsis.  The specifics of intended procedures will have to be further elaborated beyond the intent that is listed above.

P170, a strongly acid-inducible promoter from Lactococcus lactis, is up-regulated at low pH during the transition to stationary phase.[2] The trans-acting protein RcfB, however, is involved in basal activity of P170 and is also essential for pH induction. The protein RcfB, upon activation by lactate, bind a DNA recognition motif within a promoter region and activates transcription.[3] When the cells are exposed to acid environments, the RcfB activation by an ‘acid’ signal allows its binding to the ACiD-box, resulting in transcription activation.[3]
Figure 1. The principle of P170 and RcfB
So we construct a part as follows. With the constitutive expression of RcfB, once the pH reaches the threshold that usually ranges from pH 6.0 to pH 6.5, P170 will be induced so that RFP can reflect red fluorescence under UV detection. In this way, we can sense the acidity in our system. Furthermore, other functional genes will replace RFP gene as a strategy for application extension.

2 Regulating system—an effective tool in regulating metabolic pathway
Here comes our regulating system for acid recovery.
The ssrA tag sequence (mf-ssrA tag) and the Lon protease (mf-Lon) from Mesoplasma florum are made up of the crucial elements of a protein degradation system. Experiments has been identified that mf-ssrA tag is efficiently recognized by mf-Lon [4] Besides, degradation system based on the Gram-positive M. florum tmRNA system lies in proteomic level and does not rely on host degradation systems, which makes it an adaptive method in variety of bacteria. Here, we use this proteolysis system for lactate regulation and keep it in an oscillatory value of acidity.
So we design a part like follows. Once the T7 promoter is activated, with the reflection of red fluorescence, we are able to detect mf-Lon activity on various tags. Henceforth, we can substitute the RFP with functional genes. We believe this toolbox is intended to be a fast and convenient method for prospective proteolysis option and degradation research.

Notably, the proteolysis system has potential to apply in many fields. As a strategy to make it a toolbox for further"

Synthetic biology is a brand new field of biological research which combines science and engineering. Now more and more people are familiar with this promising and appealing field. Gene expression regulation can expand the regulating tools for synthetic biology. We can control protein biosynthesis through things like riboswitch. Different combinations of these regulating tools can bring different outcomes in protein expression levels. And they can be applied to real life to solve many difficult practical problems.
According to some of the championship projects in2011 igem,we find some  are intresting and develpmental.Gene regulation can be called as the core for most of the projects.
For example, As BYU's first iGEM team, BYU team proposed constructing a molecular AND gate in E. coli. To detect their chosen inputs they investigated the OxyR promoter and a thermo-sensitive riboswitch. The OxyR protein activates transcription in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen speesscies (ROS). The riboswitch allows translation only above a specific temperature. Both inputs activate a Cre/Lox system to remove a terminator sequence and allow transcription of a molecular signal. And they think a similar system, in theory, could be used for early detection of colorectal cancer.
Another team is the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, they designed a set of Codon-Switches that regulate target protein biosynthesis (translation).In their rare-codon switch, the translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of rare tRNA amount,aaRS that charges the rare tRNA and rare codons. Besides, their also made other two switches that can be turned on/off without background noise . One is to use stop codon as the controlling element, the stop-codon switch.The other is to use any codon but the original start codon to initiate translation, the initial-codon switch.
Various methods of regulation are provide.Followings are the typical ones.
Regulation with density: XMU gold medal，Advance to Championship
They have developed a series of devices which program a bacteria population to maintain at different cell densities. They have designed and characterized the genetic circuit to establish a bacterial ‘population-control’ device in E. coli based on the well-known quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri, which autonomously regulates the density of an E. coli population. The cell density however is influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. As such, we have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by using"

Pittsburgh,2016,Team:Pittsburgh#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," used in the differential equations. Units are included (as well as conversion factors) for dimensional analysis and confirming that each term is correct
From these differential equations, we generated a Simulink Model in MatLab 2016a and used a script to input values. The Simulink Model is shown below.
We were able to find the average water consumed by a child based on their age in order to get an idea of their lead intake. In order to effectively simulate the ""daily consumption"", we used a random variable to guess how much water they drank on a given day (since many children also get water from juice, soda, and other beverages). The random variable was used to predict anywhere from 20-100% water consumption from contaminated tap water. This gave us a range of possible blood lead level concentrations based off of the level of lead contamination as we will see later.
Determining the blood volume was a little tricky. We were able to find a correlation that related a person's height and weight to an average blood volume. From there we looked up average values for children's height and weight over time. Using the reference values for height and weight, we calculated the average amount of blood for a person and related it to their age.
With all the important information put into the model, we were able to begin simulating lead exposure. Initially, we used a pulse of lead contamination of 50 ppb for 10 days on a 1-year-old child. This was meant to simulate a brief exposure to a mild amount of lead. We decided to model it using a 500 day window to see the long-term effects of lead exposure. To account for the different amounts of water a child may drink in a given day, we ran the simulation 50 times and plotted them all on the same graph. The results of these simulations are below
It's clear that while the blood lead levels spike quickly, the body is able to filter the lead out of its system within 3 or 4 months after the initial exposure. This is not true for the bones because the lead that makes it into the bones stays around much longer. Unfortunately, this means that the child will continue to have prolonged exposure to lead at a very low level. As of yet there is no hard evidence that proves such a long exposure to lead at a low level can do any damage, there is a growing notion that an exposure like this at such a young age can make the individual at higher risk for depression and other neurological conditions.
We decided to look at the same level of exposure (50 ppb) but for increasing intervals of time (ranging"

Tested whether adding silicatein cells to a solar panel had any effect. We tested the strain expressing OmpA-fused silicatein which was incubated with silica, so it had a silicate coating.  The cells were washed 3x in PBS. We connected a multimeter that was measuring voltage to a solar cell with a limited area exposed to light. We measured the output power of the solar cell at the same time as the light intensity of the lamp. We repeated this experiment with the same area of the solar cell covered in PBS and covered in PBS + silicatein-expressing cells.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," runs only little below the size of the N-terminal construct. An additional western blot was therefore performed with GFP antibody.
Figure 5) sfGFP light induction - Western blot with anti-GFP
No reconstituion could be seen in the sfGFP
As suspected, the GFP-antibody's epitope seems to lie in the much larger C-terminal half of split sfGFP (Figure 5). It should thus show the bands in the C-terminal single expression and in both splicing and non-splicing coexpression constructs as well as in the LOV-constructs. Surprisingly, we did not recognise any band in the non-splicing C-half which should theoretically be stained by anti-GFP. However, the band in the splicing construct can certainly be identified as C-terminal half next to the sfGFP positive control. We therefore conclude that no intein splicing has taken place for the Ssp DnaX split inteins and split sfGFP.
This conclusion is supported by the data we obtained from flow cytometry.
Figure 6) FACS analysis of fluorescence of sfGFP samples
No reconstitution was visible for sfGFP
The FACS data was gated on the FSC - SSC scatterplot to separate debris from cells (Figure 6). During acquisition the maximum event count was set to 50000 or 100000 and usually reached within 10 to 30 seconds even at higher dilutions.
The fluorescence at ~488-512nm is plotted on vertical histograms for comparison. Data strongly implies that there is no change in fluorescence in the splicing constructs. This suggests, especially with regard to our previous experience with [2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project/Reconstitution Fluorescent Proteins Assembly], that no protein splicing has taken place.
For mRFP, results look much better. Apart from confirming the expression of most constructs, a weak yet clear band is visible in the splicing coexpressed sample at the estimated position of mRFP (25.4 kDa). All proteins in this particular blot seem to have run at higher positions as suggested by the protein ladder. We have previously observed this in our lab and is has proven to be best to carefully compare the protein-bands in one's samples with each other in addition to the ladder. Although the band of reconstituted mRFP is weak it is to be seen alongside the non-splicing control to the left. The blot strongly implies that protein splicing has taken place and mRFP has successfully been reassembled from split halves.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," to the database is highly valuable to improve our detection accuracy.
Additionally, we added 30 DNA strings of 150 bps as DNA from other endogenous sources than EPO. The 30 DNA strings were randomly chosen fragements from four other human genes: ACTN3 ( Beggs A.H. et al., 1992 ), Growth Hormone ( Seeburg, P.H., 1982 ), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( Tischer, E. et al., 1991 ) and Oxytocin Receptor ( Inoue, T. et al., 1994 ). The chosen genes all have GC contents that are similar to the human EPO gene, around 57% ( Clark et. al., 2016 , Biologics International Corp, 2018 ). Therefore, they are especially important genomic DNA fragments to use for classification reference as they would be hardest to distinguish based on combinatorics. The reference genes were furthermore all chosen to be of length 150 bps, since that is the expected cell free DNA length for genomic DNA ( Fan et al., 2008 , Lo et al., 2010 ). In this way we are able to accurately distinguish between gene doping DNA and DNA that does not code for EPO as is described in results .
Data Simulation
To train our gene doping detection algorithm, we need to accurately predict the data our algorithm would come into contact with in a working setting. We need to take into account both the type of DNA and the length of DNA. We generated all sequences using R ( R core team, 2015 ). Packages used for data simulation are seqinR ( Charif and Lobry, 2007 ), Rbioinf by ( Gentleman, 2018 ), Biostrings ( Pages et al., 2018 ) and Magicfor ( K. Makiyama, 2016 ).
Sequence Cutter for Sample Simulation
We generated DNA in sizes that are also expected when sequencing with Oxford Nanopore technologies ( Li et. al., 2018 ). The code takes as input a fasta file containing DNA, the amount of cut sequences that need to be generated and a minimal length threshold that can be set to prevent sequences below a certain length being generated. When using this code, pay attention to the fact that it assumes the origin of the sequence as being human. In this case, an exponential distribution can be assumed. See Li et. al., 2018 , for distributions as a result of other organisms. The output sequences are generated at a certain point in the gene and for a certain length. The starting"

We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.

2. Increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR in warrior I
Change beta_(1AHL_1t ) from 6e3 to 6e5
From the results of the model, we are delight to see that warrior I just respond when there is warrior II. So the orthogonality of gene circuit is satisfied!
However, if the level of TetR is too high (like when beta1ahl1t=6e7), we will see that warrior I cannot respond with or without warrior II.
In conclusion, the core is that we can make the gene circuit orthometric by regulating the TetR level to a moderate level. This can be easily achieved by change the RBS after Prhl of TetR in warrior I.
According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.

RFP (RFP DsRed) was amplified from pHT315_rfp by PCR (Fig.1). Colonies on a plate were given to us by the Applied and Genomic Microbiology department. Primers contained restriction sites for KpnI and SacI in order to make them compatible for insertion into the multiple cloning site of the pBAD/His A vector. The PCR products were examined in a 0,8% agarose gel by electrophoresis.
Fig.1) A gel of the RFP DsRed PCR product showed the bands to be at the correct height.
After purification of the PCR product it was ligated into pJET1.2 by subcloning (blunt end ligation). This vector serves to clone the fluorescent protein without triggering its activity, which may interact with the expression vector or the chosen E.coli strain.
Ligation into pJET1.2 was followed according to the protocol in the methods collection. After over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted with the QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, restricted with KpnI and SacI and examined in a gel (Fig.2).
Fig.2) Once restriction controls showed the correct bands, both pJET_RFP_3 and pJET_RFP_7 were sent for sequencing by the G2L laboratory.
Sequencing of both samples was correct and proved that RFP_3 and RFP_7 were properly inserted into the pJET vector. We decided to keep on working with pJET_RFP_3. The plasmid was transformed with E.coli TOP10 and E.coli BL21. Cryocultures were frozen for a strain collection.
The next step was a big restriction of the whole plasmid extract with the correspondent pair of restriction enzymes. That allowed us to isolate the RFP inserts carrying the desired restriction sites (KpnI and SacI). The fragments were purified with the PEQLAB peqGOLD Gel Extraction Kit before T4 ligation. The RFP_3 insert was ligated into pBAD/His A by the T4 ligation system (sticky end ligation) according to the protocol in the methods collection and transformed into E.coli TOP10. This vector serves to express the fluorescent protein by triggering its activity.
After over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted with the QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and restricted with KpnI and SacI.

iGaME: Synthetic Biology for Gamers
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," ensure that our cellulose-degrading E. coli offers a safe and efficient alternative to current biofuel systems. In talking to representatives at BioVectra we learned about biosafety in an industrial environment. While the people we spoke to did not voice any concerns regarding the current state of our project, they did provide us with things to consider if we were to scale-up our project for their reactors. Firstly, there bioreactors do not support a co-culture system and therefore our design would have to include multiple reactors. Secondly, an E. coli organism may be just BSL-1, but when it is found in large quantities, such as in a 3000 L bioreactor, it has to be treated as a BSL-2 organism. Finally, biosafety is not just to protect us and the outside from the organism, but to also protect the organism from us. In speaking with representatives from BioVectra we gained valuable insight into the logistics of running a large biofuel-production system. In the future when we are prepared to scale-up our safe system, and when we have thoroughly tested the efficiency of our organism, we will know what to expect when approaching companies.
How We Fit In: Researching Companies
There are five major biofuel companies in Canada each doing something slightly different. Here are summaries of those five major companies. Iogen Corporation is one of the longest withstanding biofuel companies in Canada. They were founded in 1975, in East Ottawa, and have been producing cellulosic ethanol since 2004. They focus on plant fiber and enzymatic hydrolysis in order to produce a dilute ethanol stream, which is further concentrated to commercial-grade fuel. The St. Clair ethanol plant from Suncor Company, has been producing 400 million tons of biofuel per year. This facility in the Sarnia-Lambton region has been running since 2006, and it has been named the largest ethanol plant in Canada. Suncor uses corn fiber to produce their strain of ethanol. They have partnered with Petro-Canada to blend their ethanol with Petro- Canada’s gasoline. Although this does not diminish greenhouse gases completely, the use of blended ethanol-gasoline fuel has been reported to reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 300,000 tons per year. Evoleum Biofuel is located in Saint-Jean- sur-Richelieu, Quebec. It is a major producer for biofuels from second generation raw material. At Evoleum, the second generation materials used are exclusively vegetable oil. They have created 95% biodegradable biodiesel, that"

Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman"

Introduction: Our whole system was triggered by light[1], so E. coli needed to be illuminated when cultured. To make quantitative analysis, we needed to strictly control light intensity and wave length. Our hardware series kept upgrading as our demands increased.
Material: Considering the small volume and high efficiency, we chose 3W LED as our light source after careful calculations[2]. We managed to buy 11 kinds of LEDs with different wave lengths (390-400nm, 420-430nm, 430-440nm, 450-455nm, 460-470nm, 495-500nm, 515-530nm, 590-595nm, 600-605nm, 620-630nm, 655-660nm).
Design: To satisfy multiple needs, we designed two kinds of hardware. One for solid medium, the other for fluid medium.
1. Hardware 1.0 for solid medium
Process: Using thermal conductive adhesive, we fixed the LED beads with substrate to our radiator, which looked like a sunflower. In the following picture, you can see our light source component as a whole, “sunflower”!
Figure 1. Our light source component- “Sunflower”
We managed to dig a hole in a container, which our sunflower perfectly fitted in. We used wires to connect the sunflower with a power source, and the plates inside the container could be illuminated by our lovely light! You would see some of them in the following pictures.

Introduction
Current lab equipment is very expensive. Due to this, some labs that have a smaller budget are limited with the amount of equipment they are able to provide, and as the equipment is very expensive to replace, labs rarely update this machinery, resulting in outdated hardware and software.
The team wanted to devise a solution for this problem, and as such started investigating the different types of methods currently employed for the detection of bacterial growth. This is a relatively simple experiment, which everyone should be able to perform without the need for expensive lab equipment. This will then allow future iGEM teams, who perhaps do not have access to these technologies, to be able to build and design this device from the open-source manual provided on this site. Other teams will then be able to perform essential experiments for the development of their projects, without the need for large sums of money.
The focus was on detection methods which could be adjusted to allow the user to make automated measurements within a warm room. This was important as it was a desired application of the device, giving the user the ability to run an overnight experiment, permitting the freedom to run further experiments through the day.
Detection Methods
Detection methods that considered are listed in the table below:
Impedance microbiology
Capacitance
Opacity
Light microscopy
pH reading
Advantages
Can use simple electronic components.
Can use simple electronic components.
Well known principle, used frequently in current labs.
Allows for the imaging of cells.
Can provide very sensitive information regarding the growth of bacteria.
Disadvantages
For a well in a 96 well plate the change would be too small to read. (explained in detail below)
For a well in a 96 well plate the change would be too small to read. (explained in detail below)
More complex circuitry required.
Does not provide quantitative information about the bacterial growth and requires sensitive camera equipment to achieve realistic magnification.
pH sensors can be very expensive.
Table 1: This table shows the different types of methods that are able to detect bacterial growth that were investigated.
1- Impedance microbiology involves using electrodes to measure the electrical resistance through a bacterial solution. As the bacteria grow the resistance changes.
2- The measurement of capacitance also involves using electrodes to measure the amount of stored electrical charge across the bacterial solution. As the bacteria grow the capacitance increases.

The next answers are related to the current iGEM projects. The poll shows clearly that patents have been a problem for 10% of the participants, which is not that much. But still : they do have been a concern in some cases. The relatively low number could be explained by the aforementioned reasons about the providing of non-patented tools by the iGEM organization.
It could also be explained by the redundant solutions offered by the living matter in general and the synthetic biology in particular. For instance, our team specifically picked a Dispersin gene that was not patented, though others were available (whose commercial use was protected).
Nevertheless to the question : “have other IP concerns (copyright, trademark) have negatively affected your current iGEM project ?” about 67% of the participants answered yes, which is considerably more, but as we have not even been concerned by such a problem, we find it hard to explain why this number is so high.
Our sole conclusion on this matter is that the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) often do affect iGEM projects, even if in general patents are not the limiting IP tool for them.
May a project be built on patented materials?
19% of the survey participants said that their team’s project used patented materials. This means that privatized knowledge and the iGEM contest are compatible in some way or another. However, the potential industrialization of these teams’ work will probably be restricted because the commercial use of something built on patented material is forbidden. This is a shame as one of the iGEM objectives is to generate projects that may have economically viable applications.
It is also surprising to note that 48% of the participants do not know whether their work is based on patented information or not, which shows a lack of information on their project material. Besides, it could stab them in the back if they were wishing to industrialize their ideas. Several questions were asked on the use of patented material. As it was discussed before, it is the most important IP issue in iGEM.  Nonetheless, only 20% of the survey participants said that their team’s project used patented material.
Furthermore, two thirds of the iGEM team members believe that using patented work would not stand in the way of patenting their own one. This is quite surprising because obviously one’s research cannot be patented if based on protected materials. This statistic is very interesting as it shows how much most of the iGEM community’s actors do not know their legal rights concerning the IP.

Silk Genetics
Spider Silk
Well known as a remarkable natural material, spider silk exhibits an incredible range of strength and elasticity. Silk-weaving spiders can actually choose from a wide array of silks (such as dragline, capture-spiral, and egg cocoon silk), each having its own unique physical profile and genetic origin. However, one thing that’s common to all silk is that their genes are comprised of highly-repetitive modules. By comparing the contribution of each type of module to the silk fiber’s physical properties, we can begin to understand how to create a collection of silk modules to build our own gene!
By genetically engineering the repetitive modules, and stringing them together in defined orders and ratios, we can customize the physical properties of the resulting silk fibers. Given the diversity that naturally exists across different types of silk, we can potentially assemble a massive library of silk proteins with an impressive range of strength and elasticity for a variety of applications. We plan on optimizing the compatibility of the iterative capped assembly (ICA) technique for the iGEM competition, creating a standardized method of assembling any highly-repetitive gene fragment in an efficient, user-definable manner. Having a library of silk gene blocks to choose from, and an optimized protocol for assembling them, we can optimize the selection and production of programmable silk with custom properties.
Honeybee Silk
Although lesser known than silkworm or spider silk, honey bee silk has emerged as an exciting candidate for a wide range of materials applications.  The elasticity of honeybee silk in fact exceeds that of spider and silkworm silk, while still maintaining a high level of strength.  A huge advantage of honeybee silk is that it is much more amenable to being produced through by recombinant e. coli due to the fact that the honeybee silk protein is much smaller and less repetitive than its spider and silkworm counterparts.  We aim to modify honeybee silk at the genetic level to add novel functionality to our silk materials.  For example, fusing fluorescent markers to silk would allow us to create honey"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," BioBrick cloning. Ligations were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and grown overnight .
Colony PCR was performed to check ligations. Colonies picked for this protocol were streaked onto a LB-agar plate.
Colonies were picked from streaked plates and cultures were prepared for miniprepping . DNA samples were then sent off for sequencing to ensure that the constructs were correct. Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .
Conclusions and Future Work
Though we have generated a sizable library of promoters of varying strengths and functions, we lacked the time to complete its characterization by the screening against targeted molecules.
Due to time constraints, we also lacked the time to characterise these parts into the Sensynova platform within the lab.

Accomplishments
Our team won a gold medal and was nominated for the best project in the New Application track. Our other, more important accomplishments exist in the new knowledge and connections we made at the conference.
Making Friends
Of course, we met many more teams and people from all around the world. There are too many for us to list on here, but we sincerely enjoyed meeting all of you. It is extremely likely (due to unfortunate consequence of how the world works) that we will not see each other again, but even so, we wish you all the best of luck in your future aspirations.
We would like to extend our personal congratulations to the team of William and Mary, who took the competition by storm much to their own surprise. After seeing their presentation, I'm sure no other iGEM team there was surprised with their victory. We're proud to have seen their project grow from the beginning when they came to our meetup when their project just taking shape. Our ties, strengthened by our close proximity, will hopefully lead to great collaboration in the future.

Looking Forward
Along with our accomplishments this year, we have learned so much about the competition and are inspired to take the team to new heights. We're currently working on positively restructuring the team and reaching out to new talent and potential collaborators. We hope the future UMaryland iGEM teams can expand on the success of previous years."
