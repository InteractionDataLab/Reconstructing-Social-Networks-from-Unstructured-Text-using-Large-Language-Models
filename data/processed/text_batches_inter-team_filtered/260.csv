Riza is a fourth year Biomedical Sciences student at Ryerson University. She was part of the winning team of Ryerson’s annual Chemistry and Biology (CaB) Challenge, which gave them the opportunity to join the iGem competition. She was motivated to win upon learning that iGem focuses on the expansion and innovation of synthetic biology. She always found synthetic biology fascinating with the various creations of parts that can be assembled together to create novel and efficient systems applicable to various sectors (medicine, energy, etc.)."

08/19/2014
E. coli colonies containing the iGEM Barnase part (BBa_I716.211) were recultured in liquid media.
08/20/2014
We made minipreps of yesterday's culture and to check them we made digestions in silico:

Enzyme
Expected bands
Barnase
NotI
2046, 357
BamHI
1558, 845
Digestions were correct, so we adjusted the product to 5 ng/μL in order to use them as a PCR template.
Adittionally, we made a ligation to obtain the TA29 piece in pUPD vector as follows:
1 μL pUPD
1 μL TA29
1 μL BsmBI
1.2 μL Buffer ligase
1 μL T4 ligase
6.8 μL H2O miliQ
Reaction conditions: 25 cycles x (37°C 2 min, 16°C 5 min).
We made a mistake predicting digetions in silico, so we repeated them, this time with the appropriate vector (pSB1C3).
Piece
Enzyme
Expected bands
Barnase
EcoRI and PstI

This double digestion was checked with an agarose gel showing that the resulting bands were the expected ones.
Additionally, TA29 in pUPD vector was transformed in E. coli. The protocol followed was the same as previously done.
08/21/2014
We did a PCR to obtain the Barnase as a product using the primers Bar_F1 and Bar_R1 and the template obtained yesterday.

In this RFC, we also give a standard format to record a circuit. Please see RFC 97(version 2.0) for more information. This standard is an update of RFC 97 (old version): Genetic Circuit Standard (version 1.0), which was published by us at the end of September.
Database
Introduction
To record the standard circuits, we set up a database. The information and format follow strictly the RFC 97 (version 2.0). And this database is open and dynamic. You can upload your circuits into the database and download information from it. We also provide APIs that allow developers to use the information of the database for other software.
Structure
So far, we’ve collected a number of valuable information from iGEM wikis and the journals about their respective gene circuits. And we set up a central database which can store all these useful information. Referring to the RFC document, all the information of a circuit can be separated into following parts:
I.Classification
Each circuit should declare their first classification and the secondary classification based on functions. A circuit should also be attached with some key words which can search and classify easily. Furthermore, the circuit should also be attached with the tags in Mind Map so that the circuit can be found in it.
II.Basic information
In part I, we store the name, the authors (or the team name), the id, the tags, the classification, the reference (wiki link or ISSN) as well as the description and applications about the gene circuit. Also, it contains the chassis (where the circuit functions), plasmids (the vector, may have more than one plasmid), the input and output of the gene circuit and the result of the circuits. Through this part, you can generally have a concept of what’s the functions of the circuits.
III.Circuit Structure
Based on the Technique standard, we build up a plug-in named Logical Genetic Diagram. The LGD can dynamically illustrate the structure of a genetic circuit. So we need several data to build up the structure. The database record the information of the coding-frame which is the subpart of genetic circuit. The information is composed of the output, input as well as the state (E.g Is this coding-frame constitutively express or it will just activated by some specific substance) and the sequence. The database also stores the biobrick assembly to coding-frame, which gives the assembling order of the biobricks and some detailed information of these biobricks. What’s more,"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Self-Governance, Legal Aspects, Justice & Religion
1. Introduction
The K.U.Leuven 2011 iGEM team had the unique opportunity to meet the Policy Officer for Governance and Ethics at the Directorate-General for research at the European Commission in Brussels. Alice Uwineza and Bakul Vinchhi represented the team and had an intriguing talk about self-governance, justice, religion, “do-it-yourself-community” and patents. As a part of a good self- governance practice we would like to share the new insights we gained from some of our questions.
2. Self-Governance
What are the steps taken by the European Commission (EC) to promote self-governance to tackle risks in synthetic biology?
Governance is an overarching concept including legal, political and ethical considerations [1]. It may refer to personal conduct or family units but more commonly refers to larger scale activities, i.e., professions, industry bodies, religions and political units (usually referred to as Local Government), up to and including autonomous regions and aboriginal peoples (or others within nation-states who enjoy some sovereign rights). It falls within the larger context of governance and principles such as consent of the governed, and may involve non-profit organizations and corporate governance [2].
Several initiatives have been taken by the EC to deal with synthetic biology and other new emerging fields in science and technology. One of the main aims of “The Science in Society Program” at the EC is to promote good governance in research, along with promoting high standards of ethics in research and innovation. There are other action lines about gender equality and science education, but the main focus remains on governance and ethics aspects.
One of the initiatives setup within the EC under joint collaboration is a recommendation that was published on responsible research in nanotechnology, called the ‘Nanocode’. This was an initiative of the member states of the EU to promote self-governance in nanotechnology. Currently, there are plans to promote good governance and ethics in an even broader aspect: a general code of conduct for scientists, but also about some specific activities pertaining to synthetic biology.

All of Slovenia’s Article 7 reports claim that there are no areas suspected to contain antipersonnel mines. A report by the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe in October 2001 stated, “Slovenia no longer has a mine problem, however there still remains a problem associated with the disposal of UXO [unexploded ordnance] from previous conflicts.”
At the Fourth Meeting of States Parties in September 2002, the Slovenian representative told delegates that the Slovenian-based International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance (ITF) is an efficient funding mechanism for mine clearance and other mine action.[19] In 2002, the government donated $362,534 to the ITF. In 2001, Slovenia contributed $418,373 to the ITF. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>

JUDGING FORM ⇗
★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed below .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

In order to check the sequences, sequencing was performed with the isolated plasmids (J23101+I13504 and J23106+I13504). In order to prepare the samples for sequencing, the following steps were conducted.
16/07/2015
Transformation of J23117_I135K4 gave more than 100 colonies for the concentrated one and around 70 colonies for the normal one. And the control gave around 40 colonies for the concentrated sample and 8 colonies for normal one.
Then inoculation was performed in 5 mL, in 15 mL tubes @ 37°C @ 200 rpm overnight. The following colonies were selected:
J23117_I13504 (5 colonies). We did this one again, because the sample did not give any GFP signal;
∆csgB;
I13522.
17/07/2015
We performed plasmid isolations for the 7 colonies selected on 16/07/2015. The plasmid concentrations obtained were measured by using the nanodrop method. The following results were obtained.
After the plasmid isolation we did the restriction again for J23117_I13504 with EcoRI and PstI. The following scheme was used in which the mixture for each of the 5 reactions is described. The total volume of each reaction was equal to 20 µl.
The restriction of the ∆csgB was performed with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and XbaI and the restriction of I13522 was performed with EcoRI and SpeI. In this case a total volume of 50 µl was used.
The restriction products were putted on a Agarose gel 1% for 30 minutes, 110V and after that for 15 minutes, 125V. The description of the gel is as above.*These are not for the Interlab study but for our own constructs (module 1).

Chapter II: Designing the Library
Figure 12: Library design of the quikchanged chemoreceptor Tar. (A) Schematic representation of the applied procedure for library generation of the quikchanged Tar_QC under a strong promoter. Saturated PCR mutagenesis was performed in two rounds. In the first step the mutagenesis primers, that randomly mutate three triplets and introduce a BsaI restriction site (scarless mutagenesis), were designed. In the second step the parent plasmid was amplified with these primers hybridizing to the parent plasmid pSB1C3_18C_TAR_QC. In step three, the parent plasmid was digested with DpnI and the mutated plasmid with BsaI to provide sticky ends. BsaI cuts outside the restriction site. In step four the plasmid was ligated and afterwards transformed with the mutated DNA into electrocompetent DH10B cells. Subsequently, the DNA was isolated for the second round of mutagenesis PCR (step five), where two other triplets were mutagenized repeating the previous steps. After finishing the 2nd round the plasmid library was isolated from the liquid culture. The 1st and 2nd round of the mutation library covered 105 clones. The two rounds were combined to one library with a final diversity of 2x 105. (B) Representative pictures of 0.8% Agarose gels from the 2nd saturated PCR mutagenesis round of step two after PCR (2), step three after double digest with DpnI and BsaI (3) and step four after ligation of the mutant plasmid (4).

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

demonstrate cross-talk between genes. These plasmids
will consist of genes for two different fluorescent proteins (green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein) next to each other, in different orientations.
We expect to see differences in the relative expression of the two genes depending on how they are arranged and oriented, and we will quantify this effect.
Next, we will try several strategies for removing these differences, including adding extra base pairs of spacing between the two genes and adding DNA ""clamps""
made from DNA-binding repressor proteins between the two genes. We will again quantify the effects of cross-talk between genes,
which will hopefully be ameliorated by our additions.

The Depot
NorCal iGEM Meetup
Over the summer, UC Davis organized an iGEM meetup with UCSF, UC Berkeley, and the Stanford-Brown teams. We started off the day giving a brief talk on each of our projects. After each talk, we had a chance to ask more questions about their project and offer possible constructive criticism. From this, we all received a different perspective on some of the tough problems we were trying to solve with our projects. After the meetup, we all had lunch and got to talk even more about synthetic biology among other things. To change things up, we also went bowling.
Other Efforts in Human Outreach
Provided DNA extractions for E.coli expressing RFP for the biotechnology class at Davis Senior High School.
Worked with classmate Nicholas Armstrong to create a Synthetic Biology Club at UC Davis
Grew to over 20 members after the first meeting.
We promoted the club on campus during the Activities Fair.
We began writing a lab proposal and a Club Finance Counsel grant for the club.

How to Build a Safety Case
How to Develop a Safety Case:
Developing safety cases can be a daunting task, but it really does not have to be. Safety arguments should be thorough, but by a simple step by step process, clear and thorough safety arguments can be developed and can help guide the design and engineering of the project. Once a team has determined a real world problem to focus on they can begin developing a safety case.
Fundamental Steps to Build a Safety Case:
Identify potential environmental hazards
Design a BioBricks to help solve the problem & engineer them
Toward the end of the design phase, it should be possible to determine specific environmental hazards and the engineered organism’s dependability requirements
As the design evolves, update potential environmental hazards
Understand requirements for reliability of the parts
Obtain evidence to strengthen safety argument claims from wet lab results, previous iGEM results or results in literature
Perform lab simulations and test the system
If refactoring is required to accomplish team goals, refactor the design of the BioBricks as needed and jump to Step 3
Create a clear succinct presentable format for the safety case
A diagram form following Goal Structuring Notation would be appropriate
Evaluate the strength of safety arguments
The following figure is the diagram view of a sample safety case Dr. Myra Cohen and Dr. Massimiliano Pierobon have developed for the 2012 iGEM Food Warden project.

Penn,2013,Team:Penn State#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a cDNA library, but we were unsuccessful.
**After meeting with our advisors, we decided to put this project on hold and focus our efforts on the promoter project**
Butanol Project
April 21-28
A rough draft of Castor and Pollux were designed using a 2A sequence to separate the different genes in the pathway. The amino acid sequences for the genes were tracked down and converted back into optimized nucleic acid sequences for Nicotiana and Physcomitrella. Sequences for the CMV promoter and NOS terminator were also found and added to the sequences.
May 12-18
More research was done into the 2A sequence, and we are more confident that we can chain together the different proteins for Castor and Pollux. This also raised concerns that the 2A sequence would leave “scars” on the the upstream and downstream coding sequences. This was addressed by searching for the structures of the proteins in Castor and Pollux and placing the 2A sequence at the least obstructed end of the protein.
May 19-25
Other pathways that utilized NADH were found that could synthesize butanol, but the team decided to stay with a NADPH dependent pathway. It was also suggested by our advisors that we could divert one of the intermediates in the butanol synthesis pathway for making a plastic as a secondary product. The proteins in the butanol synthesis pathway were checked again to make sure that the 2A sequence would interfere as little as possible with protein folding. The drafts of the constructs were also checked for stop codons and edited to remove restriction sites that could be problematic in the future.
May 26-June 1
An enzyme that could catalyze the synthesis of the plastic, polyhydroxybutyrate, was tracked down. This enzyme will be in its own construct to allow for co-transformation to make either plastic or butanol. The drafts of the constructs were also checked for errors and corrected. They were also optimized for assembly.
June 2-8
The three constructs – PhaC, Castor, and Pollux –were run through final checks.  Vector plasmids were also cultured.
June 9-15
DNA was ordered for the synthesis of PhaC and Castor. Various issues were addressed concerning problems with synthesis. As a result the NOS terminator would have to be amplified from a source, and could not be synthesized.
June 16-22
The NOS terminators were amplified in preparation for assembly of PhaC and Castor.

Zn(NO3)2 x 4 H2O, Zn(Ac)2, Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB), NaOH and KOH were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All experiments were carried out in ultrapure water. The synthesis of ZnO microflowers is similar to a synthesis performed by Zhang et al. (2004). 0.5 g of Zn(Ac)2 were added to 110 mL of a saturated C16TAB aqueous solution under stirring. After 10 min of stirring, 10 mL of a 2 M NaOH aqueous solution were added under stirring, resulting in a white aqueous solution maintained at 110 °C for 1 h under reflux. The white solid was centrifuged, washed with distilled water and ethanol until no foam was present after shaking. Finally, the white sediment was dried at 60 °C under vacuum.
The mineralization process was related to a process developed by Umetsu et al. (2005) and used by Tomizaki et al. (2012) to produce ZnO nanofibers. A 0.1 M zinc nit"

The most interesting suggestion was that of sensing metabolic intermediates, such as lactate. These will give our project a significant advantage to fecal analysis, as these intermediates will not be present in the feces. Nevertheless, they will allow us to paint the profile of, for example, lactate metabolizing bacteria and determine their dysbiotic behavior in IBD.
In order to make our project feasible, we would need to make sure that our encapsulated bacteria stay close to the mucus, where NO is produced. This will probably be necessary due to NO being relatively short lived.
Prof. Lacroix was also kind enough to offer us access to his gut simulator, a machine imitating the mucus of the gut, on which we could test our system and to their IBD affected mice, in case we would arrive that far in the project.

CRISPR/Cas9 technology has resonated widely within the scientific community and even in the general public. Given the flexibility of the technology, we wanted to design an alternative switch for our system using CRISPR. Given that Prof. Jinek’s 2012 paper[3] introduced the scientific community to this technology, we could not think of a better expert to help us design our switch.
Prof. Jinek introduced us to a new enzyme that his group is investigating and that has been discovered by the Zhang lab at MIT, called Cpf1 [4]. For more details please see our description page .

Measurement of pBAD Promoter
Fig.1. Team photo of NYU_Shanghai
NYU Shanghai made a Bacterial Music Generator this year, which could translate the colors and positions of bacteria colonies on a plate into sound composition. Integrating the unpredictable nature of life with digital technology, they aim to introduce new forms of bio-data into the sound domain. They engineered E. coli expressing chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins, or luciferase to produce colors visible under white light. We helped them test the strength of pBAD promoter, which they used to control and predict the expression of target protein.
We characterized the inducible promoter (BBa_I0500) in August. We tried to test it in both liquid and agar medium, which can be more helpful to our friends from NYU Shanghai. And it is the first time the pBAD promoter was measured in LB agar medium in iGEM. We constructed a GFP expression device which consisted of the pBAD promoter (BBa_I0500) and a GFP coding sequence with RBS (BBa_I13504).
The liquid cultures were diluted to OD600 0.0015 in LB and added to the 96-well plate together with arabinose at 7 different concentrations (0%, 0.00002%, 0.0002%, 0.002%, 0.02%, 0.2%, 2%, m/V). The absorbance at 600nm and green fluorescence (excitation: 485 nm, emission: 520 nm) were measured every 30min in a plate reader, until the E. coli cells reached stationary phase (that is, the absorbance and fluorescence no longer increase: about 8 hours from OD 0.5). Both absorbance and fluorescence were background (LB only) corrected. The fluorescence was then normalized for the number of cells by dividing by the absorbance.
The tested cultures were incubated at different concentrations of arabinose (0%, 0.002%, 0"

Conversely, in microbial electrosynthesis (MES) systems, also known as reverse MFCs, the microbes reside in the cathode chamber and the system uses an input of power other than microbes. At the cathode, electrons are taken up by microbes and this provides reduction power so that more reactants can be produced than normally would by the microbes alone, thus increasing the rate of reaction. MES systems have safer waste products, such as carbon dioxide and water.

Description
Overview
BASSET aims to engineer Escherichia coli to create a microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system that produces short-chained alkanes. The biosynthesis pathway produces alkanes from fatty acyl-ACPs, using energy derived from the MES module. Heterologous expression of pmt1231 from Prochlorococcus marinus and acr from Clostridium acetobutylicum, overexpression of the endogenous fadK and a mutant tesA, and deletion of endogenous fadE and fadR create a pathway to achieve this goal.
To increase efficiency of the system, the engineered organism would accept electrons from an external source, such as off-peak solar energy, to produce reducing equivalents such as NADH or NADPH in the cell, which are then used in the reductive alkane production pathway. This functionality will be gained by heterologous expression of the MtrCAB pathway and the CymA cytochrome from Shewanella oneidensis, as well as phenazines (secreted extracellular electron mediators) produced by the phzA-H machinery from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overexpression of the endogenous cytochrome maturation gene, ccmA-H will also assist in this MES system.

Types of natural RNATs

RNA thermometers
RNA thermometers (RNATs) are RNA sequences that range from 40 to more than a 100 nucleotides commonly found in the 5' untranslated region of some genes and that regulate in cis their translation without the need of other factors [ Kortmann and Narberhaus, (2012) ; Narberhaus, (2009) ]. These RNAT sequences show certain three dimensional structures, some of which interact with the ribosome binding site (RBS) of their regulated genes and hinders the proccessivity of the ribosome complex at certain temperatures. The dynamics of the formation of these structures is temperature dependent and is the basis of the regulation of the translation rate of a given transcript [ Chowdhury, S., et al.,(2006) ; Narberhaus, F., et al.,(2006) ].
Functional RNAT have been found in different organisms, mainly pathogenic bacteria, and many others have been predicted in almost everyfrom a number of bioinformatic studies. They have been found to regulate the expression of virulence factors, heat and cold shock response factors and even proteins involved the development of some bacteriophages.
Their apparent widespread presence in living organisms has made RNATs attractive for some applications, specially the ones related to the replacement of chemical inducers and for the development of new drugs.
However, from the experience of those who have been working extensively with RNAT in the later years, the accurate bioinformatic prediction of functional RNAT has proven to be an exceptionally difficult task; the reasons for this are pointed to be the poor sequence conservation observed among RNATs and the gaps in our current understanding of the RNAT function, their structural diversity and the effect of other regulatory sequences far from the RBS region [ Kortmann and Narberhaus, (2012) ;"
Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", expression of the Mms6 protein was induced in one of the 500 mL cultures by the addition of 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). One milliliter of cells from each sample was removed at one hour intervals and the optical density at 600 nm was recorded and plotted.
Results
The addition of IPTG to cells containing the BBa_K249019 BioBrick caused a slowdown of cell growth after 2 hours, and a subsequent plateau at approximately one-half of the cells density that uninduced cells reached after three hours post-induction.
Conclusion
The slowdown in cell growth as a result of production of Mms6 protein could be attributed to a number of factors.
One potential explanation could be a significant diversion of cellular resources to the production of Mms6 protein. This is unlikely, as subsequent analysis of cell fractions with SDS-PAGE showed no increase in banding at the expected molecular weight.
Another explanation could be that the Mms6 protein is toxic to the cells, and causes them to die. This possibility is being explored in collaboration with the Calgary team by using their troubleshooting kit.

Rikke is head writer on the  Studies on the Precautionary Principle ,  Theory and Bioethics  and Philosophy of science . 
The Bacteriocin group was Brian Baltzar, Astrid Honoré, Pernille Rasmussen and squad leader Cathrine Christensen. They all went crazy in the laboratory and got awesome results!
Beside the three main groups our project diverged into more branches including Funding, Clothes, Graphical design, Integrated human practice, Presentation etc. It was therefore necessary to assign people to different tasks. To sum-up, we all contributed to the project with our individual forces and thus made it a fantastic experience.

Poster Presentation at  the Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+
Figure 2: Poster
The Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ was hosted by the German Ministry of Education and Research in July 2011. This strategic meeting is organized every year. The purpose is to bring research facilities, companies and politicians together to discuss the development of biotechnology and synthetic biology in Germany in the next ten years.
The day started with an introduction from State Secretary Dr. Helge Braun and talks from different industry representatives. In the late morning we participated with a poster presentation together with this year's iGEM Bielefeld Team as well as the last year's Freiburg and Weimar-Heidelberg Arts Teams.
Throughout the poster presentation we had many interesting talks about iGEM. We discussed our idea with various people in terms of potential and application. Different thoughts were proposed about the project and about the Microviridin cluster. The feedback was great and encouraging. We also gave an interview to biotechnology.tv to promote our concept to a wide range of people (see youtube video below).
The lunch break was followed by a podium discussion about the scientific advantages which have been made throughout the past year. Highlights were presented and discussed by the speakers. In the afternoon several workshops took place. In the relaxed atmosphere novel applications and innovations were designed in role plays. It seemed that the search for novel natural therapeutics is a main focus in the arising decade of biotechnology in Germany. This poster presentation on the Strategic Process Bi"

Discussion:
From the MS-GC all three samples produced C17 and C19 methyl esters, showing that N. crassa naturally has C16 and C18 fatty acids as the predominate species. From the FID-GC the samples grown on solid sludge, and wheat straw produced more amounts of fuel (per g of wet weight) then when grown on N. crassa's preferred potato dextrose medium. The reason for this increase is unknown; however it could be caused by a survival signal in the in N. crassa when placed in an environment with less accessible food sources then the potato dextrose medium, or the fungus grows slower in the cellulosic media so at five days it is still accumulating fatty acid whereas the cells in the potato dextrose media have started to break down the fatty acids. In any case we can infer from this data that growth on cellulosic material does not inhibit fatty acid synthesis.
Applications/ Future directions:
In the future this data should be compared against the altered N. crassa to see if there is an increase in fatty acid levels and/or a shift in those levels due to the addition of a thioesterase, and the knockout of β-oxidation. It would be interesting to determine whether the expression of a shorter chain length thioesterase would produce a shift in the relative amounts of fatty acid.

The  Features Library manages the local libraries of feature annotations for  sequences.  From here you can create,  load, or remove libraries, examine features from within these libraries, and  select which libraries you want to use for highlighting.  (Additionally, you can drag features from a  library into the Sequence View and place them anywhere in the sequence.)  For now, let's select default library and  hit the ""Highlight"" button.   Close the Feature Library and go back to the Sequence View, and you'll  see that several features have been highlighted in different colors.  If you run the mouse cursor over any of the  highlights, the name of the feature will pop-up on the info bar just above the  sequence box.  Knowing where our  features of interest are helps, but let's find some restriction sites where we  might want to cut our sequence.  Go to  the Highlighting menu, and select ""Open Enzyme Library"".

They consist of a bidirectional terminator ( BBa_B0014 ), PBad Weak ( BBa_K206001 ), the sensitivity tuner ( BBa_K427005 or BBa_K427006 ) and GFP reporter ( BBa_E0840 ). These parts are BBa_K427007 for the MuC sensitivity tuner and BBa_K427008 for the MuMor sensitivity tuner.
All the characterizations were made in the BW27783 strain of E. coli. This strain was modified to internalize arabinose so that the concentration inside the cell is the same as the concentration outside. Another modification is that BW27783 does not use or degrade arabinose.The graphs show the data used to obtain the coefficients reported in the table. The protocol we used is described in the Protocol section of our wiki.

Introduction
Our method of solving differential equations is based on Fourth Order Runge-Kutta Method. This technique is the most widely used way of numerically solving differential equations and various methods of implementation were looked at. Most of our coding has been based on the work of Aberdeen 2009 iGEM team who used the same method in their modelling. We would like to thank the team for their work and making it available to others like us for future use.
Mathematical basis
While the strict mathematical derivation of the Runge-Kutta method is available (see here for details ), we omit it here and instead give a brief explanation of the principles behind the technique.
There are several key formulae in the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta algorithm, which are:
Figure 1: Runge-Kutta equations
The iteration of the x-values is done very simply adding a fixed step-size (h) at each iteration, thus resulting in a constant increase in the x-value according to the value of h chosen for a particular purpose.
The y-value iteration contains a much more elegant set of relationships. It should be clear to you that the y-iteration formula is in fact a weighted average of the four value k values, k1, k2, k3 and k4. Even at a first glance it should also be apparent that a 'weight' of 2/6 is given to k2 and k3 while a smaller weighting of 1/6 is attributed to k1 and k2. What then do these k-value correspond to geometrically?
Look first at k1. It is equal to the function f(xn,yn) multiplied by the step-size h, which is just the Euler prediction for Δy. It is the vertical distance from the previous point to the next Euler-predicted point.
Then consider k2. It should be noted that the x-value at which the function is being evaluated is halfway across the prediction interval and the y-value consists of the current y-value plus"

Improve the function of an existing iGEM project and display your achievement on your wiki.
     We improved the sequence of 2016 NCTU_Formosa team did before. We linked Sf1a and Lectin with GS linker to increase the folding efficiency of these two protein. Compared the result with 2016 NCTU_Formosa team, the plant protecting effect of our improvement part was more obvious, which larvae consumed less leaves areas than previous part. Moreover, larva also has abnormal movement after consuming leaf coated with the improved protein.

3. Model Your Project
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling.
     We’ve built Microbiota prediction model, Peptide prediction model, Growth model, and Productivity model, NGS data analysis. After computing again and again by machine learning, this system is more and accurate and precise to predict the need volume of bio-stimulators and its effect to the microbiota.

4. Demonstrate Your Work
Convince the judges that your project works.
     We build several models to integrate the intelligent agriculture system that simulates and tells us the complex relationships of bacteria in the soil. Through the system, we can know the microbiota adjusted by the bio-stimulator and predicts the effects of any bio-stimulator. Also, we build up the website to let user enter the amount of nitrogen, phosphate, potassium and let user know how much bio-stimulators need. After adding bio-stimulators our system suggested, the crops achieve maximum productivity and soil become healthier at the same time.

1. Validated Part / Validated Contribution
Convince the judges that something you created performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
     For bio-stimulators, we chose six bacteriocins to construct BioBricks consisting of the T7 promoter, the ribosome binding site and our peptide sequence, then purify by the intein and chitin binding domains. We test the minimum inhibitory concentration, which can inhibit the growth of B. subtilis to the desired level. For bio-sensors, we got αS1-casein, the amino acid sequence from NCBI, and optimize its expression in E. coli through adjusting the DNA sequence. Also, we added a GS linker ahead to enhance the function of sensor. We ligated above fragment to pET30a vector and transformed the plasmid to E. coli BL21 DE3 and expressed protein"

Meetup with SDU
We are very happy to have other iGEM teams around ours. As early as June 3rd, we hosted SDU team (Denmark) in Lithuania. We gained advices on organizational activities, lab work and wiki webpage. Moreover, we shared the usable information on topics, such as CRISPR/Cas systems, microfluidics and modular proteins (interactions between them and nucleic acids). We also organized a tour around Thermofisher Scientific Lithuania. Check out some more details of our meetup here . This great partnership did not end after their trip. As one biobrick ( BBa_I0462 ) was damaged in our kit, SDU team helped us by sending their sample of this biobrick. Thank you SDU team!
Biobrick collaboration with Toulouse
After we were given a hand by SDU team, we had an opportunity to help a great team of Toulouse iGEM. At the end of a summer, they told us that they need a specific construct ( BBa_K195613 ). Luckily, we were able to build it. Even more, we did some characterization of this part. It was already in a Registry of Standard Biological Parts, but has been poorly characterized. We sent this biobrick to France and hope that Toulouse team did a great job using it.
Meeting Paris Bettencourt
Dealing with French people doesn’t end this way. Our team member Mykolas visited one of the greatest iGEM teams and gained the experience from Paris Bettencourt . Impression of the structure of a team was inspiring for us, so after this visit on July we were more motivated to make this experience a part of our team routine.
Questionnaires
As the Beatles notice, with a little help from my friends, we filled in a lot of questionnaires and shared data from our ones. These questionnaires asked about GMOs, the attitude and acceptance of genetic modifications’ technologies.  We are happy to share this info with iGEM Tec-Monterrey , Vanderbilt iGEM and Oxford iGEM teams"

Frozen stock of each strain about to be put into the incubator for overnight growth.
Our team worked closely with Vanderbilt University’s iGEM team over the summer to help them troubleshoot issues they had been having regarding a promoter and to come up with questions to ask our panel.
Vanderbilt had issues concerning part K314100, which is a constitutive promoter. There were concerns that the promoter had nonhomogeneous expression despite its identity as a constitutive promoter. Additionally, Vanderbilt asked us to test another part, R0010, under the same conditions. We took their parts and induced them with IPTG to determine their effectiveness. We ran a total of 6 induction experiments, three using our lab’s induction protocol and three using their lab’s induction protocol. The parts were transformed and induced in DH10B as well as MG1655. The specific protocols we used can be found under the “Materials and Methods” section of the wiki.
Our protocol required the growth of a stationary phase culture to begin the experiment. After leaving a tube of culture sitting in the incubator overnight, we took that culture out the following day and diluted it in a new culture to an OD of 0.1. We grew that culture for another 2 hours. Afterwards, we prepared 8 serially diluted IPTG concentrations in corresponding mixtures of LB and antibiotic. Then, having pipetted those solutions to different columns in a 96 well plate, we pipetted the newly grown cultures into their separate rows. We incubated 3 of these plates for 7 hours.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," protein and hydrophobin
Janus are proteins that are produced by filamentous fungi, such as Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Many different aspects of fungal development have been attributed to Janus. For example, they are thought to play a role in the formation of aerial hyphae and fruiting bodies. Because Janus could assemble at the medium–air interface and cause the surface tension to be lowered, they could allow hyphae to breach the water–air interface [2].
Figure 3. Janus could assemble at the medium–air interface and cause the surface tension to be lowered, they could allow hyphae to breach the water–air interface.
One of the most important features of Janus is that they are able to assemble spontaneously into amphipathic monolayers at hydrophobic–hydrophilic interfaces [3].What's more, the stability of assembled Janus differs and on the basis of this characteristic two classes of Janus can be distinguished [4]. And the essential differences lie in the occurrence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues i.e. according to their hydropathy plots [1]. Class I Janus generate very insoluble assemblies, which can only be dissolved in strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid, while assemblies of class II Janus can be dissolved in ethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate or through the application of pressure or lowering of the temperature [5].

After this ligation was complete, we digested the newly ligated insert with XbaI and SpeI to get it ready for ligation with the pSB1C3 backbone. This digestion contained 1 uL of Buffer 2.1, 1 uL of XbaI, 1 uL of SpeI, and the newly ligated insert DNA. We did an overnight transformation and then ran PCR on the colonies. To see the results we ran it on a 1% agarose gel and saw that the insert did not ligate to the vector.  This sequence of events repeated itself for many weeks, to great frustration.
Week 8
Restart cloning process
After failed attempts to clone the circuit, we decided to start again from the beginning. In the digestion of the backbone, we followed the iGEM protocol, but modified it by doing an overnight digestion at 16ºC instead of a 30 minute digestion. The same digestion was performed on PcArsR, spisPink, and AmilCP. We heat killed the ligase at 80ºC for 20 minutes the next day, and digested the new insert with XbaI and SpeI. After digestion, we did an overnight ligation of the vector and the insert using the slightly modified iGEM protocol with an overnight incubation.
Testing ligation success before transformation
The team spent a lot of time transforming without successful insertion of the circuit, and needed a better way to determine the quality of ligation product that was being put into the cells. We reasoned that since PCR can amplify the tiniest amounts of DNA, we may be able to use this to screen the ligation products.
To screen the ligation, we ran end point PCR on the newly ligated parts using our standard PCR protocol. Surprisingly, the PCR confirmed that the vector and insert successfully ligated together! We then transformed our full circuit using the transformation protocol on the iGEM website, and mini-prepped using the Promega Wizard Plus SV Kit.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Acc from C. glutamicum is encoded by only two genes, accBC and accD.
The second enzyme in our pathway is the malonyl-CoA reductase (Mcr).   Since this enzyme only occurs in autotrophic organisms, performing the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle, there aren’t many candidates for our enzyme choice.   In literature Mcr from Chloroflexus aurantiacus has mostly been used, because it is easy to purify, has a high activity and is still active at moderate temperatures (Hügler et al. 2002) ; (Liu et al. 2017) .    We decided to use this enzyme and test it with different expression levels and
Acc
/Mcr ratios. However, recently it was shown, that a dissection of the enzyme strongly increases productivity (Liu et al. 2013) .    In general,
Mcr
has two functional domains, the C-terminal domain catalyzes the reduction of malonyl-CoA to 3-oxopropanoate and the N-terminal domain catalyzes the further reduction to
3HPA
.   In the mentioned publication there wasn’t an exact explanation for the increased productivity of the dissected enzymes.   Our hypothesis is, that the complete enzyme, which has its temperature optimum at 60°C, has a suboptimal protein folding at 37°C while the dissected enzymes are smaller and less bulky and therefore can fold easier. Deeper investigations of enzyme behavior additionally revealed that the C-terminal domain is much slower than the N-terminal domain and thereby the C-domain slows down the overall reaction (Liu et al. 2013) .    Therefore, we decided to use the complete enzyme of
Mcr
as well as the dissected enzymes McrC and McrN.   There is also another Mcr from Sulfolobus tokodaii, which only catalyzes the rate-limiting step from malonyl-CoA to 3-oxopropanoic acid. Since McrC has the same function, we planned to coexpress Mcr from S. tokodaii together with McrN from C. aurantiacus and test, if the activity increases.  All in all, we planned to use the acetyl-CoA carboxylase from E. coli, V. natriegens, C. glutamicum and S. elongatus, the Mcr from S. tokodaii and the Mcr, McrC and McrN from C."

The Bridge Between Microfluidics and Benchtop Biology
Welcome to the 2018 BostonU HW Project: TERRA
Microfluidics allows for the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research would enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility.
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist as traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips.
Our project, TERRA, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible active XY-plane selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.

Spectrofluorophotometer Analysis
We analyzed the degradation of our substrates with a spectrofluorophotometer. As you can see in the figures below the ethinyl estradiol and estradiol are degraded over night. Figure 4 shows the ethinyl estradiol without laccase treatment, Figure 5 shows that no more ethinyl estradiol can be detected in the sample after the degradation and new peaks appear which might represent possible degradation products. In Figure 6 you can see the estradiol control without laccases. Like ethinyl estradiol theestradiol peak is reduced after the degradation and new peaks appear indicating that those are new degradation products.
Figure 4: Ethinyl estradiol control without laccases. Ethinyl estradiol was measured in spectrofluorophotometer without laccase treatment to have a control.
Figure 5: Ethinyl estradiol degradation (with TVEL0). The ethinyl estradiol peak disappeared and some new peaks, probable degradation products, occurred.

The detection limit for the LC-MS was evaluated at a concentration of 10 µg L-1 for the substrates estrone and estradiol. The same limit of detection was used for ethinyl estradiol and anthracene. We only used those four substrates. For all LC-MS sample preparations we used the T. versicolor laccases. The dilution series was prepared in methanol and 50 % acetonitril-water (v/v).

Figure 9: Estrone calibration curve.
Degradation results
The TVEL0 was able to degrade the synthetic estradiol (Fig. 10) and probably anthracene (Fig. 12). The ethinyl estradiol control showed that it is stable in the used media (Fig. 11). Anthracene disintegrates"

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,". Northwestern University’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE) hosted its annual Summer Technology and Engineering Program . We talked about biotechnology to the group of girls participating in the event, and facilitated an activity involving isolating DNA from wheat germ using dish soap and rubbing alcohol. The activity was also inspired part of the kit provided by Building with Biology.
Emma Nechamkin from Teach for America allowed us to teach her high school biotechnology class at Perspectives Middle Academy in Auburn Gresham, a neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. Her students had never been exposed to research science, so we were allowed to give them a one-day lecture on CRISPR and antibiotic resistance. Thank you so much for giving us the chance to visit your classroom!
Jessica Yu and Joseph Muldoon helped us troubleshoot our wiki styling problems.
Thank you Drs. Leonard, Tyo and all of our graduate students for helping us with our presentating skills.
Team Roles
Our team emphasizes the integration of skills in all aspect of the CRISPR Capsules project. From wet lab work to speaking at public events, each team member has experience in all fields. Though some of us certainly deem ourselves “specialized” in some tasks, we find that the overall contribution from the high-level development of the project to the technical details of lab troubleshooting constitutes efforts from each member of the team.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," It strengthens the importance of your research through increasing your network of peers. Therefore, we had two BBQ’s with the Uppsala iGEM team during the summer. It was especially valuable to keep good contact with the iGEM Uppsala team, since they shared many similarities to us. They are also a big team, and were therefore also sharing some common problems. This was valuable since we could discuss our difficulties in the lab, but also within team management.
MedTech Evening 2018
Being in the beginning of our journey, we felt overwhelmed of how many directions our project could take. Therefore, we jumped on any opportunity to get some more insight into different mindsets and strategies to make a successful project and product. MedTech Evening, an event where students can meet interesting medtech companies and organizations, was a splendid opportunity to listen to people from different parts of the medical technological field. It gave us the opportunity to mingle with both students and professionals, but also to discuss what the world is lacking that we could bring to the world through iGEM Stockholm.
CHASE
The Careers in Health and Science Exposition (CHaSE) is a career exposition and fair organized by the Medical Student’s Association, Karolinska Institutet. It is an event that is held in the heart of campus , and was a great opportunity to talk about iGEM and the team in general, to increase the knowledge about the competition and synthetic biology. We had our own table at the CHaSE fair to promote iGEM. Since CHaSE is a hotspot for students in academia, it was a valuable crowd for us to pitch ideas to and find collaborations at.
BioBrick tutorial Copenhagen
In April, we were invited for a weekend of BioBrick tutorials, organized by DTU Copenhagen Biobuilders. The aim was to learn more about how to work with BioBricks, and to perform 3A assembly. The event was a splendid opportunity for us to meet other Nordic teams, and it led to us getting into contact with iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Lund, which we later did a collaboration with. See the event Limits of Life for more information!
NiC Lund
Sometimes the passion to do great in iGEM does not come from the pure urge to do research, but from the urge to prove that someone is wrong. From the very beginning of our project we believed in our idea and we believed that presenting it to others gave us valuable insight in how to shape the project into something that was out of the box. Therefore, we went to Lund in the beginning"

Dr. Braun is a professor at the Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research in Dresden and his research focuses on micro- and nanostructuring techniques for polymers and liquids. His presentation focused on the self-assembly of diphenylalanine motifs and its mechanism as well as discussing his experiences in judging and supervising a team in a different biology competition.
Teams
9 Teams attended the German-wide Meetup:
Aachen
Berlin_diagnostX
Bielefeld-CeBiTec
Cologne-Duesseldorf
TU Darmstadt
Franconia
Freiburg
Munich
Potsdam
Conclusion
The meetup was important for many reasons as it created an environment of collaboration for the teams, a pillar of the iGEM competition. With the time during the speed dating and the workshops, strong bonds were made between the iGEMers that will help for the competition but also for future endeavors after the iGEM Giant Jamboree. The experience for our team to set up this big event is also valuable as it takes a team effort in multiple areas, fundraising, planning and scheduling, getting guest speakers. It was all worth it in the end as the teams enjoyed themselves and we shared a lot of laughs. We can’t wait to see you all at the Jamboree"

IISc_Bangalore,2016,Team:IISc Bangalore#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Bioreactor design
We realized that manufacturing units use expensive and energy expensive machinery [3] . Hence, we engineered our bacteria in such a way that it could do most of the work done by these monstrous machines so that we no longer have to buy them and pay their bills. To increase the yield of the product, we came up with the idea of separating cell growth and target protein production so that when the cells have grown up to a high enough cell density, they shuttle all their energy towards the required protein production [4] . Based on the above ideas, we came up with the design of our bioreactor.
We realized that we would not be able to work on the whole idea this summer so, we focussed on two modules of our design: the Protein production module and the auto-aggregation module leaving the arresting of cell growth for future iGEM teams as a seed for their ideas.
Protein production
Induction synthesis of protein of interest is another important step. Microorganisms in bioreactors are induced at the OD, at which the protein production is maximum. [5] Because of this, factories install sophisticated machinery to keep track of the OD value of the culture so as to know when to induce the production. We wanted our bacteria to know when to start protein production and start it by itself. Hence, we used the lux quorum sensing system to sense this cell density. [6] We have expressed the gene for our protein of interest under the luxI gene so that protein of interest is produced in significant quantities only when the quorum is achieved.(Figure 2) We also wish to tune the quorum sensing system by tweaking with the strength of the promoters involved in quorum sensing.
Auto-aggregation
To achieve cellular aggregation, we use the famous auto-transporter protein, Antigen43 (Ag43). [7] It has shown to cause auto-aggregation of cells when overexpressed. (Figure 3) We plan to exploit this property of Ag43 to substitute centrifugation. We acknowledge previous iGEM teams who have worked on Ag43 (Hokkaido University, 2012; Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 and some more) as we got the BioBricks for Ag43 readily available.  We intend to express Ag43 only when the cells have made the product of interest. Hence, we use the diauxic shift in the media to act as a switch for the expression of Ag43.

By multiplying the absorbance at 600nm measured by each instrument, with the correction factor, all readings are now aligned to the reference spectrophotometer readings. Our plate reader was PerkinElmer EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader 2300 and measurements were made in the standard modes of the plate reader.
After the OD600 measurements are calibrated, we needed to create a standard curve for fluorescent measurements, again so that any differences in the instrument sensitivities, do not affect the results. By taking reads from a series of serial dilutions of a fluorescein sodium salt solution in the plate reader, the standard curve, with which GFP measurements can be normalized among different instruments, was created.
After these calibrations were made, the 8 devices had to be tested. All test devices were transformed into K12 DH5a E.coli by all iGEM teams participating, so that there are no variations in the expression systems between different strains. After plating onto agar plates with chloramphenicol as a resistance marker, two colonies were picked and grown overnight into LB Medium with chloramphenicol. Then they were diluted to an OD600 of 0.02 (conversion of Absorbance 600nm to OD was made by the correction from the LUDOX measurements) and allowed to grow for up to another 6 hours while taking time points every two hours. Samples were obtained every two hours and they were all measured together in the end by our plate reader. All of our results have been submitted to iGEM for further processing and comparison with data provided by the rest of teams.
We hope that our measurements will provide helpful data in this international study and confidently, along with the assistance of all other participating teams, create a standardized protocol for measuring absolute units of GFP expression for all researchers to use. We would like to encourage all teams in the upcoming years to participate in these studies, as together we can make large-scale experimental measurements seem like just another every-day experiment in the lab.

At the end of the     day and after a successfull workshop, they gave us feedback on our performance     as well as the experiments we had chosen for them. We took many of their comments     into account for developing the Mini-Kit, which is described in detail below.
Drawing with Chromoproteins, a high schooler's interpretation
Open Plant Forum and Workshop, Cambridge
At a later occasion, three team members went on a trip to Cambridge,   UK where we followed the Open Plant Forum in July and more specifically   the part of it that treated cell-free synthetic biology. We were able to  get in touch with Keith Pardee, on whose paper 1 we based the toehold part of our project (a toehold switch gets triggered by   a complementary trigger sequence, unfolds and let's the downstream reporter   gene be transcribed). Together we talked about our experimental setup, because   at the time we were quite desperate as we hadn’t managed to get the toehold   switch to unfold yet, so it was a relief to hear we were on a good track.   We were working on a software to streamline the process of finding toehold/trigger   pairs from a given input sequence, which would be the first computer program of its   kind and a great tool for anyone working with toehold switches, so we also discussed   our approach to the code with Pardee, namely how much weight certain parameters in   our scoring function could be attributed.
By chance we met the Oxford iGEM team at that very same conference, and it    was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration as they also work on a cell-free    biosensor and we were able to exchange protocols and ideas on improving the    E.Coli lysate reaction later on. However the highlight of this trip was definitely    the one-day workshop on the integration of cell-free biology in the educational    system of the UK. Named “Open Plant curriculum development working group”, this    workshop was an interactive opportunity to discuss the advantages of including    cell-free biology in the UK’s high school curricula and exchange ideas on the    implementation thereof. Our first-hand knowledge of manipulating and making E.Coli    lysate was a good starting point for many conversations, as we were closest to the    target age group and were able to contribute unique points of view.
At the end of the day, we were convinced that cell-free biology will provide    high schools with an amazing tool to explain certain principles of biology    (eg."

We have tried severe approaches to conduct recombinant plasmids to achieve specific goals, for instance, a sequence specialized to a very narrow group of metal ions can be integrated to a chassis cell, hence the chassis can obtain some new functions. Just as what we had intended to achieve, when we transmit particular sequence identifying specialized metal ions by varies plasmids, we shall find the way on engineering. Furthermore, our matched devices which will do some detections through the usage of micro fluidics can also be engineered. The chips we used can be reformed to match with desired purposes as identify different ions toxic in water relying on specific sequences. Another thing we should pay more attention to is that the devices can be more general and popular. Because of the advantages as portable, automatic and inexpensive. So it is not so hard to popularize the devices to the public, for example people who are interested in field survival activities. Anyway, there is more possible to encounter difficulties , that you need to detect the water quality to make true whether it is drinkable or not. In other circumstance, water being polluted when catastrophe happened, like earth quake. In this case, the correct and portable method to detect water source quality is really vital. Our devices can be considered absolutely. Concluded, we can still make further application on the devices.

4 Examining the behavioral change of individual worms
5 Alcohol addiction
6 Future Plan
In our project, we want to study the neural network activity and behavioral response of Caenorhabditis elegans with orthogonal optogenetic stimulation of two neurons.
So far, we have achieved almost all of our project objectives, building a platform to study the learning behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans. The whole project is demonstrated in the following parts:
Choosing the suitable excitation wavelength of light-sensitive proteins
Genetic integration of synthetic circuits  into C.elegans strains
Examining the functions of AWA and AWB neurons
Using Microfluidic device to examine the behavioral change of individual worms
Training C.elegans to be addicted to alcohol
Choosing the suitable excitation wavelength
Expression of two types of channelrhodopsins in two pairs of receptor neurons enables worm to be attracted by blue light and be repelled by red light. At the same time, we plan to use GEM-GECO as calcium indicator to examining the neuron activation, and perform feedback control in the future.
To avoid potential crosstalk, we need to separate the excitation wavelengths of CoChR activation and GEM-GECO imaging. In our project, we chose 395nm and 470nm to activate CoChR and GEM-GECO.
Before the experiment in worms, we conducted a validation experiment on CHO-K1 cell line  expressing CoChR to identify a suitable excitation wavelength for the light-sensitive ion channel.
Fig.1 Results of experiment for CoChR spectrum determination. In the experiment ,we expressed CoChR in the CHO-K1 cell line and R-GECO is used to detect the calcium influx into the cell. A) This figure shows that R-GECO in cells are activated"

Spencer Chen
Some people think Spencer is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Spencer can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Spencer however, is definitely the meaner twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Spencer likes to read Ancient Greek and Roman literature, which has limited to no real-world application to his life. He is however, passionate about immunology and genetics research. He is a freak of nature with many bodily disorders. For example, his arms and legs are different lengths. He idolizes Thomas Keller and secretly wants to drop out and make haute cuisine for a living.
Steven Chen
Some people think Steven is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Steven can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Steven however, is definitely the nicer twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Steven is also strangely obsessed with all things Medieval Europe but that is about all that makes him interesting; he is actually a really boring person. His research interests are in the field of biochemistry, cell biology, biomedical engineering-- though why these interest him I couldn’t begin to understand. Steven really likes eating bread. He likes his bread plain, just like his personality.
Maneesh Gupta
A true Renaissance man, and a true ladies man. Any task you give Maneesh, from PCR to programming, will be done flawlessly. Just don’t try to get him to leave his house in the process. He’s the master of all things barbecue and Boolean, tasty and triangulated, mathematical and manly. But vegetarians beware, he's Maneesh Gupta, and he’s so delicious.
