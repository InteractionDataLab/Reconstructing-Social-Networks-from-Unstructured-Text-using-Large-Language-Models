2. The creation of a succinct explanation of TnrA activation, according to current literature.
3. The creation of a dynamic model for B. subtilis suitable for flux balance analysis which responds to environmental cues.
Quantification of Initial Medium Composition
Purpose
The B. subtilis within the sticker must go through distinct phases under defined time constraints. The only way to control the amount of biomass, and its behavior, is through the initial medium concentration. The containment unit does not contain any time-release capsules for providing a controlled level of nutrients.

Constrained FBA Model
The constrained model used for flux balance/variability analysis was developed by adding thermodynamic data from the eQuilibrator     database to iBsu1103 developed by Henry et al.. The article provided the model in SBML format. Subsystem information was    contained in the article's supplementary information. libSBML was used to load the SBML model into MATLAB. Custom functions were    used to (1) assign subsystems to reactions, (2) correlate thermodynamic data with metabolites, (3) to calculate the Gibbs     energies of reaction, and (4) to convert the model to GDX; the format required for running FBA and FVA in GAMS.
The resulting model was composed thusly:
Compartments:
Cytosol and Extracellular
Metabolites:
1138 (852 have listed Gibbs energy of formation)
Reactions:
1681 = 1157 intracompartmental (763 with Gibbs energy of reaction) + 244 exchange with medium + 280 transport between compartments
Reaction Subsystems:
Amino Acids and Derivatives
Biomass
Carbohydrates
Cell Wall and Capsule
Cofactors, Vitamins, Prosthetic Groups, Pigments
Exchange
Fatty Acids and Lipids
Macromolecular Synthesis
Membrane Transport
Metabolism of Aromatic Compounds
Nucleosides and Nucleotides

Restriction Digestion, Antarctic Phosphatase, & Ligation
Determine the order of the two parts you will be putting together; the one in front will be referred to as the insert, while the one behind will be referred to as the vector.  Both the vector and the insert need to have their own separate tube, at least in the beginning.

Ongoing Experiments
Sequencing
By plating store-bought kombuchas onto a variety of media plates, we were able to isolate several microbial colonies. These colonies were harvested and made into frozen stocks for future use. Fresh cultures were innoculated with these isolated strains and allowed to grow until turbid. Using a genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation kit (Invitrogen), DNA was extracted from these unknown microbes. Two PCR reactions were performed for each microbe using the appropriate isolated gDNA as a template and bacterial primers (selects for bacteria and targets the 16s rRNA gene) or fungal primers (selects for fungi and targets ITS rRNA gene). The purpose of these reactions was to determine whether each isolated species was bacterial or fungal. The PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and those that yielded products in the gel were PCR purified using BioBasic and sent to UT's ICMB Sequencing Core Facility for sequencing (using Sanger sequencing). The resulting sequences were identified using the Ribosomal Database Project.
Conjugation
Ethanol Screening
Different strains of L. fermentati, a yeast isolated from kombucha, were plated onto YPD plates containing bromothymol blue. Additionally, S. cerevisiae with ADH (ethanol producing gene) knocked out was plated using these plates. Bromothymol blue changes color according to acidity, which was used as a proxy for measuring ethanol production by these different strains. This method of ethanol screening was ultimately abandoned because of its imprecise nature and out inexperience with genetically modifying eukaryotes. We are now exploring the possibility of modifying the ADH and ALDH genes in Ga. hansenii to have a higher rate of conversion of ethanol to acetic acid.
Recapitulation
pH Detection
Moving away from the tested BioBrick promoters, the pH angle has changed to focus on the organism Gluconobacter oxydans and how native sequences to this organism may lead to better integration with a pH detector. As detailed in our results section, three upstream regions of three difference loci in G. oxydans have been identified, made to be Golden Gate compatible"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#iGEMCommunity_-_-_TEXT.html," very pleased that we got this opportunity to get in contact with another team! It has been really nice and we are all looking forward to meet the Czech Republic team in Boston!
The Nordic iGEM Conference
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is getting to know new people with whom you can discuss ideas and collaborate as well as make new friends. As a step towards this, the Chalmers-Gothenburg team has participated in the Nordic iGEM Conference, NiC. This was an initiative by the Uppsala and Stockholm iGEM teams who collaborated in the hosting of this event. The conference took place between the 24th and the 26th of July at the Uppsala University, and all ten iGEM teams of the Nordic countries were invited. It was a great weekend with very constructive discussions as well as a lot of fun.
On the day of arrival, a welcoming BBQ was arranged in the evening, allowing all the teams to socialise and get to know each other. The evening offered amazing food and a range of fun games, making for a great start of the conference. The next day was when the main event of the NiC took place, namely the presentations of the projects. All the teams had selected one member who would be part of a NiC jury, which in the end would determine which project and presentation would be crowned the winner of the NiC, and be awarded with the highly sought-after Golden Pipette. However, the main intention behind the presentations was to give the teams some practice for the upcoming presentations in Boston.
All the teams, including the jury, were then allowed to ask questions on each project which also was meant to be as preparation for the Q&A which follows the presentations at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. This part of the NiC was very useful and provided a lot of interesting feedback on our project, and also letting us understand the struggles and successes the other teams faced in a very constructive way.
Later that same day, the next part of the NiC was held, which encompassed different workshops that allowed the teams to compare and reflect on various iGEM experiences. The workshop topics included:
1. Awesome solutions for the lab. This workshop aimed to address solutions to technical problems in the lab, and let the teams share their experiences in this area.
2. The future of iGEM technology. This workshop allowed the participants to speculate on current and future technologies which could be used in the iGEM competition.
3. Unsolved ethics: Is your project suitable for supervillains? In this workshop the participants could"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"
Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#HumanBody_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration
Figure 4: x-axis: time in minutes, y-axis: concentration in µmol. Concentration over time of medicine within the human body according to the model.
In the human animations you see the difference in concentration for each organ. The tumor is represented as a small piece of the small intestine. The skin represents the slowly perfused tissue and the heart the rapidly perfused tissue. for the veins the left larger veins represents the venous blood, while the right smaller veins represents the arterial blood. On the right you'll see the colour bar with corresponding values in µmol.
Conclusion
The treatment with the medicine packaged VLPs shows promising results. As seen in the figures / movies above, there is an increase in VLP concentration in the tumor. When the VLPs are breaking apart, medicine is released, resulting in a 3-4 times higher concentration compared to the healthy tissues as seen in figure 4.
If we compare the results of our treatment with the conventional treatment figure 2 we see a few things:
The organs get an initial shock of medicine through the body with the conventional treatment, while with our treatment the medicine is released slowly
With our treatment the concentration of the medicine is higher in the tumor according to our model than conventional treatment
The medicine remains longer within the tumor when using our treatment in comparison to the conventional treatment which is due to the slow release of medicine.
Medicine concentration remains low in healthy tissue with our treatment, possibly reducing side effects
We find the comparison promising, this shows that our treatment is superior compared to the conventional method according to this method in multiple areas:
A low concentration of medicine in healthy tissue
Longer exposure of the medicine in the tumor
No initial dosage shock

Simulation for our Team by Eindhoven
Team Eindhoven’s project and our LLPs project have a lot of similarities (see our collaboration for more information). Apart from experimenting with their idea they also used a newly designed and a rule-based model system to simulate their experiments outcome more accurately. Through our collaboration they agreed to helping us modelling our system for a better insight into the protein-protein interactions during LLPs.
The first approximation was the concentration of our protein in the yeast cells. Team Eindhoven found a rough estimation of a range, which was 0.1 - 1.4 μM. They therefore set the initial concentration to be 0.5 μM, which lies somewhere in between. For the association rate, we took the same as team Eindhoven used for their simulation, namely 10-5 as found in the paper of Schlosshauer [1].
The known information of the system includes the molecular weight of the protein, being 60.4 kDa and the droplet size, with an average diameter of 1.19 μm, measured by fluorescence microscopy. The weight of a single molecule can be used to approximate the volume of a single molecule with Protein Volume = 1.21 * Molecular Weight [2].  This leads us to a volume of 73.084 Å3 per molecule. As 10 Å = 1 nm this means that 73.084 Å3 = 73.1*10-3 nm3 per molecule.
Like the formula for the volume of the protein, there is a formula for the volume of spheres, which is more generally known, and defined as Volume Sphere = 4/3π * r3. Using this formula,"

We helped HKUST team’s progress by providing them a Cython-implemented Python interface. It enables them to use the ViennaRNA package functions(written in C language) in Python interface, so they can easily model the dissociation constant for the antisense mRNA and transcript mRNA. We also help characterizing their biobricks by running an GFP assay, detailed protocol and results attached below. In return, they provided us two Python scripts for our modelling of free energies of opened and closed toehold switches, by plotting ODE-based model and stochastic model using Euler’s method and Gillespie algorithm respectively. This facilitates our screening of optimal toehold switches in our program.
Below showed the test result of the characteriation of 6 biobricks provided by Hong Kong HKUST team. (Detailed interpretation of data is in their wiki )The biobricks were incubated with varying concentrations of AHT and measured the GFP fluorescence with COSTAR plate reader. Only pSB1C3-BBa_F2620-C0261-E0240-R0063-Anti2 shows a positive trend with increasing AHT concentration. In contrast, Hong Kong HKUST team's own results show a positive trend with pSB1C3_BBa_T9002.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html,"loop via EPO
The natural release of EPO from the kidneys depends on the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. If the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood decreases due to a lack of red blood cells, more EPO is released. This leads to an increase in red blood cell production, leading to a higher population of circulating red blood cells and a higher partial pressure of oxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen and the number of circulating red blood cell are therefore assumed to be proportional.
The amount \(E^{end}_{in}(t)\)  of EPO released by the kidney can be estimated by the use of the total population of red blood cells \(RBCs(t)\), which consist of all circulating red blood cells. The equation that governs the natural release of EPO uses a scaled red blood cell count with TBVbeing the total blood volume, and is shown below:
$$ EPO^{end}_{in}(t) = \bigg(\frac{(a_3 - b_3)}{1+e^{k_3 \times \tilde{M}(t) - c_3}}+b_3\bigg)\ \times \frac{1}{TBV} \tag{37} $$
$$ \tilde{M}(t) = 10^{-8} \times \frac{RBCs(t)}{TBV} \tag{38} $$
Figure 19. The effect of red blood cell population on the release of EPO from the kidneys. The units of EPO released from kidneys is mU per ml per day.
The behavior of the endogenous EPO concentration Eend(t) in plasma is modeled by the following ordinary differential equation:
$$\frac{dEPO_{end}(t)}{dt} = EPO^{end}_{in}(t) - k_{deg\,protein\,extracellular}EPO_{end}(t) \tag{39}$$
When gene doping has been administered, the concentration of gene doping EPO at a given time is given by Equation 19. It is assumed that the degradation of natural EPO and gene doping EPO occurs at the same rate. The overall concentration of EPO in plasma consists of the naturally produced erythropoietin and the administered gene doping EPO:
$$ EPO(t) = EPO_{end}(t) + EPO_{doping}(t) \tag{40}$$

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#News_-_-_TEXT.html," his night"". Mr. Stelmach was the guest speaker. In his speech he referenced me on a first name basis multiple times. Many questions directed towards him were asking about cuts to post secondary funding. In his responses he used our team as an example stating ""Justin's work on tailings ponds is a great example of funding in Alberta at work and going towards great projects."" He used us as an example of the importance of creating a knowledge based economy based in Alberta's youth.
Clint Dunford praised us of our effort in our efforts to clean-up the tailings ponds. He has served as Minister of Alberta Advanced Education and Career Development, Minister of Alberta Human Resources and Employment and Minister of Economic Development, and he was responsible for the Personnel Administration Office, the Alberta Labour Relations Board, Workers Compensation Board, and Appeals Commission for Alberta Workers Compensation. He was a very interesting person to meet, and to see him get excited about our project was great!
Daniel Weeks, Vice President of Research (U of L). Daniel wishes to keep in touch with our team and our progress. He requested updates about aGEM and he would also like to be a guest for this years aGEM jamboree.
Robert Ellis, New Dean of Management at the U of L. He stressed the importance of creating a strong relationship between management students and science students. We all agreed that bringing a management student into the team would be beneficial. We will keep in touch with him.
Rick Casson, Member of Parliament Canadian Federal Government, Lethbridge Constituency. We made Rick aware of what we do and who we are. He was impressed with our work. He was also happy to hear that Alberta Government and Oil Sands funding was going towards Alberta's youth working on one of Alberta's largest environmental issues.
Paul Walz, Graduate Students Associate President (Kolvachuk Lab). It was a nice talking to someone who new a lot about molecular biology. He wished us good luck and was interested in our project.
At the end of the evening Mike Mahon found us again and told us how much of a positive impact we made on the premier and how we made his trip to Lethbridge that much more special. He definitely wants to keep in touch and he thinks our team is doing great things for the University of Lethbridge.

Events
We were also fortunate enough this year to have been given the opportunity to run our workshops at two different outreach events, both of which were on a grand  scale. Now, we'd like to share our experiences with you.
Grade 12 Outreach Workshop: March 25th, 2011
The first was an organized Grade 12 workshop aimed at biology students to gain a better understanding of synthetic biology, the industries it has been affecting, career prospects as well as two hands-on activities. Over the planning span of 3 months, this event was organized in close accordance with the Kitchener-Waterloo school board and with the Marketing and Recruitment Co-ordinator for Science at the University of Waterloo. Through the creation of a brochure and meeting with individuals from the school board we had sent out an invitation all across the district for students to come in for our event. Eventually we had gotten more than 85 students to attend, which was great as it was the first time we had implemented this idea.
The next step had then been to recruit interested volunteers for the event so we could have our own students give a helping hand and who shared the same passion of sharing knowledge as we did. In order to facilitate this we had sent out emails, gone to various lectures and talked to students all over campus to get them involved. After recruiting 12 volunteers the brainstorming process had begun. We had wanted to have an interactive workshop where students were not just listening to us talk, but were actually involved in a stimulating activity that they could be excited about. The first part of our presentation looked into what was synthetic biology, what were Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and what were the positives and negatives of them. Once that was through we started the first event.   The first event we"

Nutrient Starvation
A dramatic drop in the concentration of GTP and GDP correlates with the onset of sporulation, and inhibition of GMP synthesis by decoyinine treatment induces sporulation in the absence of nutrient starvation. CodY has recently been identified as the key sensor of guanine nucleotide levels. Disruption of the codY gene allows sporulation to occur in the presence of excess nutrients, and the ability of the CodY repressor to bind DNA correlates with the GTP concentration. As a consequence, when GTP levels drop upon entry into stationary phase, CodY-regulated genes are derepressed. Microchip array analysis has identified phrA, phrE, and kinB, all positive regulators of the phosphorelay, as targets of CodY repression. Therefore, one way that nutrient starvation is integrated into the decision to sporulate is transcriptional regulation of phosphorelay components via CodY. In addition, sporulation is also subject to catabolite repression and requires a functioning Krebs cycle, although the molecular basis of these dependencies is unknown.[1]

Bigger, better, faster, stronger
We found we could not extract enough DNA from the registry, so we are upgrading the extraction to the ""bigger, better, faster, stronger"" method.
Warm 50μL of EB in Eppendorf tubes at 50°C and add 4 punched spots. Keep it warming at 50°C for 20mins and spin down for 3 minutes at 15,000 g. Warm agin for 10mins and spin down again for 3mins. Pipette off the liquid which should have the DNA in. We then confirmed with PCR.
Each sample except the control was then put through 34 cycles of PCR. The following were added to eppendorf tubes:
5μL of DNA in EB buffer
2.5μL of each primer for Biobrick vectors
25μL of Finnzymes mastermix
15μL of sterile distilled water
And all 50μL were then run through the PCR reaction and 17μL of product run on an E-Gel with 3μL dye.
The results gave large amounts of DNA in each lane for all Biobricks except F. The original extracts of G,H,I,J,K and L were then used for the following transformations.
To chilled tubes add 5μL of DNA + EB solution to 5μL of Cells ( Chemically competent Top 10 )
Ice for 30 minutes  Heat shock at 42°C for 60 seconds  Ice for 2 minutes  Add 500μL of SOC  Incubate at 37°C overnight

On est alors capable de connaître le nombre de cellules cancéreuses détruites pour 100 vecteurs cellulaires ou 1 vecteur tissulaire .
La vitesse de diffusion du vecteur cellulaire est égale à 0,5µm.s-1 or la taille d’un capillaire sanguin est de 10µm de diamètre. La particule la plus éloignée met donc 10s à atteindre la paroi du vaisseau.
Grâce à cette ‘’’durée de diffusion’’’ (10s) et à la ‘’’vitesse du flux sanguin’’’ (1x10^3µm.s-1) dans les capillaires, et à la surface d’une cellule cancéreuse (1 µm²) on peut déterminer :
La’’’ longueur (L)’’’ couverte par les vecteurs cellulaires libérés par un vecteur tissulaire
La ‘’’surface (S)’’’ occupée par les phages dans un vaisseau sanguin de diamètre 2r.
La quantité de cellules cancéreuses accessibles.
L = 1 x 10^4 µm
2r = 10 µm
S = 2 π x L x r = 31,4 x 10^4 µm²
Ainsi, un vecteur tissulaire peut potentiellement cibler plus de 31 000 cellules cancéreuses, or, il ne possède que 100 vecteurs cellulaires. On peut effectuer une simplification en disant que 100 vecteurs cellulaires détruisent 100 cellules cancéreuses. L’efficacité de la dispersion est donc totale.
Pour le phage, une fois la paroi atteinte, entre en jeu l’internalisation cellulaire. Ce modèle répond à deux schémas d’action.

E. Chrono
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in Escherichia coli to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.
The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals:
Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design.
Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices.
Fabricate and test microfluidic designs.
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.

Experimental setup
10-beta E. coli cells were transformed with GFP constructs under the control of different promoters: J23151-GFP (positive control), R0040-GFP (negative control), Pblind-GFP or not transformed (WT). J23151 is a constitutive promoter, R0040 is a TetR repressible promoter (repression inhibited only by the addition of tetracycline), Pblind promoter is a fusion of EL222 (photosensitive transcription factor) binding region and the luxI promoter, where EL222 is only able to dimerize and bind the Pblind promoter upon blue light exposure, where it can then recruit RNAP and drive the transcription of genes downstream.
Colony PCR was used to identify successful transformants. For each construct, 3 of the identified colonies were aliquoted into 5ml of growth media (LB media with 25ug/ml Chloromphenicol), and grown overnight at 37°C in darkness (covered in aluminium foil) or exposed to blue light (465nm). Each biological replicate was then diluted in LB to OD600=0.6. 200μLx4 of each biological replicate were aliquoted into a black flat bottom 96 well plate. LB media with 25ug/ml Chloromphenicol was also aliquoted for fluorescence baseline determination. The fluorescence of all repeats along with the LB was measured using a Tecan Safire 2 Multi-Mode Plate Reader.
Results and Analysis
Figure 1. Blue light inducible promoter (Pblind) characterisation. J23151 is a constitutive promoter, R0040 is a TetR repressible promoter (repression inhibited only by the addition of tetracycline), Pblind is a promoter activated by EL222 upon blue light exposure. Wild type (WT) 10beta cells were transformed with J23151-GFP (positive control), R0040-GFP (negative control) or Pblind-GFP. J23151 is a constitutive promoter, R0040 is a TetR repressible promoter and Pblind promoter is a fusion of EL222 binding region and the luxI promoter. All cells were either grown in the dark or under blue light overnight. GFP fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Safire 2 Multi-Mode Plate Reader.

Our team believes that modelling is critically important for the success of a project, and have therefore used it extensively throughout all aspects of our project. Modelling is a very useful technique for a variety of reasons. Firstly, modelling a system before carrying out experiments is a great way to avoid wasting time and reagents in the lab. This is very valuable during projects that are time-constricted, such as the iGEM competition for example! Modelling a pathway before attempting to get experimental results also highlights any potential issues in the system, and helps target areas of interest within your chosen pathway. Any unusual results found after experimental work has been completed can sometimes be explained using modelling approaches.
We wanted to share our enthusiasm for modelling with the wider iGEM community, and feel there is currently no resource of teams to easily find out about the basics of modelling. At the YSB 1.0 conference, we discussed this with other teams and they agreed with us on this issue. Therefore we collaborated with the University of York and the University of Newcastle to produce tutorial videos on three different modelling softwares, explaining what each software is used for and the basics of how to use them.
The Registry of Standard Biological Parts already has a number of protocols for various standard wetwork methods. We hope that one day, a similar concept could be introduced to modelling.
Modelling in 'R'
In this video, the University of York team discuss the pros and cons of different types of modelling software that teams could potentially used for their model. This is followed by an introduction to the concept of delayed differential equations, and a guide showing how R can be used to to model them.
COPASI
COPASI (COmplex PAthway SImulator) is open-source piece of software that can be used to model a wide range of biological systems, including metabolic networks and cell signalling pathways. In this video, the University Of Manchester team show you how to get started with COPASI by firstly creating a simple model of the first two reactions in the glycolysis pathway, followed by how to analyse something more complex
BioNetGen
BioNetGen is often applied on rule-based modelling of biochemical networks utilizing the RuleBender interface. This video by Newcastle University team provides a brief tutorial on how to build a basic model on a reaction between a substrate and enzyme.

The humanity in synthetic biology
A big part of participating in iGEM is spreading the word of synthetic biology and its applications. Therefore, we have done a lot of outreach. We have talked with different sectors of the society, e.g. high school students and laymen. We also reached out to experts and companies in order to get their point of view on Bacto-Aid. The feedback from both students and the industry has broaden our perspective. By integrating these new parts and insights into our project, we were brought a step closer to a desireable product. The industrial interest in the project has caught the attention of LEGO®, who wishes to meet us after the Jamboree.
Even though we have achieved awesome results, there is still a lot of work to be done before Bacto-Aid becomes a reality. For potential commercialization the project needs further optimization of the different systems. Especially a successful integration of bacteriocins into the recombinant spider-silk and the design of a feasible PHB production- and extraction system. The individual constituents of the project have each great potential for an integration into our daily lives. The entire plan for Bacto-Aid can be read in Prospects and the applications of the individual sub elements can be found in Perspectives.
We have likewise discussed the bioethical arguments in our project. The appeal to utility is an argument focused on an action's singular or multiple consequences for the society. We used this while reflecting on how Bacto-Aid can be a part of the future and what impact it will leave on the society.

As a new approach to sharing our science with the general public at large, we took our science to the streets of Scotland's capital and dramatised our project as buskers in the WORLD FAMOUS Edinburgh International Festival Fringe! Our story follows a juggler who, having problems with his natural balance, enlists the help of a young scientist who uses a variety of different props to help him restore it. Our aim was create a fun show which illustrated some key points on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, and also informed the public of what our project hoped to achieve. We hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed performing it!

LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," transformed with a helper plasmid harboring genes encoding the λ-Red enzymes, I-SceI endonuclease, and RecA. λ-Red enzymes expressed from the helper plasmids are used to recombine a small ‘landing pad’, a tetracycline resistance gene (tetA) ﬂanked by I-SceI recognition sites and landing pad regions, into the desired location in the chromosome. After tetracycline selection for successful landing pad integrants, the cell is transformed with a donor plasmid carrying the desired insertion fragment; this fragment is excised by I-SceI and incorporated into the landing pad via recombination at the landing pad regions.[2] We think this more effective and easy method would help them overcome the problem. So, we recommended TJU to adopt the two-step λ-Red method to knock out the pflB gene.
After their reconstruction of the engineered strain, a more visible contrast was shown as below.

In order to prove the cell can work normally, we tested the knock-out cell’s production of lactate in our lab. The result is shown in the figure below.

Conclusion [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Even if we could not give the proof by our own experiments, many studies show that to bring a wild-type version of a tumor suppressor gene into a mutated tumor cell for this gene permits to launch the apoptosis. In vivo studies on Human in the framework of the prostate, ovary and lung cancers have already been hold and present convincing results.
The implementation of this study has been originally done to determine if the DVS , application in the fight against non small cell lung cancer, is feasible or not. Because we have not been able to conclude, the implementation of the study has been done by analyzing several publications. According to these publications, the application is first confirmed in the framework of the chosen pathology but it can also be reached to others cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, on which the fact to bring a gene suppressor of tumor launch the apoptosis process. The only limitation is set by the tissue vector tropism.

The key aim for Human Practices is to get a security license for our DIYbio event - without which we may have to downsize the scope of our event, and to confirm guests for our radio show. Our competition Poster is also making progress, and Carina and Aurelija will be meeting this week to ensure its completion. Finally, Rhiannon is aiming to finalise the application for the Transnatural Conference, which is due this week.
Monday 9th July
Wet Lab. - Using our batch of competent cells, we transformed the seven biobricks today, using the standard protocol. This included mainly promoters required across all of our modules
Sponsorship. - Bethan was in contact with Promega, Mendeley and Lonza today and confirmed shipment of our in-kind products. These are eagerly awaited by the lab.
Poster - Carina arranged to meet Aurelija and Rhiannon this afternoon to discuss the design of the poster. So far we have a background with an artistic representation of the principles of our project, the design of the heading, and a provisional layout of the content.
Modelling. - Erin, Joanne and Aurelija continued to work on the degradation equation and GUI, with the particular aim of finding a interactive visual way in which to present the data.
Human Practice - Yeping emailed Jane Calvert from Edinburgh University to get some feedback on the DIYbio event. There is still uncertainty as to whether we will get the permission to proceed with this event, which is unfortunate as it would be a great means of extended Synthetic Biology into the community. Jane Calvert replied that it was a great idea and would certainly add value to the project, which has encouraged us to persist.

In our case, when ammonia levels are low the bacterium undergoes some metabolic changes. Within these changes, there are some related to nitrogen assimilation and processing, so our construction, which responds to low ammonia levels, increases its transcription.
How did we deal with this construction?We developed a nitrogen-gradation tube experiment, which means that we added different (NH4)2SO4 concentrations to each tube, so we can measure a gradation of the protein fluorescence. We used a synthetic medium for this.

OXYGEN-REGULATED PROMOTER
This construction has two parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green) protein. We chose as the promoter sequence the one of the nirB gene, because it is 100% dependent      on FNR [1,2], which is the transcription factor activated when there is no oxygen in the environment. It is involved mainly in cellular respiration and carbon metabolism      during anaerobic cell growth.
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain this green fluorescent protein one condition is required: anaerobic conditions should be met. We grew the bacteria in a oxygen-controlled environment [3].
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: the promoter is activated when there is a lack of O2 in the environment thanks to a family"

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of"

We therefore deduce that protein splicing has taken place with the LOV domain constructs. However, the samples that were illuminated for 12 hours show significantly less overall expression than the corresponding sample induced for 4 hours. We hypothesise this is caused by protein degradation or a long-time phototoxic effect that we did not detect in our phototoxicity test. As the non-illuminated control for the 4 hour time point is missing, no clear result for the effect of light induction could be derived yet.
Figure 8) FACS analysis of mRFP expression cultures
Samples from left to right: LB, LOV-6, BL21, coex*, coex,  C, N, IDE-CHT, WT, LOV-12
Very interestingly, the FACS analysis of our mRFP cultures revealed a curious behaviour. The mutated (non-splicing) mRFP coexpression samples very obviously show more fluorescence than the splicing samples.
This is supported by fluroescent microscopy pictures, where the supposedly non splicing variants is stronger in fluorescence than the splicing variant (Figure 9).
Figure 9) The non-splicing variant shows stronger fluorescence than the splicing variant
Panel A: Bacteria transformed with both of the non splicing variants, a strong fluorescence is visible. Panel B: Transformation of the splicing variants results only a mild fluorescence.
Discussion
In the context of these experiments, we designed a new approach to regulate intein splicing via light induction. The connection between caging peptides and intein splicing was so far not established in literature. However, this application becomes only possible by the discovery of very small, artificially created C-inteins. We successfully managed to verify the splicing reaction of SspDnaX in the context of split mRFP. However, we were surprised by the low efficiency of the splicing reaction depicted on the Western Blot. Looking deeper in the original papers, we saw that also the authors did not archive higher amount of splicing product using SspDnaX [11]. The usage of split mRFP 168/169 failed as easy read-out of intein splicing, since the the non-splicing samples turned out to be brighter than the splicing construct. It could be due to sterically inhibition caused by the splicing reaction at position 168/169 compared to the flexible assembly by the mere proximity of the split halves. However the reconstitution of m"

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Parts
The iGEM parts registry includes more than 20,000 BioBricks. The standardized form of BioBricks are the basis so all present and future iGEM teams can build on existing BioBricks to achieve their projects. This year we integrated more than 50 existing BioBricks into our project and we submitted more than 80 BioBricks. Further iGEM teams can realize their project by building on our BioBricks.
All of our submitted basic parts are listed in Table 1.
We are very proud of our favorite basic part BBa_K2638002 , an impressive copper importer.
The best composite of our team BBa_K2638703 is a second generation targed vector for siRNA silencing. All other composite parts are listed in table 2.
Our part improvement is a modified human ferritin BBa_K2638999 . The human ferritin was submitted by iGEM Calgary in 2013 and is an iron storage protein. We changed certain amino acid residues to add the ability to form silver and gold nanoparticles.
During our project we had to deal with gene expression, which requires a certain promoter strength. To enable a comparison of different promoter strengths, we developed a measurement vector. Furthermore, we characterized the system with our promoter-RBS library. The vector and the library are submitted as best part collection . The BioBricks are: BBa_K2638560 and BBa_K2638400 - BBa_K2638426.

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html," southern hemisphere’s largest city. Reservoirs of the Cantareira system that supply 45% of the city fell to 9.7% capacity, an unprecedented low. Conflict ignited between Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, the country’s three most prosperous – and most severely water stressed – states. Sao Paulo controversially diverted water from the Paraiba de Sul in order to supply the Cantareira system, by reducing the flow of the Jaguari River (a tributary to the Paraiba de Sul). Paraiba de Sul is one of the major water and energy supplies of Rio de Janeiro.
This move violated a federal pact between the three states, made due to fears water transfer to the Cantaneira system may have adverse effect on the environmental, economic and social balance of all three states.
The disagreement recently reached the Supreme Court and eventually concluded with Sao Paulo reducing water flow in two of its dams and Rio de Janeiro reducing water capture from the Paraiba de Sul river basin (International Law Office 2014).
The Cantaneira system that supplies 45% of Sao Paulo with water, here seen after the recent droughts (guardian.com)
Many conflicts stem from large areas and communities relying on a single, shared water supply. In addition to preventing overexploitation it is helpful to provide communities with alternative, more local purification solutions to empower them and give control of their own resources (Faeth and Weinthal 2012)
The map displays nearly 2,000 incidents, involving conflict and collaboration alike, over shared river basins from 1990 to 2008. The circles in the sidebar compare about 2,200 events—including another 200 disputes over resources other than shared rivers—from the same period.

Social implications
It is predicted that within the next 15 years, more than half of the world’s population will be living under severe water stress (OECD 2012). So far, water scarcity has been an issue for individuals and families living in poverty, while most in the developed world enjoy reliable, plentiful access to safe water. As the stress increases, it will hit many of us who were previously unaffected but the majority of the hardship will continue to fall on the worlds poorest.

There are further issues arising from water accessibility and sanitation regarding gender inequality. In developing countries significant responsibility for acquisition and distribution of water is placed upon women and children of the family. Diff"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"

Ligations
Preparation:
Calculate your ligase concentration by estimation of DNA concentration from your restriction gel.
Which vector to use?
Material:
Prepare ligation mix with a total volume of 20 μl
2 μl 10x Buffer
Parts to be ligated: vector+insert 1:5, DNA conc. less than 50 ng
fill up with water
1 μl ligase
control (no insert)
Add ligase and keep mix at RT for 1h.
To inactivate the ligase place your mix at 65ºC for 10 min.
Store on ice.
Before starting on the ligation(s), always run your digestion products after you’ve performed a clean-up/purification on a gel to verify you actually have been successful in your digestions.
If you want to be very precise with your DNA-content calculations, when running the gel you can load the DNA-ladder sequentially with a difference of 2-fold dilution.
If your digestions were successful and you are happy with the way your gel looks, you are set to start your ligation calculations.
Firstly, make sure you have a DNA-ladder illustration indicating the mass of DNA at different positions on the gel, then compare the intensity of bands of your digested products with the intensity and position of the bands from the DNA-ladder(s).
The same intensity of bands indicates they must have the same mass of DNA.
After you have determined how much DNA (mass) you have of each band, you can calculate the DNA content on a mole basis by dividing the mass with the length of the fragment.   In general a ligation-mix should look like this:
Usually a ligation mix should have a total volume of 20 μl, although if you require additional amounts of the same ligation, make a duplicate of the ligation you are trying to make.
The buffer needed is simply called “10x ligation buffer”, and being 10 times concentrated, you need to add 1/10th of the total volume of buffer. Hence if the total volume is 20 μl, you need to add 2 μl of your 10x ligation buffer.
The amount of DNA added should conform to the calculations you made from the gel you ran with your digested products. A rule of thumb should be that you take more insert than vector, this way increasing your chances of actually getting a ligation. The ratio of insert to vector should be 5:1 and the total amount of DNA should not exceed 50 ng.

SCREENING
April – May
We found some literatures for our Screening Project and combine some projects from previous team. We decided to use Golden Gate Assembly from Freiburg team 2012 to synthesis our TALE. Our screening kit is related to Calgary team 2013 model but we use AmylCP reporter from UPPSALA team 2011 .
June-July
The TALE and AmylCP will be linked by E coil and K coil that created by Calgary team 2013 , so we ordered them from IGEM. The bio bricks stocks is limited so we have to clone them, we transformed them to E. coli competent cell. In the beginning we use local strain E. coli but the cells has low efficiency.
Figure 1. BBa_J04450 not inserted to local E. coli competent cell bacteria.
August
We made DH5-α competent cell bacteria and test the efficiency with tansform our parts. First trial we succeded to transform our TALE direpeat parts from kit plate 2. We run the isolated plasmid into agarose gel before and after PCR.
Figure 2. The bio bricks were transformed into the new competent cell (DH5-α). Size of the parts are about 2200bp shown in the yellow box.
Figure 3. PCR products after we inserted the parts into DH5-α competent cell. The control band are shown in the K1 and K2 line that related to there is no problem with PCR technique. Only 4I part that successfully amplified.

Plasmid isolation from strains with moaA or cld
Day4: 2016/07/13
Investigator(s): Valentijn Broeken, Wouter Liefting, Lisanne Oosterhoud, Lizah van der Aart
Procedure :      The Plasmid isolation by Alkaline lysis protocol was used to isolate the plasmids from the white colonies grown in liquid LB medium. For 14 cultures, the anticipated insert was cld, and for 14 other cultures this was moaA. No chloroform/phenol extraction was performed.
The isolated plasmids were then dissolved in 50 µl of demi water and the nucleic acid concentration was measured using a Nanodrop, together with the 260/280 ratio (protein contamination) and 260/230 ratio (contamination by salts and solvents).
Results: The Nanodrop values were extremely high. In the follow-up experiment (putting the samples on gel), it turned out that most of it was RNA.
Gel electrophoresis of the isolated moaA or cld plasmids
Day5: 2016/07/14
Investigator(s): Valentijn Broeken
Procedure :      To roughly check whether the anticipated inserts were present in the isolated plasmids, samples were digested with two restriction enzymes flanking the inserts (PstI and EcoRI) and subsequently put on a gel.
For each insert, five samples with high 260/280 and 260/230 ratios (both >1.9) and high nucleic acid concentrations (>2500 ng/µl) were selected.
The digestion was performed in a volume of 20 µl:
11 µl MilliQ
2 µl Restriction buffer 2.1 (NEB)
5 µl Isolated plasmid solution
1 µl PstI
1 µl EcoRI
The mixture was put at 37°C for 1 hour.
A gel containing 1% agarose was made by Lisanne the day before. Of each digestion mixture, 5 µl supplemented with 1 µl purple loading dye (NEB) was put on the gel. The gel run for 55"

About iGEM
International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is an annual world-wide synthetic biology competition aimed at university students. Each year, participating teams from all over the world are challenged to bring their innovative ideas to life by applying engineering methodology in life sciences to ultimately produce “Biobricks” which are modular biological circuit parts that can be utilized to solve global issues.
About us
We are a combination of dedicated graduate and master students from both UCL Cancer Institute and UCL Biochemical Engineering .
About our idea
Improvising activation of the circuit with light, evolve luminescent proteins. Allow preclinical genetic imaging to study endogenous and disease processes in vivo and to image the genetic behaviour of life.

On Oct.25, we did the experiment using the concentrations got from an article dealing with the effects these halides have on epithelial cells (We chose that because up to then, no more related articles had been found by us.), but the results weren’t very good. The concentrations we tested were too low to perform adverse effects on bacteria.

ONE DAY WORKSHOP
Session
Date: July 11, 2015
Venue: LB 4, Library Extension, the University of Hong Kong
Target: 25 F.5 students (Grade 11) from 5 different school
BACKGROUND
School Visit allows primary school students build up a basic concept towards synthetic biology. However, is it enough for Human Practice to come to the end? No. The “transmission” of synthetic biological message to high school students would be another concern because it is the stage when students start to think about what to study in university. Thus, we held a one-day workshop for high school students to develop a more in-depth sense of synthetic biology among them.

“The banana DNA extraction is very interesting, but the talks about genetic engineering is quite confusing...”
“The materials are very detailed...but I feel that the schedule is rather packed for there is no break in between sessions...”
“Writing keys notes on the blackboard when presenting the PowerPoint allows us to know better about the messages… However, to be honest, the discussion session is quite boring. It might be better if the arrangement can be clearer next time...”"

Collaboration with iGEM Chalmers Gothenbourg
In July, requested for help from team iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg.Although we have some experience with using MATLAB, we are not modelling experts. We wanted to model our biosensor for detecting VOCs. Therefore, iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg provided support through skype-meetings. Together with iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg, we conducted a survey covering the public opinion about a mass screening program in both Turkey and Sweden. The results from each country could then be compared to analyze differences in the public opinion about mass screening strategies and how this should be financed. The results of the survey can be found here .

This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

As our project involved improving the way we make biosensors and apply them in the field, we aimed to develop several biosensors, employing different mechanisms, to prove the extended functionality of the final product. To date, most of the biosensors in the registry use an inducible promoter to control expression of their reporter protein. We aim to use some of these as a proof of the compatability of our kit with a theoretical customers' sensors. However, we also explored another mechanism of biosensing in the form of riboswitches. The rationale behind this decision is found on our Design process page, whilst the success of Ribosense can be found"

    From the killing test, we find that although warrior 2 is nearly perfect, but warrior 1 kills itself and is too weak. We modified the gene circuit in order to enhance the performance of warrior 1. We did this through changing promoters and adding the part TetR.

Considering the fact that an antimicrobial peptide expressed in bacteria may be cytotoxic to the host or subjected to degradation by host-derived peptidases [11,12], we used the recombinant expression system to overcome the potential problems ——fusing the DNA coding sequence of CecropinXJ with the sequence of a bacterial thioredoxin gene exists in the pET32a(+) expression system [3,4]. To construct recombinant pET32a-cecropinXJ expression vector (Fig.1B), we used artificially synthetic CecropinXJ synthesized by Tsingke Ltd. (Fig.1A). Subsequently, CecropinXJ and pET32a plasmid were subjected to enzymatic digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase.
Fig.1 Schematic structure of CecropinXJ in pSB1C3(A) and CecropinXJ in pET32a (B).
After that, we selected positive clones which were resistant to ampicillin on LB plate to confirm the plasmid through PCR (Fig.2) and DNA sequencing. The verified recombinant plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLYsS competent cells [8], which encodes a chromosomal T7 RNA polymerase under the control of a tac promoter.
Fig.2 The result of colony PCR confirmed the successful construction of CecropinXJ expression plasmid.
When the optical density at OD600nm of the culture reached 0.6-0.8, we added 0.8mM IPTG to induce the cells, by which time the tac promoter was activated and drove expression of pET32a-CecropinXJ. After 5 hours induction at 37 ̊C, the expression level of recombinant CecropinX"

Modeling
We have modeled several aspects of the project to answer some key questions about our project:
Contents
1 Kinetic Model
2 Reactor Model
3 Codon Optimization
4 Model of Periplasmic Contents for Hello World Pilot Project
5 Protein Models
Kinetic Model
How long will it take to convert ammonia into nitrous oxide?
In order to determine the practicality of our solution, we are applying kinetic modeling to investigate how much time our engineered E. coli cells will take to convert a certain amount of ammonia to nitrous oxide. For ammonia concentrations typically encountered in wastewater, our modelling shows that our transformed E. coli cells will be able to do this within less than 15 minutes.
Go to Kinetic Model
Reactor Model
How large a reactor will we need?
We want to get a first estimate of how large a reactor filled with our transformed E. coli cells must be to treat ammonia polluted wastewater. Since Mutant 2 requires anaerobic conditions, we plan to build two reactors in series. With our model, we find that the second should be around 10 times the size of the first. This is under the assumption that all transformed proteins will be expressed at the same level, so expressing proteins at different levels is something we should look into if we want to avoid a large difference in reactor sizes.
Go to Reactor Model
Codon Optimization
Will we need to codon optimize the N. europaea and P. aeruginosa genes we are expressing in E. coli?
Using the tRNA adaptation index (tAI), we find that the tRNA pools for these organisms are similar enough that we do not need to codon optimize.
Go to Codon Optimization
Model of Periplasmic Contents for Hello World Pilot Project
What fluorescence cross section will the cell have when we express GFP in the periplasm and RFP in the cytoplasm?
We provide a dynamic javascript model that allows parameters of the cellular model to be modified and the results shown in real time.

pT181
The Repressive RNA Switch pT181 attenuator is the extra regulator of our Negative Feedback Loop (NFBL). We are utilizing pT181 attenuator – a dual control repressors – to regulate both gene transcription and translation in a fast and robust way. We have submitted it as our improved part since it increases repression from 84% to 98% compared with that of Kyoto 2013 submitted. As RNA transcriptional regulators are emerging as versatile components for genetic network construction, we believe that improving the part in this library is essential for advancing synthetic biology. We hope our improvement of pT181 attenuator to iGEM parts will encourage future teams to implement this versatile, highly orthogonal, and effective regulator in their circuits.
Key achievements
Characterization of pT181 attenuator  -mediated target gene activation in various conditions.
Improvement of a new sense target sequence of pT181 attenuator.
Update of the BioBrick Registry library by improving a RNA-logic toolset.
Overview
Our engineered cells need a Three-Node Negative Feedback Loop to construct a more sensitive and high-fidelity control system. And pT181 attenuator is the part that plays the role of repressor in this loop.
pT181 attenuator is a part composed of a sense target sequence and an antisense RNA that can regulate gene transcription and translation. Residing in the 5΄ untranslated region of the target gene, it can regulate the expression of a downstream gene at both transcriptional and translational levels.
Fig.16 A schematic representation of the pT181 attenuator in action
At transcriptional level, the anti-terminator, which is a part of the sense target sequence will anneal with the 5’ region of the terminator stem without antisense RNA. In this case, the terminator could not format, which means the RNA polymerase can start transcribe. At translational level, in the absence of antisense RNA, a ribosome binding site (RBS) for the gene of interesting is exposed, so that the ribosome could bind to it to begin translation.
While the antisense RNA is present, the formation of terminator will be allowed as the anti-terminator is sequestered due to the kissing hairpin interaction between the antisense RNA and the sense target sequence. In this way, the downstream transcription will be prevented. As for the translational level, the occlusion of the RBS by the terminator hairpin"

Wash the pellet by adding enough volume of 70–80% ethanol to at least cover the pellet.
Dislodge the pellet by vortexing.
Finally, centrifuge for 30 minutes at maximum speed and decant or aspirate to remove the supernatant (as in previous step).
Dry the pellet with a speed-vac, desiccator or air dry.
Optional: in the beginning you can add glycogen as a carrier, useful if you have low concentration of DNA. To do so, just add 1µL of 20mg/mL glycogen before first or second step.
Note: shorter centrifugation times may decrease yields.
19. CELL FREE MEASUREMENTS
We have used PurExpress in vitro protein synthesis kit from NEB (E6800S), following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. We have used 250ng of DNA template, previously purified by ethanol precipitation.
Note: add DNA right before starting the measurements.
You nee to use a fluorimeter that is set up for kinetics measurements (i.e. PTI Quantamaster 40) and can acquire data using multiple excitation wavelengths simultaneously.
The parameters to take measures are:
| | Excitation | Emission |
| A206K Venus | 485nm | 528nm |
| mCherry | 587nm | 615nm |
Take a measurement every minute for 360 times.           At the end of the measurement you can take also excitation and emission spectra of each protein using the same parameters.

NEON system
NEON system is designed to receive input, amplify through positive feedback then generate output sig-nals, while remaining stringent without stimulation. This is achieved with a double control design that in-volves two interlinked devices, lux positive feedback circuit and CRISPRi. In NEON test system, we built two plasmids, Neon the positive feedback plasmid BBa_K2558214 , and Safety Catch the CRISPRi plasmid BBa_2558215 , BBa_K2558216 and these two are linked by a Ptac/lacI system.
We named the positive feedback plasmid Neon because it is the core element in NEON system, and without Safety Catch inhibition it causes E.coli to produce massive amount of output sfGFP, shining brilliantly like a neon light. The constitutively expressed luxR on neon is able to bind with lux-AHL. LuxR/AHL complex activates lux pR that controls the expression of luxI and sfGFP. LuxI protein is the en-zyme that catalyses the synthesis of lux-AHL, which is going to bind with more luxR protein and further activates lux pR expression, forming a positive feedback loop. However lux pR promoter is not stringent and even the slightest leakage is able to put the positive  feedback loop in action. This is where the safety Catch plasmid comes in. It is designed to prevent undesired leakage expression, like the safety catch on a firearm, keeping Neon in check. Constitutively expressed dCas9 and Ptac controlled gRNA binds just downstream on the lux pR promoters on Neon. The binding interrupts the formation of bacterial initiation complex, silences luxI and sfGFP expression and prevents positive feedback circuit from activation. With lux-AHL stimulation, luxR/AHL complex activates the transcription of lacI on Safety Catch, which binds to Ptac before gRNA and down regulates gRNA transcription. Without gRNA, dCas9 will no longer interfere with lux pR promoters on Neon, and the positive feedback circuit is able to operate without hinder. However, IPTG can relieve lacI inhibition on gRNA by altering lacI conformation, thus silencing the positive feedback circuit on addition"

Discussion
 
How predictive and precise can this model be?
This model lacks lots of details in it, so it can't be a precise model for calculating a steady state for a protein production in bacteria. But the toy model that we presented in the final equations for a gene in our plasmid can be extended and one needs to take into account several factor before extending the model to a more informative one.
Good timing: Since we are using CPP fused to our proteins this could be interesting to consider critical CPP concentrations in bacteria. Because it is hypothesized that CPP can lead to its host's death by penetrating membrane.
Rare codons: Will process stall because of rare codons? The amount of rare codons, and how repetitivet they are is an important factor. (for more information look in [5] and [6])
RNAP: How strong will RNAP bind? and How long is the transcription initiation time? This is very interesting question, since in our model we didn't consider them (because we removed time delays in our final set of equations)
Diffusion time: Do you really need to worry about diffusion? if yes, then this will introduce another type of delay which is usually negligible.
CPP interactions: If your proteins are fused with CPPs, then the only case that you need to take care of is the amount of secretion. So one needs to take care of external concentration and if it is lethal to its host.

The difference in growth between the two negative controls can be explained by the metabolic burden caused by plasmid replication and expression of the chloramphenicol resistance. Therefore, E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 (BBa_K2201004) is the more accurate control, since all samples contain the same plasmid backbone and were also grown in LB media supplemented with chloramphenicol. If not indicated otherwise, pSB1C3-PtNTT2 (BBa_K2201004) was used as the main reference. The difference in growth between strains expressing the native, full length transporter and the truncated version PtNTT2(66-575), observed by Zhang et al. 2017, could also be shown. This negative effect might be associated with the native signal peptide of PtNTT2, which E. coli might not be able to process correctly. Another explanation for the weak growth could be that the native transporter variant has a higher activity compared to the other variants. If the activity is too high, this might lead to a toxic effect and to the observed weak growth. Given that all transporter variants were expressed with the same promotor, this difference in growth cannot be explained by differences in the expression.

Preparation of Competent E. coli Cells
A sample of E. coli DH5ɑ stored at -80℃ was defrosted and inoculated in 5mL of LB in a 125mL conical flask (volume of LB 10% of flask volume so as to achieve sufficient aeration). The culture was left to grow overnight at 37℃.
Re-PCR of DNA Sequences
Two sets of sequences A,B,F,G, I, J, K, and M were PCRed using the same protocol as 22/06, with one set using a 55℃ annealing temperature and another using 50℃ annealing temperature.
Day 3
Re-PCR of DNA Sequences
Refer to protocol from 1.0
PCR Results
The amplified sequences A, B, F, G, I, K, J, and M were loaded with blue dye and run on agarose gel as per standard protocol
Sequences G and J showed bands corresponding to the expected sizes at both 50℃ and 55℃ annealing temperatures.
The bands were excised and extracted according to standard protocol (E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction).
Plasmid recovery
The concentration of pSB1C3 plasmid recovered on 23/06 according to the NanoDrop was low (1.6ng/µl). To obtain more plasmids, we restriction digested a construct made by last year’s, pSB1C3 + abijk, to recover the pSB-1C3 content from the construct.

Description
1. Overview
According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death globally. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule. One of its many complex functions is to transduce nitric-oxide (NO) and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signaling and remit myocardial dysfunctions by relaxing blood vessels. This summer, we tried to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line. We hope that our work could provide basis for a future gene therapy using synthetic biology.
NO：nitric oxide,      sGC：soluble guanylate cyclase,    PKG：protein kinase G
PDE5A：Phosphodiesterase-5A,  HIF： hypoxia inducible factor-1,   HRE：  hypoxia responsive element
Increased understanding of the molecular events operating in the NO-sGC-cGMP axis has stimulated therapeutic targeting of the pathway in human diseases. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is an enzyme that synthesizes cGMP from GTP and is found as a heterodimer of α and β subunits. BBa_K1720000 and BBa_K1720001 contain the full coding sequences of the α and β subunits of human sGC, respectively. Co-expression of the two parts increases sGC activity and cGMP synthesis in the cell. However, elevated cellular level of cGMP may lead to feed-back expression of PDE5A, a phosphodiesterase that degrades cGMP. Creation of novel circuit that consists of U6 promoter followed by PDE5A shRNA may enhance the function of our parts. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also designed a hypoxia-inducible operon, HRE, as a switch to up-regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation.

THE ETHICS OF ENGINEERING LIFE - PANEL DISCUSSION
GMO and safety are not only hot topics for the scientific community and the general public, but are also a  huge concern in our project, especially as we want to introduce bacteria into the lungs. We knew that to ever launch such a product, we would need to address the public's opinion. In collaboration with iGEM Uppsala 2017, we hosted a debate with the title of “The Ethics of Engineering Life” on the topics of safety and ethics regarding GMOs . We invited experts in the field with various opinions. Our panel consisted of Anthony C. Forster, a researcher at Uppsala University where he leads a group in protein synthesis and applications (synthetic biology), Heidi Howard a researcher working on the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) related to genetics and genomics, Cecile van der Vlugt, a member of Safety committee of iGEM and a researcher at National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Utrecht, Netherlands and Mona Hagi, a member of Green Youth of the Sweden Environmental Party (Miljöpartiet). Sadly Mona cancelled in the last moment.
The discussion was designed in such way that there was a base of questions the moderators (Amanda, project leader of iGEM Stockholm and Lucie, project leader of Uppsala) asked the panel. As the first questions started the discussion, the audience could join in. Throughout the debate, there was a flow of questions both from the panel to the audience and back. In such way we assured that the public got as much space in the debate as the panelists and that all voices and opinions could be heard and respected.
We are able to say that, although we had prepared the first set of questions to discuss in"

result: negative colony PCR ,no good bands ,were too small
-> better : use original plasmid psB1K3 which was already digested with E+P ,since this plasmid never contained a TaC
-> assumption why colony PCR negative: the previously cut  cut TaC from Kan TaC1 ligates with the plasmid   hence the 3A assembly( Tac #(E+S) +TaC #(P+X) could not ligate in the vector
-> better : ligation at 16°C for 2h or overnight

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," biology, is a sign that we have constantly tried to democratize synthetic biology to the general public and helped us to consider the profits and risks. Without being paranoiac, we have to think of all potential dangers that our molecule may create.
Will this molecule be able to create new diseases? Can it break the flora equilibrium for example through effects on bees in the region and creating the proliferation of chinese hornets? We can also ask ourselves questions concerning it's effects on humans. Since curdlan is technically a sugar biopolymer, would it increase the sugar level in wine? These are questions which can be asked by the general public and which might cause them to be frightened of our project. This is why we have taken into consideration these questions and tried to answer them in the best way possible which are resumed in our next section which deals with safety.

Safety
To avoid confusion about the terms ""biosecurity"", ""biosafety"" and ""biohazard"", some people gave a definition of each of these terms.
✵ Biosafety describes principles, technologies and containment practices put in place to avoid accidents and unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins.
✵ Biosecurity describes the protection measures put in place and management of important biological materials in laboratories, in order to prevent them from being accessed without authorization.
✵ Biohazard includes, in this case, both biosafety and biosecurity.
Reference : http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Biosecurite-dans-les-laboratoires
The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training. We learned how to act in the case of an accident, where to find emergency showers, fire extinguishers and emergency doors. Some basic safety requirements were discussed such as wearing gloves and a lab coat for most procedures. In some cases, during the use of ethidium bromide, nitrile gloves are mandatory. Other experiments must be conducted with safety glasses. It is also recommended to wear clothes offering a minimum of protection. We also learned about working with chemical products and how to dispose of them. Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol). Chemical products are just irritants and so need to be handled with gloves. In"
Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," are told about biotechnologies?
I studied biotechnologies for three years in college and I was passionate about it. After that, I studied in microbiology to know more about those organisms we can use in biotechnology. To me, it represents a way to change the world as we know it. Of course, biotechnologies could be used to harm people, but it is not how I see it. There are so many things we can do with biotechnologies, it is like all the tools in the world are contained in DNA and now the only limit is our imagination.
We truly believe that our project could pave the way to the development of a successful start-up. We therefore launched an entrepreneurship approach to design the business model of such a company. We first met biotech startups and technology transfer centers to confront our project to real businesses. Then, in collaboration with a startup incubator, we deepened several aspects of the business. We identified the most critical points of the project and developed a business plan to assess its value, feasibility and durability in terms of marketing, finance and law. These led us to define our future company as centered on advice, conception and innovation to provide manufacturers with functionalised molecules produced by our sub-contractors. It’s time to knock on bank doors!
For more details, visit our Entrepreneurship page
During the Cerberus project, we meet the public on several occasions and we have soon understood the crucial importance of communicating and educating. We therefore participated to scientific and non-scientific events, explained our project in the media and committed ourselves in making children aware of biotechnology possibilities. We also carried on the development of a card game, MicrobioWorld, explaining molecular microbiology in a fun way. However important were these actions at a local scale, it was frustrating to not reach more people. We therefore initiated contacts with the French Department of Education and we helped them to develop a pedagogic wallet distributed to all the “Sciences and Techniques of Laboratory” high schools, at the national-scale. They loved Microbioworld which will be part of the wallet. So, our Education & Public Engagement is not done with iGEM but will be pursued for the year to come or more.

Sweat Challenge
Because dermcidin, which is the heart of our whole project, exists in human sweat, we decided to spread the word about the health benefits of sweating to encourage people to move and sweat more.
We set up a Sweat Challenge for other iGEM teams where we asked teams to take a picture of themselves doing some sweaty activities and to share it with us by using the hashtag #igemsweatchallenge. Our own team showed a good example by participating in the Espoon Rantamaraton running happening where we ran for 10 km and sweat a lot.
While we promoted our project and iGEM, we aimed to convey a message to the general public - Sweat is part of our natural thermoregulation and immune system.
As the saying goes, “Seeing is believing”, we wanted to collect sweat from people, analyze it quantitatively in the lab, and raise awareness among people that there are many important proteins and peptides secreted in sweat. In this way we wanted to open a dialogue between people to prove to them that sweat is not as bad as it is often perceived. We collected sweat samples from different people, aiming to quantify dermcidin levels in natural sweat and get deeper insights for our project. For this purpose, we collaborated with Tec-Chihuahua team from Mexico. We met with one of their team members as she was visiting Finland and we had a lot of fun during the sweat collection in sauna. You can read more about it from our Collaborations page.
We performed BCA assay to observe protein levels in sweat samples and found that a considerable amount of proteins is present in sweat.
We can see the proteins in our sweat samples beautifully colored as purple.
During the summer there was an article about the negative sides of sweating in the biggest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. We decided to turn the discussion the other way around and write an opinion article about the health benefits of sweating and the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin. Our opinion article was published in Helsingin"

Integrated Human Practices
In due consideration of the results of our human practice work, we improved the final design of our project.
Improvement of a previous part or project
We continued the work of the iGEM team Texas Austin 2014 and improved their measurement kit to determine the incorporation-efficiency of a tRNA-synthetases-pair. We successfully used the improved kit in the course of our project and made it available for everyone by submitting it to the Registry in the BioBrick standard.
