[5] Hydrophobins: Proteins with potential. Hektor H.J., Scholtmeijer K. (2005) Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 16 (4), pp. 434-439.
 
Neo-Protein Design
Among all kinds of hydrophobins, Class I hydrophobin inJanus (we name it from its insoluble property) from Grifola frondosa and Class II sJanus (we name it from its soluble property) from Trichoderma reesei are models of Class I and Class II respectively. However, it has been reported that bacterial hosts could not be used to produce functional Class I Janus, which causes great obstacles in broader applications of them.
Figure 5. The resource of our Janus
When expressed in E.coli, inJanus usually exist as inclusion body. And there are some possible reasons for this phenomenon: the expression is so fast that protein have no enough time to fold; there are many amino acids with S element, and the environment in E.coli goes against the formation of disulfide bond; lack of necessary enzyme and cofactors [1].
Thus, we made some directed mutations of inJanus, and make its expression in E.coli possible. Meanwhile, we do the same to sJanus. Though it could be expreesed in E.coli (the difference in solubility may lead to it), we would like to research on its difference. Then we made contact angle experiments to test their properties. Ultimately, our project is about four kinds of hydrophobins- inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants: inJanus-m and sJanus-m.
Figure 6. We make some mutation of inJanus to make its expression in E.coli possible. We also do the same to sJanus to see its difference.

Super Protein Chip
Background
Protein chip is an emerging technology, which can be used to track the interactions of proteins and to determine their function. Nowadays they are playing a crucial role in various fields around the world, especially in clinical medicine. According to many researches, protein chip has already become a new method of the rapid detection of tumor markers, but it is still a difficult problem to solve the combination between the matrix and the probe, due to the biomolecule inactivation caused by ordinary substrate material.

Jr. High School Visits More    Even More!
One of the many ways to achieve a better diffusion of iGEM and Synthetic Biology is through students.
Our objective is to convey these topics with an accessible discourse and to evaluate this through surveys, which will also allow us to assess the impact of our expositions and talks in public and private junior high schools from the metro area of our city.
We gave a presentation/talk that addressed students in a clear, simple and concise way; we also performed some experimental demonstration, like banana DNA extraction and the simulation of an iGEM competition, where students had to propose a fictitious iGEM project with the information that we taught them, in order to make them understand the topic more profoundly.
Synthetic rally 2012 More
The objectives are to promote the importance and impact of Synthetic Biology, inform about the interesting applications through a funny, entertaining, educative and original activity. This would allow the students learn and enjoy the experience of Synthetic Biology in a very “Silence” way, playing thematic games which can help them understand some difficult concepts such as “DNA”, “Plasmids”, “BioBrick”, etc.
The purpose of the final activity is to simulate an iGEM competition, in which they would apply their knowledge to build an original circuit and win the “Great BioBrick”.
Aware 200 junior high students about Synthetic Biology. Show them the applications, benefits, risks, and how they could improve the world by modifying characteristics to make a better place while protecting the environment.
Media and Interviews Back to top
Entrepreneurial interview More
As part of our HP, we contact two experts in the biotechnology field, working in different enterprises, and did them an interview about the processes their enterprises develop, and the way synthetic biology could help them. This activity was done in order to show the great impact the synthetic biology could have in the business area, and also the help that different biologic projects can give to the society and technology.
On the Radio! More
During last summer, the team was invited to present our work to different radio stations, were we talked about our wetlab project, E.cologic, and the human practices projects, specially the Synthetic Biology Tunnel expo. This expo gained attention from the Public Secretary of Education (SEP) and also from two local television channels; these channels made two news reports, respectively.

清凉夏夜，送你一支荧光雪糕
The Amazing Fluoresce Ice Cream
British boutique ice cream maker Lick Me I'm Delicious (yes, that is the company's real name) recently released a glow-in-the-dark ice cream that uses a luminescent protein from glowing jellyfish. The idea? Lick the ice cream and calcium-activated proteins react by glowing, thanks to differences in your mouth's warmer pH level and the ice cream's more neutral pH.
英国精品雪糕制造商Lick Me I'm Delicious(舔我~我超好吃的哦~ ~(≧▽≦)/~)上市了一款能在黑暗中发光的雪糕。这款雪糕中添加了取自发光水母的发光蛋白，此外，我们的唾液成弱碱性，在舔雪糕的时候，使pH值升高，从而使钙激活蛋白发光。在你舔雪糕的时候，你就会发现雪糕越来越亮啦！（好神奇有木有！）
Be forewarned: a scoop will set you back about $220 in sweet change. Turns out jellyfish protein isn't exactly cheap. But no worries: Charlie Harry Francis, the food scientist who invented the treat, assures foodies that it's safe for consumption. 要提醒大家的是，你需要花费220刀才能吃到这种发光的甜甜的雪糕球，因为提取水母蛋白的成本很高。另外，我们也不必担心食品安全问题，食品科学专家Charlie Harry Francis，同时也是荧光雪糕的发明者，已经确定这种雪糕对消费者来说百分之百安全。

- Evolutionary algorithm
- Large Parameter Optimization Problems
- System Optimization
     Professor Ho gave us lots of suggestions on programming the training processes of AI, including feature choosing, data analyzing and evolutionary computation. After the guiding of Professor Ho, the system reached the level                         of further applications:
- Filtering

Validation of antifungal function
     According to the design of our dry lab, we successfully built the whole system including the database and the IoT system. AI is the core of the whole platform to predict and filter the potential and suitable peptides to be the fungicides. To make the system more reliable, we also designed a series of wet lab experiments and tested the antifungal function of the peptides that our system predicted. Via genetic engineering of E.coli, we got the peptides.                     and test activities in vitro and on plants.

Other novel ideas
Tackle Water bloom by Tong Wang and Kuanwei Sheng
Since the detrimental effects caused by cyanobacteria to the environment such as making water carcinogenic have become a serve global problem, we therefore tried to employ E.coli as an expression system to eliminate these detrimental effects. When we first took over this project, we thought about limiting the growth of cyanobacteria. Along with the process we got to read a large amount of relevant papers about cyanobacteria, we found that not only the main detrimental effects caused by cyanobacteria is attributed to its product which is a cyclic peptide called microcystin, but also microcystin can regulate the population density. Then we came to realize the importance of microcystin and began to search information about it. Through over this process, we discovered a gene cluster which is responsible for the microcystin degradation pathway. It encodes four enzymes——MlrA、MlrB、MlrC and MlrD. Also, we found that some non-toxic cyclic peptides produced by cyanobacteria such as Anabaenopeptin B and Anabaenopeptin F can induce lysis of cyanobacteria. The latter finding can be utilized as an effective cell population density control mechanism. Thus we thought about constructing two independent systems to eliminate cyanobacteria, one about inducing lysis of cyanobacteria and the other about degrading microcystin. Finally we gave up this project because of the reasons that these gene clusters are too large to be expressed in E.coli and that E.coli cannot survive in the sea, however, we still feel proud of these fancy ideas.
Desalination of sea water by Kuanwei Sheng
We came up with the thought that engineering bacteria can intake ions like Na+, cl-, Mg2+ and etc. under special stimulus. Also, under another certain stimulus, the bacteria can export those salts out of cells for reuse. Therefore, we can use these bacteria to desalinize sea water and extract the salt the same time. However, there is no such ion channel that can meet our needs.
Sense the earthquake By Min Ye
We once tried to find proteins that can sense vibration and construct a pathway to report that vibration. However, we are not able to find the protein that can meet our needs.
Auto plasmid preps By Kuanwei Sheng
We thought about constructing a synthetic protein that combines zinc finger protein which can recognize the specific sequence of DNA and signal peptide that can make proteins be exported"

Our method of producing palm oil could be used in Malaysia as well. Would you approve this? Do you think that it is realistic and could compete with common oil plantations? Would you favour our method if it is only used to cover the growing demand on palm oil?
I think it is unrealistic that such a strategy would work in Malaysia. Our universities are not as good as in Europe. I don’t think we can train enough scientists to compete with other countries’ markets. I think a new method will take a long time to implement in Malaysia. Change here is difficult as the government support the current palm oil industry very strongly.
There are thoughts on changing the genetic material of the oil tree to gain more fruit. Is this legitimate? Do you see any problems in this way? Could it be possible that big concerns are using it and small farmers are left with nothing?
Currently we use fertilizer with lab-created nutrients to make the palm oil grow faster and produce more seeds. So this might be a similar method. This fertilizer is accessible to everyone, but it is more expensive so small farmers might not be able to afford it. It shows results though, so the fertilizer is a worthy investment. I think the genetic method would have similar effects.
Do you want to add something?
I don’t have anything else to add.
Interview with Wolf-Dietrich Kindt from the VDB
Would you introduce your organisation?
Since 2001 the VDB represents the most important German biofuel producers vis-à-vis politics and general public on a national and European level. The organisation’s current 12 full members and 3 associate members represent 60% of the German biofuel production and they stand for the present and future of sustainable mobility in Germany. The VDB has two main tasks: help shaping the framework for a competitive market and represent the industry.
In order to communicate the positions of the German biofuel producers, representatives of the VDB are constantly in contact with members of the German Bundestag and their co-workers, ministry officials, journalists and representatives of the general public. Due to the increasing importance of EU legislation, members of the european parliament and the european commission are also important contact persons for the VDB.
What role does palm oil play in the production of biofuel?
In Germany, the percentage of palm oil in the biofuel production is in single-digit range
Where is the palm oil obtained from? Are certifications deemed important?
The sources of the raw materials are registered by the federal agency of agriculture and nutrition, please read the according report.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"

**The components of this project are the same as those in Cas9 and because of this, the notebook starts in August**
Aug 11-17
Re-isolated cytoskeletal promoter, Actin, from Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Actin was unsuccessful so it was PCR amplified again. A genomic isolation was performed from Arabidopsis leaves. Gel extractions of Myosin, Actin, MMV, and ClCuV.
Aug 18-24
PCR of myosin and profilin were both successful. CBAR 1 and CBAR 2 were performed again as described in cas9 notebook. In addition, FiMV promoter was put together again with CBAR. All were successful except the CBAR’s that were rescue PCR amplified. It was determined that the annealing temperatures were not compatible for CBAR 1 and 2 amplification so new primers were ordered. FiMV was successfully PCR amplified and was gel extracted. An intermediate CBAR of CMV35s(2) with mCherry (CBAR 3.5) was conducted and successfully amplified.  Each component of the construct was CBARed again successfully and a CBAR of those parts was conducted to assemble the entire construct. It was unsuccessful.
Aug 25-31
More intermediate CBAR’s were conducted to piece together CBAR 1 with CBAR 2 from above, named CA. Also, CBAR 3.5 and Nos3 were joined together and named CB. Both attempts were unsuccessful and were tried again.

The Sir BacMan Story
Thy Quest to Sequester
We see our bacteria as tiny eco-warriors, brave and selfless in their actions.
The Bacillus Battle Cry.
2009, this is our year! So now, let us survey the land. We learn of injustice, imbalance and destruction, with forces from our past, which hold us hostage to our future.
Poison is the ancient currency – not ours. Let us expunge these vile deeds and make a better world.
Rise up Sir Bac-Man and devour this toxic injustice. Let us follow your banner, and let our voices raise  your motto, your challenge, your sacrifice....it is yours and mine...
""Thy Quest to Sequester!"" Unwind your flag, and rouse you in your ancient inheritance. For now, by our design, you will condemn this villainy to jail a thousand years.
So to battle my microscopic friends ... and you so small... so few... you tiny band of genetically engineered siblings, in our debt may you always be re-mem-ber-ed.
Sir Bac-Man, to victory!

The issue with the acid hydrolysis is that initially it                         is used to produce sugars and that HMF is just an unwanted co-product. The quantity of HMF is very                         low and is insufficient to be quantified. Originally, we aim to use ionic liquids which are present                         in a significant amount of scientific articles but we learn that they are very expensive and they                         need chrome salts which are banned at the industry level. Since our purpose was to adapt our method                         in an industrial way, there was not interest in using ionic liquid even if they worked well.
Toxicity results coming from IGEM Leiden
Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an organic compound of the furfural family formed by dehydration of sugars (1). It is a multifunctional                         molecule because of its structure (Fig 1),It has a furan ring with an aromatic alcohol and an aromatic                         aldehyde. HMF is a versatile intermediate allowing to obtain by a transformation some high value-added                         chemical. It is a valuable and interesting molecular building block which can be catabolized in some                         useful molecule such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) (2).
Figure 1 : Structure of Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)
Our project is about producing a bacterial strain that transforms hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into furandicarboxylic acid                         (FDCA). HMF is a byproduct of the degradation of cellulose or other polysaccharides. FCDA is a platform                         molecule that can be polymerized into plastics or biofuels.
Our researches in the literature on the enzymes that can catalyse the reaction from HMF to FDCA, have                         shown that in some cases and for some organisms it may be toxic.
Several studies in different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that cell growth was significantly                         affected (3). Studies also show mutagenic effects on human cells (3). HMF is also known to cause                         specific damage on microorganisms with DNA mutations in Salmonella typhimurium (7) or Escherichia                         coli (8). But some studies also show that for some strains of E. coli or some others bacteria, there                         is not effect of toxicity (9).
The effects come from a reduction in available cellular energy caused by the inhibition of enzymes such                         as alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate"

We also saw some 'cool' experiments (gladiator bacteria and generation marking in bacteria), but we still haven't found the project we want to work on. Nevertheless, we had some excitement about a project by a TU Delft Masters student working on a bacteria that can sense whether it is in an environment with low insulin concentration and produce insulin in response (could be a good diabetes treatment).

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," has been under the regulation of “ Robots Protocol ” file stated by the official WEIBO company on their website.
After couple of online discussion, the total 17 emojis related to the three words on microblog database were classified into 5 sorts: “Happy”, “Sad”, “Upset”, “Helpless”, and “Others”.Two conclusions can be drawn from the data. First is that 53% of people tend to use negative emojis when they mentioned “losing weight”, “body weight” and “fat”, which reveals about half of the population dislike the process of losing weight. Second is that the emoji “crying” is the commonest emoji, about 17% among all types of emojis, when people’s microblogs contain words related to losing weight or fat. This conclusion reinforced the first conclusion that losing weight is actually a quite annoying process where half of our people may have trouble on different levels.
This background analysis laid a solid foundation on their project motivation this year. By confirming with positive relationship between bad emotions and loosing weight, they conducted a project for producing weight-reducing drugs by engineered organism which may greatly innovate the way we deal with the weight losing matter. Also check on NJU-China's wiki page.
Figure 1. Data analysis in pie chart. We can see from the chart that “crying” is the most mentioned words when it comes to losing weight.
Figure 2. Another pie chart reveals that about half of the emojis are negative when it comes to the three words.
Bi-direction collaboration
During the collaboration, NJU-China tried our software when we released our origin version to them and gave us helpful feedbacks based on which we improved our UI and operating logic of design platform. Additionally, they also give us valuable advice on Interlab Study.

Solution & Results
Serving for the goal to help everyone who is interested in Synthetic Biology generating their idea rationally, we managed to provide a visualization tool for presenting the relationship between projects and hot topics. Each blue node stands for a topic key word and other nodes in different colors stands for team’s previous work in different tracks. Teams who shared the same key words of topic would be connected to the same blue node where the words of the topic will emerge"

Friday 18/7
We prepared a freezing stock of the parts we had ordered and received from iGEM, and the remaining sample from the ON culture used for the freezing stocks, was miniprepped and catalogued.
Some of the minipreps, were prepared with a wash buffer not containing any ethanol, and therefore we has miserable results. New ON cultures of those was prepared.
Saturday 19/7
The ON cultures of the iGEM parts from yesterday, were miniprepped with fine results.
Colony PCR was performed on the cultures transformed with PCR1+3, PCR2+3, ABC and AB. There were no colonies on plate 5.10 (AB-part).
Plate streaking was performed on each colony taken for colony PCR.

Demonstrate
        We take water samples from water sources near metalworking plants, and demonstrate our products in the samples.
Potential applications
        Besides detecting heavy metal ions, our report module can also be used in various fields of detection. By combining with different detection modules to our report module, other components could also be detected. For example, a combination of a detection module that responds to aflatoxin and our reporter module can be used to rapidly detect aflatoxin.
         Therefore, our report module could be applied to build up efficient and low-cost biosensors which would make biosensors be widely used in various detecting field.

Hawaii,2008,Team:Hawaii#Protocols#Cryopreserve cells_-_-_TEXT.html," Although glycerol is an effective cryoprotective agent for many bacteria, it is not effective for most cyanobacteria. Methanol at approximately 5% (v/v) is suitable for most strains. However, we have been successful with concentrations of methanol ranging from 2% to 12.5%, and DMSO ranging from 4 to 15 %, depending on the culture. A small fraction of some cultures survive with no added cryoprotective agent.
[5] Cells are killed by exposure to bright light when in cryoprotective solution. Keep the culture in subdued room light while handling, and in complete darkness at other times.

SBa_F0002: Symbolic Interactionism
Contents
1SBa_F0002: Symbolic Interactionism
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
A major strength of this theory is that it takes into account free will of individuals, how they behave and the choices they make. It is more detailed and beneficial to individuals as a micro theory as it gives a real insight into small scale interactions which may not be defined by a macro theory. For example, SBa_F0001 may overlook this.
Limitations
Symbolic Interactionism is quite flawed when drawing conclusions as symbols may be interpreted incorrectly. The meanings to the symbols cannot be traced easily and so it relies heavily on other sociological theories.
The theory also fails to develop many sociological ideas such as order and how this comes about.

Overview
In this country profile, all the information was obtained from reliable government and official websites. This profile includes information of perception, regulations, researches, funding, market, events, people and organizations about synthetic biology and biotechnology.
In general, synthetic biology and other fields of science are considered less significant in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government does not provide much support to the field of science compared to other fields such as business. Moreover, the awareness of bio-safety issues in Hong Kong is not high among the general public.  We hope that this country profile will provide readers information about synthetic biology and biotechnology so that more people understand and review the situation of scientific development in Hong Kong
Synbio Map
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in the synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project,"" ). It is a good tool to compare the development of synthetic biology all around the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.   In this map, 5 entries are located in Hong Kong. Two of them are in the University of Hong Kong and two are in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, while the remaining one is a private company.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Universities in Hong Kong have been actively participating in the iGEM competition. Since 2008, out of 9 universities in Hong Kong, 4 took part in the competition.
The four universities are Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), University of Hong Kong (HKU) and Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)."

Description | Design | Construction | Characterisation | Shear Device | Modelling | Results | Conclusions
Curli synthesis
Our cell model for aggregation describes the pathways through which curli cluster coding genes interact to make up  up curli fibrils which are produced on detection of microplastics. This particular curli cluster (BBa_K540000) contains five genes that later on interact and make up curli fibrils, however, we are looking into synthesis and interaction of only two of them: CsgA and CsgB due to complex nature of the system.
Aim
Using this we aim to find out to which extent is curli fibrils' production is dependent on the persistent organic pollutant presence in the surrounding environment. In addition to that we would like to estimate how much fibrils are produced over time.The following diagram shows the genes, molecules and reaction involved in the synthesis of the curli fibrils, on which further description is provided below.
Description of the model
As with our degradation model , this SimBiology model is divided into three compartments, with each DNA species and reaction explained in further detail below:
1. Outside1: in this compartment we see the association, adherence, and dissociation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from polyethylene (PE) (R1).  We rely on the POPs to induce our curli synthesis system. As it will be described later on, POPs have a tendency to adhere to the plastic 105 to 106 times more"

Conclusion
The difference in Nitrite concentration may be caused by the different pickle extract: Qiumei Food provided us with only small quantity of samples each package. While we are satisfied with the result of NzFE in 16 °C and 25°C: both reduced more than 40% nitrite after 39hours. However, the result of 30°C is less satisfied: only 20% nitrite reduction after 39hours. We consulted with Dr.Zhang in Bluepha, and he suggested that at 30°C, bacteria is around its optimum growth temperature compared to 16°C and 25°C, and that much higher growth rate caused too much metabolic stress on cells, leading to unsuccessful translations.
Further Improvement
1
Implement the product by replacing better linker, making the results as close to prediction in Modeling as possible, which means finding linkers with least impact to our target enzymes' active sites.
2
Testing the feedback loop device regulated by Pyear promoter(BBa_K2346005 and BBa_K2346006).
3
Change our chassis to $B.substilis$(see Chassis Selection ).

Using a fast digest, we ligated B0034+dehydrogenase along with B0034+reductase to build the simple construct. Also, we added a stop to the two enzymes in order to prepare and build the complex construct. The resulting nanodrop concentrations were lower than expected, so we decided to scale up the amount of DNA in the digestion reaction. Second attempt at Gibson PCR and PCR screen, bands at wrong lengths. Gel run and gel purification done on J23101+R0010+E0240 and B0034.
Tuesday August 21st
We began sequencing Strain E-15 EG3 today to see the different mutations that occurred from the University of Barcelona laboratory. It was actually easier to make a library than it sounds. We followed the non-PCR protocol, so it involved a lot of incubating and mixing. Literally, the hardest part was the math involved to find dilutions and concentration. In other news, we found out that the J23101 + B0034 + C0012 ligations worked! We are en route to our complex construction of the ethylene glycol side of things. We also met with our advisor, Dr. Facciotti, about the wiki to make some edits and additions. Sequencing for K206000+B0034+Full Cutinase sent in. Gel ran and gel purification done on B0034, KAN+B0015 and Full Cutinase.
Wednesday August 22nd
We miniprepped our way through the morning. The liquid cultures of J23101 + B0034 + C0012 were pink, meaning that there was RFP present. This was strange to us, but we will continue because the RFP is past the insert area, so it may not have gotten cut out. In case this is not the right one, we are also digesting B0034 + C0012 and J23101 so that we can ligate them once more. The RFP should be digested out of the construct, assuming that the SpeI and PstI are working. We are also beginning digestions from one step back with B0034 + C0012 so that it can make the before mentioned pieces. As it turns out, the genome sequencing library did not turn out well.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Collaborations2_-_-_TEXT.html," one organized a debate about biosafety, and filmed a short video of iGEM team presentation on biosafety for each project. This encouraged all teams to think about safety considerations in their project and allowed us to discuss general safety issues such as containing Genetically Modified Organisms and ensuring that they do not become out of our control.
Afterwards, we had a discussion about Paris Pasteur's project and answered their survey in order to talk about the pollution due to the plastic and help them with their project.
We would like to thank again all of the teams which came to our meetup, Cap Sciences for the loan of their place and for the videos. We also thank all the people who took pictures and videos this week-end and shared them with us.
Collaboration
Paris- Saclay
When talking with Paris-Saclay during our meetup we were very interested in their project this year which is concerned about safety. Safety in our project is not a particular problem since we are using our genetically modified organisms for production and all cells are destroyed during Curdlan purification. However, when thinking about alternatives where our bacteria would be directly applied on grapevine leaves, these safety issues are extremely important. We spent some time with them during the meetup and afterwards thinking about Safety of our project.
Oxford
In collaboration of IGEM oxford Team we managed to do a toxicity assay of Curldan as we want to use it in vineyards.  Our lab does not have the required material to do so and this would help complete our project. So we sent them a sample of our produced Curdlan so they could do tests on it.
They decided to test curdlan toxicity on two Bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas putida. They choose these bacteria because these two species are very common in the environment  so  they believe these bacteria represent a good marker for an eventual environmental toxicity.
Methods and Materials
Single colonies of wild-type Rhodobacter sphaeroides WS8N and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were grown in SUX media and Lysogeny Broth respectively overnight to stationary  phase at 30°C with orbital shaking at 225 rpm. 1% w/v curdlan in NaOH was made by adding 0.1g of solid curdlan to 10mL of 0.5M NaOH  and warming the mixture at 55°C with regular vigorous shaking for 15 minutes to achieve complete dissolution. 100µL of stationary culture was added to 100µL of curdl"

Our Project
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

Abs600 and OD600 Data/Calculations for LUDOX CL-X and Water
Step Two: Construction of Particle Standard Curve
We measured the Abs600 of a dilution series of a known concentration of silica microspheres, which mimic the size and optical characteristics of cells, and constructed a particle standard curve. This enabled us to convert Abs600 values into an estimated number of cells.
Abs600 Readings from Silica Microspheres Dilutions
Calculated Particle Counts from Measured Abs600
Step Three: Construction of Standard Fluorescence Curve
We used a dilution series of fluorescein, a molecule that shares similar excitation and emission properties with GFP, to create a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration and provide a method of comparison between teams for GFP expression in the transformed E. coli cells.
Fluorescence Measurements from Fluorescein Dilutions
Calculated Correspondence between Measured Fluorescence and Fluorescein Concentration
Step Four: Transformation of Test Devices and Controls
We transformed all of the control plasmids and test device plasmids into E. coli DH5α cells. After transforming the cells successfully and growing them on plates overnight, we picked two colonies from each plate and prepared overnight cultures for them.

Our Project
For this year’s iGEM competition our team has set out to find a method for producing new regulatory parts used in the construction of complex biological devices.
Background & Motivations
Transcription is the first step of gene expression that can be regulated. Key elements of this regulation are proteins recognising and binding specific DNA sequences that either recruit the full  transcription machinery or prevent it from assembling on the DNA. It is this class of proteins, called transcription factors (TFs), that we intend to engineer.
Existing DNA binding proteins can be a starting point for developing these new TFs. By changing their residues it is possible to modify the affinity of these proteins for a specific binding site and alter how they interact with the activation or repression mechanisms of the downstream gene transcription. Investigating these effects can improve our understanding of how the residue composition affects the TF's ability to recognise a given DNA consensus sequence.
Engineering new transcription factors will not only give us a better idea of how they work but also extend the tool kit of the synthetic biologist. Within synthetic biology, TFs are used to design biological circuits where they act as building blocks for reporters, inverters, logic functions and switches. Extending the tool kit with new TFs will enable combinations of devices that currently share the same regulatory elements and thus cannot be used in the same system.
Goal
Our project’s outcome will be a method to derive pairs of TFs and DNA binding sites meeting selection criteria for orthogonality, affinity and specificity. It will include setting a selection scheme that allows for high-throughput identification of functional TF-consensus sequence pairs in vitro and in vivo. We plan to use bacterial cultures in parallel with chemostat platforms and MITOMI to screen a library of TFs against a set of consensus sequences.
Our research will begin with the tetracycline repressor (TetR), a transcription factor which down-regulates (represses) the transcription of"

If things do not change
The fatal future - This is not an unlikely situation for many parts of the rainforest if the rubber consumption and production do follow the prospects. The rubber tree is native to the rainforest and has its optimal growing conditions in tropical areas of distinct climate conditions; often regions already grown with rainforest or other arable lands. Furthermore, rubber consumption is estimated to increase by approximately 5-6 % annually. This will result in an expansion in both number and size of rubber plantations in the tropical areas of the world. Source: The International Rubber Study Group IRSG (Link)
The establishment of new plantations leads to deforestation of rainforest and destruction of natural flora and fauna. For instance, the Xishuangbanna region of China is one of the richest regions in terms of flora and fauna diversity. Most of the region was covered in tropical rainforest and broadleaf forest, but  deforestation has led to a decrease in woodland. In 1976, 70% of the region was covered in forest and in 2003, this was down"

What I love in Synthetic Biology is that we can be creative in Sciences and not only in Arts. iGEM project should be the dream of every undergraduate student who wants to become a researcher: create our own project, work with a brilliant team and have a lot of fun! I am also volunteer at “Médecins du monde” (Doctor’s of the World) where I make Thin-layer Chromatography to analyse drugs. I like dancing, theater, playing guitar, reading and diving to admire the beauty of the ocean!
Clovis Basier
2nd year in Licence Frontières du Vivant, at Université Paris Descartes.
I’m currently doing a bachelor in biology, chemistry and physics at the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire de Paris. I’m new in the research world but extremely motivated to learn and to succeed. I am very interested in the interdisciplinarity of biology, especially in genetics and synthetic biology which are likely to be a really huge field in science soon, as it’s beginning to grow fast. I enjoy doing challenging experiences as much as work in team and I’m sure that IGEM will be a great one.
Marguerite Benony
2nd year of DSAA (1st year Master) in product design at l'Ecole Boulle, Paris.
I am a 22 years old recently graduated product designer. While I was studying applied arts, I became deeply interested in Biology and harnessed my designer's energy to seek/assess the potential of an exciting upcoming field: Bio-design. Whilst investigating the friction of design with Biology, I discovered Synthetic Biology. I became instantly amazed by its potential in real life implication and the role that design could have in this technology. Naturally, I then wanted to acquire actual wet lab experience in Synthetic Biology, enabling me to explore how designers can work with scientists and what are their roles, missions, interest would be. I believe iGEM is the best place for this investigation!
Aude Bernheim
2nd year AIV Master student. 3rd Year AgroParisTech, Paris Institute of Life sciences.
I am currently completing an engineering degree in life sciences by studying interdisciplinary research at the Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires.  My scientific interests and previous research experience revolves around  evolution, genetics architecture, genomics and of course synthetic biology. In parraleĺ of those scientific topics, I have been studying and working in the field of public policies"

resulting in
\[k=-\dfrac{V_{f}}{K_{m}A_{b}\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)}\ln\left(\dfrac{K_{m}A_{b}c_{bo}}{V_{f}}\right)\]
and therefore
\[c_{f}=\dfrac{c_{bo}}{1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}}\left(1-\exp\left(-\dfrac{K_{m}A_{b}\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)}{V_{f}}t\right)\right)\]
This shows how the concentration of fluid varies over time when there is a constant volume of fluid surrounding the beads. However, in the experiment, 1ml of water was removed every 10 minutes. We account for this by taking \(V_f=V_{fo}-\dfrac{1\times10^{-6}}{10}\). Where volumes are given in \(m^3\), time is in minutes and \(V_fo\) is the initial volume of the fluid surrounding the beads.
Now we have derived the final expression, have a look at how this result was fitted to the experimental data to determine the value of \(K_m\) here .
Mass Exchanger
In our analysis of the use of beads in a mass exchange system we used the expression
\[J = K_mA\dfrac{c_{fo}-c_{fi}}{\ln\left(\dfrac{c_{B}-c_{fi}}{c_{B}-c_{fo}}\right)}\]
but where did this come from?
For this derivation we need to take a look at the mass flow out of the beads across a differential area, \(dA\). To help visulise the system below is a diagram showing how the concentration of proteins varies through the mass exchanger.
The mass flow rate across a differential area, \(dJ\) can be expressed as
\[dJ=K_{m}\left(c_{B}-c_{f}\right)dA\]
This expression comes from the mass equivalent of Newton's law of cooling. We may use the relationship
\[dJ=Qdc_{f}\]
Where \(Q\) is the volume flow rate of water through the mass exchanger. By combining these 2 relationships we arrive at

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.
Integrated into the project:
In order to stimulate one's inspiration in synbio work design, we tried the following explorations: The tree of words, and network analysis.
The tree of words: When you first enter the search engine of S-Din, you could search any word you like, or try selecting a word to explore more! When clicking, You will see the subordinated words. After few repeats, you will finally get the projects that you want. This function is designed to help specify your need, and help you understand your idea better.
Figure 11: The tree of words.
Network analysis: This function is designed to help you find out potential relationships between two parts, projects or keywords. Sometimes the recommendation may be hard to understand, but perhaps it would open a new direction and lots of inspiration for you.
Figure 12: Our analyses show keyword relationship and year relations when searching ""UV light"" in S-Din.
S-Din Statements
Inspirations we have learned
According to Mr. Li Yuzheng's advice, it is necessary to write a software statement, and show the statement to users when they first use our software. Only when users agree to provide their private information can our software collect and use it. What's more, Prof. He Zhumei reminded us of adding biosafety statements and interactive interface with users.
Integrated into the project
We combined the software statement with biosafety statement, then wrote the integrated S-Din statements. See statements , which consists of Terms of use, Bio-safety Alerts, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.
Integrated Human Practice
S-Din is a product born for solving synthetic biological problems and serving the biologists and ordinary people who are interested in synthetic biology. In our ""Integrated Human Practices"" page, we'll show essential human practices work we have done around S-Din, including user needs analysis, function improvement for user feedback, product assessment, and public promotion.
User needs analysis
Study the needs of other iGEM teams & ordinary bio-lovers
In the discussion with SYSU-CHINA iGEM team and SCAU-China iGEM team, we reached an agreement that fragmented data makes it time-consuming and laborious to collect and reuse data. ( Silver page )
Nowadays data or information online is abundant but scattered. Many people spend much time on integrating them by themselves. instead of spending more time on their ideas for their core work.

Schematic illustration of competent cell preparation. The desired E. coli strain is grown to log phase, pelleted and re-suspended in CaCl2 solution. Now the cells are competent and should be kept on ice all the time. To test the competence of the cells, one aliquot is used to test the transformation efficiency. This is done with a standard plasmid, e.g. pUC19 and a defined amount. Afterwards the efficiency can be calculated.
Transfer the cells into 15 ml Falcon tubes and harvest the cells by centrifugation for 6 min at 5,000 rpm and 4°C. Discard the supernatants and re-suspend the cells in 5 ml of ice-cold CaCl2 solution.
Incubate the cells for 30 min on ice and collect them again by centrifugation for 6 min at 5,000 rpm and 4°C. Re-suspend the pellet in 1 ml of the ice-cold CaCl2 solution. Now the cells are ready to be transformed with your re-ligation and ligation samples.
Method 3 (high amount of competent cells, time-consuming)
The Material
TB buffer (ice-cold)
SOB -Mg
1 M MgCl2
1 M MgSO4
DMSO (100 %)
The Procedure
Inoculate a 20 ml culture either with a single colony or with a cryo culture of the desired E. coli strain and incubate the culture with agitation for 20 h at 28°C.
Inoculate* 250 ml SOB medium supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM MgSO4 in a 2 l shake flask and grow the cells to an OD600 of 0.5 – 0.9 (20 – 24 h) at 18°C and 200 – 250 rpm.
*) The volume of the pre-culture strongly depends on the E. coli strain. Using DH5a it is recommended to use 4 ml pre-culture and inoculate at 8 a.m. Next day around 10 a.m. this strain should have reached an OD600 between 0.5 and 0.6. If you use the strain XL1-Blue, you will need less cells and it is sufficient to inoculate the SOB medium around lunchtime.

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#humhub_-_-_TEXT.html," Aalto-Helsinki launched a team questionnaire.
The questionnaire consisted of multiple choice questions and aimed to gather information about the different platforms teams used to communicate with other  teams and also how teams find each other to start collaborations. By August 5th, 23 teams had replied to the questionnaire. Of these only one team felt there was no need for a better collaboration platform. This team used Facebook and email to stay in touch with their collaborating partners. 7 other teams also said they use Facebook and email (and facebook and email only) to collaborate, but hoped for a better platform. This led us to believe that the wish for a new platform was not only due to the clutter of different platforms. Nearly half (11) of the respondents used more than two platforms, and we thought that they might be having some trouble juggling between the platforms. 17 of our respondents used social media to find the collaborating teams and 19 teams use social media as their collaboration platform (the only or among others). We suggest that this will make collaborating with e.g. Chinese teams very difficult, since they do not have access to Facebook, and instead use their own social media platforms. Facebook is also less common all around Asia than in Western countries. This disrupts the whole point of collaborating, as it is difficult to find teams around the world. From the survey respondees 6 teams did not collaborate, but 5 of these had looked for collaborators. All of these teams also replied that they had problems contacting other teams. This is probably the main reason why they are not collaborating with anyone, but it might also be that they have not been able to find but a few interesting teams who unfortunately have not replied.
The Promise of HumHub
The Hub holds promise to solving many of the problems pointed out earlier. As the Hub could be used for iGEM communication alone, there would be no unnecessary distractions. It however works quite similarly as e.g. Facebook, and most team members would find it easy to use as they are already used to the way Facebook is set up. It would also remove the necessity of multiple platforms for intra- and interteam communication as is the case with e.g. Aalto-Helsinki at the moment. It would also help the problem of communicating with teams in countries where there may not be access to Facebook, or where Facebook may not be popular. If HumHub would be spread out through the headquarters, teams would be encouraged to use it and the communication between teams would likely be much easier.

Method
100mL of LB with appropriate antibiotics (if required) was inoculated with each strain for analysis, and placed on a shaking incubator at 37 degrees, shaken at 200 rpm
After 3 hours of incubation, any necessary inducing agents (IPTG at 0.5 mM) were added to the cultures, which were then left on the shaking incubator at 37 degrees overnight
The next day, the OD600 of each culture was measured before OMV harvest
Each culture was then centrifuged for 20 mins at 6000g in a fixed angle rotor to pellet the biomass
The supernatant was recovered and then passed through a 0.2μm syringe-driven filter
40mL of the syringe-filtered supernatant was then loaded into a 100kDa centrifugal filter unit
The filter unit was then centrifuged at 3500g in a swinging bucket rotor for 15 minutes
The volume of the filtrate was recorded and then discarded
PBS of equal volume to the discarded filtrate was loaded into the filter unit on the retentate-side
The filter unit was then centrifuged at 3500g for 10 minutes in the same swinging bucket rotor
The filtrate was again discarded. The retentate was recovered by fitting a retentate collection cap to the filter unit and centrifuging with the filter in the opposite to normal orientation for 5 minutes at 1000g. This was recovered and the volume recorded.
400μL of PBS was loaded directly onto each of the 2 filter units of the filter unit
The sample above was combined with the retentate collected in step 11
OMVs were stored at 4 degrees until analysis

Development of the genetic frame for an “Intelligent Biosensor”
After deciding we wanted to make a concentration sensitive biosensor, we began to investigate the different ways we could achieve our goal. After an initial research concerning biological reporters and the mechanisms currently used to make them, we began to read previous iGEM projects to look for useful BioBricks that could be applied to our work. Two past iGEM projects were of our particular interest: British Columbia’s 2009 project and Cambridge’s 2007 project.
British Columbia’s project
In the past iGEM competition The University of British Columbia team developed a project that resembled our initial proposition. They wanted to produce an E. coli that expressed different Fluorescent Proteins depending on the concentration of arabinose in the medium. Basically, they proposed a system that used three different sensitive promoters to activate a “Lock and Key” mechanism that enabled the expression of the Fluorescent Protein. There were 3 promoters: the wild type pBAD promoter that is sensitive to arabinose, and two others called pBAD weak and pBAD strong that were designed by the team via mutagenesis. As their name implies, the weak promoter is sensitive only to higher concentrations of arabinose and the strong promoter is sensitive to lower concentrations of arabinose compared to the wild type. Finally, to prevent the expression of all the fluorescent proteins when there was enough arabinose in the medium to activate all three promoters, they developed a “jammer” that consisted in placing a reverse promoter on the other side of the fluorescent protein. Thus, when both promoters were activated, the production of fluorescent protein ceased.

Nanjing iGEM Seminar
At the end of May, we participated in an exchange meeting hosted by Nanjing University. The meeting was attended by Zhang Haoqian as a keynote speaker, and representatives from Nanjing University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing Foreign Languages School, and Nanjing Agricultural University participated. We reported our project to those universities and middle school and gained some suggestions came from Mr. Zhang and other schools. We started cooperate with China Pharmaceutical University in this seminar.
6th Asia-Pacific Conference
We participated Asia-Pacific Conference held by National Chungtsing University from 30th July to 3th August. There are about 20 teams from China, Taiwan and Japan took part in this magnificent conference. During this five days' meeting, all teams present their projects by PowerPoint slides and show us their posters. We are deeply impressed by several novel, innovate projects of some teams, and launched several collaborations with them. We also did our best to present our project to judge, professor Que, and received many sharp but beneficial guidance opinions. Besides projects presentation and collaborations with other teams, hanging out and having fun are also important part of this conference. We had a pleasure night with iGEM Fudan, iGEM XMU-China, NCHU-Formosa and other teams, we shared funny stories and difficulties we faced during the presentation.
CCiC
We attended the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) held by ShanghaiTech University from August 28 to August 30. More than 50 teams from Chinese universities and high schools participated in the meeting. During the meeting, each team displayed its project through PPT, posters and other means, looking for problems and perfecting the project with the help of judges and other teams.  We also gained many valuable suggestions from judges and other teams in the process of displaying our project. For example, the judges put forward some requirements for us in terms of digital models and other teams also put forward some questions about our digital models.
In addition to sharing and exchanging projects, listening to the master's report and the experience sharing meeting of IGEM's predecessors also benefited us a lot. Through the master's report, we learned about the current situation and future development direction of synthetic biology. The experience of IGEM predecessors such as Haoqian Zhang in participating in the competition is of great significance for us to participate in the competition in Boston.

Summary
Today was dedicated to finishing our cloning strategies and primer designs, and so lab was called off. However the stochastic switch team had time to set up some overnight cultures to redo the minipreps and restriction digests for the biobricks from last week. These will be carried out tomorrow. We mixed the colonies in 3 ml of LB+Amp and left them overnight in shaking incubator. To prepare LB + Amp solution we used 5ml of LB + 250ul of Amp. 12 cultures were left overnight.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Repressor Section_-_-_TEXT.html,"quencing of characterization plasmids
Because of the differences in colony size and GFP expression that we saw on the transformation plates, see figure 5 and 6, we decided to have the plasmids pIGR01-04 sequenced. Results show that out of three chosen colonies two were mutated for strains carrying pIGR01 and one was mutated for strains carrying pIGR02. For pIGR03 and pIGR04 we chose two colonies carrying each plasmid, and we found one silent mutation in the repressor gogR, but none in the rest.
Biolector
We picked three different colonies from the four constructions that worked (pIGR01, pIGR02, pIGR03 and pIGR04) and ran them on the BioLector.
The results from the BioLector run will be presented here.
BioBrick BBa_K374008 (Gifsy1)
Figure 7 shows the change in biomass over time for the three different strains DH5α, pIGR01 and pIGR03. The growth curves show that the cells without the repressor (pIGR01) grow slower than the cells with the repressor (pIGR03). This might be because the cells without the repressor expresses GFP which might be toxic to the cells. The reference strain DH5α seems to grow at the same rate as pIGR03.
The biomass shift for pIGR01 around (5;200) indicates that the cells change morphology or cell size due to a re-arrangement of metabolism in order to utilize other aspects of the growth media after the exhaustion of others. The drop in biomass around (7;300) can be explained by the complete exhaustion of media.
Figure 7 The change in biomass (Light Scattering Units) over time (hours) for the three different strains.
Figure 8 shows the change in GFP expression over time. The strain only containing the Gifsy1 promoters (pIGR01) show expression of GFP as expected while, the strain containing both the Gifsy1 promoters and the GogR repressor (pIGR03) shows no GFP expression as expected. The DH5α reference strain shows no expression of GFP which is also expected.
Figure 8 The change in GFP (Fluorescence Units) over time (hours) for the three different strains.
Figure 9 shows the normalized GFP expression over time.  When the GFP expression is normalized with biomass any variability in GFP expression due to difference in growth is taken into account.

Collaboration
We contacted iGEM teams based in the University of York and Edinburgh University and set up Skype interviews. During these interviews we were involved in discussions over Policy & Practices, paying particular attention to team structure. This was in order to help ourselves better understand the possible roles and responsibilities that different hierarchies would require. Furthermore, we questioned each of them on their approach to modelling their systems.
We also held discussions with the iGEM team from Universidad de los Andes in Columbia. This gave us an insight into how our fellow students from the Americas were proceeding and what obstacles were facing them. We covered topics such as sensitivity analysis, estimating parameters in modelling, and how best to maximise efficiency given various budgets. Further, we discussed ventures that would be mutually beneficial to our teams. Amongst the many suggestions the one that particularly stood out was for them to send their model to us and then we would then run it on a supercomputer on their behalf. In turn they would allow us the opportunity to look over their work and see whether we could glean any ideas which could lead to improvements regarding our project.
Surveys were created and sent out to universities around the world. We in turn completed the surveys of iGEM teams across Europe and both North and South America. Following this we were contacted by the team from MIT, with whom we discussed the possibility of using our system as a delivery mechanism for their creation.
We communicated with teams from Hokkaido University and The University of Manchester  providing assistance with modelling using MATLAB as well as gaining feedback on  a program to analyse data produced by our Tecan.
The iGEM team from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill contacted us, and we realised they were planning a project similar to the one we had decided on. The potential of this was not lost on us, and we eagerly replied as communication between our teams seemed like a particularly beneficial recourse. The similarity of our projects allowed us to share a lot of information, the focus of which was on the modelling aspect.

Cell Splitting
DMEM, DPBS and Trypsin solutions were prewarmed to 37 °C. Old medium was aspirated and cells were washed with 5 ml of DPBS, which was subsequently aspirated as well. After an addition of 1 ml Trypsin, an incubation step at 37 °C was performed - until all cells showed signs of detachment. 5 ml of fresh DMEM were then added to recollect trypsinated cells from the dish. Cells were transferred to a Falcon tube and centrifuged at 900 g for 2 minutes. The DMEM-Trypsin supernatant was removed and the pellet finally resuspended in 6 ml DMEM. Seeding into a new 10 cm, 6-well or 24-well dish was performed and cells stored at 37 °C. Confluency was usually checked the day after.
Cell Seeding
For a 24-well plate, 0.5 ml cell suspension was commonly utilized per well. Accordingly, 2 ml were added to 6-wells and 10 ml per 10 cm petridish. The amount of cells depended on the respective experiment, but usually ranged from 65,000 in 24 wells to 300,000 in 6-wells and 1,800,000 per 10 cm dishes.
PEI Transfection
10 cm dish
24 µl of PEI-solution were mixed with ~ 600 µl of Opti-MEM. 8 µg of the DNA of interest was added to the solution, then the tube was immediately vortex thoroughly and had to incubate at room temperature for exactly 15 min. Finally, the solution was gently resuspended and drop-wisely spread to the cells in the dish. This was in turn swung in an 8-form.
6-well plates
7.5 µl of PEI-solution, 200 µl of Opti-MEM and 3 µg of interest DNA were used.
24-well plates
1.5 µl of PEI-solution, 50 µl of Opti-MEM and 0.5 µg of interest DNA were used.

Hannah completed her CBAR transformation today. Kait, Victoria, and Alexander completed a gel, gel extraction, and transformation for constructs for the Codon Optimization Project . Kevin and Chris inoculated six cultures with transformed colonies that grew overnight. Chris also did a comparison transformation between the CC DH10B cell line that he and Kevin made over the weekend, and the other CC cells that the team has been using.
Wednesday, June 13, 2012
Victoria and Kait made more plasmid stock for the Codon Optimization Project . Hannah made cultures from the colonies that grew from her CBAR reaction. Kevin and Chris extracted plasmids for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . They also began making more plasmid vector in preparation for their CBAR reaction.
Thursday, June 14, 2012
Plasmids from Hannah's CBAR reaction were extracted and back-up cultures were inoculated. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander ran a gel to confirm the components of plasmids to be used in the final Codon Optimization Construct. Kevin and Chris inoculated a culture with a colony containing the vector plasmid for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. They came in later that night to extract the plasmid.
Friday, June 15, 2012
Kevin ran a PCR on the vector component that he and Chris extracted the previous night. This was run through gel electrophoresis to separate the desired component from other side-products, and to ensure the fragment was the correct size. This was finally cleaned and concentrated for a CBAR reaction on Monday. Hannah grew her cultures from her CBAR reaction to get a higher plasmid yield. She also prepared new chemically competent DH10B cells since the stock was running low. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander checked a plasmid's components for the Codon Optimization Project.

Investigating Intellectual Property in iGEM
Working with novel concepts such as tunable consortia and distribution of the Dsz pathway, the UBC team became curious of whether iGEM projects would be owned as intellectual property (IP). We also realize that almost all research projects require the use of some sort of IP-related component. Even if iGEM teams are not planning to patent their own work, they will likely come across something (e.g., reagent, strain, etc.) that is already patented by someone else. To use these materials properly, we need to understand how to navigate around the legal aspect of patents. The purpose of this part of our Human Practices project is to convey IP knowledge to the community in an iGEM-relevant fashion. We surveyed various iGEM teams about their interest in such an IP primer and asked them about what they already knew, what the would like to know, and how they would like the information presented to them. In constructing our guide, we have met up with professions in the field of biotechnological patenting and incorporated the results of these meetings here. In this respect, our project will serve as a connection between iGEM and experts outside our community. We do not intend to make an argument for or against the idea of intellectual property.  Our aim is to create a user-friendly platform for all iGEM teams to learn about relevant IP issues.  It will present information in a manner that will allow users to make an informed decision about what stance to take when confronted with IP-related decisions.  In addition, the guide will help teams navigate through the processes of obtaining or using patents and build a foundation upon which they can then proceed with their projects.
Our Survey
Our survey methodology was relatively simple. We wanted to confirm our suspicions that other iGEM teams knew as little about ""patents and stuff"" as we did. We then came up with a set of questions for other teams, trying to evaluate their existing knowledge, their self-assessment"
