Integrated Practices
Visiting Deer Island
about our visit
As part of our integrated practices we visited Deer Island, a wastewater treatment plant near the Logan Airport. The facility is unique in several ways, not least of which is its use of anaerobic digesters.
The twelve 46-meter digesters, called the “giant eggs,” are unmistakable to anyone flying into or out of Logan airport. Each contains an anaerobic consortium of bacteria—unmodified—that convert the reduced energy from sludge into methane. Interestingly, the island has generators on site strictly to utilize the digesters’ methane output, converting the gas into steam for heat and electrical power. This recycled energy provides 26 percent of the islands energy needs and saves the facility $15 million per year in fuel oil costs and $2.8 million per year in electricity savings. The facility is also notable for being the second largest in the United States. All told it treats wastewater from 43 cities and towns.
Deer Island Facility
How the Sewer System Works
By visiting Deer Island we were able to see first-hand a plant which might benefit from microbial electrolysis cell technology. Compared to an average treatment facility, however, Deer Island is already advanced. In fact, anaerobic digesters are considered by some to be efficient enough to prevent microbial fuel cells  (not to be confused with electrolysis cells), from reaching mass adoption. Therefore it was interesting to walk around the technology that represents the greatest challenge to microbial electrolysis cell adoption.
H2 vs CH4! The benefit to anaerobic digesters over microbial fuels cells is the low cost of production at scale. While microbial fuel cells scale poorly (with increased distance between electrodes having a significant deleterious effect on power generation and hydrogen production), digesters scale well, as evidenced by the 46-meter digesters. The benefit of microbial electrolysis cell is the greater energy density of hydrogen relative to methane. If some future microbial electrolysis cell can circumvent the technologies scalability challenges, it may represent a significant advance.

Introduction
=Overall Project=
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides."

After understanding of protein composition required for fire retardant effectiveness, we would like to find a novel protein candiate with fire retardant properties. We decided to use protein data mining approach in bioinformatics for our purpose.
 
We contacted and asked iGEM team, NCTU-Formosa for collaboration with data mining and programming. Chao-Di Chang, who is an advisor of team NCTU-Formosa  in 2014, taught us a lot in the field of bioinformatics and protein databases such as NCBI, UniProtKB and dbPTM. The super advisor, Prof. Wen-Liang Chen gave us many great advices and shared experiences in the previous iGEM projects and Jamboree.
 
This year, the members of NCTU-Formosa helped us finding out the fire retardant target in the protein data bank. And Yi-Ru Liu of team Mingdao wrote a programming code (see here) and NCTU-Formosa gave us a lot of comments on the code. With the thanks of NCTU-Formosa, we found the ideal target with high serine and arginine contents in protein composition from Uniprot database (see the result).

Overall, I'm very glad to have had an opportunity to be involved in UCSD's first ever iGEM team. iGEM is a great program, and my experience with iGEM in the past is one of the main reasons why I decided to pursue graduate studies. And I hope that I've done my small part to show students that research can be exciting, meaningful, and enjoyable.

When Jenhan first approached me about mentoring undergraduate students for a summer software project in synthetic biology, I was initially very excited at the opportunity, but at the same time I was nervous. Many of the students we recruited had very little experience programming, and our project was very ambitious. We spent the better part of the Spring quarter teaching skills to the undergraduates ranging from synthetic biology concepts, to algorithm development, to learning how to read scientific papers. I was pleased and impressed at how quickly the undergraduate students were able to pick up these new skills, and when summer arrived, we were ready to hit the ground running.
My undergraduate background was in biology and mathematics, but all of my research experience had been in bioinformatics up to this point. I had never worked on a synthetic biology project either, but after attending IWBDA 2014, I was able to learn more about the field, giving me the confidence to move forward in mentoring this group of undergraduates. Software development was also a new project style for me, so the process has also been a great learning experience for me as well. Much of my summer was spent helping the students develop and analyze algorithms to perform searches and queries across our manually-curated networks. I was also involved with the database schema development to better represent the network we were trying to present. As a member of the Trey Ideker lab at UCSD, I have spent the past year working closely with network biology and tools"

Week 1: Miniprepped each of the cassette plasmid parts. Transformed VCP golden gate reaction. Did a ___golden gate reaction for pp2551 cassette plamisd (PCP).
May 8 - May 12, 2017
Week 2: Made glycerol stocks of VCP. Transformed HCP, PCP, and VCP. No growth on plates. Looked into why golden gate didn’t work. Found out the low-copy origin is not efficient, and z-comp cells we used for transformation are less efficient.
May 22 - May 26, 2017
Week 3: Redid golden gate reaction of HCP, PCP, and VCP using EcoRI enzyme. When we spun down liquid cultures, the cells were all red. Re-picked colonies (white) from the HCP and VCP plate because PCP plate only had red colonies. Did a miniprep of HCP and VCP.
May 29 - May 31, 2017
Week 4: Digested and ran gel electrophoresis of HCP and VCP. No insert seen.
June 1- June 9, 2017
Week 1: Out for Vacation
June 12 - June 16, 2017
Week 2: Out for Vacation
June 19 - June 23, 2017
Week 3: Tried golden gate reaction of pp2551, negative results. Ran production assembly, gel looked good. Decided to focus on sensing assembly.
June 26 - June 30, 2017
Week 4: Out for Vacation
July 1- July 7, 2017
Week 1: Tried digesting all parts necessary for golden gate reaction of pp2551’s cassette plasmid, digest did not run properly. Received evpp2551 from Simon (backup), PCRed to add golden gate overhangs.
July 10 - July 14, 2017
Week 2: Went back to retrying golden gate reaction of pp2551 after eliminating several possible places of error, didn’t work. Put evpp2551 into a golden gate vector.
July 17 - July 21, 2017
Week 3: Digested all parts necessary for golden gate reaction of pp2551, several oddities with smaller pieces. Decided to move on to possibilities of gibson assembly of sensing assembly. Started working on Human Practices and Wiki in earnest.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," 30% in stage 4. [25] Early diagnosis allows curative treatment via radical prostatectomy or radiation, whereas metastatic cancer is incurable. [24]
There is currently no screening program for prostate cancer as a reliable enough test does not exist. [26] Some trials report no benefit for prostate cancer screening using a protein biomarker PSA. [27] However, there are factors to explain this; the Sandblom et al. study used a small patient cohort, there were improvements in treatment that occurred during the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial and a different cutoff value was used in these trials to the value used in the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer where benefits were seen. Despite the large European study showing increased survival rates, overdiagnosis and false positives remained problematic. [28] Furthermore, PSA has low specificity for prostate cancer as elevated levels can be caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis and diet alterations. [29] The 3-miRNA method could prevent unnecessary biopsies and aid the detection of early stage, aggressive prostate cancer. [24] The same study also identified a separate urine based 3-miRNA model that could determine the likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence after surgery, which could help inform a therapeutic decision.
Other cancers with miRNA biomarkers include: oral cancer (saliva) [30] , while bladder cancer (urine) [31] and cervical cancer (serum). [32] The possibilities continue to grow as research continues.
MiRNAs have also shown to be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of other diseases. For instance they have been shown to be indicative of drug induced liver injury (DILI). It is serious clinical problem as liver failure  can present suddenly, without prior symptoms. More sensitive and reliable blood-based biomarkers are needed for rapid detection (i.e. before liver failure). [33] Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the most common cause of DILI. [34] There is a highly effective antidote, but there can be difficulties in achieving the diagnosis that warrants it. For instance those who have DILI despite having taken the recommended dose of paracetamol would not normally be considered for the antidote. Prescribing the antidote in more potential cases of DILI results in significant costs and unnecessary unpleasant side-effects. Effective biomarkers are needed to assess whether treatment is required. [35] MiRNAs miR-122 and 192 were shown to be a more sensitive measure of DILI than levels"

Education
This year, we had the opportunity to cooperate with an international school in Hong Kong to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to high school students. We had roughly around 30 students from The Independent Schools Foundation Academy (shorten ISF Academy) visit our school. These were grade 10 students who will be determining their IB subjects in November. The school eagers to expose these students into various areas of studies to allow them explore their field of interest. Our team’s goal was to introduce students to synthetic biology as the newly emerging field of study in biology, hoping to give those potential future scientists some inspiration.   We delivered a talk to the students introducing the basic concept behind synthetic biology as well as its application. We also managed to introduce iGEM and present this year’s project “Finding Pneumo”. We tried to explain the principle behind our construct, and it was pleasing to see students’ enthusiasm to learn. In fact, we were surprised how much they understood considering they are only grade 10 students in high school!   After the talk, we invited students to visit our lab, giving them a snapshot of how a college biology lab looks like. Moreover, we prepared a few small lab activities such as ____ for them to have some hand on experience in wet lab. We emphasized that while the lab work can be fun, safety should be the first and far most important concern.

Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
It was great to interact with these high school students. They all had potentials to be great scientists and researchers, and we are excited to think what this young future generation has to offer in the near future.

The goal is intelligible but are this also the used methods? If the students create such an microorganism and want to free it into nature, they have to make it competetive to natural microorganisms otherwise it will not survive. Goal of this manuscript is to investigate prospectivelly possibilies and consequences of this creation. In this technology assessment a model by Wolfgang Bender (IANUS) will be used wich focus on aspect of conservation and development. These aspects can be used for descision making. In a quite fictive view of what might happen in the future an utopia which emphasis positive possibilitys is pitted against a dystopia in which the focus lies on negative side effects.
Development or Ernst Blochs principle of hope
The thinking of youth is the most desirable thinking for Ernst Bloch in philosophy (Horster (1987, page 14). Preserving this kind of thinking is the only way mankind can actively create his future. Unbridled without any conventions or rules daydreaming about the future becomes colorful and unlimited, a cockaigne of possibilities. Some might say that this kind of thinking is quite unrealistic but haven´t they also said the same to Jules Verne when he dreamt about diving boots or flying to the moon? Ernst Bloch´s opinion is that a society needs people with visions, people who with their fresh ideas promote development and extend culture. The philosophy of Hegel (one of Bloch´s paragons) describes the development from the abstract to the concrete. Bloch following Hegel creates the idea of the concrete utopia, a possibility becoming reality. Bloch´s demand of being realistic by doing the impossible (Horster (1987, page 15) can be used as plea for thinking without any fears and doubts and with this create a surplus of ideas to built up new possibilities which then can someday be realities. Incentive for daydreams and developing utopia are deficiencies in actual human life which prevent the procedure of people to find themselves. In this case the deficiency lies in a great uncertainly concerning future mankind life. Will mankind die from its own rubbish? If we look at global pollution and the continuous enrichment of PET, question arise whether human can still trust in consuming foodstuffs or will there be health effects at the long range?
Even in today’s ecological systems consequences of phthalates (parts of PET) can be observed. On the basis of their structure, which is similar to those of the female sex hormone estrogen, phthal"

Malene pointed out that she is marketing her designs and selling them on markets and in chosen boutiques: “In the catalogue and in the stalls the dresses with the prints are given names like ‘plasm wedge’ or ‘water-corral’, so, unfortunately there won’t be a dress or top with the name ‘mKeima’ in the foreseeable future.“
Malene proved to be the perfect associate for further projects: “Science can be very inspiring, instead of taking a photograph of a flower, I rather take a photo of something similar, something which has more of a story behind it, which may raise awareness. I like when people are allowed the freedom of thinking about the patterns in a different way.
Machines Rocks - Arnold
In the quest of finding a top cell sorter machine to carry out high-throughput screening in our directed evolution experiment, we met Arnold Richard Pizzey. He is an electronic, mechanic and cell sorter expert in UCL Cancer Institute. We are deeply impressed by his works, especially by his latest innovation, an advanced cell sorter prototype which can potentially sort thousands and thousands of mutants every few hours. We decided to collaborate, and will be testing out his prototype with our iGEM project!
Further conversation with Arnold had opened up our mind of the detailed mechanistic of charge powered sorting machines. His feedback and insights laid down the foundation of the evolution protocol we are trying to establish.
Art Inspiration - Maunel
Maunel Wolf is a German Artist and Product-designer interested and present in wide range of crafts, using various methods and materials. If one had to choose two words that describe the style of his portfolio, they would need to be: Dynamic and Powerful! His campaigns and various artistic projects, range from high definition art work and classic drawings to furniture and clothing-designs.

Manuel’s CV shows that he always has been interested in arts and crafts as well as science. ‘Interest’ is one of the key factors to his work he said: “I am exploring the world.

The development of Non-Euclidean geometry proved important to physics in 20th century, and it help physician to discover the nature of the world. Likewise, the development of synthetic biology may prove essential for the biological engineering. The industrial age is drawing to a close, the life programming epoch is coming.

Recent Research
Structural and physiological study of the evolution of outer membrane porin mediated antibiotic resistance of E.coli strains during prolonged antibiotic therapy. Molecular dissection of the mechanisms by which proteins are able to transduce mechanical force applied to biological membranes into a physiological response. E. coli contains several examples of such mechanosensitive ion channels. By identifying the similarities and differences between these mechanosensitive channel proteins, a picture can be built of the requirements for mechanosensation, a universal and basic component of the sensory interface between the cell and the environment.

Harvard,2018,Team:Harvard#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM Team. Their project, TERRA, is an automated microfluidics system designed to facilitate wet lab experimentation. Their tech was particularly useful for us because cell encapsulation with alginate can be accomplished using microfluidics. This particular technique of forming alginate capsules was not available to us at in our own lab. However, it is advantageous in the respect that using microfluidics allows for precision of cell concentration in each droplet. A microfluidics system also allows us to test many different concentrations of cross-linker and alginate to influence pore size, a feature that would need to be optimized for our keratinases. A still image of the microfluidic chip running with dyed water is shown below. Due to the viscosity of alginate, we were unable to perfect the technique of encapsulating cells with alginate. However, the BU Team allowed us to explore another facet of our experimentation. In addition, we provided feedback on the design and use of their microfluidic device to help them to further optimize its function.
Massachusettes Institute of Technology iGEM
It became clear between the discussions on both of our teams that the use of cell encapsulation was a necessary component in our experiments. Through MIT, we were able to connect with a graduate student at the Langer Labs, Derfogail Delcassian who offered to train our team on how to perform a gel encapsulation. Half of our team members shadowed Derfogail as she went through the procedure, carefully explaining the method for casting the solution into a sterile tissue culture plate, as well as the technique for adding the appropriate cation for crosslinking the gel. This experience proved to be enormously helpful towards our efforts of creating a gel that would enable our keratinases to secrete without having the cells break through the gel. Between the two teams, we agreed to compile a standardized protocol for cell encapsulation that could be used by future iGEM teams.

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#Coliguard#Differentiation_-_-_TEXT.html," AI2 (auto-inducer 2). AI2 is a member of signaling molecules used in bacteria quorum sensing, produced by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria(6, 7 and 8). We thought that, since we could silence the AI2 coding gene on our lineage, any detectable presence of this molecule would be due to the presence of contaminants, thereby working as a trigger signal.  Thus, we decided to place the Cre-recombinase coding gene under the control of a promoter with sensibility to AI2. We will use AI2 self promoter for that purpose, since there is a negative feedback control related to AI2 production.  In short, when contaminants are present they are likely to produce AI2, which will trigger CRE-recombinase expression. This expression, as previously discussed, is responsible for Killer cells differentiation.
Strategy
As we previously explained, the model that we´ve developed to the differentiation subpart of our project involves the modification and coupling of two strategies previously used by the teams of Paris 2007 and Caltech 2008. The Paris 2007 team used the FX58 E. coli strain, which has the construction Lox71-FSTK-Lox66 inserted in its genome. The FSTK gene is essential to cell division; its disruption stops cell division. The Lox71 and Lox66 sites are cleaved by a CRE recombinase, excising them and  all the DNA sequences located between them. In Paris model, the Cre recombinase gene is under the control of dapA promoter. (for more information about Paris 2007 project, access the link: https://2007.igem.org/Paris )   The Caltech 2008 team inserted the repetitive sequence AGCT10 between the start codon of the GFP gene and the rest of its ORF.  In this case, the ORF is not in frame with its start codon, so the GFP is not corrected translated. However, DNA polymerase may slip when it replicates repetitions of small nucleotide polymers. So, during the replication of this construction, in some cases the AGCT10 is replaced by AGCT9. In this case, the GFP ORF is in frame with its start codon, and the protein is corrected translated. In our model, we aimed to insert two constructions flanking the FSTK gene; a) an upstream construction: LOX71-GFP; and b) a downstream construction: FinO-FinP-Lox66. The presence of finO and FinP genes imp"

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"amphenicol plates to select for transformants. We also checked the transformation plates from yesterday which hopefully had the low copy backbone plus dCas9, PdCas9 and T1 in - at the end of Friday there were 2 colonies from being left in 30 degrees for around 24 hours - good news!
WEEK 6
WEEK 7
WEEK 8
WEEK 9
WEEK 10
Sequencing showed that our dCas9 vectors consistently had a frameshift only 40bp into the dCas9 gene so we looked for a new source of dCas9 template. We would like to say a huge thank-you to Dr. Bolt's lab from the University of Nottingham who gave us a small amount of PdCas9 from addgene to use as a template. The below gel shows our attempts to mutate dCas9 using this template.
WEEK 11
In order to test the random ligation idea, we constructed various controls where we used P4 as ""on"" or ""+"", or PE as ""off"" or ""-"". We constructed control plasmids where only GFP was on, RFP was on, or CFP was on. We also had a control where all three fluorescent proteins were on. Unfortuantely a control where we had all three fluorescent proteins off generated no colonies. We also used a random ligation where both the bricks for P4 and P0 bricks for each fluorescent protein were added to a mixture where the fluorescent protein bricks had both been digested with sets of enzymes that mean we can control where each fluorescent protein appears in the plasmid. In this way, the fluorescent protein can be either on or off at each position, randomly. We wanted to check that each colony had the plasmid containing a 3kb insert of all 3 fluorescent protien bricks, so we carried out colony PCR.
Sequencing results showed that the previous gRNA 3 and 5 colony plasmids were mutated so we decided to re-construct the gRNA 3 plasmid in the same way as before. We then used gRNAv_F_seq and ColE1_F1 to probe for positive colonies in colony PCR, as shown below.
WEEK 12
The random ligation controls generated some unexpected results - the colours didn't line up with what we were expected so we did some sequencing with M13F and p15a_F1 to troubleshoot the issue. The result of this is that we suspect some contamination somewhere along the line, so we went back to construction. Unfortunately the primers"

Figure 1: The activity of the chimaeric light receptor Cph8, described in further detail below..
Image: Levskaya et al. (2005)
The chimaeric light receptor Cph8 contains the photoreceptor from Cph1 (green) and the histidine kinase and response regulator from EnvZ–OmpR (orange); inset, conversion of haem to phycocyanobilin (PCB), which forms part of the photoreceptor. Red light drives the sensor to a state in which autophosphorylation is inhibited (right), turning off gene expression.
Miller assay showing that Cph8 is active in the dark (black bars) in the presence of PCB and inactive in the light(white bars). There is no light dependent activity in the absence of Cph8 (-) and there is constitutive activity when only the histidine kinase domain of EnvZ is expressed (+), or when the PCB metabolic pathway is not included (-PCB).
When an image is projected on to a bacterial lawn, the LacZ reporter is expressed only in the dark regions.
Transfer function of the circuit. As the intensity of the light is increased by using a light gradient projected from a 35mm slide, the circuit output gives a graded response.
Strategy
Our original plan was to revive UT Austin 2004 's BioBricks BBa_I15008 , BBa_I15009 , and BBa_I15010 from the provided Registry plates. Once revived, we aimed to combine them into a single red light sensing system, and transform cells with for characterisation of the system and for analysis of their compatibility with the mutated red luciferases .
Figure 2: Another view of the red light sensor.
Problems
The composite construct of all three BioBricks would not transform, and transformations of the individual BioBricks also failed. We attempted to amplify products out of the BioBrick to see if they were actually there, but the only component that we were able to recover was the sensing component, Cph8.
Thus, we retrieved transformants from the kanamycin-resistant version of BBa_K098010 , the HO-pcyA fusion deposited by Harvard 2008 , to supplement this and to complete our red light sensor.

Tsinghua-A,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," position 12 and 13 in difference, which reasonably leads to in cell homologous recombination under the functions of Rec family proteins. Apparently, it can happen to one TALE, with one repeat crossing with another in this peptide chain. Moreover, it may happen to several TALE which contains a relatively larger amount of homologous regions. Thus, the RVD will be disturbed and the targeting function of the TALE will be missed.
Our solution is based on the codon usage bias, which refers to differences in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in coding DNA.[1] The translational efficiency of heterologous genes can often be improved by optimizing synonymous codon usage to better match the host organism.[2]

TALE Assembly
The TALE assembly strategy uses the Golden Gate cloning method, which is based on the ability of type IIS enzymes to cleave outside of their recognition site. When type IIS recognition sites are placed to the far 5’ and 3’ end of any DNA fragment in inverse orientation, they are removed in the cleavage process, allowing two DNA fragments flanked by compatible sequence overhangs, termed fusion sites, to be ligated seamlessly. Since type IIS fusion sites can be designed to have different sequences, directional assembly of multiple DNA fragments is feasible. Using this strategy, DNA fragments can be assembled from undigested input plasmids in a one-pot reaction with high efficiency.
We chose the native TALE AvrBs3  as a scaffold for customized assembly of TALE constructs. The central DNA binding domain of AvrBs3 is formed by 17.5 tandemly arranged 34 amino acid repeats, with the last half repeat showing similarity to only the first 20 amino acids of a full repeat.

Moving Biobrick Constructs onto Yeast Chromosomes
A New Standard for Biobrick Construction
The Registry  includes a growing number of parts for use in yeast, but there currently exist  no BBa compatible yeast shuttle vectors.   In our work, we have chosen to utilize Sikorski yeast vectors to  integrate BBa parts into yeast chromosomes.   [1]   With genomic insertion, each  transformation is stable, being reproduced with the rest of the  chromosome.  Additionally, exactly one  copy of each insertion is present in transformed strains, allowing for precise  control of the relative expression levels of multiple elements.   The Sikorski vectors can be transformed into  E. coli for construction and propagation.   There exist four integrative vectors in the pRS30x family, each  integrating at a different auxotrophic locus and containing the amino acid  synthesis gene to fill that auxotrophy as a marker for integration.   The vectors are not suitable for Biobrick construction- they each contain one extraneous Biobrick site, and lack the standard cloning site.  Thankfully, there is a standard method for cloning BBa parts onto the pRS30x vectors for yeast chromosomal  integration: [2]
Digest the BBa vector containing the finished construct and pRS30x vector of choice using the following enzymes:
Sikorski    vector (marker)
insert & vector digest

pRS304* (TRP1)
EcoRI, SpeI
pRS305 (LEU2)
XbaI, PstI
pRS306 (URA3)
EcoRI, SpeI
Alternatively,  the final BBa construction ligation can be done as a double insertion onto a  pRS30x vector.  We did all of our pRS vector insertions this way.  The three-way ligations work well consistently, and many variations (e.g. combination of promoters and coding regions) can be generated with relative ease:

Characterization of Mating Switcher
OVERVIEW
After realizing that we need more intuitive characterization of Mating Switcher, we thought of two kinds of gene expression products in different colors, red fluorescent protein and β-carotene. We carried out a reasonable experimental design, and decided to realize functional conversion from yEmRFP to β-carotene by Mating Switcher.
At first, we built expression vector with TEF promoter, which was a strong promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although we obtained results as we expected, it is not so perfect that we decided to change a stronger promoter. Then, we constructed another expression vector with TDH3 promoter. We redid the same qualitative and quantitative experiments to characterize our results.
CONSTRUCTION
In the early stage of the project, we constructed two device parts with TEF promoter: BBa_K2407306, BBa_K2407307. At the end of our project, we also constructed one device part with TDH3 promoter:BBa_K2407314. Among them, yEmRFP is modified from a mCherry mRFP to adapt to the transcription environment in yeast. We did overlap PCR to construct them together. After that, we sequenced these parts, and sequencing results showed that these construction were successful.

Then we first inserted BBa_K2407306 to the SynⅤ of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Through the screening of SC-Ura solid medium and PCR experiments, we obtained the required strains called PVUVC. Second, we integrated the second device part into this chromosome through homologous recombination, allowing the yEmRFP gene to replace the Ura3 gene. The 5-FOA solid medium and"

In the article by Mateus and Avery: ""Destabilized green Fluorescent protein for monitoring dynamic changes in yeast gene expression with flow cytometry"" they show that addition of these 178 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of the Cln2 PEST signal, changes the half-life of a GFP from 7h down to 30 minutes.
Registry id: BBa_K194002
USER cassette for insertion of USER fragments
USER cloning allows fast and efficient cloning of PCR fragments into plasmids. Here we present the first USER cassette for the purpose of USER cloning.
This biobrick will allow insertion of PCR fragments using the novel USERTM biobrick assembly standard ( BBF RFC 39 ). It contains a PacI/Nt.BbvCI USER cassette for insertion of PCR fragments using the USER cloning standard. PCR fragments containing uracil is treated with a uracil DNA glycosylase that removes the uracil exposing a predesigned 8bp overhang allowing for cloning without the need for ligase

The Registry of Standard Biological Parts
The Registry is a collection of ~3200 genetic parts that can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems. Founded in 2003 at MIT, the Registry is part of the Synthetic Biology community's efforts to make biology easier to engineer. It provides a resource of available genetic parts to iGEM teams and academic labs.
The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry users benefit from using the parts and information available from the Registry in designing their engineered biological systems. In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will, in turn, contribute back information and data on existing parts and new parts that they make to grow and improve this community resource.

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," designed according to the required knowledge determined by SEP for each year of primary education.
The guide will consist of 30 experiments designed to motivate and involve students in a scientific environment while having fun.
General Objective
Improve the access to science for all kids but especially Mexican children. Having this in mind the app will be introduced to the SEP to be implemented within several schools including the private and public sector.
Specific Objectives
Choose an adequate  30 experiments divided into 3 blocks: 6-8 years (easy), 9-11 years (intermediate) and 12-13 years (expert).
Develop the primary guide with introduction, materials, guidance, video guidance, conclusions, and learnings.
Design and sketch experiments video tutorials for more explanations, guidance, and interactivity.
Put together all the information recollected and generated in an app.
Collaboration/Work Plan
To tackle the national problem correctly, all the MEXICAN teams (Tec-Chihuahua, TecCEM, and TecMonterrey_GDA) worked together in the creation of the Experiment Handbook. A selected group of students from each college was designated to work in the design, validation, and execution of this project.
The work plan was discussed within the first couple of weeks of July. It was established that each experiment includes objective, theoretical background, principles, material needed, steps of the process and some questions to stimulate critical thinking. Every experiment was carefully selected so that the student learns and experiences basic knowledge about chemistry and physics. We aim to contribute to children’s understanding of the world through science.
As we were three teams, it was determined that each will developed a block (10 experiments per block) completely.
First block:TecMonterrey_GDA was in charge of this block. In this part for new elementary schoolers, children will learn about photosynthesis, the light and its colors, material degradation, basic human biology, and microorganisms, as well as the importance of having a good personal hygiene.
Second block: TecCEM developed this one. This block is designed for the children to learn and experiment about the matter, as well as its interactions, some of the topics are: states of matter (and aggregation), the water cycle and energy. The experiments are easy and fun to do.
Third block: Finally Tec-Chihuahua designed this last block. Aimed at children between 12 and 13 years old, for them to understand: electricity as a useful energy (and its risks), colligative properties, reactions and catalysts, crystallization and forces in our daily life.

Lindy, LINDY DHARMAWAN
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Her being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad probably made you think that biology is her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing...well, everything. Her plans after UST involves earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Word of Wisdom:
When lab gives you lemon, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.
Winnie, HUI WAI IN
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST, she would like to try anything new to her. Therefore, she joins iGEM Team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy the lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memory and friendship in iGEM.
Food for Thoughts
Although there may be failure in the experiment, it is really exciting to see our result come out!
Doyle, JIHWAN LEE
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Science student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization related to public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Doyle's Two Cents on Life:
Doyle sometimes feel envy toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live under no stress and tension unlike his neuron cells in his brain.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together"
Kent,2016,Team:Kent#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM has probably made an impact in these areas. Perhaps there are more areas which we can look at in the future, such as poverty, world hunger, etc.
‘Biosensor’ has been a popular topic in iGEM competition too, probably due to it being a concept that can easily be understood by the audience - to detect something and emit a signal in response.
Absence of the terms that are related to “economic” or “financial”, could signify that synthetic biology is still not economically feasible to solve certain problems. However with the exponential reduction of the cost of gene synthesis and sequencing, this might change soon.
PubMed entries with the keyword “Magnetosome”
Click here for full size
Figure 2 shows the mapping of 15 topics which was computed by our topic model. Abstract of 429 PubMed articles under the search keyword “Magnetosome” were scraped for the model.
This analysis was used to evaluate the science behind our project. Immediately it is interesting to look that the topic with the highest probability. Words like “genes”, “genomics”, “sequence”, “genome” are all related and expected to be seen under the same topic. However, the most interesting thing about this topic is the word “novel”. This is very good for our project because this indicates that analysing, sequencing, or genomic study of magnetosome are considered novel and needs to be explored. This topic has the closes relationship with the topic containing the words “magnetite” and “crystal” which could also mean it is novel.
The orange topic in the middle of the map tells that microorganisms such as magnetotactic and its magnetotaxis behavior is unique which was to be expected.
Looking at keywords, smallest purple circle at the left bottom of the map, the protein ‘mamK’ is the only protein that has appeared in our map and this topic suggests that it is a stable and a domain protein to work with. Importantly, non of our proteins is represented in the topic, suggesting that our project could represent an important unexplored area in magnetosome research.

6. There are lots of HBI analog. Adding different chromosphere can produce different color.
Cons:
1. If merely used as an output signal to detect expression, GFP system would be better.
2. Specific project is still unclear. I don’t know what the upstream regulatory mechanisms is. Also the whether signal transduction depends on protein or small molecular is unknown. Don’t know if it will help.
3. If want to use it in painting pictures or changing color, chemical molecular must be added during the process. How to achieve automation is a big problem.
4. This system can work in E. coli, but in vertebrate is unknown. Don’t know whether it will work in yeast.

The fourth igem team meeting:
Lots of good ideas! But further reference is needed to confirm the details. Several ideas were picked up for further development:
1. Timed-release drugs from Huang Yanlan
Time controlled. Capsule Storage microorganism which can release drugs opportunely and can sense the concentration of the drug.
Blood sugar may influence our metabolism. Release insulin to regulate it.
Help with jet lag.
2. Immunological recognition (mycoplasma) by yeast from Li Chaochang.
Direct way: Gram positive bacteria can release exotoxin; add exotoxin receptor on yeast (react when dimerization)
Indirect way: promoter array
3. Cells enriched protein from Wang Yuning
Vertebrate protein, non-secretive protein in prokaryotic system can be difficult to collect. Enrich in membrane system.
Lipid-dependent (PI4P), PI4P binding domain can enrich in TGN.
Secretory vesicle enrichment. There is some inhibitor which can allow vesicle synthesis but not secretion.

Yujia Liu
My name is Yujia Liu. When I was 5 years old, I decided to be a scientist in the future, and I keep on going toward this direction. I love exploring the world and designing new tools. In my free time, I read a lot of books about biology and also other various subjects. Sometimes I play music. Those hobbies makes me happy and I can relax from academic projects. Besides doing some experiments, I am also responsible for math modeling in our team.

Biology is a study of the funniest, prettiest most important thing here on earth: life.                      Some say that the 21st century is belongs to biology. I totally agree. There is a bright future in the future of biology even though the road of which is a long and twisty one.  But still, my friend, we need carry on. No matter what kind of obstacle is waiting for us, there is no chance for us to run away like a coward. Biologists are explorers and the one who have passion and will of carry on.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"omolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.
Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

For PotD, it is clear from the gel that it is being successfully overexpressed since there is an intense band present at the 37 kDa marker which corresponds to the expected size of PotD in the induced culture sample. For SBP, there is no band present which suggests SBP is being overexpressed.

Figure 3: Characterisation of PotD. Single colonies of MC1061 E.coli containing pQE80-L encoding PotD were used to inoculate 5ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, one was induced with 1 mM IPTG and one was left uninduced as a control. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted.

Building a iGEM Synthetic Biology team and performing the experiments of the project needs substantial support. Besides  having the infrastructure provided by the University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (MHSC-DBMB), our team was supported by outstanding sponsors. The University and the Department supported our work in several ways, and details will be given below.
Platinum Level
Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI)
The Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) is a collaborative network between ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen Inc., Statoil Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. and Total E&P Canada. OSLI's vision is to achieve world-class environmental, social and economic performance in developing this world-scale oil sands resource. Their mission is to lead the oil sands industry in the responsible development of Alberta's bitumen resource by taking action to improve the environmental, social and economic performance of Alberta's oil sands. Oils sands initiative is encouraging the development of new ideas and is one of the sponsors of iGEM. You can read more about these new ideas at [1] .
Our team received substantial funding for the second time from Oil sands Initiative. This funds were mainly used for purchasing reagents and laboratory tools and supporting our attendance at the Jamborees. We also received samples last year for testing in our newly developped SynBio test systems.
Gold Level
University of Debrecen, Medical and Heath Science Centre - Apoptosis and Apoptosis Signaling Research laboratories
One of the main areas of research in László Fésüs’s lab is the molecular characterization of cell uptake by professional phagocytes, primarily macrophages or dendritic cells. Phagocytosis is a highly complex and redundant process that is influenced by the treatment of phagocytes and the cell types engulfed that may have different origin. The lab focuses on the phagocytosis of cells dying by different types of programmed cell deaths such as apoptosis, autophagy"

2012 Calgary iGEM Team
It is important to note that the technological basis for this project was provided by the 2012 Calgary iGEM team that all of our team members were a part of. With this basis however, all electrochemical data presented on the Technology page was collected by the 2013 team this summer and fall.
Sponsors
Our team would also like to thank our generous sponsors, without whom this project would not have been possible. Specifically, we would like to thank Alberta Innovates Technology Futures. Through their geekStarter program, they provided us with not only funding, but also opportunities to connect with experts as well as other iGEM students in  order to refine our project. At their September workshop, we were able to gain extensive feedback on our presentation as well as see what some of the other Western Canadian iGEM teams are up to. Thank you Jennifer Hill and Sarah Lee for all of your advice and hard work with geekStarter!

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#GMM legislation_-_-_TEXT.html," before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea, there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.
In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.
The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.
Discussion
As a final comment, we wanted to reflect on the principles standing behind any GMM related legislation: ensuring citizens’ safety. As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous projects, thus helping solve environmental, medical and nutritional problems. When left unchecked, however, gene modification may interfere with natural biodiversity and lead to irreversible outcomes. Government’s laissez-faire approach to the field of synthetic biology is, therefore, hardly ever seen. Yet the crux of the matter seems to be finding the golden mean as banning GMOs altogether would not necessarily make the world a safer place.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of"

Refinement refers to methods that minimizes pain, or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used.
Reduction refers to methods that enable scientists to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals.
Replacement refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims. Reference: Good Animal Practice in Science. Visited: 04.09.15. (Link)
Even though the 3Rs is widely accepted and the use of dogs, pigs, primates, cats etc. are decreasing, the overall use of animals in experiments are increasing. This is caused by an escalating use of mice and genetically modified animals. Experiments are being done to 100 million vertebrates annually according to British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, Reference: Cruelty Free International. Visited: 04.09.15.

One can only hope that the success of this project, PAST, really can support the process towards lesser animals in laboratories.

The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and the antimicrobial domain is designed to interact with microbial membranes and interfere with membrane stability. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine suppressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence suppressing LL-37 antimicrobial action. This is an improvement on the Utah State biobrick BBa_K1162006 which consists of only the LL-37 peptide.tion.

Results
To summarize everything mentioned in the Wild Cell and Modified Cell tabs, the complete equation system is presented with all the final modifications. Aditionally, simulations are carried out to visualize the impact that the aiiA enzyme had over the QS.
REACTIONS
Based on the law of mass action that states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, the whole modified ecosystem is represented in the next chemical reaction network
EQUATIONS SYSTEM
PARAMETERS
*The settled and assumed parameters were established this way because of the experimentation, due to the fact that this is the first time modeling Erwinia amylovora. Consult Ingalls 2013 and James 2000 to compare parameters with Vibrio fischeri.*
MATLAB
To be able to visualize the numbers obtained from modeling, we simulated the behavior described before, on the MathWorks® platform MATLAB. Thanks to these simulations we were able to compare the graphs between the variables concentrations inside a Wild Erwinia amylovora and a Modified one. The results were the following:
EamI gene behavior
In the graphic of the wild cell (graph 1) we observed that the EamI gene expression is not significant until the cell density (p) reaches a critical value, around 1800 in this particular scenario. Considering a time horizon of 300 and a range of values of cell density from 0 to 5000 we obtained an increasing EamI concentration from zero to a stationary value of 136.4.
In contrast, in the graphic of the modified cell (graph 2), we observed that in the same horizon of time and with the same range of cell density, there is not enough time and density to reach quorum sensing, sustaining the hypothesis that the aiiA will help to inhibit the virulence gene expression. The EamI protein will reach a concentration equal to 0.9567, 99.30% less than the observed in the wild"
Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"aging in the alpha helix of the LOV domain, we cloned SspDnaX, GyrB and SspDnaE3 in our standard 2-Gate construct of the Toolbox using CPEC.
Insertion of His in 2Gate -> Results in 1Gate constructs
Insertion of all split FP variants in 1Gate Npu
Preliminary assay to screen for the best split fluorescent protein.2x mRFP, mCherry and GFP were tested and the decision was made for split mRFP (168/169).Design of fast track LOV constructs including mRFP (168/169) version and sfGFP(64/65) followed.
The Primers for LOV constructs finally arrived and cloning started. Parts were PCR amplified and assembled via CPEC into pSBX. The constructs were then transformed into TOP10, prepped and prepared for sequencing.
SDS-PAGE and western blot were run with the samples from sfGFP time series. Results didn’t look too good, we repeated the western blot and ran a gel with coomassie stain. The western blot showed a problem with the expression of the N-construct.
CPECs for LOV constructs were sequenced, unfortunately only few worked. New clones were picked, additionally CPEC was repeated. Parts were then cloned on one backbone for coexpression. We transformed them into BL21(DE3) and made preparation for the first assay.
The first DnaX assay was run. Additionally we light-induced all LOV-construct we already had finished cloning. The first assay was a complete mess: time-points were messed up and the FACS settings were wrong. The few reliable data we got did not show any splicing activity of the DnaX-S11 intein.
We repeated the assay with longer expression (10h + 20h) at room temperature to ensure the inteins had enough time fully splice.
Western blot from the last assay was evaluated. The final LOV assay was run.
First literature research revealed Dnmt1 as interesting candidate for heat stabilisation through circularization. Correspondence with Prof. Dr. Rippe,  Prof. Dr. Plass, Prof. Dr. Lyko (University of Heidelberg) and Prof. Dr. Jeltsch (University Stuttgart) for detailed information.

And you can also manage some variables like protein degradation, the translation rate or probability of some post-translational modification that is needed to be done so that the protein can work. Similarly with RNA, comparing with time or the influence of an activator or repressor. In addition, the same logic is applied in a system with more proteins or circuits interacting, you just need to gather the correlation among them to build a trustworthy model.
Now, in the ecological level there is a bunch of new variables to work with. In ecological (or epidemiological) modeling, your protagonists are populations, where you seek for their fluctuations. So the variables are in general carrying capacities, that is, the maximum population size that an environment can sustain, intrinsic growth rate of that population, what includes both natural birth and death rates, and, sometimes, some other death rate, like in classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models. But a good example in the paratransgenesis problem, where your objective is stop the pathogen life-cycle, is a toxicity of the protein the system is producing in some equation that describe the pathogen itself.
Another very interesting problem to model is the transmission of the modified organism. This problem is still in the ecological spectre, but you may need to understand better the relation of the two species, how the horizontal and vertical transmissions occur, if they do, and even the micro-ecological system that already lives within the insect. If the final objective really is to put a modified organism in the environment, you need to try and predict its ecological behaviour, and if it can be successful in colonizing the insects, or even spread unintentionally among unwanted territory/hosts.
To work with all of this different aspects can be really hard, so a good way to have an accurate, but simple, model is try to focus just in some of them. Nevertheless attempting to integrate this whole complexity can be a challenging, but extremely interesting and even fun, endeavor.
How to model:
A good start is designing a simplified representation of the problem, like a scheme, where you draw the basic information of your inputs, the items to have their variation described in those models, their outputs and the relations between them.
Now, having a simplified notion of the system, you can have an objective point of view on it and then decide what type of model you want to do.
Differential Equations
Differential equations (D.E.) are a very interesting way to construct a mathematical representation of a system, and specially interesting when we are talking about paratransgenesis, as we"

The α-Hemolysin Transport System
The ɑ-hemolysin transport system is an ABC transporter complex consisting of three proteins, namely the outer membrane protein TolC, hemolysin B (HlyB), and hemolysin D (HlyD) Gentschev I, Dietrich G, Goebel W. The E. coli alpha-hemolysin secretion system and its use in vaccine development. Trends in microbiology. 2002;10(1):39-45. , which can effectively transport intracellular hemolysin A (HlyA) to the extracellular fluid. Utilising a linker peptide, the protein of interest can be fused with HlyA. Once a protein is HlyA-tagged, it can be recognised by the ATP-binding cassette HlyB, which will initiate transportation of the HlyA-tagged protein to the extracellular fluid, as seen in Figure 8 Gentschev I, Dietrich G, Goebel W.

We need to agree on some things about Clotho architecture.  I'm learning a lot about swing, and at the rate things are going, I can actually get the Sequence View done pretty soon.  Next thing on my list is to work on the actual ide interface or maybe spreadedit features.  Sequence View depends on spreadit features right now, but I might change that.  I'm not quite sure about how encapsulated an app should be.

Finished Sequence View today.  Admittedly, there is more that could be added.  However, the core of the challenge, highlighting features/orfs, has been implemented in full.  The code has been rigorously tested and it is bullet proof.  I want to present the app to the wetlab team but Traci is at sb 5.0 I think.  I think I will consider following the instructions to deploy a clotho app.  Also, need to make my wiki look nicer; Janoo has incited a wiki war.

I drafted my proposal for a new format for ClothoTools today: Media:New_Clothotool_Specifications.pdf .  I will be polishing the contents and using this document to create a presentation.  I hope to present this to the the Wellesley team.  Maybe they can optimize the interface or something.  I'm still unsure what Wellesley will contribute to the team, and so I am looking forward to the upcoming meeting on the 27th.
Asides from the working on the proposal today, I spent a decent chunk of time learning how to produce proper wiki pages.  When this notebook is complete, I hope it is something that I can be reasonably proud of.

This result demonstrates that people in China still hold a superficial and inadequate perception in the cognition of the malignant degree and the death rate of cancer.
The attitude towards cancer treatment and new therapies
● Of the 780 respondents, curative efficacy and side effects were their top priority concern if selecting cancer treatment.
● Under the influence of ""Wei Zexi incident"" (a malpractice due to deceptive advertising of immune therapy), 40.86% of the respondents worried about the curative effect and side effect of immune therapy as a new therapy for cancer, and 31.04% said they are afraid to be cheated and take advantage of by criminals when try a new therapy. 24.75% said they would believe the latest research achievements, while only 3.34% expressed entrust or even rejection of immune therapy.
● With a brief introduction of the background of molecular targeted drugs (e.g. Iressa), 64.87% of respondents were open to molecular targeting drugs and consider it acceptable, while 18.27% respondents were worried about the high expense, which they may be unable to afford. It should be noted that there are still 16.92% of the objects consider the immunotherapy as immature and are unwilling to take any risk.

Interview with doctor
To better understand the current situation of cancer treatment and further shape our project direction, we interviewed a doctor from Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School (also known as ‘Drum-tower Hospital’) for a broad view of therapeutic concern from professional perspective. There are many teams focusing on technical problems on the interaction between targeting drugs and their models, but the acceptance and trust issues from patients are less discussed. In our project, attitudes of patients is correspondingly valued, so we interviewed doctors from Drum-tower Hospital (Its oncology department is the National Key Clinical Specialist) for their opinions on patients’ acceptance and our project. The suggestion would not only be used for the further improvement of our project, but also provide a general concept of the safety issue that must be dealt with when synthetic biology encounters clinical medicine. Their professional experience and advices are valuable if we want to apply synthetic biology to a broader clinical field in the near future.

Lactoshield - SVCE_CHENNAI
Schools
Given that biotechnology is an emerging and still nascent field in India, we felt the need to create awareness among school students and educate them about the potential of biotechnology. We spoke to them about iGEM, its goals, synthetic biology and it’s the socio-economic impact it can have. Further we presented our project to them, illustrating to them an example of how a real life problem can be solved using synthetic biology.
We facilitated knowledge sharing about synthetic biology through flash cards, quizzes and other games. In Bertrand Russell Nursery & Primary School, Laurel Higher Secondary School, Five Star Matric Higher Secondary School we interacted primary and higher secondary school students and made them aware of the potential of synthetic biology and iGEM. We also interacted with the teachers of these schools and considered the possibility of them teaching the basics of biotechnology along with conventional biology.
Also, the Human practices team of Team SVCE_CHENNAI joined hands with Team IISC Bangalore and presented our respective projects to high school students of biotechnology at  Vidhya Mandir. Members of both the teams explained our projects together and the students expressed great inquisitiveness and also educated the students about some basic cloning stratergies in synthetic biology.
We evaluated the student’s knowledge before and after presentation by conducting Pre and Post Questionnaires.
We also discussed about a couple of fascinating projects of other iGEM teams(Probeeotics:British Columbia,iGEM 2015 &Colisweeper: ETH Zuich,iGEM 2012 Groningen).

Guelph,2008,Team:Guelph#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"otenoid production and GFP fluorescence. We definately didn't get a chance to test the operon with frdBCD in it, but crtEBCD with just GFP at the end did work (it seems). Both the constitutive promoter, PSBA and the Biobrick arabinose inducible promoter (BBa_R0080) were put in control of this operon, with similar results (GFP expression and orange pigment production).
Testing these constructs in E. coli Nissler 1917 will be attempted in anaerobic conditions after this website freezes, but lactobacilli have proven to be beyond the time frame of the possible for us this year. This quick  intestinal simulation will hopefully make it on our presentation and poster, but the website won't show it. Talk to us at the Jamboree to see if we got good results or not!
RNAi inducing corn endophytes (BIGS)
Making projections based on measurements on endosymbiont and endophyte numbers within a functioning biological system using GFP
We plan to do wet lab modelling. By tagging our microbes with simple GFP constructs and counting colony forming units per set sample fresh weight, we hope to be able to observe microbial survival with our construct and predict how much beta carotene or RNAi might be produced and released.
In corn, we are doing this using a corn endophyte called Klebsiella pneumonii strain 342. Using protocols for E. coli electroporation, these microbes were transformed with the gram negative broad host range GFP plasmid GFPuv. Plants were either injected twice with 10 ul of bacterial suspension or dipped in it at an early stage. Two or four weeks later 500 mg of tissue were harvested, ground in sterilized mortars, resuspended in 500 ul of sodium phosphate buffer, and 50 ul of the dilution was spread on half of a kanamycin LB plate.  The results are depicted graphically below.
We injected 20 ul of a bacterial OD of 0.85 we estimated to amount to be 1.07 million microbes based on colony forming unit counts (CFU). The above plates show a one fold dilution of homogenized plant tissue. This suggests that corn leaf tissue was harbouring 12 microbes per milligram of tissue (both root types had a similar number), while stem tissue near the site of injection had a number closer to 500. It is difficult to extrapolate accurately how many microbes might exist in the plant, know whether these are dispersed survivors from the injection or recent generations"

Three differents aptamers were tested, here are their sequences: Aptamer A: GGGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCACAGCGAACAGCGGCGGACATAATAGTGCTTACTACGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGGAG 2. Aptamer B: GGGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCACATGGCATGAAGTATTATTACCCAATTCCATACACAAGCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGG 3. Aptamer C: GGGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCGGCACAAGCATATGGACTCCTCTGAACCTACGATGTAGTACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGG
To both demonstrate the ability of our aptamers to fix their target, and the affinity constants,                                     Electrophoretic Migration Shift Assay (EMSA) were set. A proof of concept was realized with a well described aptamer and its target protein:                                     the human thrombin. This experiment allows to measure the affinity of an aptamer with its target.                                     The aptamer/protein complexes formed in presence of increasing amount of proteins were separated and quantified on native PAGE.
Fig 1. Aptamer-Thrombin complex analysis on native PAGE stained with SYBR Green. The aptamer linked to its heavy target protein migrates at a slower rate than the free aptamer (not linked).                                         Concentrations of thrombin are going from 10-4mol.L-1 (lane A) to 10-11 mol.L-1 (lane H), with a factor 10 between each lane.                                         Lane I is the control with no thrombin. The DNA was at a constant concentration of 10 nM. The DNA linked to thrombin migrates slower than free DNA.
Fig 2. Comparison of the 3 thrombin aptamers affinities to the target. This figure was obtained via integration of intensities of the lanes on several EMSAs (data not shown), with Bio-Rad ImageLab software.                                         The curves were modeled to fit the points. This allowed to calculate the Kds.
All three aptamers are able to fix thrombin.                                     The Kd are the concentration values corresponding to the inflexion points.                                     Our most sensitive aptamer detects thrombin down to 350 nmol.L-1, corresponding to the aptamer of "

We have considered using toxic chemicals as inputs to our program to suggest a pathway that would convert harmful pollutants into valuable chemicals. I wrote a script that scans a list of harmful chemicals from the EPA and then forms a dictionary pairing the chemical name to its KEGG_ID. The script doesn't quite work perfectly and not all chemicals are found on Kegg. This will be improved throughout the week. Also, I am looking into the possibility of using django to host our application on the web.
I was finally able to figure out who that girl is that I saw in the gatehouse and at work. Potential suspects were Lucy from the other team or Jacinda the secretary. After extensive facebook searches, the unlikely candidate of Julie Richards turned out to be the culprit. I look forward to meeting her or something so I feel less strange about all the stalking
Riyad Read articles related to metabolic pathways and biological networks to better understand how fluxes work. Also messed around with the Flux Balance Analysis in the COBRA toolbox.
Kanishka Worked on learning the python language through tutorials and textbooks.
Nate Explored the world that is wiki.  I learned some useful things about wikis(such as templates), and investigated ways to create and edit our wiki page.  Looked into some programs, such as dreamweaver, but I am not sure if that will really be of any help with the wiki.  I also learned some fun stuff about Linux, and learned some linux commands via Cygwin, a linux emulator for windows.  Lots of fun indeed!  Towards the end of the week, I learned a great deal about Python programming.  In particular, I learned about for and while statements, classes, def statements, regular and global variables, lists and strings.  This will be very useful in the future.  I was also able to write some small programs.  These included a number guesser program(user gives input of what to add and subtract to get to the goal) and a prime number generator.  These very basic programs are not very useful of course, but they allowed me to better understand the programming language.  Can't wait to start writing some useful code.  Also, watching Donny stalk people on facebook has been very entertaining.

Human Practices (Silver)
“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Summary of our Silver Human Practices Outputs
We produced a report of our investigation into science communication: A Corpus Based Investigation Into Science Communication
We compiled a set of guidelines for communicating synthetic biology: Breaking down the barriers: How should we communicate SynBio to the public?
Legislative issues associated with our project have been investigated
We have considered the safety of our work
Our team attended North East Big Bang Fair to discuss synthetic biology with students and teachers
Introduction
When considering reasons for the lack of uptake of biosensors, we chose to investigate one of the most fundamental aspects for the success of any project: communication. Communication also affects how synthetic biology and the many projects emerging from the field are received. Because of this, many of our human practices and education and public engagement activities are centred around sharing the research and activities we have completed in relation to science communication.
Our human practices work has focused on addressing technology uptake, which is one of the challenges that we identified to biosensor development and deployment. This took place in three main stages. First, we determined the current state of dialogue by consulting previous dialogue studies and reviewing how language is used in the media. We then generated our own guidelines to help future researchers to develop dialogue in a constructive way. Finally, we put this into practice by creating activities and sharing our work in a way that established a dialogue and encouraged discussion. Attending the N8 Crop and Agriculture Innovation Conference made us aware of the barriers which must be overcome to increase uptake"

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," oversight of the primer design was not initially noticed our plasmid map sequence for the C-terminal GFP part also contained the error. A part such as this with the extra two nucleotides before the start codon has the potential to be translated at decreased level from an upstream ribosome binding site.
AND-gate modules
Without realising the sequence issue of the GFP C-terminal part, assembly proceeded for making the respective split fragments into individual AND-gate modules.   The first design choice implemented for all four AND-gate modules was the inclusion of the double terminator part B0015 . This terminator part would be present at the end of each discrete module, and prevent read-through transcription from the preceding promoter through to the 2nd AND-gate module. The three split fragments created by PCR along with the pre-existing GFP N-terminal part K1789003 were restriction digested for insertion upstream of the B0015 terminator in pSB1C3. Following ligation, transformation, and restriction digest verification, these parts were sequenced. Both T7 RNAP modules were shown to be correct; however, at this stage the problem with the C-terminal GFP part was noticed, and a similar problem was discovered in the pre-existing N-terminal GFP part. The N-term GFP part contains an extra A nucleotide immediately preceding the start-codon ATG (Figure 4).
Figure 4:  A Biobrick prefix error in GFP N-term part. Alignment of a sequencing read of the split GFP N-terminal to a reference sequence plasmid map. The base highlighted in red indicate an insertion has occurred at those positions relative to the reference sequence. The single-A insertion may correspond to the use a taq-polymerase during the original amplification of this coding sequence. Alignments performed in ApE.
This erroneous nucleotide is present in the parts-registry sequencing for K1789003, but is not reported as an error. Unfortunately, now both split-GFP modules might be affected by improperly spaced ribosome binding sites. Despite this we proceeded to the next assembly stage.  A general design was chosen for both types of AND-gate, where one module of each gate would be placed under transcriptional control of a lacI-regulated promoter, and other module would be under control of a tetR-regulated promoter. The lacI ( R0011 ) and tetR ( R0040 ) regulated promoters were chosen to control the AND-gate modules as they are heavily characterised and well understood parts. We utilised a variant of both promoters (lacI: K1725080 , tetR: K244"
