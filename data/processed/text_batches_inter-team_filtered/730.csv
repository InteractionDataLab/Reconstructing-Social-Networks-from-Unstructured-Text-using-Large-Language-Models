TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Landmine_-_-_TEXT.html," fraction of the total amount of promoters.
The change of concentration of reporter protein ([R]) is given by the following ODE:   $$  \frac{d}{dt} [R] = \ \frac{[P_{A}]}{[P_{T}]}k_{1} + \ \frac{[P_{R}]}{[P_{T}]}k_{2} - \ d_{P}[R] \tag{12} $$  In equation (12), \(k_{1}\) is the rate of protein production from an active promoter (this could be regarded as a combination of \(s_{A}\) and \(s_{P}\)) and \(k_{2}\) is the rate of protein production from a repressed promoter (combination of \(s_{R}\)and \(s_{P}\)). In this equation, the transcription/translation-process is wrapped up in one equation instead of two as in equation (7.4) and (7.5). This can be justified by the fact that in in vivo systems, transcription and translation are strongly coupled [3]. Plugging in equation (11) and again considering the steady state, we arrive at the following expression for the equilibrium concentration of the reporter protein:   $$  [R]_{eq} = \ \frac{1}{d_{P}} \frac{k_{1}[DNT]+ \ K_{D} k_{2}}{K_{D} + \ [DNT]} \tag{13} $$  For the protein degradation rate we used the fixed value of \(4 \times 10^{-6} \ s^{-1}\), which is estimated from the data in [2]. To obtain the values for \(K_{D}\), \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\), we fitted equation (13) to the data from the Yagur-Kroll paper [1]. To do this, we used the nlinfit function in MATLAB.
Figure 5: Fits of the promoter activation model described by equation (13) to the data of [1]. The left panel shows the fit for the jbiJ promoter, the right panel the fit for the yqjFB2A1 promoter.
From figure 5, it is clear that the fits do not match the data. This is a strong indication that the model as described by equation (13) is not correct for the system at hand. We therefore went on to explore another model.

Harvard,2008,Team:Harvard#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," an electrical output that can be monitored by a computer.  This could theoretically allow for the remote sensing and analysis of the chemical composition of an environment over time in a cost-effective manner, making it a tool with powerful public health applications, such as monitoring water quality.
Another interesting direction would be the linking of the light-sensing system developed by the UT Austin iGEM team with electrical output in S. oneidensis.  In response to variations in light, the amount of electricity produced by S. oneidensis would change.  This would allow for the intriguing possibility of not only S. oneidensis conveying information to the computer, but also the computer responding to the S. oneidensis.  A simple example would be that in response to a chemical input, S. oneidensis may increase its electrical output.  Sensing this increase, the computer could turn on or off a light directed at the S. oneidensis, modifying S. oneidensis's output, creating interesting feedback loops.  This could ultimately be developed into more complex communications systems between bacteria and computers. We tried constructing this system over summer, but as the process requires making an EnvZ knockout strain of S. oneidensis, we could not finish it. We did, however, make a few parts to facilitate future attempts.
The possibilities are further broadened by our observations of co-cultures of E. coli and S. oneidensis.  Either of the systems described above could be pursued through an alternative alternative strategy of co-cultures.  For instance, an array of E. coli which respond to different chemicals by breaking down lactose into lactate could be cultured with S. oneidensis.  In response to an increase in lactate, S. oneidensis would begin to produce higher levels of electricity.  Co-cultures could also allow for more complex bacteria-computer interactions.  This strategy could enable the coupling of almost any E. coli ability to electrical output.
These future directions in which our research can be taken demonstrate some of the exciting possibilities of BACTRICITY!

Interspecies conjugation
Weâd like to furthermore test our system with different bacteria. If, as we suppose, our kiler bacteria can conjugate with other Gram negative bacteria, our system could kill the antibiotic multi-resistance bacteria usually found in           hospital, ... (like Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus sp, â¦)           Unfortunately, we donât had enough time to test itâ¦ It will be tested soon after Boston.
Design with complete RP4 plasmid
For better efficiency, weâd like to design the same conjugation/killing system, not with a âlightâ mobilizable plasmid like we have used, but with a complete RP4 plasmid (about 60k bp) to have a much better conjugation efficiency.
Biosafety aspect
Weâd like to add biosafety composant to our system. With a killer plasmid carrying the R6K machinery, our killer plasmid will be dependant of Lambda-Pir. If our plasmid become liberated, it cannot be propagated.           We have started such system, with a conjugative strain (pSW23T) carrying the R6K Ori. We have clone in this plasmid, after have change the MCS, our âkillerâ cassette containing the Cas9 and our killer sgRNA. This plasmid was cloner in           S17-1 who have Lambda-Pir.           Unfortunately, we donât had enough time to test itâ¦ It will be done soon after Boston.
We also like to add a FRT sequence around, for example, the resistance gene present in our plasmid. With a special enzyme, this antibiotic resistance gene will be âcutâ of the plasmid, who will be safier.
Adding a recombination system
As we want to do in a first time (but aborted because of time), we wanted to combine our conjugative âkillerâ system, with a sequence that could permit our âkillerâ cassette to recombine into the target bacteria. A such system will be           more efficient.

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", undeveloped fields, or even their backyards so that flowers can grow, giving the bees more access to food. We used seeds from Smooth Blue Aster, Purple Prairie Clover, and Prairie Coneflower to make our seed bombs because they are native to Southern Alberta, and would not be considered an invasive species.
We distributed seed bombs to members of the public and informed them about our project and the plight of the bees. Many people accepted our project and showed their support by signing a petition that supported urban beekeeping in Lethbridge, which is currently illegal.
Urban Planning
As we looked around our city, we noticed that it could be improved in terms of having more flowers around parks and along roadways. By doing this, not only would our city look more aesthetically pleasing, but having more flowers would attract bees to our city. The bees would pollinate the flowers and thus help them survive. Attracting more bees would also help our local agricultural industry by increasing pollination of their crops.
To help focus our ideas, we contacted Parks and Planning officials from our city. Ryan Carriere, the parks planning manager for the City of Lethbridge, responded back to us and we had the chance to interview him.
Interview:
iGEM: We want to have more flowers in our parks and along roadways inside the City of Lethbridge. Do you think we can actually implement this idea?
Ryan: Thatâs a possibility. [One of the simplest ways] we could increase flowers is [by planting them] along roadways. Some of the problems we might have with that is getting a mixture of flowers that are drought-tolerant, low maintenance, and that are kind of native to the area. We can develop a seed mix like that, but obviously we would look to a group like yourselves to come up with that mix and help us with that. We would have to do some test pilots first, just to see. The price would have to be comparable to the grass seed mix that we use currently. In terms of putting more flowers into parks, Lethbridge is sort of unique in the sense that our river valley that runs through the city has a vast amount of flowers. We donât use any insecticides throughout the whole city. So we arenât affecting bees that way. But in terms of the small parks around the city, putting flowers in them, I donât think would actually make a big difference in the bee health population. I know that Red Deer is implementing these pollinator parks, which to me is basically a âword of the dayâ. In the actual population of bees, putting"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Denmonstrate.html_-_-_TEXT.html," we test them in DH5Î± and BL21. We believe that the success of these core parts will ultimately make the system work in the real world.
1.Nitric oxide sensor
We constructed our NO sensor in the pCDFDuet-1 plasmid (Figure 1). Although the E. coli has native NorR expression, increasing its expression facilitates the elimination of stoichiometric imbalances between NorR in the genome and PnorV on the foreign plasmid, avoiding interference with the host's detoxification of nitric oxide.
According to the results of the ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team , 100Î¼M SNP aqueous solution can continuously release NO, and the NO concentration is stable at about 5.5Î¼M. This concentration is the concentration of NO in patients with IBD and it is nearly 100 times higher than normal people. So, we can simulate the patient's inflammatory signal in vitro. In the subsequent test of the NO sensor, the final concentration of the SNP aqueous solution we added was 100 Î¼M.
We transformed the constructed plasmid of NO sensor into DH5Î±, and cultured at 37 â overnight to dilute to OD = 0.2. After 1.5 h of growth at 37 â, the inducer IPTG and SNP aqueous solution were added. After 6 h at 37 â, 1 mL of the bacterial solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 min (Figure 2). It can be seen that the NO released by the SNP aqueous solution can effectively activate the expression of the reporter gene. But to our surprise, the blue chromoprotein in group 1mM IPTG without SNP was also be activated. We have not yet figured out the reasons behind this phenomenon. But we speculate that it may be caused by leaky expression of promoter PnorV when the NorR overexpress. Due to this, we will use a weak promoter to express NorR in future engineered bacteria to avoid leakage.

Basic orthogonal memory modules
This part is a combination of existing memory devices. In one time period, only one of these orthogonal devices in this part are ready to work. And each device only correspond to this time period, and respond to the inducer in this time period. We choose integrases to build this part. In the above animation, except Time 1 and Time 3 which serve as recording interval, Time 2 and Time 4 are corresponding to IntA and IntB respectively. Of course, any orthogonal memory devices can be used here with similar design.
Results
The orthogonality of the integrases
Overview
We have to ensure the orthogonality of our integrases because it is required for building sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules. Five serine integrases were obtained from the start of our project. They are phiBT1, Bxb1, phiC31, phiRv1 and TG1. We designed and conducted the experiment based on PCR, which implied good orthogonality between each of them, except for the crosstalk between phiRv1 and attB/P sites of phiC31.
Methods
Two plasmids are adopted in this test. Before conducting our experiment, we made competent TOP10 expressing transcriptional factors, which had already transformed with pUC19-LacI-AraC high copy plasmid(Fig.4 a). On the testing plasmid, all five attB and attP pairs are aligned together(Fig.4 b). Some notices of this alignment are listed here: 1. attB/P of one integrase are in opposite direction; 2. There is no nucleotide between former attP and latter attB; 3. Primer pairs(Fig.4 c) are designed to determine by PCR whether each attB/P has been inverted by the integrase. One of the five integrases is also expressed using PBAD controlled by L-arabinose. We tested each"

Overview
Over the past decades, mankind has sought for a  new source of energy. It must be green, clean and 100% renewable. Microbial fuel cells (MFC) come to us as a plausible solution. The concept of tiny organisms converting waste materials into electricity has captured attention of scientists and publics around the world. However, MFC is inefficient and produces little electricity. In this project, we aim to improve MFC through decomposition of gold nanoparticles within the anodic chamber. What is more, our MFC must be bistable as well as tunable to work well under a wider range of conditions.
We engineer the genetic circuit of Escherichia coli, such that the bacteria could sense gold and respond accordingly. Our new, engineered organism is called Electricus aureus. Our circuit is subdivided into three modules (Figure 1). The first is gold sensing. It is designed to recognize gold (HAuCl4) in its environment. GolS is a transcriptional activator of the promoter P(golTS). Upon binding with the gold, it dimerizes and binds to the recognition site within the promoter. The second is gold scavenging peptides. There are four variants of the fusion between MIDAS-2 and A3. We also include the N-terminal pelB tag for secretion to the periplasm and IM9 for higher stability. Note that the tag is likely to be removed during transportation process and potentially our peptides should be released to the extracellular space.  IM9 tag is relatively small (~9.5 kDa) and should not interfere with mineralization mediated by the peptides. Genes for the peptides are placed downstream of the gold sensing promoter, such that mineralization is conditional to concentrations of gold in the environment. The final module is hybrid bist"

Project 1: Model System for studying quorum activation of pathogenicity
Quorum sensing is a system of bacterial communication that coordinates gene expression based on population density. Bacteria secrete a signaling molecule, such as N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones (AHL), that binds to specific extracellular receptors on neighboring bacteria to activate transcription factors.  As the bacterial population increases, the signaling molecule reaches a certain threshold that initiates a positive-feedback loop and causes all members of the population to activate certain genes at roughly the same time.  Many pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing to activate their virulent factors, as it is not energetically favorable for a single bacterium to release its virulent factors until it is in a large enough population to infect a host.  In our project, the CU-Boulder iGEM team aims to disrupt quorum sensing in order to reduce pathogenicity of otherwise virulent bacteria.
It has been well documented in research that bacteria use quorum sensing signals to activate pathogenic factors. The gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa synthesizes AHLs as a bacterial density indicator, and upon reaching a specific threshold, pathogenic factors are activated (Iglewski et al., 2000). P. aeruginosa is a common opportunistic infection that occurs most frequently in immune-compromised patients (Iglewski et al., 2000).  This quorum sensing mechanism for activation of pathogenic traits has also been demonstrated in Salmon"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," academic representatives who were qualified to give an informative understanding of the issue of gender inequality and a lack of diversity in science. There were two student representatives: Alec James, the current VP Welfare sabbatical officer for the Students Guild at the University of Exeter. His role as VP Welfare includes providing the students with a voice for making the university accessible and inclusive as he could communicate studentâs issues with the leading academic boards. And Laura Howard, the University of Exeter academic representative coordinator for undergraduate students, specifically in STEM. Her role involves liaising with the student staff liaison committee (SSLC) in which STEM students who have issues with the quality of their experience get their voices heard. There were also two academic representatives: Dr Alison Hill, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Exeter. Dr Hill has taken programmes like the Aurora leadership programme and is considered a mentor and role model to many, shown by her nomination for the teaching awards in 2012 and consistently high feedback ratings. Dr Rob Wilson, head of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group in Biosciences at the university and senior lecturer in conservation biology. Dr Wilson was one of the academics we interviewed and he gave a really interesting, grounded perspective on the state of affairs at the university and how it should be improved. Through this discussion, we were able to establish a two way communication with the public with questions from the floor for our expert panel. The event was shared both on Facebook, with over 200 people interested in attending, and by the university, and as it was streamed live and broadcasted live on XTV and Xpression FM respectively, we were able to reach people from all across the country.

Key Points:
We tried to cover the key points that were discussed in the section that highlighted academics work on improving gender equality and diversity in their fields. Consequently we talked about issues related to the massive social and structural change needed for there to be a significant difference as well as specific points like the importance of role models, mentors and the problem of gender distribution at higher levels of science.
We began the discussion with the relatively simple question of 'what is diversity?â. Many people have a very narrow view of what diversity is, mostly commenting on gender, ethnicity, religion and socio-economic background. Laura viewed the definition of diversity as:
Getting representation from people of all different backgrounds, whether that be racially, sexual orientation, gender, socio-economic background. It"

Genome Alberta
To continue last years' work we formed a collaboration with Genome Alberta to engage the scientific community in Alberta. Through the Genome Alberta website we published blogs detailing what our project is and our progress at various points. By interfacing our work through their website we were able to interact with the large base of scientists and industry members that work with Genome Alberta. As well as providing a distraction from the PCRs and genome preps of scientists in Alberta, we raised awareness of the issues surrounding EHEC contamination of beef and how we are aiming to help. The fruits of our collaboration with Genome Alberta are linked below.

Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team
This yearâs Macquarie University iGEM team continued a tradition of collaboration by assisting the Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team with their project. The Paris teamâs project this year involves determining the enzymes involved in the break-down of pigment molecules in wine. The idea for this project stems from the fact that wine stains on clothes are amongst the hardest stains to remove, requiring, amongst others, perchloroethylene, which is listed as a possible human carcinogen. As such, finding an alternative method to removing wine stains would be beneficial to human health. The need for collecting samples from vineyards stems from the idea that certain organisms contain enzymes that are able to degrade wine pigments such as anthocyanins and tannins. Collecting these samples would enable the isolation and identification of these enzymes.
The many quality wine producing regions of Australia made collaborating with the Paris team for their iGEM project seem a natural fit for collecting the required samples. After discussing with the Paris team about their requirements, we were able to collect two samples from a vineyard here in Australia for their project. The first sample was a falcen tube of soil obtained from soil just located around the roots of a vine. The second sample contained contain vine bark, as well as shoots from both last yearâs vintage, and this yearâs vintage. More detailed descriptions of the samples obtained are attached(?).
Given samples were being sent overseas. Customs forms for both France and Australia needed to be completed detailing what was contained in the samples. Examples of the customs forms that needed to be completed are attached(?)."

Lux
The Lux Module is the input signal controller of our Negative Feedback Loop(NFBL) as the part A. In our project, we utilized quorum sensing system's sensing part as the signal sensor of the Module, this allows downstream gene expression to be operated by external signal. We have examined four quorum sensing systems(Lux, Tra, Rhl, Rpa) and finally choose the Lux as the input part of our module.
Key Achievements
Construct Lux, Tra, Rhl, Rpa quorum sensing system
Evaluation for each quorum sensing system
Overview
Quorum sensing is a natural occurring mechanism that certain strains of bacteria use to regulate gene expression in response to their population density. As quorum response proteins be translated, signaling molecules such as N-acyl homoserine lactones or AHLs could bind transcription factors and activate downstream gene expression as well the cellâs growth.
In our project, quorum sensing response genes were connected to receptors from other modules, and associated AHLs were added to control downstream gene expression. We have examined four quorum sensing systems (Lux, Tra, Rhl, Rpa) to evaluate weather each quorum sensing system is suitable for our Negative Feedback Loop (NFBL) or not.
Fig.2 Mechanism of the Lux Module
Through experiments, Lux show advantages in its robustness and sensitivity, including:
Lower background leakage: Downstream expression perform very low when associate AHL was note added.
High sensitivity: Only very little amount of associate AHL were needed to activate downstream expression.
Stable expression: Downstream gene expression performed stable even after 8 hours after adding associate AHL.
According to Luxâs outstanding performance its sensitivity and robustness, we chose the Lux quorum system to control module A.
Our Approach
The first node of our three-node negative feedback loop, was controlled by the Lux quorum sensing system and the repressive RNA switch pT181 from module C, which was designed as âpCon(J23100) + pT181 Target + RBS(BBa_B0034) + LuxR + TER(BBa_B0015)â.
We believe that, as pT181 RNA switch is open, the Lux transcriptional activator, LuxR, is translated. With the induction of exogenous AHL, LuxR will combine with AHL molecules and activate the Lux transcriptional promoter, pLux, and lead downstream gene expression.
In the absence of AHL, the pLux promoter will not be activated, which means the system keeps off without input signal. When the concentration of AHLs changes, the"

One tube of every construct was grown in 24 ËC, 30 ËC, and 37 ËC. Samples were taken after 1 and 2 hours. SDS-PAGE was run (for elaborate protocol see Notebook / Protocols ). Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 depicts GFP expression at different temperatures. Although our RNA thermometers were designed to melt at 37 ËC, some displayed leakiness to different extent. GJ3 (link: BBa_K2622011 ) RNA thermometer was the leakeast and allowed for GFP translation at lower temperatures. On the other hand, when grown at 37 ËC, it unlocked the translation of GFP to highest yields. GJ2 (link: BBa_K2622010 ) was less leaky, but inhibited protein translation more strictly when grown at 37 ËC. GJ6 (link: BBa_K2622012 ), GJ9 (link: BBa_K2622013 ), and GJ10 (link: BBa_K2622014 ) suppressed GFP production at 24 ËC and 30 ËC at similar level. They also inhibited translation to some extent at higher temperatures, meaning their melting temperature was not reached. Altogether these results prove, that our synthetic thermoswitches are temperature-responsive and act in physiological temperature range needed for IVTT reaction and also for BamA folding and membrane insertion.

C. REPORTER
In order to make sure the presence of DNA  from HPV 16 and 18, we need reporter which connect to detector.  Fluorescent protein usually used as reporter gene to study about gene expression. Gene encoding fluorescent protein was synthesized in four stages (Laufer et al, 2013). Chromoprotein can be used as good reporter. Another useful feature of the chromoproteins is the âkindlingâ behavior, which makes them prospective photoactivatable markers. In this project, we used amilCP blue chromoprotein. This chromoprotein was extracted from Acropora millepora and  display purple-blue colour (Alieva et al, 2008).
This is one of chromoprotein collection from Uppsala Team 2012 . This chromoprotein will be connected to detector using linker. amilCP bind to E coil and interact with Tale-K coil. This reporter show the presence of Human Papilloma Virus by colour change. When the HPV DNA is bind to detector, spesific sequence of HPV will be recognized and blue colour appears  in the second strip. The Colour intensity will be detected in our software and we can determined the risk level of cervical cancer disease. Dark blue colour show the amount of  DNA  from HPV 16 and 18 is high and indicate the patient get severe cervical cancer.
D. PROTOTYPE
With those concept as explained before, weâre trying to make a prototype for early detection to cervical cancer that has some common with test pack. These are our model for the prototype:
We test the sample from menstrual blood that we hypothesized if she got cervical cancer, the menstrual blood will go through the endometrium and then to cervix which is can bring some of the infected cells. Then the give a little bit of menstrual blood to the applicator. Inside the test pack weâll use nitrocellulose membrane to get the result. Next steps is the binding from TALE 1 that already bind with the linker and reporter to the HPV DNA that can be found in menstrual blood. We canât be sure if the TALE 1 and HPV DNA is binding without the TALE 2, so the sample will be catch by TALE 2 that stands for positive line. If that two TALEs canât bind to the DNA it means negative"

0. Summary
When we tried to represent Snow White with TA system and Quorum Sensing, we faced two problems. First, we could access too little data of TA system to work on our project. Second, simulation of our final genetic circuits revealed that Rhl system was too weak to function as well as Lux system and our final circuits could not work well. So we decided to characterize the existing TA system and rhlR parts, and improve the past improved Prhl in order to represent Snow White as faithfully as we could. As a results, the data we obtained makes easy to use these existing TA system and rhlR parts. Furthermore, our original improved Prhl expands the possibility to use Quorum Sensing.
1. Characterization of TA system
Table 1-1 TA system that has been studied in the preceding iGEM.
1-1. ""Backgroundâfor our Characterization of TA system
TA system is the function that regulates cell growth on the genomic DNA of many microorganisms. So far, iGEM 2014 team ULB-Brussels, iGEM 2013 team UGent had studied about ccdB-ccd, iGEM 2014 team Wageningen UR about Kid-Kis and Zeta-Epsilon, iGEM 2015 team UMaryland about Hok-Soc. Almost all the iGEM teams dealing with TA system aimed to use it as Kill Switch or substitution for antibiotics. On the other hand, we aim to study the interaction of toxin and antitoxin in a cell. Besides some teams failed to show enough data of TA system assay. Although UCSF 2012 experienced the communication through TA system including mazEF system, they did not introduce toxin and antitoxin into a cell and could not show mazEF system assay data. Our results show that the cell growth can be controlled by mazEF system.
iGEM 2016 team Tokyo_Tech has studied about mazEF system (MazF : toxin , MazE : antitoxin) that has been researched well as TA system.
1-2. Summary of the experiment
We studied mazEF system with various conditions and found that the best condition of expressing mazEF system in one cell. Besides, we also found that cell growth regulated by the alternative expression of MazE and MazF.

Finally, here you can download  the files related to 3D printing, laser cutting and the Arduino code for making your own Seletora Centrifuge !
Community outreach and integration
More than only setting up a great hardware kit, we also interacted intensively with a broad audience. We engaged the USP community directly with a well structured Hackathon, got in touch directly with teachers and high school students at the FabLearn conference and spread the Open Lab Hardware word even for designers and artists at FAZ!
BioHackathon at USP
In the hope of reaching out to the community and effectively making an impact with our work, we organized a hands-on open workshop on making open hardware equipment for biotech. The event was organized in partnership with University of Sao Paulo (USP) Synthetic Biology Club, USP Free Hardware group, USP entrepreneurship nucleus and the agrotech company Lotan, founded by former iGEMers. This partnership made the event possible and the company even adopted some hardware made, the Seletora Centrifuge, the Transilluminator Tabajara and one Electrophoresis Chamber. The rest of the equipment produced in the event was either given to the participants at  purchase cost or  was directly used by our team to develop our project. More than reaching out to the entrepreneurship community and former iGEMers, we had also a participant from USP-EEL-Brazil 2016 iGEM team, which travelled 200km just for the event!
The microcentrifuge and the other equipment weâve built costed a great deal less than a commercial one, but the most important part is the autonomy and freedom that having these Open Hardware pieces promotes. The experience on making these equipments will surely guarantee that this culture will continue, not only among our team members, but among all the students that have attended our workshop. These students with different knowledge backgrounds, from biology to humanities to engineering, also are helping to build a community, wih insights that are making the Open Hardwares more functional, practical and accessible!

3 Sharings to students (Coverage: 950 students)
We often hold public sharing on science, particularly synthetic biology, to the fellow students and teachers in our school. What we have done over the years is fruitful and have definitely match our aim to cultivate a research and science atmosphere in UCCKE. Here is a list of activities with details of what we have done in the past year.
Activities
Details
Science talks to student (Coverage: whole school ~950 students)
We have held two talks in the school assembly in this year on 20 and 24/10/2016. On 20/10/2016, we have invited Team:Hong_Kong_HKU to come over and share about their experience joining iGEM on the school assembly to the fellow student. On 24/10/2016, the iGEM team member of our school present our project to the fellow students on the assembly. We didnât only present our project to them, we also told them what science or research really is. Our presentation successfully made students to have more interest to learn more about research.
Science game booth (Coverage: ~200 students)
Our school held the Academic week every single year around the mid December. Last year, we held public exhibition booth in the common area  of our school, introducing synthetic biology to fellow students and teachers. We have set up a black box with pGLO-transformed green fluorescent E.Coli and Non-transformed E.Coli in LB Agar plates for visitors to witness the pGLO expressed in Green Fluorescent Protein. To make it more interesting, We  streak the E.Coli on the LB Agar in a special pattern like emojis and cartoon characters. It received overwhelming feedback from some junior form students saying that they have never thought of science being such cute.
Experiment session with primary school students (Coverage: 50 students)
We have an undeniable passion to share our love of science to the youth because they are going to be the new major force in the future. Kau Yan School, being one of our closely related Primary school, was invited to come over and enjoy a one day science camp in our school for their Primary 5 students. We decided to carry out  a DNA Extraction experiment with them and they simply have a blast with it.
The course has received very positive feedback from our student too. The course have grown from a total participant of"
SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," imagination is that she can compete with teams from around the world via doing biology experiments. It is definitely a challenge to her as this is the first time she worked in an iGEM team However, she appreciates the chance to learn not only genetic biology more deeply but also the importance of collaboration. Outside the competition, she holds several positions in the school activities, such as the propaganda minister of the coffee shop, the reporter of the newspaper, the member of the student union and so on. In a nut shell, she is looking forward to taking part in iGEM and she believe that all her efforts will pay off!
Li, Haocong - Laboratory Researcher
Haocong Li, from SHSBNU grade 11. The reason why he is interested in researching biology programs is that he admires the power of nature. He also wants to make the world a better place. Additionally, he is also a loyal aviation fan, especially the field of commercial airplanes. During spare time, he often goes to the local airport to take pictures of airplanes. Seeing the plane landing and the hearing the sound of the turbine engines, makes sense of the dream coming true.
Xie, Zhiran - Human Practice Researcher
Zhiran Xie, from SHSBNU, grade 11. As a member of the team, he participates in the lab work, the math modeling, and the human practice. He is one of the three leaders of Synthetic biology club, which groups different people who have different hobbies together, not only students who want to major in biology, but also who are willing to challenge themselves and try their best in different areas. He has lots of interests, and he is ready to help others.â Try you best no matter what you need to deal with, try something new whatever the times of failure you have to face. "" he believed it.
Yuan, Yijia - Laboratory Researcher
Yijia Yuan, from SHSBNU grade 11. She is interested in Biology. Whatever how busy she is, she keeps studying Biology as a hobby. Also, she is interested in human health care and medicine due to her family back ground. Last summer vacation, she spent 2 weeks to learn relevant classes in UCLA. There will be no surprise that her ideal job is doctor. Moreover, she has other hobbies including traveling, drawing, and watching movies.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," module. The relaysâ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the userâs mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service lifeâ¥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," held an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of the IGEM competition. Besides IGEM, we also discussed many frontier life science progress and appreciated their unique views.
We then showed them our lab space and facilities, including cell sonicators, ultra-centrifuges and flow cytometry. We explained the principles using analogies and metaphors. The IDPI ended around 6 pm and we can see through their eyes and faces that these high students were reluctant to leave. As one of the visiting students commented, this tour was 'so impressive and amazing'. We believed that the one day IDPI truly delivered the IGEM core value by arousing their curiosity to explore the secrets of nature. A few days after the visit, the teachers contacted us to consult us for building a biology lab. We really hope that this is the beginning of another amazing adventure!
Poster
During the investigation of intestinal diseases, we realized that IBD is a world-wide threat to human health with a great morbidity and severity. And we found that, unfortunately, public awareness intestinal diseases like IBD is insufficient.
Thus, we decided to introduce IBD and its hazard to the public. The symptoms, diagnosis and related information about IBD were collected.
A poster was designed by our team to show the public that IBD is threating our health, and we need basic knowledge about it. The poster includes the definition, morbidity, diagnosis, symptoms and potential causes about IBD. Our IGEM project Gutrio and the idea to utilize synthetic biology to treat IBD were also introduced.
We have introduced IBD to many communities, and wish more and more people to realize the severity of IBD.

UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#2 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," Do not use a larger culture volume than recommended in the protocol, as this will result in inefficient lysis and reduce the quality of the preparation.
3. Grow the culture at 37Â°C with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm) for 12â16 hours (see next section).
4. Harvest the bacterial culture 12â16 hours after inoculation. This corresponds to the transition from logarithmic into stationary growth phase, when cell density is high (3â4 x 109 cells per ml) and RNA content of cells is low. Harvesting too early may result in lower than expected yields of plasmid DNA due to a lower cell density. Harvesting too late may result in low plasmid quality and yield due to DNA degradation from over-aging of the culture.
Tip: Growth of cultures is dependent on factors such as host strain, plasmid insert and copy number, and culture medium. To determine the optimal harvesting time for a particular system, monitor the cell density and the growth of the culture by measuring the OD600 (see next section).
5. Harvest the bacterial culture by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4Â°C. Remove all traces of supernatant by inverting the open centrifuge tube until all of the medium has been drained. The cells are now ready for the lysis procedure, as indicated in the appropriate plasmid purification protocol.  The procedure may be stopped at this point and continued later by freezing the cell pellets obtained by centrifugation. The frozen cell pellets may be stored at â20Â°C for several weeks.
For storing E.coli strains:
Glycerol stocks
E. coli strains can be stored for many years at â70Â°C in 15% glycerol.
Prepare glycerol stocks of bacteria as follows:
1. Add 0.15 ml glycerol (100%) to a 2 ml screw-cap vial and sterilize by autoclaving.  Tip: Vials of sterilized glycerol can be prepared in batches and stored at room temperature until required.
2. Add 0.85 ml of a logarithmic-phase E. coli culture to the vial of pre-sterilized glycerol.
3. Vortex the vial vigorously to ensure even mixing of the bacterial culture and the glycerol.
4. Freeze in ethanolâdry ice or liquid nitrogen and store at â70Â°C.
Tip: Avoid repeated thawing and re-freezing of glycerol stocks as this can reduce the viability of the bacteria.

Human Practices
Our team has put a lot of effort into utilizing many different avenues for communicating who we are and what we are doing. Not just have we done multiple educational activities, such as starting the first Danish high school iGEM team , giving talks for 9th graders and advocate for iGEM at a competition for aspiring young students in natural sciences , all of which has a seperate web-page. We have also done a collaboration with the universities of Copenhagen and Exeter to compose a report on the history, ethics and public discourse surrounding Mars colonization. Furthermore, we hosted a 3-day workshop, the Biobrick tutorial , for more than 80 igem participants from Scandinavian iGEM teams, where performing assembly experiments and exploring the broader possibilities of participating in iGEM were in forefront.
Directly related to our project,  we have spoken with both the industry experts, such as Ecovative and Novozymes , and experts from academia , who have helped shape our ideas and provided valuable feedback to our project. We have also met with another fungal biomaterial project here at DTU to discuss their experiences with growing fungus and how we potentially can help each other moving forward.
Finally, we have worked on reaching out to the broader public be attending a competition in sustainable energies , doing SnapChat takeovers and being showcasing our project during the annual cultural night in Copenhagen .

To elucidate which direction our project could take, we spoke with experts from both industry and academia. From them, we have gained valuable information on how to conduct our experiments and"
UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," first year on the iGEM team. I love everything science and so the interdisciplinary and undergraduate guided research in iGEM is an incredibly enjoyable experience for me!
Scott Taylor | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
As a junior in the MIMG Department (for now), Iâm am a new addition to the iGEM team. My previous lab experience has been working on data analysis and correlation of production of certain yeast metabolites. In the coming year, I am eager to explore synthetic biology, which I sees as a very open frontier for interesting, novel ideas to be explored. As for my long term goals, itâs all up in the air.
Amy Pai | Sophomore | Neuroscience
Initially, I was pleasantly surprised that there would be a research team genuinely valuing input from first-years like me. UCLA iGEM not only offers the platform for individual voice in developing a project, but also opens the door to many aspects of research dynamics. Syn bio wields massive potentials for creative minds, and itâs remarkable that we get to explore the field this way.
Nithin Dharmaraj | Junior | Bioengineering
I am a junior study bioengineering. I enjoy the creativity and autonomy that iGEM provides and also cherish the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds at my university. Though most of my transformations rarely work, I still marvel at the power of synthetic biology when in the off chance I do see colonies on my plate. With this same excitement, I hope to pursue a profession in advancing the field of healthcare in the future.
Yashes Srinivasan | Sophomore | Bioengineering
Passionate about science and innovation, I am excited to be part of UCLA iGEM. The program offers more than just a research experience. It encourages independence and creativity and allows students to explore unique interests alongside a dynamic and driven group of individuals. The interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology provides several opportunities as well as exposure to many different fields of science.
Jared Lamar | Junior | Physics
âI am a junior undergraduate majoring in Physics at UCLA. This is my second year on the team. What I'm most drawn to about iGEM and synthetic biology is the sheer number of possibilities there are in terms of the directions our research can take. It really feels like the sky is the limit as to what we can make these little microbes do."

The RIOT system uses CD44v6 as a spatial marker, and recognition of this protein via a CD44v6 specific antibody allows anchoring of the engineered bacteria on the surface, triggering the expression of invasin and LLO for subsequent invasion.
Part III:RIOT Responder-Invader
LuxR is under the control of pHas, which get activated via transponder circuit. The production LuxR will then induce the expression of LuxI, invasin, LLO (listeriolysin O) and GFP respectively. There is already a basal level of AHL in the bacteria. Upon LuxI expression, more AHL is produced, thus amplifying the loop of this positive-feedback mechanism.
Invasin helps the bacteria to get into cell endosome while LLO which is a pore-forming toxin will allow the bacteria to escape out of the endosome into cytosol. We use GFP as a marker to locate the bacteria and signal the successful activation of circuit.
BACKGROUND:
Invasin is derived from the bacteria Yersinia pestis which allows selective invasion of cells that express Î²1-integrins. Listeriolysin O (LLO) on the other hand, is expressed in Listeria monocytogenes and allows the bacteria to break out of the endosome after entry into mammalian cells.  LLO is activated in the low pH enviroment (pH 5.5) of the endosome. Then,  LLO  will forms pores in the membrane of the endosome and results in the lysis of the endosome and the escape of the bacterium into the cytoplasm. Combining the traits of these two genes, our engineered bacteria is capable of entering the cytosol of cancer cells to potentially release a cytotoxic drug.
We aim to make a construct that is activated in the presence of a hasS-hasI complex that is formed in the presence of CD44v6 on the surface of cancer cells. The construct makes use of luxR and luxI to activate the production of invasin and listeriolysin O (LLO), as well as a designated drug that will be able to kill off the cancer cells.
The combination of both invasin and LLO allows the bacterium to invade mammalian cells and escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm of the cell. Once in the cytoplasm, the drug released from the bacterium can build up within the cell"

At first I was really skeptical about the iGEM program because as a first semester there are so many new things to learn and to think about. However I decided to learn more about iGEM and on our first briefing I was so impressed about the engagement and courage of the members of last yearÂ´s team that I decided to join. Furthermore, there was also another aspect which guided me to the iGEM-Team. It was the idea of being creative, meeting new people and learning about synthetic biology all at once.

Does the concept of competition exist within synthetic biology? If so, how does an institution market the Staphiscope to optimize their opportunities for growth?
How can the marketing strategy approach be differentiated to ensure that both the scientific and non-scientific community are exposed to the relative benefits of the Staphiscope?
How do we channels the knowledge and learnings acquired within the synthetic biology industry and channel it to other stakeholders that will prospectively be impacted by the technology?
The purpose of the analysis is to ensure that the scientific industry understands the importance of bridging the scientific theory of a product to its economic feasibility. Moreover, it encourages institutions who participate in developing synthetic biology technologies to align their perception of a revolutionary design to what will be socially acknowledged by a non-scientific community.
What is the Staphiscope?
Methicilin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are bacteria whose presence has been quite problematic in terms of human pathogenic infections. Since its discovery in the 1880s, Staphylococcus aureus has been the known cause for several kinds of minor skin, and major post-surgical infections. Prior to 1940, mortality rates in relation to this pathogenic organism reached 80% (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008.) The first wave of resistant S. aureus came two years after the introduction of penicillin for medicinal practice in 1940. In less than twenty years, most of the S. aureus strains known to man were unaffected by the antibiotic. In the late 1950s, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin was brought forth to the medicinal market; this was methicilin (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008.) The bacterium's subsequent resistance to methicilin came two years after its introduction in 1959. The mecA gene responsible for methicillin resistance is also to blame for the organismsâ desensitization to several classes of antibiotics (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008). This has led to the creation of the term: MRSA, now commonly used worldwide.
While an MRSA infection is much like a S. aureus infection, the difference comes in the lack of sensitivity of the MRSA to several classes of antibiotics. This makes MRSA infections a serious threat in both health and economical aspects.

The WHO guideline values base upon a number of assumptions which change locally or nationally according to the present situation. To fill the lack of knowledge of parental variants the HPLC method is commonly used also for the determination of references. Current treatment processes used at water surface plants are coagulation, sand filtration, and clarification.
The negative site of these methods is the ineffective removal and destruction of cyanotoxins. To combat this problem treatment systems like carbon- and membrane filtration were developed. External and internal accumulation of toxins is another research topic since the inhibition of Mustard seedling development by of microcystein-LR in aquatic root solution.
Dundee 2013 Solution to combat Algal blooms
Figure 9: interaction of PP1 and microcystin [ source: PDB ]
Due to the deleterious results from the toxin release of algal blooms many risk assesments were have been developed [ Schaeffer et al., 1999 ]. The effects of microcystin for the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem have been proven to include the modulation of proliferation, apoptosis and proliferation of spermatogenic cells in vivo [ Zhou et al.,2013 ], which makes it an attractive target for our project.
For the bioaccumulation of microcystin, it is possible to use the enzyme PP1. Mycrocystin can inhibit the function of PP1 by binding to it, this interaction of microcystin, in form of a heptapeptide structure, with three distinct regions of the PP1c is depicted in Figure 9. Hence PP1 can act as natural binding partner for mycrocystin.
As the Dundee iGEM team 2013 Team Dundee was already working on this subject we contacted them and they kindly provided us with the gene that encodes PP1. After converting the human PP1, to RFC 25 and constructing some expression plasmids we produced transgenic phytomitrella patens ( PF-14 ) with PP1 and a biobrick of PP1 receptor.

Moreover, the export of these chemicals is hard and time consuming or even impossible and the response time is limited by the rate of chemical addition and diffusion. On top of all, the effector chemicals may even be toxic or they might bind to unknown receptors leading to unwanted effects in the bacteria. (Schmidl et al., 2014)
Light signals, on the other hand, are non-toxic and we have full control over them: it is very easy to increase and decrease the light intensity. In many cases, light is orthogonal signal that does not affect to the indigenous cell mechanisms and pathways. Such is the case in for example E. coli. We are also able to target light very specifically to single colonies or even single cells allowing unprecedented accuracy. This allows very precise spatial and temporal control over the light signal. Lastly, the light signals can be emitted using LEDs which are widely available, durable and very inexpensive even in a large scale.
Light Regulated Gene Expression in Earlier Research
Optical control over molecular interactions has been harnessed in metabolic signaling, dimerization systems, light activated adrenergic receptors and neuronal ion channels (Tabor et al., 2011). Most importantly in terms of synthetic biology we can now regulate transcription with light. One of the foundational papers were written in 2005 by Levskaya et al.: Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Since then, many different light sensors and light regulators have been built. This toolbox enables more precise spatial and temporal control over the synthetic biological systems. Hence, light regulation has been part of many iGEM projects. Light sensors are arguably one of the most important elements in controlling gene expression in synthetic biology. In contrast to chemicals, we can have full control over light intensity.
The applications of the previous iGEM teams include communication, kill switches and metabolic engineering, among many others. Previous teams have been very active in making BioBricks out of new light sensors published in research. Uppsala 2011 team designed a multichromatic light sensor system which regulates three independent genes. In their project they used blue, green and red light sensors and linked them to different chromoproteins. This way, different light signals produce different colors in bacteria. They added many useful BioBricks to the registry which has made also our project more feasible.

6.- Issues outside the lab
Youth Biotech, the association we belong to, which was created after attending the UN Biodiversity Conference, focuses on three main areas: science communication, science regulation and science development. Thatâs why, the PHAagave project has also taken into account those areas for our human practices, but mainly science communication. Why? Because we believe that effective science communication is key for Synthetic Biology and the other emerging technologies in order for the fear of the unknown to not be able to close the door to science development. Most science misconceptions are based on hypothetical escalated risks regarding these technologies. It is our responsibility as scientists and future scientists to be able to explain how the technologies actually do work so the can be implemented in projects that solve big problems like climate change, famine, antibiotic resistance, cancer, among others.

Our experience at iGEM
The development of our project was not error free and, of course, it wasn't easy at all! We had initially thought on the diaper degradation problem. We started to work on it and made some research to optimize its degradation, but we soon realized it was more convenient to change our project due to biosafety concerns regarding mixing pathogenic bacteria strains, found in the used diapers, with our GM organism. We also found out that there already existed other efficient systems for diaper degradation that didn't cause much environmental struggles; for example, thereâs a fungi mixture that does the job in 60 days.
After having already picked the PHAgave idea, we tried different ways to degrade the bagasse, a lot of investigated ways were not viable in our conditions as well as we did not have a lot of materials.
Then our iGEM kit didn't arrive on time, it was stuck in customs for months!!! Because of this we failed to finalize the InterLab on time. Well, not only because of thisâ¦ the DH5 alpha E. coli strain we were provided with wasnÂ´t DH5 alpha in reality!! We found out too lateâ¦
Hereâs a video of the moment when we finally received our kit! We were so excited!

Finally, we investigated methods for validating nanoparticle formation. Namely, we considered fluorescence spectroscopy as tested by Parker et al. (2008), where 410nm output was indicative of iron incorporation as per assembled ferritins.
Apart from using magnetism to manipulate magnetoferritin to isolate pathogenic DNA, we developed a backup approach. Watt et al. (2012) constructed a nanoscale battery where ferritins with two different cores were oxidized and reduced on gold electrodes. We are contemplating using a split TALE capture system to bring ferritin into close association of an electrode. Current could then flow from ferritin into an electrode to indicate binding of pathogenic DNA. Finally, we considered how we might construct a magnetic device to isolate ferritin. Bushart et al. (2006) discussed method for isolating metal chelating magnetoferritin for metal purification. However, the necessary magnetic field strengths, mesh density, or mass of isolated compounds in these systems were not explicit. Thus, we are still uncertain about the feasibility of using magnetism to isolate proteins attached to magnetoferritin.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The application of ferritin in our project has changed substantially. Due to uncertainties of using magnetism to isolate proteins attached to ferritin, our team proposes instead to use it as a nanoscale protein scaffold. Our team was inspired by the work of REFERENCE et al. (2011) who used gold nanoparticles bound to ssDNA to detect DNA in a lateral flow strip assay.
We have decided to modify the aforementioned system. Weâll replace gold nanoparticle with ferritin and ssDNA with TALEs targeted to pathogenic E. coli markers. These nanoparticles will bind pathogen DNA via TALEs, be drawn up through a strip via capillary action, and become immobilized with complementary TALEs affixed to other regions on the strip. A reporter marker will also be fused to the recombinant ferritins to allow visualization of the pathogenic DNA.
This system is unique since double stranded sample DNA could be detected without having to first melt the DNA. Cheap prototypes for such a system could be constructed and would be suitable for cost constraints in the beef industry. Moreover, this system is amenable to scale-up for the identification of multiple pathogenic markers on a single lateral flow strip. We are, however, unsure as to what to use as a reporter enzyme.
We also met with two U of C professors in nanoscience to discuss the feasibility of our magnetism idea. Dr."
Toronto,2013,Team:Toronto#og_-_-_TEXT.html," silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative âadditiveâ modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
The spectacular success of the metabolic engineering field eminently shows the defect in this paradigm. Successful engineering of model organisms is based on using chemical kinetics and metabolic networks, where metabolite flux is directed by both gene up-regulation and deletion. (Insert examples here...)
Since deletions from a cell's genome is another means to engineering the cell as a system, we have also characterized the biofilm response of a set of knockout E. coli. Unfortunately, these systems cannot be submitted to the biobrick registry because they do not conform to the Biobrick paradigm, an issue we hope that the iGEM competition can address.

NCTU_Formosa,2010,Team:NCTU Formosa#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Ptet inhibition is released, resulting in cry protein production.                          The next consideration was how to effectively control our E. coli population. To address population control, we introduced the LuxI/R system from V. fischeri, specifically genes ccdB, luxR and luxI. SAM is one of the metabolic products of E. coli. LuxI is a synthase that converts S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) into a small molecule called an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and LuxR is a constitutively expressed protein that can bind AHL, which form a complex for activating Plux. ccdB are produced after Plux is activated and when in combination cause E. coli self-destruction.  When the concentration of AHL and luxR rises, the Plux has a higher activation rate, resulting in ccdB production and subsequent suicide.  This population control mechanism is not activted during E. coli incubation, because luxR and luxI are also initiated by Ptet. ptet is inhibited by the temperature sensitive RBS and tetR, and during incubation is off by default.                            In our initial experiment, we use GFP and mRFP to substitute for cry and ccdB respectively. This makes it our design easy to test and observe.

Series (n = 5) of working solutions for each standard were prepared (0.0625 - 125 Î¼g/ml)by appropriate dilution of the stock solution with methanol. To determine the recovery of the studied indolic compounds from bacterial broth during sample preparation, standards were spiked into sterile LB broth  at five different concentrations. Bacterial broth was processed with the sample preparation procedure described below.
1. The bacteria were cultivated for 72 h in LB broth with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5 and 5.0 mM Trp supplementation
2. Bacterial cultures were then centrifuged, and the bacterial culture supernatants were processed
3. Sample preparation consisted of a single centrifugal filtration step using 3-kDa cut-off membrane centrifugal filters.
4. 0.5 mL of bacterial culture supernatants or spiked sterile bacterial broths were transferred to the sample chamber of a 0.5 mL centrifugal filter tube and centrifuged at 14,0009*g at  4 C for 30 min.
5. The filtrates were directly analyzed by HPLC.

Modeling Overview
In light of our guiding principles ( specificity , regulation and biocontainment ),  we modeled four different aspects of BeeT. The modeling work can inform and aid the improvement  of wet-lab experiments. Another facet is to assess the optimal application strategy for BeeT in real  world applications. We asked ourselves; what parts of our system can benefit the most from an interplay  between modeling and experimental work? These considerations led us to ask the following questions:
How can we assure optimal toxin production using quorum sensing and subpopulations ?
What are important parameters for the optogenetic killswitch to function optimally?

Numbers below the sequences indicate cysteine pairs forming disulfide bridges. Boxes below the sequences indicate residues overviewed in 3WMT template: catalytic triad - red, substrate-binding residues - magenta, calcium-coordinating residues - cyan.
Selecting the mutations
Our esterase and our chosen template alignment was refined manually after each homology model generation using MODELLER toolkit. The final structural model of CAT-Seq Esterase was visualised with ICM Browser (Fig. 3).
Figure 3. Homology model of CAT-Seq Esterase.
a) Superposition of the generated homology model (light blue) and the template used (light yellow, PDB ID: 6G21).
b) View of the catalytic triad in the model. Residue coloring: catalytic triad - red, mutation positions - orange, calcium-coordinating residues - cyan. Catalytic residues as well as the mutations are numbered in boxes. Hydrogen bonds in the catalytic triad represented as black dashed lines.
The residues chosen for mutation were scattered around the catalytic triad of the esterase and involved mainly polar and aromatic side chains. In literature, these side chains are assumed to form bonds stabilizing the binding of the substrate.
When selecting the mutations, we have aimed for the polar and aromatic residues in the binding pocket, and mutated them into other synonymous residues to avoid total inactivation of the enzyme, yet ensuring a change in catalytic activity.
These are the following mutations we have chosen:
N107D; G194A; W224Y; K227R; K230R; Y368F; E430D; M431L; R509K; ÎP348-H356
Experimental validation of the CAT-Seq Esterase Mutants
After carefully selecting the mutations in-silico, we have synthesized and measured the Activity of those esterase mutants in the laboratory. The mutations have successfully altered the activity of the original Esterase. Also, there were no cases of complete inactivation of enzyme catalytic activity.

Conclusions
Here we have described a rational in-silico homology modelling procedure. Our goal was to determine the specific mutations of an Esterase enzyme, which would slightly"

Catalog for regulatory RNAs
Over the years, the number of regulatory RNAs in Part Registry has steadily increased over time and many has been made available to end users. Based on different mode actions and natures of regulatory RNAs, they can be grouped into different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing regulatory RNAs. Some of them are grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them.Over the years, the number of non-coding RNAs in Part Registry has increased steadily over time and many have been made available to end users. More than 400 entries in the Part Registry are related to RNA devices (updated 25-12-2014). Based on different mode of actions and natures of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), they can be grouped under different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing ncRNAs. Some of them are simply grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them. For example, BBa_K145013, which is a part for antisense LuxI, could be used to add an extra layer of control to the widely utilized quorum sensing Lux pathway but it has not been extensively reused. It is likely that Part Registry users are unaware of its existence because there has yet to be an information hub for ncRNA.
We would like to solve this problem by designing a list of category tags as well as a guideline, so that automated display of non-coding RNAs by the
function can be facilitated. By doing so, we hope that"

With the lab-in-a-box and lab equipment found in typical high school classrooms, transformations, overnight cultures, and minipreps can be conducted, with further possible modifications to increase its functionality.
We aimed for this project to be used primarily in high schools, where there may be limited resources. In addition, it presents an interdisciplinary learning opportunity, since the physics, engineering, and biological aspects of the box can be taught and explored. When parts inevitably break of malfunction, the students can learn how to troubleshoot and repair the appropriate machinery. It is also modular and expandable, with ideas for further expanding the ability of the box given, so that high school students can add components that they need instead of purchasing extra equipment.
The included guide to assembly includes detailed explanations of the principles behind the box, how it is achieved, a full parts list, and assembly instructions including pictures of almost every step. It also includes ideas for expansion and a usage guide. We've used feedback from our outreach efforts in order to make the guide more clear for high school audiences.

There are four main components of the box: the motor and speed controller unit, the Peltier plate assembly, the 3D printed rotors, and the Arduino microcontroller.
Motor and speed controller
The motor (Golden Power A2212-10 1400KV Brushless Motor) is a DC brushless motor that provides the shaking, centrifugation, and vortexing functions. It runs on DC 7.4 - 11.1 V, and provides 1400 RPM/V (rotations per minute per volt). The maximum speed depends on the voltage provided to the motor. This motor was chosen for its high maximum speed and pre-soldered bullet connectors, which allows easy connection to the speed controller. It draws a maximum of 16 amps and 180"

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", several processes appear to be regulated via the PP2A and the PP2A-related protein phosphatases. These phosphatases consist of heteromeric protein complexes. The PP2A holoenzyme contains one of the two redundant catalytic subunits (PP2Ac), Pph21, Pph22, a scaffolding subunit, Tpd3, and one of the two regulatory subunits, Cdc55 or Rts1. The PP2A-related phosphatase is mainly found as a complex between the catalytic subunit, Sit4, and one of the four regulatory subunits, Sap4, Sap155, Sap185 and Sap190. TORC1 controls the activity of these phosphatases via Tap42. When Tap42 is phosphorylated by TORC1, it will compete for binding the catalytic subunits of the phosphatases leading to the exclusion of other subunits of the phosphatase holoenzymes. Thereby, TORC1 stimulates the formation of a Tap42-associated phosphatase complex that further includes either one of the regulatory proteins Rrd1 or Rrd2, both of which are known to confer phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity to the catalytic phosphatase subunits in vitro. Tap42 as well as Rrd1 and Rrd2 may redirect the substrate specificity of the catalytic phosphatase subunits, and as such, it is not surprising that the proteins have been attributed both inhibitory as well as activating roles, dependent on the substrate being studied. In actively growing cells, the Tap42-associated phosphatase complexes reside mainly at membranes where they associate with TORC1. Rapamycin treatment or nutrient starvation abrogates the TORC1 association and releases the Tap42-associated phosphatase complex into the cytosol. Once cytoplasmic, this complex then slowly dissociates, presumably concomitant with the dephosphorylation of Tap42. Several studies revealed an important role for yet another player in TORC1-dependent regulation of PP2Ac and Sit4, i.e. Tip41. This protein was initially identified as an inhibitor that could specifically interact with dephosphorylated Tap42. However, more recent data suggest that both Tip41 and Tap42 cooperate in determining the substrate specificity of PP2Ac and Sit4, and that both proteins may fulfill essentially a similar function in TORC1 signaling.
The complicated network has been characterized in the above image, which is also the foundation where we build our modeling section. FAP takes the place of Rapamycin (Rapam"

FUTURE APPLICATIONS
I. Light-directed bacterial cells sorter
II. Improvement on the HR desalination system
III. Incorporation with BBa_K786031 as a new biosafety approach
Â 
I. Light-directed bacterial cells sorter
When the phototactic systems are integrated with heavy metals collection devices [1, 2] , such as SmtA and MntH for collecting cadmium ions, fMT and Glpf for collecting arsenic ions, and BBa_K346005, a mercury(II) ions absorption device, our sensory rhodopsin systems could become a useful tool for heavy metal sorting in present in sewage.
When different ion-absorption systems are integrated with our Sensory Rhodopsin systems, different kinds of ions can be directed to different position for heavy metals sorting and separation in sewage, which could be a new tool for heavy metal recycling.
Â 
Metal ions collection aided by light-directed cell sorting in an environmental friendly way
Other than integrating with heavy metal absorption device, our sensory rhodopsin system can also be incorporated with our gene expression system and our genome targeting system in order to sort out and collect heavy metal ions while minimizing potential environmental hazards due to release of genetically engineered organisms.
First of all, the cells absorbing two different ions can be sorted out by blue light alone with positive phototactic device (BBa_K786002) and negative phototactic device (BBa_K786001).
An orange light source can then trigger the genome targeting system (BBa_K786031) together with the gene expression device for sensory rhodopsin (BBa_K786010).
The cells will eventually destroy their own genetically engineered DNA, and leading to cell death and releasing the heavy metal ions. Furthermore, this step"

Results of Re-Transformtation of Inducible Promoters + GFP
Few to no colonies grew onthe transformed plates, which leads me to think that the Gibson Assembly failed because only PRM2 worked and was Gibson'ed prior to the other transformed promoters.
PRM2 grew many tiny colonies.

Possible Explanations for Failure:

Backbone concentrations were not high enough, which would make sense because PRM2 had a new backbone which had a higher concentration than the rest of the promoters.

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - Â£16000 for stage 1 and Â£17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be Â£8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be Â£19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.

The correct insert was confirmed through sequencing.
BioBricks
Dockerin Biobricks
The dockerins ACEL (Acetivibrio cellulolyticus), BCEL (Bacteroides cellulosolvens), CCEL (Clostridium cellulolyticum) and CTHE (Clostridium thermocellum) were amplified from pBAD_ACEL, pBAD_BCEL, pBAD_CCEL and pBAD_CTHE with primers to add the desired EcoRI and PstI restriction sites by PCR. Primers contained restriction sites for EcoRI and PstI in order to make them compatible for     insertion into the iGEM shipping vector pSB1C3.
After purification, the PCR products were restricted with EcoRI and PstI, as well as pSB1C3. Afterwards the restricted dockerins were     ligated into pSB1C3 by T4 ligation (sticky end ligation) and transformed into E. coli TOP10.
Ligation into pSB1C3 was followed according to the protocol in the methods collection. After over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted     with the QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and test restricted with EcoRI (pSB1C3_CCEL and pSB1C3_ACEL) and EcoRI and PstI     (pSB1C3_BCEL) (Fig.1). We lost CTHE due to failing transformations at this point.
Once restriction controls showed the correct bands, pSB1C3_CCEL, pSB1C3_ACEL and pSB1C3_BCEL were sent for sequencing.

Colour BioBricks
We also wanted to improve already existing BioBricks by fusing our dockerins to the colours eforRed ( BBa_K592012 ) and amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ) that were     submitted from the University of Uppsala (Sweden) in 2011.
So we chose to fuse eforRed to BCEL and amilCP to CCEL. Since the plasmids of the two colour proteins were not distributed with the current plate of the     iGEM Distribution Kit, we ordered those parts including the right restriction sites as gBlocks from ID"

Environment
An Investigation into the Potential Risks and Limitations of Genetic Kill Switches
In our project, we have designed a programmable genetic system that allows the gene expressed in E. coli to change after every generation. Further applying the system, we can potentially create a genetic system that can kill the host cell after a desired number of divisions. In order to better design our genetic kill switch as well as to be aware of the potential problems of our kill switch applied in the environment, in this section of the human practices, we have investigated and evaluated the potential risk and limitations of genetic kill switches.  The detailed design of the kill switch application is described in the applications page.
The principal problem on the release of genetically modified organism (GMO) is associated with the preservation of biodiversity as is mentioned in Cartagena Protocol. This time we designed a programmable genetical system which works on E. coli and can kill the host cell after any times of division. Our project introduces the possibility to consistently solute the problem; utilizing the advantage of genetical modulation with few damage on environment. To put this idea into practice, we must discuss about possible risks on handling E. coli with our kill switch system in natural environment.
There are several lethal gene known to kill E. coli by internal expression. Kill switch utilizes such lethal genes for killing the host cell on desired condition. If E. coli naively express lethal gene without control, it wouldnât be a useful tool. With our kill switch system, it is possible to ensure sufficient time before expressing lethal gene. For example, we can actuate kill switch after 105 generations by inserting 3-, 5- ,and 7-generational loop system (as 105 is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7). Beneficially, E. coli with such kill systems dies endogenously without any chemical or other external stimuli.
Letâs consider the effect to the environment when we release the genetic engineered bacteria who have built-in kill switch which will be triggered after 105 generations, to decontaminate the environment.
If we release the bacteria to the polluted soil, they would rapidly degrade the pollutant using their efficient enzymes acquired from genetic engineering. Every cell division means the step to their death. By the moment when the kill switch is triggered after 105 generations, they could neutralize enormous amount of pollutant. After that, the kill switch, which have never been expressed, will be expressed and lead the owners to death. In this way, we can make them work for a certain period and"

* Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history.
Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ss"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," our aim of creating bacterial ""living therapeutics"" - strains of bacteria genetically engineered to secrete functional antibiofilm and antimicrobial proteins towards the treatment of UTIs.
Future
To develop our project beyond a proof-of-concept design, we would adopt a more suitable chassis, such as Lactococcus lactis. L. lactis has been widely used as a expression host for the production of proteins in both the medical and food industries. Being a Gram-positive species of bacteria, it is less likely to be killed by the same mechanisms as major Gram-negative pathogens such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa (e.g. Art-175's peptidoglycan lysis ability is specific for Gram-negative bacteria). On top of that, being Gram-positive means that it will not pose the problems of endotoxicity brought about by the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Using E. coli as our host was purely a starting point, in view of its ease-of-use as well as availability of pre-existing resources.
In addition to secreting antibiofilm/antimicrobial proteins, a comprehensive treatment for UTIs would be a bacteria engineered to also sense and move towards biofilms. We conducted extensive literature review on this in the early stages of the project but, due to the time restraints of a summer project, could not put our ideas into practice. With further work, we would incorporate both a sensing and chemotaxis mechanism into our design.
Nurses, doctors and professors all raised to us the issue of targeting the multiple bacterial and fungal species that are involved in UTIs, highlighting the fact that the problem extends further than E. coli and P. aeruginosa. We have explored how we would approach this in the Practices page.
Beyond the scientific issues of implementation, thinking seriously about the questions of ethics and public acceptance is also crucial for the further development of synbio-based medical therapies especially in view of the fact that it is currently illegal to even bring genetically-modified organisms outside of the laboratory environment. We have explored this theme also in the Practices page.

Human Practice
Â Â Â Â  The art of science should not only be limited to the scientists who are learned. We believe that everyone has the right to have a taste of the magic of science. As everyone likes playing games, we decided to integrate playing with education, thus making science more fun and less formidable. To make our game better, we had a visit to one of the biggest game company in China and received many constructive views from experts. We want the public to know more about science and love science, especially children. In order to achieve this, we held an exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum where lots of children who are interested in science visit every day. Lastly, as we want many of our peers to know more about synthetic biology and even have an interest in being an iGEMer, we held a mini-jamboree in our school. Take a look at what we have done!

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,") from the iGEM parts registry and even the original Fixk2 promoter from pDawn and pDusk system 5 does not have a detailed structural analysis. So we decided to construct five different FixK2 hybrid promoters ( BBa_K1913022 , BBa_K1913023, BBa_K1913024 , BBa_K1913025 , BBa_K1913026 ) based on the sequence of the wild type FixK2 promoter of Bradyrhizobium japonicum 6 . Nellen-Anthamatten et al. made a definite sequence structure analysis of this Fixk2, showing the presence of two FixJ boxes between the -40 and -70 region and a -10 to -35 core element (Figure 11a). According to this sequence structure, we added two additional LacI operators, both upstream and downstream the Fixk2 sequence (Fig 2, b), which could be bonded by tetrameric Lac repressor resulting in the formation of a DNA loop and consequently on transcription repression 7 . We also designed a ptet-Fixk2 hybrid promoter by inserting two TetR operators into the core element region so that Tet repressors could form a dimmer and bond to these operators, resulting in transcription repression 8 .However, according to some previous iGEM projects ( UNITN-Trento 2013 , INSA-Toulouse 2013 ), the transcription activity of the wild type Fixk2 promoter is so weak that they all added an inverter part to control their target gene expression. Even the original pDusk system in darkness has only 5 times expression levels than in light conditions. Therefore, we decided to enhance the transcriptional activity of the Fixk2 promoter by changing the core element region of the wild type Fixk2 by adding a strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23106 ) from iGEM part registry and by adding two typical FixJ boxes 9 10 . into the -40 to -70 region (Figure 11ab) In addition, we designed an additional plac-Fixk2 as a backup (Figure 11d) via changing core element into -10 to -35 region of ompC promoter from another two component system 11 , because we couldnât guarantee that FixJ boxes could be compatible with the core element of a constitutive promoter.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," bases at any sequence position would need to be trained with signals of every possible kâmer that is a combination of natural and unnatural bases. As the number of possible kâmers given n possibilities is nk, 6752 new k-mers would have to be analyzed, which is beyond our means. Nevertheless, since unnatural base pairs are mostly used at well-known locations, e.g. to expand the genetic code in inÂ vitro or inÂ vivo experiments, it is sufficient to analyze only certain kâmers that are of interest. The comparison to kâmers containing all natural bases provides a foundation for a software that differentiates between unnatural and natural base pairs at a given position of interest (POI). This is the approach for our software tool.
Overview
The software package iCG is a collection of three python scripts for the analysis of Oxford Nanopore sequencing data of DNA containing unnatural base pairs. The first script, iCGÂ filter, is used to filter basecalled Nanopore data by certain criteria like read length and quality. Its fundamental function is to select sequencing reads that contain the position of interest, where the unnatural base pair is subjected to be, irrespective of its presence. The second scipt, iCGÂ model, creates a statistical model for the detection of unnatural base pairs in sequencing reads based on linear discriminant analysis of ONT data previously filtered by iCGÂ filter. The third script, iCGÂ predict, uses a model created by iCGÂ model to predict which base pair is present at the position of interest for a set of filtered sequencing reads.
Fig. 1: Overview of the iCG functionality.
Dependencies & Installation
Our software works with basecalled Nanopore data. For Nanopore sequencing, we used the ONT software MinKNOW version 1.7.14.1 in combination with FLO-MIN106 R9.4 flowcells on a MinION sequencer. Other combinations of hardware and consumables, such as 1D2 flowcells, were not tested in combination with this software package and will probably require for small adjustments. Basecalling has to be performed with the ONT basecaller Albacore.
The iCG software package has some dependencies that need to be installed before it can be used. First of all, HDF5 needs to be installed. HFD, standing for Hierarchical Data Format, is a format for storing and retrieving large data sets from/to files and is the format in which Nanopore data is stored.

Optogenetics
- already done a bit by Washington university's 2012 team
Idea #1
I proposed that we used optogenetics to control movement/behavior of vertebrate models such as Xenopus, however I think this approach would be particularly difficult and the consensus on this is that its a hard system to implement in practice. In particular, i feel that it doesn't have any far reaching impacts in terms of trying to then move forward (in respect to synthetic biology and contribution of parts etc) and has already extensively been tried and tested on say, mice. I think the start-up kits are around Â£2000 also. If anyone wants to expand on this and find out more, feel free to add anything below what I've written. - Waq.
In addition, after researching what the washington team did - i noted that their main problem was in the control of expression levels, which would be expected in such a system due to the fine level of control in respect to light that is required.
Reviews on this system, Karl Deisseroth is the pioneer of this system for behavioral manipulation by using light.

Bacteria Painting
Nothing can be more impressive than take a visit to bio-lab and do something yourself. Thus we invite students in junior grades from Tsinghua University to visit our lab and to draw whatever they like using a kind of engineering e-coli that can produce violacein. By these way, most students set up their first impression of bio-lab and engineering bacteria.

ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Project#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html,"-expressing two genes from Synechocystis for chromophore biosynthesis together withcyanobacterial chromophore 1(Cph1) from the same organism [15],[35] . Heme oxygenase converts host heme to biliverdin IXK which is then reduced to phycocyanobilin via phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The Cph1 apophytochrome is able to autoassemble with the phycocyanobilin in vivo to form the fully photoreversible holophytochrome.
Nevertheless, we decided to use the exogenous way by adding exogenous PCB and to focus on our main objective to prove the functionality of our system. Beside that it has been shown that the endogenous way to produce the holoenzyme leads to the production of toxic side-products.
Protein Tagging
Construction choice
Â 
The addition of the tag could lead to some problems as compromised folding or increased activity of the target protein.  Most bacterial proteins tolerate C-terminal fusions and the C-termini of most proteins are solvent accessible. Chances are, that no major problems occur when we add our tag.
For the C-terminal degradation tags, the target protein construct will be PIF-linker-Protein-Tag. To avoid problems with the accessibility of the tag we decided to test a further contruction with a N-terminally fused degradation tag (Tag-Protein-linker-PIF).
We need then to choose an appropriate tag. It was also a critical step.
The LAA Tag
The ssrA tag is a natural well-characterized recognition for ClpXP-degradation sequence in E. Coli. It is composed of the 11 amino acid sequence AANDENYALAA, localized at the C-terminal of the target protein. At least five ClpX-recognizing motifs have been determined: three located at the N-terminus and two at the C-terminus [34] . Here we are concentrating on those located at the C-terminus where ClpX recognizes the last three residues (Leu9, Ala10 and Ala11).
ClpX alone is able to interact with the ssrA-tagged substrates and delivers them to ClpP protease. However, it has been shown that the adaptor protein, SspB, markedly enhances the recognition of the ssrA tag. So, in our case the PIF-fused target should also favor the recognition of the ssrA tag.
Baker et al. have shown that proteins with C-terminal"

We performed Gel Electrophoresis on this set of DNA.
The amplification of pMJSAF displayed strong bands at       500 bp for the primers : DVL0_BF with DVL0_CR and DVL0_DF with DVL0_ER.       However for the Â Â DVL0_AF with DVL0_BR showed a much weaker       band, and the DVL0_CF with DVL0_DR did not show at all. We gel extracted       MF3,4 and SJ4. Using the gel extraction protocol. We then quantified the       amount of DNA we had using NanoDrop DNA quantification protocol andset up       a restriction digest (SpeI, BSA, Buffer 4)for MF3,4 and SJ4. following the       Restriction digest protocol
We did PCR clean up of MF3,4 and SJ4 and We quantified       the product of MF3,4 and SJ4 PCR clean up using NanoDrop
For the amplification that didnÃ¬t work, we Â performed gradient PCR Â of SJ3 and MF3 in order to set the best       parameters for the amplification (62-69 with interval of 1 degree C). We       later found out, that our step 1 was set at 62C instead of 95C, which       could have affected denaturation of the DNA template; although the SJ5-12       was amplified while the MF5-12 did not. We are unsure to the cause. The       results were inconclusive compared to the Gel made previously.We ran       another PCR to verify results.
We were given new primers to make stock and  working solutions from. In the process we realized that we used DVL1_ER instead  of DVL0_ER in SJ4, thus all SJ4 products were discarded and data obsolete. We  remade the DVL1_ER stock solution by adding additional EB buffer till the right  concentration has been reached. We then proceeded to make stock and working  solutions for: DVL0_ER, DVL1_AF, DVL1_ER, DVL1_FF, DVL1_FR, DVL1_GF, DVL1_GR  and Â "

With the Gibson primers that contain Plac, colonies 1 and 3 have a brighter band. Either they are the only positive ones, or they just have a bigger amount of DNA (as also seen on the other gel). For pSB3K1, both PCRs failed. Since it's very unlikely that we have a plasmid that lost TetR, there must have been a problem in the PCR; it will be repeated.
Nadine also digested the (supposed) J61002 Plac-RFP plasmids from Tuesday's Gibson assembly: colony 6 from Gibson plate that was red, colony 9 from Gibson plate that was white and colony 12 from negative control plate that was also red. Pst1 has a restriction site in the original J61002 backbone, therefore it should cut independently of RFP insertion. The results indicate that only colony 9 was digested by the enzyme, therefore it's likely that the red colonies contain an unknown plasmid that has RFP... Since colony 9 was positive for RFP colony PCR, it can be our expected plasmid that has little expression of RFP.
Saturday, 27 August 2011
Nadine did a second colony PCR on the pSB3K1 TetR-LacI colonies. This time, the LacI PCR worked for all samples (fragment should be about 750 bps), but the TetR PCR failed again (although these primers already worked in the past). One colony will be sent for sequencing on Monday.
Vincent first made Nanodrop measurements of his Gibson assmebly DNA (post PCR purification from Friday night). The concentrations were abysmally low, which made it likely that the transformations would be unsuccessful. Nevertheless,  the Gibson Assemblies of the K1-T7-RFP variants (1-18) and the three K1-T7-Lysis variants (14, 16, 17) were transformed into DH5 alpha cells and plated.
Sunday, 28 August 2011
What a surprise on Sunday afternoon to find that all the transformations -- both RFP and Lysis -- had made dozens of colonies each! With all these beautiful colonies just begging for a Colony PCR, Vincent could not resist and did a colony PCR as well as liquid cultures (and a large plate) for all 21 plates.
In an attempt to finish off the remaining stubborn T7-Lysis variants, Vincent used the gene-specific T4-Lysis product from Friday to start an Extension Touchdown"
