Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,". We conceived aether and thought it out like a real ecosystem. Indeed, we imagined the life cycle of our product from its conception up to the recycling of the filters.
Project stages
We have been working since January on the development of an innovative material capable of decontaminating the air by capturing fine toxic particles. This material is a natural polymer, produced using synthetic biology. We selected the biopolymer according to multiple criteria: the elasticity, the resistance, the asepsis and finally the affinity with water. Indeed, the water will play a dual role: it will capture the pollutants and allow the enzymes on its surface, to degrade the trapped particles. The micro droplets that create a moist environment, will condense on our biopolymer. On one end of this biopolymer are fixed the enzymes, that will degrade the pollutants. On the other end anchoring proteins are fixed, to fasten our filter on many different surfaces. Our aim was to functionalize this polymer by linking it to enzymes that target a category of pollutants. We chose a degradation pathway that targets polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as a proof of concept. Once the enzymes were purified, we characterized their activity.
Outside the laboratory, we already designed a model of our device and we are now working on the prototype. Our objective is to present a functional prototype with satisfactory performance by the end of December 2018. We also prepared a model of the smartphone application associated with the aether device. We plan to have finished the development of the app' around the same time. Indeed, our goal is to launch a big-scale beta testing by late 2019.
Our project stages are summed up in the following Gantt chart.

Overview
While some team members focused on global outreach, other members focused on connecting with our local community. We want to inform and inspire upcoming generations, so we reached out to local schools and asked if they would let us present to their students. We have contacted a total of 15 schools (four middle schools, nine high schools, and two vocational/private/alternative schools) in a 75-mile radius. So far, six of these 15 schools have shown interest in us presenting to one or more of their classes.
San Lorenzo Valley High School (SLVHS)
While we have many school presentations planned, SLVHS was the only school who planned for our presentation to be before the Giant Jamboree. We spoke with two SLVHS biology teachers, Aria Bauman and Stephanie Beck, who were interested in us presenting to their freshman biology classes. We created a presentation similar to our Bioethics class presentation, but with less technical information since the level of knowledge with high school freshmen isn't as deep. We scheduled a total seven presentations at SLVHS, some of which took place during the same class periods; to accommodate, we created three presentation groups each with three iGEM members: one that discussed what iGEM is, one that discussed the scientific research of our project, and one that discussed our work with human practices. We worked closely with the two biology teachers to assure our presentation wouldn't intimidate or confuse any of the students and we went through several rounds of revisions to make it perfect. All seven classes were extremely receptive to our presentations and some even felt encouraged to devise their own SLVHS iGEM team.
UCSC 9th Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium
We engaged the scientific community on campus by presenting at the UCSC 9th Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. We created a poster that details the science and outreach aspects of our project. Three iGEM members presented the poster to various audiences and Our audience asked questions about distribution methods and our timeline, and people were excited to hear"

This is my second time participating in an iGEM competition, and this is my fourth semester as a member of GenetiX. Both GenetiX and iGEM have given me an opportunity of improving my research and analysis skills, and showed me a new version of the world in which I can actually learn how and why things happen. As a part of GenetiX, being able to help the team with projects and ideas has been an amazing experience.

In the second stage of the project, recombinant IF protein is aimed to be secreted into the extracellular matrix of E. coli cells. With the help of 3A assembly strategy, gif gene transferred into a new vector system which contains a T7 promoter, strong RBS, and transcription terminator. ImmunoBlot will be used in order to examine efficiency of secretion.
Result
In order to examination of secretion of GIF protein with OmpA signal, a composite part which contains T7 promoter, RBS (B0034), GIF gene with OmpA signal sequence(OmpA-GIF) and double terminator (B0015) has been planned to ligate. First step, GIF-OmpA and doubled terminator (OmpA-GIF + B0015)  were ligated (Figure 1). Second step, OmpA-GIF + B0015 planned ligated into B0034 part. Therefore, B0034 was cut with S and P; also, OmpA-GIF + B0015 was cut with X and P. Unexpected 300 bp DNA fragment was observed in B0034 double cut. Bands that observed in lane loaded with DNA from OmpA-GIF + B0015 double cut were expected (Figure 1).

Module 2
Introduction
Purification of a protein is required prior to investigation of its structure and action mechanism. However, it is not an easy task to separate single protein from other  10,000 different proteins (approximately) in the cell. To overcome this, there are different methods and strategies were developed.(1)
Usage of recombinant fusion proteins is a widely used strategy for purification of proteins. In this strategy, a tag with a known size is used as the tag for the protein of interest and allows its efficient purification and detection by affinity chromatography. Two commonly used tags are glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag and 6 x Histidine residues (His)6 tag. (2)
GST tag is a protein that is composed of 211 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 26 kDa. DNA sequence that encodes GST is transferred into an expression vector in order to produce recombinant fusion proteins. GST tagged fusion proteins involve a GST protein attached to their N-terminus. GST tag provides higher expression rates"

all residues not in any of the above 4 groups are kept static.
2. Cycles of sequence design and minimazation within constrains To optimize the structure we applied an iterative optimization algorithm. This algorithm mutates all residues from the backbone, which are not part         of the catalytic center, to alanine, and a small energy function refraction will place the ligand in an optimal position to the backbone. SHOW TECHNICAL DETAILS
For this approach, bb_min and chi_min allow for backbone flexibility and the rotation of the torsions. An alternative for this minimization step is the         Monte Carlo rigid body ligand sampling. For further information on this method, we refer to the ROSETTA documentation .
Design step inputs
The following input files are relevant for the design procedure:
“.pdb”-file generated in the matching step
“.cst”-file for the ligand
“.params”-file for the ligand and the scaffold
“.flags” to coordinate the inputs
For further information on these files, please refer to step 2 above.

CBT-asparagine in purple, scaffold in green, created in pymol
Design step outputs
The output for the design step is a “.pdb”-file containing the mutated scaffold and a “.score”-file.           For every .pdb-file, a line in the score-file is generated, so it is easy to evaluate the given structure.           The first score in the file is the total score of the model. After that, the number of hydrogen bonds            in the protein as a whole and in the constraints is listed, followed by the number of dismissed solutions in the            catalytic residues as well in the whole protein and in the constraints.

Overview
Atoms Turkiye view human practice as an avenue to serve mankind. The new sublime rule, Novel Approach enforced us to deeply question what it is that be should done to form a connection between our project and humanity on the long run. Besides accomplishing the classical outreach methods as a form of human practice, we have developed a triple thriller called SynPhilo, SynArt and SynSafe. Our aim is to open a new window for our generation which will enable them to look at creation and synthetic biology through unique perspectives such as philosophy and art.
Novel Approaches
SynPhilo: A bridge connecting philosophy to Synthetic Biology
SynArt: A different perspective to Synthetic Biology.
SynSafe: A unique route to enhancing Safety.
Game: A chance to live the journeys of a cancer and a normal cell.
High School: First Runner up: AUC Turkey. An invaluable result.
Outreach: Tha classical with the worthy.
SynPhilo
'Learn to look, look to recognize, recognize the similarity.'
SynPhilo: Synthetic Philosophy is a new approach to evaluate scientific research. As young scientists, we abundantly have evolved to think that research is only alive in the zone of laboratory; once we take off our lab coats and leave, the research remains there. Though when cancer is taken into consideration, there is an undeniable truth that nearly most of us individuals have encountered a close relative"

The maximal specific BPA degradation rate of this BioBrick is higher than the observed specific BPA degradation rates in the other cultivations. But due to the dependence of the BPA degradation from the BPA concentration the BPA degradation with this BioBrick is not as efficient and not complete. Anyway, the fact that this BioBrick is working is impressive.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#modelorganism_-_-_TEXT.html," already existing chassis as everything is already designed to be functional. Hence we believe that this term might be misguiding.
The chassis is an ideal of something like the minimal cell with the minimal genome designed to sustain living properties. By forcing the idea, one might include E. coli, B. subtilis or some other very well-known bacteria, though some may doubt that this the metaphor is totally relevant. But it seems quite inappropriate for more complex forms of life which development and organization are so far from our understanding. For this epistemological reason (and others we will develop latter) we prefer keeping the term model organism against the chassis idea. In our sense it provides a better idea to our work and don’t deny the complexity of life properties. A model organism is an organism we are trying to know, it is a being that helps us increasing our knowledge about nature and about us [13]. The term chassis creates some epistemological and ethical confusion, what is the tool, synthetic biology’s products or the beings modified by synthetic biology?
We discovered with great interest on the eve of the wiki freeze the philosophical work of Pablo Rodrigo Grassi and the FreiGEM 2012 team. They did a quite interesting and accurate epistemological analysis of the concept of “living machine” as a core concept of synthetic biology. We deliver here the personal conclusion of P.R. Grassi:
“While I am indeed sympathetic to the practical work of synthetic biologists, I need to object to its underlying epistemology. One can still heal diseases, produce biofuel, build biosensors and so forth, without using analogical expressions like ‘living machines’, saying that we only understand life when we construct it and arbitrarily determine what belongs to life and what does not. The notion of life as a machine is not self-evident and it would be negligent to persist in it without further revision.”[14]
We believe that the chassis metaphor is quite concerned by this conclusion. We invite the reader interested in an analytical approach of the “living machine” metaphor from the points of view of philosophies of language, of biology and of technology to have a closer look to FreiGEM report .
In last resort, one could say that chassis is a specific term of synthetic biology, a reference for the community principally used like a brand or a slogan. Nothing to make fuss about, and scientist are well aware of what is a tool, what is an organism and so on. However, when this is put in regard with reflections of the non-innocence of metaphors , we may prefer keeping the old terms such as model organism,"

The circuit 2.0 was timely got, the new one carried the Lac I promotor instead of T7 one. We were excited hearing the news. And now the circle will begin again. We will induce the expression of the dsz genes under the Plac promoter, 1 mM IPTG was added to the medium. Cultures were incubated 12h at 16 °C.
Thursday 22nd September
The team uniform arrived!! We will be smart and cool putting the uniform on.
Sunday 25th September
  After the second fermentation and induction, we analyzed the data and were not satisfied yet. The liquid chromatography came out, it seems not so good. There is not much time here, would we finish the whole program in time as we wish?

CeBiTec-Kolloquium
On September 9th we invited Dr. Falk Harnisch to our institution for giving him an impression of how our work goes ahead. All in all he was very satisfied with our ideas after we presented him our state of research. Furthermore we engagingly discussed our MFC-design and how we could optimize it. He observed that our carbon electrodes were well chosen and that potassium ferrocyanide (III) in the cathode chamber is a suitable redox system. We discussed that on both sides of the MFC the pH has to be 7. For example 50mM phosphate buffer can be used to avoid liquid diffusion and potential gradients through the membrane. We  debatted that glycerin is a more suitable carbon source than glucose and that it is also a great advantage to use as it is a waste material of biodiesel production. In further discussions, it was possible to develop a protocol for the next experiments. With this we were able to measure how well E. coli can metabolize the different carbon sources, like glycerin, acetate, lactate or glucose, under anaerobic conditions. After applying this screening method without using mediators we will screen these carbon sources of choice with added soluble and insoluble electron acceptors like fumerate in order to analyze the growth rate of E. coli with supplemented mediators.
A low growth rate with an insoluble electron acceptor indicates a not usable mediator, whereas high growth rate shows good extracellular electron transfer by the mediator. Dr. Falk Harnisch gave the hint to test these different screenings primarily outside of the MFC. After finding a good combination of carbon source and mediator the optimal system could be transferred to the MFC.
Impacts on our project
The exchange with Dr. Falk Harnisch had a big impact on our project. Together we discussed different problems about the genetical aspects, for example that the orientation of the mtrCAB cluster in the membrane could be problematic or that the nanowires are too complicated to work with in the short time we have. Especially, since the structural proteins have not yet been clearly analyzed which genes are responsible for the pilus and his conductivity. In addition he answered our questions about the MFC design, which aspects were important for measuring or cultivation. All in all he always was available and willing to answer our questions.

Algorithm
In this section, the step by step functioning of our application,     along with the encapsulation of the algorithmic concepts of ‘standardization’     of functional iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts.     Rectangular boxes represent the encapsulation of implementations of     the computer programs to perform the particular tasks stated in that     box on the flowcharts. These boxes are sometimes called subprograms,     objects or packages in Object Oriented software Engineering context.     The diamonds represent decision branching and they are found between     two rectangular boxes. The arrows show the direction in which subprograms     work and communicate. The subprogram at the head of the arrow starts     executing after the termination of the subprogram at the tail of the     arrow. Following flowcharts are the high level representations of our     algorithms developed for the BioGuide software.

Diagram 1. Flowchart of collection, formatting and storage     of devices data algorithm
Information about the iGEM parts had to be collected in a standardized     format for our application to function properly. Following data collection     custom subprograms is needed to parse and forward the data the application’s     database. In order to achieve this we have designed and implemented     the algorithm shown in diagram 1. In this algorithm, the first stage     was to find the list of part IDs of devices which were supplied by iGEM     in Spring 2010 distribution. This information has been collected from     two sources 1) plate files in excel format which was available online     2) device data provided in xml format, both provided by iGEM. The last     step in the algorithm was to send the collected partID data to the application’s     database.

Diagram 2. Flowchart for BioGuide execution before and during     user interaction
Diagram 2 presents the main algorithm, which shows how BioGuide application     works. In BioGuide the major components are device and Biobrick graphs.     While the device graph represents input-output (promoter-regulator)     compatibility combination of iGEM devices, the Biobrick graph represents     combinations of atomic parts assembled in a device or system. The flowchart     shows how these graphs are created and embedded into the program, which     displays both of the graphs to the user when launched. Application presents     few interactive options to the user when started, which were shown on     the flowchart under the horizontal, bolded line. As shown on the diagram     2"

Nithin's Notes
Ran a PCR Amplification and PCR cleanup of our PCquad 3.0 Prime. Conditions were all the same as previous PCR reactions run by Phillip.
Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today affinity purification will be done on the cell lysates.
Procedures:
Below is a complete protocol for lysis and purification, though only purification was done today.
Cell lysis and Ni-NTA Affinity Purification
Introduction:  The following procedure is for lysing bacterial cells with triton lysis buffer.  For optimal activity, it is suggested that reagents be made right before lysis.  This protocol is also designed for Ni-NTA affinity purification, as the lysis buffer resembles the equilibration buffer.
Triton lysis buffer:  10mL was made.  Only 1mL was used, so the rest was stored at -20C.
50mM phosphate buffer (pH 8)
300mM NaCl
10mM imidazole (pH 7.4) (Optional for downstream Ni-NTA affinity purification)
1% triton x-100
Note:  The above can be made and stored either in 4C or at room temperature for about a month (store in the dark if containing imidazole).
Right before cell lysis, add the following:
100ug/mL of lysozyme
One Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet per 10mL
1uL/mL of 2500U/mL DNase (adjust the solution appears viscous during the lysis).
Note:  It is optimal to use the lysis buffer fresh, however this complete lysis buffer may be usable up to a month if stored in -20C with minimal thawing cycles.
-Lysis protocol:
1.  Obtain the frozen cell pellet, keep on ice.  0.09g of cell pellet was lysed in 1mL of lysis buffer.

Thursday (06/22/17)
Sense/Respond: The day began with another PCR. Today, the students were ready to completely do the PCR by themselves with little guidance from the mentors. The standard protocol was followed and the PCR and ran another cycle in the thermocycler. Meanwhile, another gel was prepared by the students. This time around, the students were very efficient and the process went by very quickly. The gel ended up giving too many bands, but the mentors conversed and decided to proceed with the PCR purification anyways. After the lab work was done, the students decided to meet with the other lab students to discuss current progress. The students created discussion points and had a great discussion with the other lab.
Packaging: The morning began with the RXers beginning cellulose cultures. Later the team started colonies of the TOP 10 E. coli cells in culture tubes with LB broth with Kanamycin, as well as LB agar plates with Kanamycin. Growing colonies would allow the plasmids to replicate inside the cells. The entire team met at UES in the afternoon.
Friday (06/23/17)
Sense/Respond: The day began bright and early with two PCR digests. This time a PCR Vector Digest was conducted on the same from yesterday and a PCR GFP digest was done on the sample from Wednesday (6/21/17). After following the protocol, the students were able to successfully perform the digests. After a 2 hour wait (per the protocol), the young scientists performed a purification on the GFP digest. The goal was to cut off end bits of the base pairs to allow the plasmid connect again. During the students' lunch break, another meeting was held with teacher leaders who wanted to know information about progress and future proceedings.

High Schools
ZJU-China attaches much interest in communication with other teams. It’s very necessary to know more about others and to help each other is the very tradition of Zhejiang University. This year, we helped H4Z to get started in iGEM, helped HZAU with modeling and provided BNU with two important gene circuits.
To help H4Z, we held some seminar in Zhejiang ST, in which we talked a lot about how to run an iGEM team and what should be paid attention to in an iGEM project. Also, we did our experiment in the same lab so we got even more time to help them. In the modeling part, our dry lab helped them write their wiki in a technical way.
The picture of teaching high school teams to do experiment.
BNU
To help BNU, We constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP (click here too see more information from BNU's wiki)  , the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to att"

The combination of sgRNA binding sites will be based on the rule that a pair of sgRNA should be distributed in EML4 or ALK area separately or one of them located on the connecting area of the EML4-ALK fusion gene.
Figure 9. The three sgRNA binding sites of fusion gene EML4-ALK Variant B. We designed three sgRNA binding sites in target gene – sgRNA70, sgRNA126 and sgRNA147. The number of them indicates the location of their first base pair in target gene. The combination of sgRNA binding sites will be based on the rule that a pair of sgRNA should be distributed in EML4 or ALK area separately or one of them located on the connecting area of the EML4-ALK fusion gene.
We intended to translate sgRNA in vitro. In order to achieve it, a cassette of T7-promotor-sgRNA-T7 terminator is indispensable. We planed to insert it into psb1c3 plasmid and submit them to IGEM registry as our new Biobricks.
Figure 10. The plasmid of sgRNA generator. The sgRNA generator Biobrick is composed of a T7 promotor, coding sequence for sgRNA and a T7 terminator.
We planned to use Polymerase Cycling Assembly(PCA) to construct those sequences.                 The construction scheme was acquired from DNAWorks, which is a website for “Automatic oligonucleotide design for PCR-based gene synthesis.”[6]                 .
Figure 11. The schematic illustration of Polymerase cycling assembly(PCA). [7]
Since those sgRNA cassette only have a 20bp difference, we speculated that experiments can be simplified by finding “overlapping” solutions given by DNAWorks. We tried to find as many same oligo DNA in the solution of seven sgRNA as possible. We wrote a program to do it and reduced the ordered oligo DNA from 42 to 24 in the end.
Figure 12. The cartoon explanation of saving ordered oligo DNA. The rectangle of each color represents a particular oligo DNA. By finding shared oligo DNA in over 200 solutions provided by DNAworks, we can save the ordered Oligo DNA.

Figure 1: Chemical structure of BPA, BPF and BPS showing the different chemical groups linking the two phenols.
BPF and BPS are used in a broad range of applications that involve the use of polycarbonates or epoxy resins and thus can often be found were BPA is also present. Accordingly their presence is a potential disruptive factor that could lead to a false positive signal with our biosensor. This is especially true for BPS that in some cases is used as a substitute for BPA in baby bottles [1] . Studies concerning the environmental pollution with BPF ( Fromme et al. (2002) ) and the acute toxicity, mutagenicity and estrogenicity of BPF and BPS ( Chen et al. (2001) and Kitamura et al. (2005) ) indicate their potential harmfulness but further research is needed to fully assess their impact on human health.

Samples were taken at the end of the cultivation. Two biological replicates were analyzed.  While BPA is fully degraded, only a small fraction of BPF (~7%) and BPS (~3%) was degraded.

Mathematical Formulation
The activities of a gene are regulated by other genes through the interactions between them, i.e., the transcription and translation factors. Here, we assume that this system follows Hill kinetic law.
<math>\begin{align} \frac{dm_{i}}{dt} &=-a_{i}m_{i}+\sum\limits_{j}b_{ij}\frac{p_{j}^{H_{ij}}}{K_{ij}+p_{j}^{H_{ij}}}+l_{i}, \\ \frac{dp_{i}}{dt} &=-c_{i}p_{i}+d_{i}m_{i},  (i=1,2,...,n) \end{align}\,\!</math>
where <math>m_{i}(t), p_{i}(t)\in {\mathbb{R}}</math> are concentrations of mRNA and protein of the <math>i</math>th node at time <math>t</math>, respectively, <math>a_{i}</math> and <math>c_{i}</math> are the degradation rates of the mRNA and protein, <math>d_{i}</math> is the translation rate. Term (1) describes the transcription process and term (2) describes the translation process. Negative and positive signs of <math>b_{ij}</math> indicates the mutual interaction relationship that could be attributed to negative or positive feedback.

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#JoannaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," improve Clotho.  We ended the day by setting up CVS with Netbeans so we could download the current source code for Clotho.
Tuesday morning, we had a long team meeting where Doug introduced us to editing this wiki, gave us a Clotho tutorial, and briefly discussed the Ptolemy coding standards which we will be using.  Doug also assigned each of us a Clotho help file or two to be in charge of and edit by the end of the week.  Mine was the Features Library.  I spent the afternoon playing with Clotho, finding bugs in Clotho, and improving the help file.
Wednesday Doug gave us a tutorial on the Clotho Data Model.  Later, I had my meeting with Doug to talk about my project area for the summer.  I will be working on Visualization with Richard.  We also decided my short term project would be to make a plugin with drag and drop functionality for icons (more on these shortly).  Afterward, I spent a little more time playing with Clotho and looking for bugs.
Project description: Visualization
3 Areas we could work on:
Design
Several levels of abstraction, from DNA sequence to icons of features (which ideally can be dragged and dropped in the window) to parts and even systems(??)

Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Project#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," attached to dCas9, His-tag has minimal impact on the complementation of N-luc and C-luc.
Construction and optimization of PC reporter system
Considering that dCas9 is a huge protein and is structurally complex, we need to figure out the configuration of PC reporter system. We first fused split luciferase to either N or C terminus of dCas9 (Figure 5a) to see its influence. Then, provided that initial binding of dCas9 depends on the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, a short 3’ motif adjacent to target sequence) [11], four sets of sgRNA orientation settings were also tested (Figure 5b). One set placed two PAM sequences distal from the spacer sequence between the sgRNA pair, with the 5' end of the sgRNA adjacent to the spacer (PAM-out) while another set put both PAM sequences adjacent to the spacer (PAM-in). PAM-direct 1 and PAM-direct 2 combine both sgRNA orientations with one PAM sequence adjacent to and another distal from the spacer (Figure 5b).
In total, 16 pairs of split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes were constructed and tested (Figure 5c). Most of these pairs worked very well.  Among them we selected N-luc-dCas9/C-luc-dCas9, the most robust protein construct with minimal intergroup difference, and PAM-out, the sgRNA orientation exhibiting the strongest luminescence, for the following study.
Figure 5. Construction and optimization of PC reporter system. (a) 4 different split luciferase-dCas9 fusion strategies.  (b) 4 different sgRNA orientation settings. In orientation PAM-out, the pair of PAM sequences are distal from the spacer sequence, with the 5' end of the sgRNA adjacent to the spacer; in orientation PAM-in, the pair of PAM sequences are adjacent to the spacer sequence, with the 3' end of the sgRNA in proximity to the spacer; in orientation PAM-direct 1 and PAM-direct 2, one PAM sequence is adjacent to and another distal from the spacer. (c) The experimental results of PC reporter systems using 16 different (4 different constructs X 4 different sgRNA orientation settings) configurations.
As the reconstitution of enzymatic activity was constrained by the distance between N-luc and C-luc [11], we varied the spacer length from 5 bp to 107 bp (Figure 6) to find how"

Results of Transformation
Redo of the transformation using Tuesday's protocol seemed to work, presence of large growth of individual colonies formed on the plates.  1:1 dilutions showed expansive lawn growth of colonies, whereas the 1:10 dilution showed growth of fewer, but larger colonies.  1:!0 dilutions showed little to no colony formation, suggesting higher transformation effect in the 1:10 range.  Images of plates will be posted via Benchling.
For each of the devices, 4 colonies were picked from the three ligation 1:1 plates.  Each colony was circled and labeled, as showing the plate group below.
To screen for proper insert size and presence, colony PCR was conducted using RedTaq master mix and VF2/VR primers.  The following protocol was used.
First, each colony was picked and suspended in 50 uL of sterile LB using a sterile tip.  The suspension was left at RT during the day to later be used to inoculate overnight cultures of sequencing and stocking.

Before discussing the competitions compiled by each of the three groups, we asked everyone: What do you, as artists and designers, bring to synthetic biology? A huge debate exploded!
What are the differences and similarities between artists and scientists, their points of view, aims, boundaries, logic, constraints? What about design?
Experimentation, subjectivity, tangibility, play, process, aesthetics? What about sensitivity and empathy?
It's a new medium, but we don't know the limitations. Like paint, we need to mess around to learn! We've been learning the science, but we still need to break through the barrier. Scientists though tend to be constrained by what exists.
Art as critique on society and self.
Context - do designers have a broader approach than scientists who need deep knowledge?
Art and science both exploring questions? Both can explore things the unconventional way.
Is the end product or the process our priority? In science, is the end product the priority?
Bad science, bad art...
Plagiarism - is recombinent DNA plagiarising? How does open source fit in - remix culture.
Is the difference similar to a chef making molecular gastronomy and a scientist engineering food?
We compiled the discussion into the ideal art/design iGEM competition.  Ready for the launch tomorrow... Could scientists enter iGEA to subvert it?

Site-directed mutagenesis
Day 1
To prepare the expression of a photocaged protease and to prove our principle, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis. Four different strategies were pursued:
SDM
amino acid
DNA

DNA
1.
serine  >  tyrosine
AGC  >  TAC
2.
serine  >  DMNB-serine
TAC  >  TAG
3.
tyrosine  >  tryptophan
TAT  >  TAG
4.
tyrosine  >  ONB-tyrosine
TAT  >  TGG
Figure 1: Overview of different SDM strategies.
As a proof of principle we exchanged serine in the active site against tyrosine and tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against tryptophan. In preparation for the expression of a photocaged enzyme we exchanged the codons for the targeted amino acids against the UAG amber stop codon.
To achieve this, we simultaneously performed the site-directed mutagenesis three times (SDM 1, 3 and 4) with fitting primers and our expression system after the exchange of promoters as a template. SDM 2 had to be performed separately and with SDM 1 as a template at a later time.
For SDM 1, 3 and 4 we executed the following PCR:

1. Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.(See more in the HP/Gold .)
Integrated human practices were well-tailored for the development of our project. We created a series of study to further discover the quality and practicality of our project. In the investigative study, we met up with people from different backgrounds including agricultural academics, farmers, proprietors, and potential users. Therefore, we can integrate the opinions and advices into the project.
For implementing our project in the real farmland, we started up entrepreneurship to commercialize our system. We participated various business plan contests to bring our project to the society.
2.Improve a previous part or project
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We improved 2010 iGEM part (Gly4Ser)3 Flexible Peptide Linker BBa_K416001 (GS linker).
In the experiment, we proved the efficiency of our improved GS linker by observing the repellent effect of Hv1a-lectin with GS linker. (See more in the BBa_K1974030 .)
3. Proof of concept
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
We proved the repellent effect of PANTIDE in the experiment. The tobacco cutworms are more likely to eat leaves without PANTIDE. As the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, the area of each leaf that larvae consumed gradually increased. This again proved the repellent effect of PANTIDE. (See more in the Results .)
4.Demonstrate your work
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate"
UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Medal Requirements_-_-_TEXT.html," part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
The biobrick BBa_K2068001, which is our PC Quad Mutant 1 part, has been validated and highly characterized. This part codes for a designed protein cage from the Yeates Lab at UCLA with inserted thrombin cleavage sites; it is designed such that in the presence of the enzyme thrombin protease, the protein cage will disassemble into its subunits. We were able to validate this via our thrombin cleavage assay and analysis via SDS-PAGE. For details on the biobrick itself, please visit its page on the registry here and for details on our methods of validation, please visit the results section of the Protein Cages project here
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
The UCLA iGEM Team has been involved in a number of collaborations which are detailed here. In summary, we hosted the Second Annual South California iGEM in July, in which several team in the SoCal area visited UCLA and engaged in discussions about our projects, received advice and feedback on our work, and discussed the state of iGEM and our respective teams. We provided advice and mentorship to the Brazilian iGEM team on the current silk project, using our expertise and experience gained from our 2015 project. Additionally, we provided significant help to the UCSC iGEM Team with their Human Practices project by providing an extensive interview that they will present as a part of their project.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
The UCLA iGEM Team is committed to being an advocate for the universal advancement and acceptance of synthetic biology, and we believe that progress through the field can only be achieved by informing and teaching the youth of our society. Our 2016 Human Practices project centers around education of Los Angeles youth to show them the potential of synthetic biology, and furthermore think of the implications and ethics behind scientific progress and research"

SKLBC-China,2015,Team:SKLBC-China#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM website. We picked several important attributions such as functions, types, status, etc. and assembled them in one search page, allowing users to fill up whatever search box with pieces of information that they consider necessary. Therefore, we can not only search bio-bricks by their names,but also search them according to certain descriptions. Furthermore, users can choose the binding type of prefix and receive bio-brick information with genetic sequences including prefixes and suffixes. Through redesigned algorithm which fits our engine most, our search engine can respond more quickly and be used more conveniently than those previous searching tools. After attaining the bio-bricks they need, if users consider some bio-bricks important, they can mark them down and review them later for other purposes.
Features:
1)Multiple search choice and cross-match In addition to the common free search mode, we considered the demand of users, and developed various humanized functions. For instance, the function column in the searching page serves to find bio-bricks by keywords in their function and helps an iGEMer match the functions he needs with the bio-bricks that are yet unknown to him but can possibly actualize his goals. This will definitely motivate the researchers’ inspirations when their minds sparkle and need to find bio-bricks immediately, conveniently and accurately.
2)Auto addition of prefix and suffix
Considering the feedback from wet teams that they find it troublesome to use the original genetic sequences without prefix and suffix during analog piecing experiments with great need of bio-bricks’ sequences, our search engine has the ability to add prefix and suffix according to users’ demands and display them with different color from the usual sequences. With a choice box including various binding types, users can simply choose the type they need and let the program judges the gene order of corresponding bio-bricks. Finally, users can view the genetic sequences with colored prefixes and suffixes and copy these sequences in one click. This seemingly tiny feature actually helps cut down useless efforts in experiments.
3)Mark down the bio-bricks you need
“Favorite” is a common feature that we can usually find in the social platforms. They’re implanted into the WEiGEM 2.0 now, making it more convenient for users to look up the former searching data and avoid searching repeatedly. One can mark down the bio-bricks he/she find them likely to be useful in the future and review them later for experiment design.
4)Bio-bricks information sharing by QR code
QR code is another wonderful and significant tool to the optimization of our search engine. First off, each bio-brick has its unique QR code, and one can"

New Strategy / finO and finP
We are truly disappointed that we still couldn't make our finO and finP biobricks. We found a lot of issues that must be solved in order to achieve this objective, and we are totally running out of time =(
We decided that we are going to leave finO and finP aside for a while, and we will focus on constructing our modified version of Paris 2007 Team's biobricks.
We made a whole schedule for that, and we hope we would complete it in a week tops. The next step would be it's insertion into genomic DNA by homologous recombination.

Recovering More Biobricks
We started our ""new strategy"" (related to modifying Paris 2007 team's biobricks) by recovering some biobricks that had now became useful for our project. We ressuspended biobricks BBa_E0840 (GFP device), BBa_I718017 (lox71), BBa_J61000 (chloramphenicol resistance cassette) and BBa_I718016 (lox66), and then transfomed them into electrocompetent E. coli cells, strain DH10B, according to Protocol 3 .
The transformed cells were plated in LB-AMP media, and were grown for an O/N period.

Ten Teams. Three Days. One City.
In other words: The German Wide Meetup. This years German Wide Meetup took place in Dresden from June 30th to July 2nd. Nine teams followed the invitation by the iGEM Team Dresden.
The weekend started with some getting-to-know games in the “Großer Garten”. During this time, first exchanges about projects and experiences happened between the teams.
On Saturday, the Meetup continued with student talks, in which every team gave a short presentation about their projects. On top of that, even Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher and Marcel Thiel from Promega, gave  little input talks. The day finished of with a Sight-seeing tour through Dresden and a Tortilla-Party afterwards.
A last get-together occurred on Sunday morning. Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun gave a talk about BIOMOD, a biomolecular design competition. Further down the line two workshops took place: “iGEM goes green” and speed-dates “Collaboration”. After a last group photo, the teams departed.
The event was a great opportunity to get to know the other German teams, to exchange ideas, experiences and to talk about collaborations. Thanks to the iGEM Team Dresden for organising and hosting this amazing event.

Discussions
Antisense RNAs can reduce basal expression level
The efficiency of basal level reduction for antisense RNA type I and II are compared prior to AHL induction ([AHL]=0M)               and after the induction ([AHL] = 1.00E-05 M) Unpaired t-test analysis suggests that the differences between               w/PFB and PFB+ asRNA2 and the difference between w/PFB and PFB+asRNA2 could be considered as highly statistically               significant.
Antisense RNA type II reduces basal level more significantly
To visualize the difference between antisense type I and type II better, Fig. 2 and 4 were illustrated. Using               unpaired t-test calculation, it suggests that there are significant differences between antisense RNA type               I and type II both before and after induction with 1.00E-05 M AHL, where Fig. 2 and 4. imply that construct               with antisense RNA type II can reduce basal expression level more significantly. This may be due to higher               GC content of its complementary sites (55% for asRNA type II comparing to 47.4% for asRNA type I) according               to our first hypothesis.
Positive Feedback Loop works after AHL induction
There are also notable statistical differences when comparing the changes before and after induction using two-tailed               paired t-test analysis for both PFB+asRNA1 (p <0.001) and PFB+asRNA2 (p<0.01). The average of fluorescence/OD600 for PFB+asRNA2 is 4,199.18 while the average after its                 induction is 6,121.58, showing an increase for around 2,000 GFP/OD600 (45.8% growth) after 3 hours. Whereas,                 PFB+asRNA1 also experiences an increase by 4,765 GFP/OD600 (65.7% growth) under the same controlled time (Fig. 5),                 suggesting that antisense RNA regulates translation"

Measurement
It wouldn’t matter if our hardware was cheap, portable and easy to build if it didn’t actually work. We characterized it with LUDOX and fluorescein to ensure it wasn’t just making up the readings.
We used the interpreter to record the data from device. These readings were then exported and analysed to plot the graphs.
Optical density
Optical density measurements were taken using different concentrations of LUDOX. We made up a dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time. We used 6 dilutions. We used the same cuvette (washed with distilled water between readings) to avoid random error introduced by the differences between our cuvettes. We characterized our densitometer using Lee Filters’ - Fire (019) and Medium yellow (010) - and without a filter.
The readings for optical density are consistent with little variation between readings, except for LUDOX concentrations above 12.5µM. Above 12.5µM the readings began to decrease. We are unsure as to why this would happen, but this is clearly not caused by random error as it happened with all the filters.
Fluorescence
For the fluorometer function of our device, we used fluorescein to take measurements. We made up the same dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time but with fluorescein instead of LUDOX. We characterized our fluorometer using LEE Filters’ Twickenham Green (736) and without a filter.
The results are consistent and demonstrate the linearity of our fluorometer. The pipetting error in the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and"

On the other hand, we presented microorganisms to parents and children and explained how useful and powerful they could be as GMOs. In the end, we explained our project and showed them Chlamydomonas reinhdartii which is the microorganism we are using, through the microsope. Around hundreds of children and adults came to our stand where they enjoyed our explanations and activities and showed interest in our project “SugaRevolution”.
Public survey
In order to learn more about people’s vision and expectations regarding sustainable development and our project as well as GMOs in general, we created a public survey. The main axes of this survey were:
1) Definition of sustainability in general and environmental sustainability
2) Importance given to environmental issues and people trying to solve them
3) Perception of our project and the issues it wants to tackle
4) Opinion/Knowledge about GMOs
5) Questions/reluctances about our project or GMOs
Our survey was created on dragnsurvey.com, each of our team members shared it on their social media accounts and we also asked for the participation of numerous iGEM teams around the world. In total we obtained 291 responses among which 64,9 % from women, 33,3% from men and 1.7% from people identifying as other. We noted that most of the participants to this survey are involved in the field of biology, as you can see from the diagram below. This might be related to the nature if the “crowd” we shared our survey with.

Aim:
Transformation of plasmids P40 and P42 into E.coli XL1 blue to get plasmids of higher quality. P40&P42 are directly extracted from the expression strain BL21(DE). The quality of the plasmids might not be sufficient for Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore transformation into E.coli XL1 blue and subsequent plasmid preparation to get plasmids with sufficient quality for SDM.
Procedure:
100 μl of competent XL1 blue cells were thawed on ice. 1 µl plasmid DNA (P40 or P42) was added. Incubation for 30 min on ice. 5 min heatshock at 37°C. 1 ml of LB medium without antibiotic was added, incubation for 45 min at 180 rpm/37°C. After incubation, 100 µl of the cell suspension were plated on antibiotic containing plates (P40: Kan, P42: Amp). The remaining solution was centrifuged for 60 sec, resuspended in 100 µl LB and plated, as well. Incubation at 37 °C over night.

Nanjing-China,2018,Team:Nanjing-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"mitting efforts, with capacity for  indigenous innovation constantly increasing. By 2017, China has become the largest  producer and consumer of nitrogenous fertilizer, greatly contributing to the  development of fertilizer industry and agriculture around the world.
With  the implementation of China's ""five-in-one"" policy, a large number of  contaminating factories have been shut down. We noted that Yantai Wuzhou Feng  Fertilizer Plant is located in the water conservation area of  Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Province, and its traditional method of producing nitrogenous  fertilizer consumes massive energy, meanwhile, causing large quantities of  pollution, which severely affects water and soil resource in the environment.
Integrated Human Practices
Xiaohe Bei Village
We  visited farmers in Xiaohe Bei Village, Ju County, Rizhao City, Shandong  Province, so that we could communicate with the users, direct stakeholders, of nitrogenous  fertilizer.
During the  conversation with them, we were informed that the nitrogenous fertilizer sold  on the market is of high cost, and the quality of it couldn’t be guaranteed.  Farmers are in urgent need of fertilizer products with guaranteed quality and  affordable prices.
Based on our previous work (Nanjing-China 2016) on  photosynthetic hydrogen production, we wondered whether we could utilize solar  energy to fix nitrogen, which is an environmentally-friendly and economical  method for production.
Yantai Wuzhou Feng Fertilizer Plant
With  the idea of photosynthetic nitrogen fixation, we contacted Yantai Wuzhou  Feng Fertilizer Plant.
During  the course of the exchange, the manager of Yantai Wuzhou Fertilizer Plant, Mr  Li, told us the technical bottlenecks encountered so far. The main production  of nitrogenous fertilizer, urea, was still following traditional methods, with  liquid ammonia and carbon dioxide as raw materials and then urea directly  synthesized under conditions of high temperature and pressure.
After fully understanding the current production and demand of nitrogenous fertilizer, we introduced our project to them, and proposed applying synthetic biology to realize photosynthetic nitrogen fixation, which would not only cut down cost but also effectively reduce environmental pollution. They expressed great interest in the application of synthetic biology for nitrogen fixation and the use of solar energy, a clean energy source for production.
Yet,  they raised some problems that might arise in the production process as well,  such as the contamination of cadmium sulfide, semiconductor materials attached  to the surface of Escherichia coli"

The molecular weight of potassium acetate = 98.15
The desired volume of this solution = 0.2 litres
The desired molarity = 5M
Put this into the equation:
Molecular Weight x Desired Volume (Litres) x Molarity = Weight (grams)
98.15       x        0.2l      x   5M    = 98.15 grams
We then made up the solution and added it to the other ingredients, according to the protocol.
Growing the transformed cultures
Jess obtaining E.coli from a single colony of transformed cells
With the solutions prepared and sent to the autoclaver, we had the task of taking each of the 10 colonies of transformed cells and placing them into 10 tubes containing LB. We labelled the tubes 1-10 and added the colonies to the tubes as follows:
Tube 1 = BioBrick 2 - colony 1
Tube 2 = BioBrick 2 - colony 2
Tube 3 = BioBrick 3 - colony 1
Tube 4 = BioBrick 3 - colony 2
Tube 5 = BioBrick 3 - colony 3
Tube 6 = BioBrick 3 - colony 4
Tube 7 = BioBrick 3 - colony 5
Tube 8 = BioBrick 3 - colony 6
Tube 9 = BioBrick 3 - colony 7
Tube 10 = BioBrick 3 - colony 8
BioBrick 2 = BBa_I13522 in the pSB1AK3 plasmid
BioBrick 3 = BBa_J04450 in the pSB1AT3 plasmid

8. Use the Elution Buffer to elute the bound GST protein.
MagneGST Protein Purification
Preparation of Cells:
Bacterial cultures can be grown in tubes or flasks. Grow the culture containing the appropriate GST-fusion protein (GST-spycatcher) to an O.D.600 between 0.4 and 0.6, then induce protein expression. For IPTG induction, add IPTG till final concentration of 0.4mM-1mM and incubate at 37℃ for 3 h or at 16℃ overnight. Depending upon the expression system, other methods of induction and growth conditions can be used. Induction conditions often require optimization. For 1ml bacterial cultures, pellet cells by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 3 min and carefully remove the supernatant. For culture volumes larger than 1 ml, pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min. Carefully remove the supernatant. The cell pellet can be frozen at –20℃ or–70℃ for long-term storage, or the cells can be lysed immediately.
Cell Lysis:
1. Prepare cell pellets from bacterial culture. Remove all growth medium. Recommended: Freeze the cell pellets at –20℃ (15–20 min is usually sufficient) or on dry ice for 5–10 min. Freezing cell pellets will increase efficiency of cell lysis of certain strains, such as the BL21 series of strains, or when cultures are grown to a high density. For cultures of O.D.600 >2, more lysis buffer will be required.
2.Resuspend the pellet in MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent at room temperature (20–25℃) by pipetting or gentle mixing. (for 500 ml of bacteria culture, use 10 ml of MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent)
3.Incubate the cell suspension at room temperature for 20–30 min on a rotating platform or shaker and then sonicate for 1 min.
Particle Equilibration:
1. Thoroughly resuspend the MagneGST particles by inverting the bottle to obtain a uniform suspension.
2. Pipet 100 μl of MagneGST particles into a 1.5 ml tube.
3. Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," 2% were actually tested positive (Duke Global Health, 2012) . A study from Afghanistan showed that 413 of 414 patients tested negative for malaria, yet 412 of 414 were treated for it regardless (Nader, Chandler, Whitty, & Rowland, 2012)
Week 7: June 16th - 20th
On the 16th the human practices team met with Dr. Lisa Allen who has a biomedical background and a PhD in Public and Global Health.  She has had direct international experience with misdiagnosis of malaria, working in a rural hospital in Tanzania since 2008. After discussing potential priorities of their impact with the hospital and the community, it was determined that malaria was perceived as the biggest issue. The medical officer in charge thought malaria diagnosis was ineffective, so the main task of their presence was to improve the situation. 95% of patients were diagnosed with malaria based on microscopy; however pregnant women and children under 5 malaria had a default diagnosis of malaria for a fever.  In the region in which Dr. Allen worked, actual malaria cases were declining due to high altitude and the temperature drop to 4∘ Celsius during the night.  Despite this decline the diagnosed cases of malaria were showing no decrease, despite the low potential for infection.  Citizens of this area would automatically assume that that fever is malaria, culturally using this inclusive term to describe any similar illness, similar to how our society using the term “flu” to describe what is potentially different health issues.  Dr. Allen emphasized that awareness and education of other neglected infectious diseases was imperative, as this mindset of clinicians was part of the problem.  Missing a case of malaria is considered “unforgivable” therefore overdiagnosis is present.  Clinicians are aware of the algorithms for diagnosis of other diseases, but usually do not have lab capacity for bacterial infections. Having “safer than sorry” mindset, patients often receive both antimalarial drugs and antibiotics in the hopes it will treat malaria, and whatever other diseases exist if it happens not be malaria.  Overdiagnosis and treatment  with both antimalarial drugs and antibiotics result in a great economic impact on institutions and patients, shortage of antimalarial drugs, and increasing drug resistance. Patients pay for their prescription drugs, and if the diagnosis is not accurate and treatment is unsuccessful, patients waste their personal resources. Dr. Allen also looked into rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) what clinicians think of them. Many seems to criticize them because RDT can’t quantify infections which might be important in determining the most effective type of"

Contrary to such facts, only half of the interviewees agree that cancer can be avoided with certain measures.  What’s more, the majority consider cancer as some kind of senile disease and therefore no special attention is currently needed for the prevention of cancer.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Seq is to connect catalytic biomolecule’s phenotype to genotype in ultra-high throughput manner.
During the theoretical design phase it became apparent that recording such information in mutant’s own DNA sequence from which it was synthesized would be the smartest choice. That is because DNA already contains half of the information we want to save - the sequence that codes the biomolecule. As we want to associate the sequence information with the information of catalytic activity, there did not seem to be a better object than the DNA.
But how can we write such information into the DNA? Substrate Nucleotides!
While navigating the vast sea of scientific literature we have stumbled upon a fact that some polymerases do not incorporate nucleotides into DNA sequence if they are modified. We have then come up with an idea to attach the enzyme substrate to the nucleotides and term this compound “Substrate nucleotide”.
Such modified nucleotides then act as a target for various catalytic biomolecules - they would first need to recognise it, bind to it and then chemically convert it, resulting in the removal of the substrate. We call this chemically converted nucleotide a “Product Nucleotide”.
The removal of the different substrates can be achieved by different types of catalytic biomolecules that catalyse a vast range of different chemical reactions. For example, all of the six major classes of enzymes can be used. To explore the prospects of recording the activities of different types of catalytic biomolecules, please head to the Substrate Design Prospects page!
The catalytic molecule acting on the substrate nucleotide is the main principle behind CAT-Seq. A substrate nucleotide cannot be incorporated by DNA polymerase. In contrast - Product Nucleotide can be incorporated.
Yet, such concept alone is not enough to record catalytic activities of the biomolecules. What else is needed? Let’s dive right in.
CAT-Seq design
Every part of the CAT-Seq design page is divided in two main sections:
Design description - an in depth explanation of how a particular part of our system works, how it should be used in real-life situation and why such design choices were adopted.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"] .
After further research, however, we discovered multiple issues with this assembly technique: our team members and mentors have no prior experience with GGA, the process takes up to six hours, and we would need to insert unique type II restriction sites between our gene blocks, which adds another step to our project [19] . For these reasons, we ruled out GGA as our cloning method and returned to GA. GA requires that DNA fragments have homologous ends (either naturally or artificially) for assembly to occur. These ends are called Gibson overhangs (GOs). To create homology where it does not occur naturally, we will use primers with GO flags on either end that match the overhangs and homology regions on corresponding fragments. GA shortens the construction process because it does not require the use of restriction sites, can be performed in under an hour, and seamlessly integrates fragments.
Dr. William Belden informed us of his extensive experience with another assembly method: yeast-mediated cloning (YMC). At the beginning of our research, we considered this to be an innovative cloning technique, but we abandoned it due to our lack of experience. Dr. Belden explained that YMC works similarly to GA, but the process occurs naturally within yeast. Similar to GA, YMC requires homologous overlaps between fragments. Because GA and YMC involve similar designs, we reasoned that we could perform both experiments simultaneously without sacrificing much time or effort. Running both experiments in parallel will allow us to experiment with YMC while keeping GA as a contingency plan. We consulted Dr. Kamakaka on our parallel experiment idea, and he offered his support by providing protocols for YMC.
YEAST TRANSFORMATION
We want to integrate our gene cassette into the Y. lipolytica genome so that our construct will be passed on to offspring with each round of replication [20] . We investigated a paper on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to insert pathway genes into Y. lipolytica [21] and considered using this system to incorporate our progesterone precursor genes into the yeast genome. In this paper, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate a set of two genes into the Y. lipolytica genome, but they used a gene cassette much smaller than ours will be [21] . Schwartz et al. (2017) identified five loci within the Y. lipolytica genome with a high rate of integration via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination [22] . They found that gene disruption in these regions did not affect"

Mite Shower
In a regular beehive, most Varroa mites will be inside the closed brood cells. This makes it difficult to gather them for laboratory assays. Therefore, Tjeerd Blacquìere and Delphine Panziera (Wageningen UR, in personal communication) taught us how to manage a mite shower 1 . This method of managing beehives makes sure that more mites are present on the honeybees and can be collected. Figure 1 provides an overview of a mite shower.
Figure 1. A schematic overview of a mite shower. The numbers indicate different steps required to manage the mite shower. A queen excluder is a type of roster used to keep the queen restricted to the top half of the beehives. A more detailed explanation of this figure is in the paragraph below.
For a mite shower, two colonies are necessary: the companion colony and the mite shower colony. The companion colony produces brood infested with mites, while the mites can be gathered from the honeybees of the mite shower colony.
During step 1, young and open brood from the top of the companion colony is moved to the bottom half of the colony. This brood is infested with Varroa mites. The queen excluder is used to keep the queen in the top half of the hive; extra care needs to be taken to ensure she is not moved downwards together with the young brood. This is done to prevent the queen from laying more eggs around the young brood.
Step 2 takes place a week later; most of the open brood will now have been capped by the nurse bees. Varroa mites are trapped inside. If there is too much open brood on the frame, it should not be moved. If it is mostly or only closed brood, it can be moved to the bottom half of the mite shower colony. This is also the frame from which you can gather larvae to feed collected Varroa mites.
Step 3 is not vital, but simply necessary to compensate for the frames taken out in other steps. Empty frames"

Logic
From a truth table to abstract logic circuits
In BioBLESS, a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input
Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and
then “Create”. The corresponding designed logic circuits with different
predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed
in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a
designed logic circuit, which in most cases is supposed to be a compli-
cated multi-input circuit. Besides the function above, gates list will
provide many Boolean gates, and users can drag them freely to our
canvas to design logic circuits.
Gene Network
See the detailed structure of a designed gene circuit
A simple click on “Gene network” button will lead you to
another tab where the detailed structure of your designed
gene circuit is shown. When a gene circuit consists of many
Boolean gates, it is crucial to understand the internal sub-
stances and mechanisms. In this tab, you can see how
substances react with each other clearly, such as inhibition
and activation in or between Boolean gates.
SIMULATION
Get concentration-time simulation results
Given a designed gene circuit, such as a simple serial circuit composed of
an AND gate and an OR gate, you can use our default parameters and
change initial concentration of reactants to get simulation results. If you
want to get different results, you just need to change system parameters
such as the rate of reactions, namely, to fill constants into the dialog
boxes on our canvas. What’s more, simulation time slot is necessary as well to give  concentration-time figures of the inputs and outputs of a given gene circuit.  You are free to see the concentration-time evolution of every substance in  designed gene circuits individually.
ANALYSIS
Get robustness and sensitivity analysis
While offering various functions, BioBLESS also serves as an
analysis tool for designed gene circuits. Having designed a gene
circuit, you can click the “Analysis” button to reset parameters of
initial concentrations and reaction rates. Meanwhile, BioBLESS

European iGEM Meetup organised by TU Delft
Two of our teammates participated in a European iGEM meeting in the Netherlands in Delft as the only high school iGEM team and also the only one from Eastern Europe. It was held on the 7th and 8th of July and we had the chance to meet several iGEM teams and scientific researchers there. Participants had the opportunity to attend lectures held by university professors about synthetic biology and responsability while working on a synthetic biology experiment. It was a great pleasure for us to talk to others with similar interests about our scientific research work. Every team brought a poster to this excellent meeting as a result of which we could have a deeper insight into other iGEM teams' project. In our experience, the TU Delft team provided a great chance to make friends from the iGEM world and collaborate with other participant teams. We extremely appreciated all of the precious, practical and helpful collaborations given by others.

Ever since I was young, I’ve been obsessed with deciphering the world’s mysteries.  Why is that wall red but that one green?  How do I know which way is up?  Can entropy be reversed or is the heat death of the universe inevitable?  You know, typical kid stuff.  Either way, my natural curiosity has only grown as the apparent magic of the world has revealed itself to me.  With each answer found, two new questions appear.  This ever growing curiosity, combined with a knack for problem solving, has led me to where I am today.  My plans for the future are just beginning to really take shape, but I know I want to continue on to grad school and work in bioengineering on a molecular level.  I also hope to explore and experience the world, because out of an incredibly expansive universe, I have the unique opportunity to experience Earth.  Relative to the size of the universe, not many sentient lifeforms can claim that!

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," Splitting. Three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched for some template chain as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. In this case, the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. This is a drawback of our MoDeL language -- it does not support description of intra-molecular reactions. If A and C could react as different parts of the product, the reverse reactions would not be lost. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans for refinement of our MoDeL language.

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," are several reasons why we think that yeast extract is a good component for our sunscreen:
It does not cause irritation [25] .
It was proven to be an efficient antioxidant due to the presence of beta-glucan [25] .
It can moisturize and nourish the skin and is able to activate both, collagen production in the skin and cell regeneration processes [26] .
These properties would make the sunscreen healing, so it not only protects the skin from the sun but also helps to fight the consequences of sunburns.In addition to that, use of MAA-enriched yeast extract allows skipping purification of the target compounds, which is often time- and cost-consuming.
Therefore, we believe that the combination of MAAs and yeast extract will be advantageous and will make our product multifunctional and attractive for further development.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2), (T1,T2)->(C1,C3) and (T1,T2)->(T2,T3). (T1,T2)->(C2,C2) is not allowed. The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence"

Kobe,2017,Team:Kobe#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," suggested us that we also participate in this conference. Thankfully, they arranged so that we could make a poster session in the conference.
In Hyper Interdisciplinary Conference, we and Nagahama listened to each poster session and advised each other. We believed it was very helpful for both teams to demonstrate each project deeply by using poster and actively pointed out each weakness at an early stage. Besides, we had great experiences through this conference (Please see our human practice page for more information). We appreciate Team Nagahama offering us such great opportunities.
Moreover, we and Nagahama helped each other in terms of raising money. While we were struggling to raise money through crowdfunding, Nagahama actively and continuously spread our activity and information about crowdfunding. As our team was founded recently and not known well, we believed their help significantly contributed to our success of raising money. On the other hand, we also supported them while they were trying to raise money by spreading information and showing how we gathered money."
Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html," were very pleased to see a bright signal for Padh1-mOrange-pTUM. Nevertheless the promotor actvity of Psuc2 was very low. Thus we prepared YPD plates of a mig1 deficient yeast strain hoping for a better signal there. We also started to prepare our own buffer for further yeast transformations!
Week 22
Tadh1 was promptly delivered and we smeared cells that were transformed with Tadh1 on one of our plates but got no colonies. A closer look in the registry revealed that there some issues with the part and we decided to order another one. While waiting for the terminator we started to ligate two parts without terminator in pRS316, namely Padh1-mOrange and Pfet3-mOrange. We also digested these parts with NdeI which degrades the pTUM100 backbone (has AMP resistance). A retriction digest revealed that pRS315 has one additional EcoRI restriction site which was not marked in the plasmid map.
We made a lot of media for our work in yeast: YPD, synthetic-complete drop-out media, SC-Ura and SC-Ura-His, low-iron medium (LIM), glucose (40%) and galactose. By choosing the pRS backbones for all parts wisely we only need three different SC dropout media!
Week 21
After another control restriction we had to face the bitter truth: luc had completely failed right from the start (i.e first PCRs). Thus we had to do everything that we thought we had accomlished again. This means: luc PCRs and DNA purfications. Last weeks 3A-Assemblies had mixed results (found by plasmid preparation): Psuc2-mOrange and Pfet3-mOrange were negative (however, we picked new colonies of these constructs and yielded better results); Padh2-mOrange, Pfet-rox1, Padh1-rox1, and Padh2-mPR Xl were positive; mig-pSB1C3 and GAL-pSB1C3 were positive, too. Another transformation of Tadh had negative results thus we decided to simply order this part from the iGEM HQ. A transformation of luc was negative (again...) thus we had to start again from the beginning (for the second time in one single week!).
Multiple 3A-Assemblies had positive results (cut with E/P then gel): Pfet3-mig1, Padh1-mig1, GAL-mig1, and GAL-rox1! Also, the ligation of Panb1 in"

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid carrying pGAL+GFP without the activation of AD and BD.
For further experiment of the Propri-ontein system, we can compare the fluorescence intensity of the S. cerevisiae containing all of the three plasmids (AD, BD and pGAL+GFP) with that of the S. cerevisiae containing only pGAL+GFP. The ideal results are that the fluorescence produced by the S. cerevisiae containing AD, BD and pGAL+GFP will be much brighter than the S. cerevisiae containing only pGAL+GFP after heat shock. And if we add GdnHCl to the system, the fluorescence will decrease because it can disaggregate the protein so that AD and BD can no longer bind together, which can eliminate the expression of the downstream gene under the control of pGAL.
Experiment Results
The pGAL-GFP experiment in S. cerevisiae
For the pGAL-GFP device, we conducted several tests in S. cerevisiae.
Firstly, we transformed the recombinant plasmid containing pGAL1-GFP into the S. cerevisiae W303. Then we cultivated the cells at 30 ℃ for 24 hours. Next we measured the fluorescence of the cells under the same condition. (We used fluorescence microscope to observe cells under 100X objective lens.)
Here're the results of the fluorescence experiment.
Compared with the results from spilt sfGFP experiment, the fluorescence intensity was extremely low. And that is exactly what we expected. So we proved that the pGAL-GFP device really functions !
As for the other devices in propri-ontein system. We tried to transformed the three plasmid-AD, BD and pGAL-GFP to S. cerevisiae. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the colony on our plates. The possible reason is that transformation of three kinds of plasmid at the same time brings too much pressure to the cell, which can cause the death of cells. It was really a pity that we had to stop the experiment due to the time limitation. But we will finish the verification of the whole system in the near future.

Overview
Due to the temperature sensetive property of the SUP35NM, our system can be applied for a Biological Temperature Indicator. In the Proof of Concept section of our project, we have showed the relationship between the temperature and the intensity of the fluorescence, so we construted a standard cure using our prototype, and tested the standard curve with a"

Homology modelling
We modeled the 3D structure of our peptide-containing scaffolds (domain B1 of protein G from Staphylococcus aureus) by homology modelling. We used the Modeller library to accomplish that; since the peptide is about 20-25 amino acids long, it can be modeled as a loop inside the B1 domain scaffold for which there are already a number of 3D structures available at the Protein Data Bank.
This is the general homology modeling procedure we followed. All peptides were cloned inside a scaffold (B1 domain of protein G from Staphylococcus aureus. The peptides were short enough to be modeled as an internal loop by loop refinement; these structures should only be considered as a working model, since we do not have direct crystallographic data. A detailed procedure can be found in this link.
Results summary
Protein G scaffold
The following table is a summary of the models we generated for our peptides inside the protein G scaffold. Their main purpose is to give us an idea if the calculated energy profile matches our assumption that the peptide is being exposed to the exterior of the scaffold. These models are in no way definitive, since we lack direct crystalographic data.

HIT-Harbin,2013,Team:HIT-Harbin#Human practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM to more people of HIT. Our project is divided into several parts, and they all advance in parallel. We also planned for a series of activities, ranging from lectures to demonstrative experiments, to get students aware of the existence of iGEM, and, what is more, the importance of synthetic biology. Also, we do communications with professors and students outside the team and that has proved to benefit us a lot.
Early the spring semester, several lectures were delivered for recruitment in HIT, during which our team supervisor and a few old members came to share their stories with iGEM. They narrated by own experience how iGEM has made a difference in their lives, and they also explain the basic idea of iGEM as well as our project this year. More than 50 students were attracted to the lecture and five of them were finally admitted as new members of our team.
After recruitment, a new series of lectures are well prepared for training. All new members are required to come for a better understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology. Renowned professors as well as experienced team members are invited it.
Prof. Xing as a Consultant
Accidently, we got the information that there are other professors in HIT who also think highly of the iGEM competition, which excited us a lot. By great efforts, we successfully get through with one of them. Professor Xing Defeng, Cheung Kong Scholar of China, had an impressing talk with our team. He shared with us his own understanding for iGEM and synthetic biology. And he also clarified to us how the idea of iGEM could be applied in his own field. He agreed to join us as a consultant, and two of his students come to our team as members.
NEAU as a New Friend
During the recruitment lecture in spring semester, we met with several students coming from the iGEM club of Northeast Agriculture University (NEAU). They had never participated in the iGEM competition before but were preparing for a long time. The lack of practical experiences stays as a barrier in their way to iGEM. Aware of the situation, we decided to give a hand to them.
We invited representatives from this team to attend our weekly meetings and participate in the training courses for new members. Also, a few students from NEAU joined our experiments for project in the summer vacation and took an active part in it. We have been sharing knowledge, ideas and passion throughout the project. And we would all feel proud and glad to see their project in the iGEM competition next year. Furthermore, there is even one"
Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Loop_-_-_TEXT.html," a sequence of                         reactions which in global, must accomplish the                         thermodynamic law for this kind of processes:
Where the free energy is decomposed in the main stages                         previously described (2,15):
Each one of the terms from the expression above, is                         explained in following sections of the Modeling. We                         determined these parameters for two of the targets                         contained in our Database: ORYZA SATIVA JAPONICA GROUP                         GIBBERELLIN 20 OXIDASE 2 (LOC4325003) and CITRUS                         SINENSIS TERMINAL FLOWER (TFL). Those induce higher                         grain yield in rice flowering in orange, respectively.                         Values obtained for each of them were ΔGcomplex,Ga20Ox= -10,37 kcal/mol and                         ΔGcomplex,TFL =-11,78 kcal/mol.
These values were used to obtain the probability that                         the Cas9:gRNA complex cleaves the target in the Testing                         System, performing the desired knockout. To calculate                         this probability, we had to account for possible                         off-targets, as they could obtain                         ΔGcomplex,target <0, letting the R-loop                         be formed at those regions as well.
After calculating the ΔGcomplex,offtarget for off-targets suggested by the algorithm, only the                         off-target for the Ga20Ox could be considered as a                         final off-target, as TFL off-targets got free energy                         increments higher than zero. Therefore, we calculated                         the Pcomplex,Ga20Ox, obtaining a value of                         0,9964.
PAM binding energy
Once the complex has been formed, it must find the                         PAM sequence of the target included in the Testing                         System. The PAM region has between 3 and 5 nucleotides which are recognized by Cas9, enabling the union of the                         complex to the DNA. Each Cas9 specie binds better to                         one type of PAM region. In our case, as we are working                         with the human type Cas9, the PAM sequence will be                         -NGGN-.
Bearing in mind that breaking one hydrogen bond provides at least an energy supply of 1.2 kcal/mol, the                         binding of the PAM sequence must give a free energy                         ΔGPAM at least of 9 kcal/mol.
Relying on the nucleotides arrangement,                         ΔGPAM resulting from the PAM recognition                         will vary. However, it is possible that Cas9 interacts                         with a PAM region even though there are mismatches between them (2)."

Held on June 21, this day started with all the presentations at the university complex in Wageningen. This formal part consisted of several talks. First of all there were the talks of every individual 2014 iGEM team, questions were asked and advice was given. Some “old” iGEM members were invited as well, to tell about their project and to share their experiences. Some people from the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) were also invited, and they were given an opportunity to speak. They offered a cooperation between the iGEM teams and the RIVM, because they want to inform more people about the synthetic biology and its opportunities. However, they considered it very hard to promote the synthetic biology in a proper way. They arranged an information marked on the 17th of September with all the Dutch iGEM team, and invited several people to visit this day. You can find more about this day on this page. After all the formalities we went to another part of Wageningen, where we enjoyed a well-organized barbecue. The teams started to get to know each other, and several people spoke about organizing a second meet up. In the end we (the Groningen) team decided to organize a second meet up in a more informal setting.
It was a very successful day, and a nice first introduction to the other teams and their projects!

To achieve our goal of developing a cost effective triclosan biosensor then, we were tasked with (a) discovering an enzyme that met all of our criteria and (b) identifying an alternative substrate that would enable practical use.
Our wet lab section is organized into five subsections:
1. Enzyme Selection
2. Chemical Biology Substrate Screening
3. Enzyme Engineering
4. Prototyping in Real World Waste Water
5. Future Directions

The Need:A FabI enzyme that can show nanomolar inhibition using triclosan
(Why nanomolar inhibition? Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae. [18])
Strategy 1a: Scan the registry to find characterized FabIs with inhibition data
We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI. We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part. We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data.
Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition data
Triclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3]. Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al. They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme’s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan’s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].
The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan’s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it.

Applications in Diagnostics
Lowering costs and the burden
The attachment of a chemical moiety that emits a quantifiable signal (a   fluorescent, enzymatic or luminiscent moiety) to our peptides can lead to an   alternative diagnostic method to antibody and antibody fragments with the added   benefit of the relative low cost of production and modification of small peptides. This cost reduction may   help to spread this diagnostic tool to the markets of the developing world, where   fungal infections have the largest mortality rates and were health care is   largely affected by economic constraints. Moreover, if the peptides prove to have a high species-specificity, the diagnosis based on them may give more information for a proper therapy choice, potentially reducing the toxicity risks associated with the use of broad spectrum antimycotics.
In vivo diagnosis and the potential of artificial selection
Short peptides are currently being used as diagnostic tools for certain kind   of cancers. These peptides are naturally produced by humans   and have their natural binding proteins in the surface of cells; however, they   have been optimized to increase their half-life and their affinity towards their   natural target, and they also have been modified with radionuclides that make it   possible to detect the location of tumors -cells were their binding proteins are   overrepresented- with PET or SECT imaging.
The most common isotopically labelled peptide used for diagnosisis a 111In-labelled somatostatin analogue, known as OctreoScanTM, which is used to diagnose a variety of tumors. Other peptides under   develompent are cholecystokinin/gastrin analogues, glucagon-like peptide-1,   bombesin, chemokine receptor CXCR4 targeting peptides, RGD peptides, exendin,   Substance P, LHR"

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," infecting cells and some of the characteristics of Lentivirus. As Lentivirus belongs to RNA virus and the RNA virus’ coat protein contains the reverse transcriptase, the reverse transcriptase of Lentivirus after the invasion of the cells is brought into the cell by the virus itself. So there are differential equations as follows:
Reverse transcriptase:
The synthesis of cDNA:
The synthesis of double stranded DNA:
The synthesis of provirus DNA:
DNA negative strand transcription:
DNA positive strand replication:
Five kinds of nucleotides:
Among them, x1 to x5 represent positive strand, negative strand, cDNA, double stranded DNA and provirus DNA relatively, x6 to x10 represent five nucleotides, x11 represents the reverse transcriptase, bi(i=6,……,10)，ci(i=1,2)，di(i=1,……,5) and mi(i=1,2,3,4,11) are all constant. v1 and v2 are the maximum reaction rate for the two reactions; δ 1 represents the initial amount of reverse transcriptase in Lentivirus; δi(i=6,……,10) represent the five kinds of the initial amount of nucleotides and they are all constant.
figure.13
From the image above, the quantity of the intermediate products produced by Lentivirus in the process of making the host cell death increased rapidly and reached stable, which, in quantity, can be directly explained why Lentivirus can not produce the structural proteins as HIV virus and achieve the assembly of the virus particles, so that the amount of the intermediate production continued to grow.
6.Discussion
In the process of modeling, there exists a lot of problems. First, considering the production of cGMP can inhibit the reaction system. therefore, we assume that NO seperated from sGC and D2 transforming into D1 are the cGMP mediated process, so we use the feedback factor m to show the degree of the feedback. The question here is whether the degree of feedback will be in accordance with the order we have chosen. Second, there is no conclusion about the research of Lentivirus and the model is only based on the HIV research results of scientific workers. Therefore, in this sense, the model of Lentivirus’ transfection and gene combination in HEK293 cells still exist defects.
Despite the above limitations, our model can still an extensible framework for the study of the important NO-cGMP signaling mechanisms. Considering the big variety of cells across different tissues and species, NO-cGMP mechanisms are bound to vary and have designs that are specific to cell types"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Since we perform tests on pathogenic strains of bacteria it is necessary to work in a class II lab, which require special safety precautions, such as wearing special shoes and making sure no biomass leaves the lab. Despite even our best efforts to minimize the spread, people could get colonized by potentially harmful bacteria. MRSA is known to colonize the nostrils of people working with it and then they unknowingly take the bacteria out of the lab and can possibly infect other people.
Ecological perspective
The idea of manipulating microbes into producing materials we desire from waste products can be considered beneficial, as we exclude the harvesting and reduce the depletion of the resources of the Earth. However, the fact that a material is produced in microorganisms does not mean that the product can not be ecologically harmful. This is why it is crucial to ensure that materials made from microbes can be degraded, either through a metabolic pathway or a relatively fast chemical decay. The silk and bacteriocins, in our project, are combined in a protein matrix and does not pose an ecological threat as proteases or pH in the gut would degrade the silk or bacteriocins.
Traditional plastic polymers are synthesized from fossil materials and are not degradable through metabolic pathways or decay processes that match the disposing rate of plastic into the environment. This leads to accumulation of plastic into the environment, where estimates suggest that 10 % of all"

Part 4: PostORF
We called the region between the stop codon of the TAL ORF and the start codon of the antibiotic resistance gene PostORF. We wanted to use this part in our vector because it contains the SV40 promoter and enhancer for expression of the antibiotic selection marker. So we used PCR to “excise the fragment and add BsaI sites and appropriate overlaps to it.
After every single part had been purified, we used Golden Gate cloning to assemble them in one step. After quite some testing, we came up with the following protocol:

So we assembled the whole MammoBrick vector in one single reaction:
Step 2: Eukaryotic TALE expression vector:
Once the MammoBrick was ready, we inserted the TAL open reading frame and thereby evaluated, how easy it would be for future iGEM students to expression any desired ORF in eukaryotic cells.
Designing the TAL open reading frame:
For this purpose, we designed a TAL ORF by adding the following modifications to the TAL open reading frame in pTALEN (v2) NG:
1. We removed all EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI, BsmBI, BbsI and PmeI restriction sites.
2. We replaced the BsaI restriction sites for inserting direpeats by BsmBI sites, because – according to the manufacturer - BsmBI is better suited for digest over one hour.
3.  We added a consensus RBS in front of the ORF for expression in bacteria
4. We added a His-Tag to the n-terminal end to allow protein purification.
5. We flanked the whole sequence with the iGEM prefix and suffix.

2. To know how to estimate the cost of the project. The company representatives told that economical aspect is essential for the project of any type and in order to integrate the project successfully, you need to know the cost of every detail participating in the process. In addition to this, they mentioned the significant price of the Claus process currently used in the desulfurization of oil and stated that finding the cheap alternative to this method would drastically decrease their expenses.
3. To know how to work with information. They strongly recommended us to search more for the information related to the amount of hydrogen sulfide found on the fields, to accurately apply the statistical methods for analyzing this data and to present it in an appropriate way.
Such meetings always play a crucial role in creating and designing projects, because it has shown us that many aspects should be considered. Also, they agreed to provide us with their samples of oily water from the fields and to coordinate us throughout the project.
MKA Engineering LLP
With the purpose of assessing the relevance of our project in the real world, meeting with “MKA Engineering” company, which specializes in the import and sale of chemical reagents for mining purposes, was organized in Almaty. Our students made a presentation about iGEM and our current project in order to receive the feedback from the general audience and to ask the company representatives several questions about the import of the chemical reagents, sulfides, in particular. As a result of this meeting, several points were made:
We learned about two main industrial methods of obtaining sulfides. In the first method, sulfide is obtained from mirabilite ore. The second method involves sodium sulfate. According to the representatives of the company, none of these were viable in Kazakhstan. For this reason, sodium sulfide is exported from other countries, mainly China. Hydrogen sulfide that is released in oil mining places is not used for further purposes. This is due to the fact that even such companies do not know the application of this byproduct. Special containers are needed to work with hydrogen sulfide gas.
Finally, we found out valuable information that could assist in the project’s development as well as collected opinions of non-experts on our presentation about iGEM, our idea and synthetic biology generally. In addition, these points led us to necessity in collaborating with oil companies.

Colombia,2012,Team:Colombia#Human#SynthEthics_-_-_TEXT.html," practicality of living beings as engineering scaffolds and we were once again accused of hubris, doing this for the purpose of controlling life instead of pursuing specific advantages of this technology.
Regarding Prof. Arana’s input, we believe he is right to a certain extent. Although it is true biological systems are chaotic in nature, and that it is true it is very difficult to assure complete understanding of our design’s, this is the exact reason why iGEM HQ has a biosafety requirement. Additionally, this highlights the importance of making mathematical models in order to predict design behaviors and possible glitches. On the other hand, even though it is true that the construction of any feasible technology will not be stopped by particular interests, this doesn’t necessarily mean every conceivable piece of machinery will actually be built. Dr. Fernando Lizcano’s opinion was very important for us since it is possible that political interests may interfere with bioethical initiatives. However, it is important to understand that there are some very well conceived ethical stand points within the scientific community (e.g., regarding stem cell research or climate engineering). This means that even if some crazy idea is accepted by a government decision, the scientific community will not just stand aside. It is also true that there are many instances where gray areas may be found, and this highlights the importance of spreading synthetic biology into pop culture so people may make informed decisions. This was one of our main motivations for the organization of our Research in Colombia forum .
Prof. José Murillo's opinion was particularly interesting. It showed us that strong preconceptions may be present even within high academic contexts. To us, Prof. Murillo believes life to be a kind of higher state of being, rather than the coincidence of certain physical conditions. His statements opened our eyes to other kinds of conceptual criticisms and convinced us of the need for healthy legislative and educational campaigns for synthetic biology. This, we believe, is one of the main reasons why Human Practices must be carried out with great effort.
From this activity, we realized how new technologies change how people think about themselves. This encouraged us to make the decision of extending our outreach not only to students but coffee growers , since they would be the people directly affected by our technology. We realized we had to be very careful as to how to express ourselves, and how our actions could heavily influence the lifestyle of others. With this in mind, we decided to investigate how the emergence of genetics and genetically oriented technologies has impacted society. We thought that by doing this, we would be able to improve our perspective into how to approach different social groups, as well as to understand our responsibility as scientists. For this"

After out high school focus group, several high school students from the nearby high schools joined Biology Club and are conducting their own synthetic biology research. We hope to get more students involved in this research and act as advisors for them as they carry out their project.
Two of the teachers from the focus group have already arranged to visit our lab to conduct hands-on activities with their students. Even though there are very strict rules about doing synthetic biology activities at their schools, they have more freedom and scope for action by working in the college laboratories. We are already helping them prepare activities to do in our lab at the end of this semester and the beginning of next semester. They are also publicizing the resources available at our school to other teachers, and we hope to have a more extensive collaboration with them going forward. Tami Byron, the STEM Coordinator for Newport News School District, plans to have us collaborate with a magnet school in her school district that needs more biology resources for their students.
We are also continuing to act as a community partner for the Girl Scouts of the Colonial Coast and are scheduled to do another outreach event involving synthetic biology in February.

To assess crosstalk and leakiness we conducted multiple experiments: after adding one of the three AHLs to the cultures we analyzed the raise in sfGFP production using a microtiterplate reader. In a first step we measured the dose response of constructs with different ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and with or without riboregulator. We could observe differences not only in sensitivity, but also in leakiness; some strains expressed GFP even without AHL induction. To give an example: we evaluated the sensitivity of the siG0024 strain to different concentrations of 3OC6-HSL (LuxI product) and compared its characteristics to  those of other constructs. Additionally, we measured the sensitivity of siG0024 to 3OC12-HSL (LasI product) and C4-HSL (RhlI product). Indeed, we could observe the induction of sfGFP transcription by comparably low levels of 3OC12-HSL. Crosstalk can be observed between the Las and the Lux system. To simulate a situation most similar to the final experiment, we added the diluted supernatant of AHL producer cells to the test cultures. However, we could not detect any GFP production as reaction to the supernatant. We assume that the AHL concentration is not high enough to induce transcription. By constructing stronger RBSs on the producer plasmids we aim at increasing the AHL production. All these informations we will use to design a system tailored to our plans.
Summary of cross-talk experiments results
The figure shows the dose response of xxx to 3OC12-HSL, 3OC6-HSL and C4-HSL. Both 3OC12-HSL and 3OC6-HSL induce production of GFP, although at different concentrations. This is an example for cross talk between the lux and the las system.
