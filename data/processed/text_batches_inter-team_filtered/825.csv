Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#diffusion_-_-_TEXT.html," Model for the Flight of Pea Moth to Pheromone Traps Through a Crop, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 10 May 1984 vol. 306 no. 1125 19-48
W. L. Roelofs and R. T. Carde, Responses of Lepidoptera to synthetic sex pheromone chemicals and their analogues, Annual Review of Entomology Vol. 22: 377-405, 1977
Since pheromones are chemicals released into the air, we have to consider both the motion of the fluid and the one of the particles suspended in the fluid.
The motion of fluids can be described by the Navier–Stokes equations. But the typical nonlinearity of these equations when there may exist turbulences in the air flow, makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve. Thus, attending to the particles suspended in the fluid, a simpler effective option for pheromone dispersion modeling consists in the assumption of pheromones diffusive-like behavior. That is, pheromones are molecules that can undergo a diffusion process in which the random movement of gas molecules transport the chemical away from its source [1].
There are two ways to introduce the notion of diffusion: either using a phenomenological approach starting with Fick's laws of diffusion and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the random walk of the diffusing particles [2].
In our case, we decided to model our diffusion process using the Fick's laws. Thus, it is postulated that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient. However, diffusion processes are complex, and modelling them analytically and with accuracy is difficult. Even more when the geometry is not simple (e.g. consider the potential final distribution of our plants in the crop field). For this reason, we decided to consider a simplified model in which pheromone chemicals obey the  heat diffusion equation.
Approximation
The diffusion equation is a partial differential equation that describes density dynamics in a material undergoing diffusion. It is also used to describe processes exhibiting diffusive-like behavior, like in our case. The equation is usually written as:
$$\frac{\partial \phi (r,t) }{\partial t} = \nabla • [D(\phi,r)  \nabla \phi(r,t)]$$
where $\phi(r, t)$ is the density of the diffusing material at location r and time"
Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.   Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of ''E. coli'' should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.   Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on"

200µl of Bacillus subtilis with MM and starvation solutions PLUS pGFP-rrnB DNA was added to an LB + chloramphenicol plate.
The way in which the chloramphenicol plates were poured is shown below. As for the LB only plate, it was already prepared from a previous experiment.
Pouring of chloramphenicol LB plates
James helping to make a stack of LB + Chloramphenicol plates
The pouring plates protocol was used to make the chloramphenicol LB + agar plates. 1 litre of LB + agar solution was made up in the usual way before 5ml of chloramphenicol was added to the flasks. Here is a summary of events:
500ml of LB+agar solution was added to one flask; to another flask 500ml of distilled water was added.
After autoclaving both flasks and cooling to correct temperature, the two solutions were combined.
5ml of chloramphenicol was added to the 1 litre of LB+agar solution.
The LB + agar + chloramphenicol solution was distributed into plates.
The plates were appropriately labelled and left on side to cool for over one hour - the 3 plates involved in growing today's transformants were then transferred to the 42ºC incubator so they could be dried off properly.
What will the plates tell us?
Plate 1 is an LB-only agar plate which contains overnight solution from tube 4 - this only contains MM competence medium as well as starvation medium added at a later stage. It contains NO Bacillus subtilis cells although it has been treated in the same way as the tube which does contain Bacillus throughout the transformation process. As it contains NO B. subtilis, there shouldn't be any growth on this plate at all. Any growth that does emerge on this LB plate will be contaminant. Hence this plate tests the contamination control
Plate 2 is an LB + chloramphenicol plate which contains overnight solution from tube 1 - this contains B. subtilis plus MM competence medium as well as starvation medium added at a later stage. However the Bacillus subtilis on this"

We transformed both the Modular Cloning DNAse1 (overnighted in the PCR) and Killer Red 3 strain into DH5α E. coli cells, and made overnights of all the transformations from yesterday as they were all successful.
We attempted the Lysozyme horizontal gene transfer experiment, and left it overnight in the PCR machine at 55°C. We also took 5ml samples from induced Killer Red, non-induced Killer Red and wild type DH5α culture flasks and stored them in the cold room.

Today the module team (led by Emily) met with Dr John Love to discuss what currently exists of the module structure, look at where it would be best to propose module implementation (our aim is to have it established as a second year Biosciences module) and receive general feedback on how to progress. He is keen on the idea, which is definitely encouraging.
The lab team today - Dan, Eloise, Jack and Pablo - inoculated the Killer Red and Killer Orange flasks prepared yesterday and grew them to OD 0.4 and 0.7 respectively, then overnighted them at 37℃ and 220 rpm. They exposed dilutions of induced Killer Red were exposed to white light for 7.5 hours then spread plated them.
They removed the incubated Lysozyme from the PCR machine - some was transformed, some was incubated and the remainder was used as a control to see if cells could survive the reaction. They also made overnights of the successful DNAse1 plates.

Jack and Alice spoke with Dr Chloe Singleton, one of our instructors, about some more ideas they had had about the integrated side of our Human Practises. Andy finished developing a basic model for the mechanism of action of Lysozyme today, modelling percentage of remaining peptidoglycan in the cell wall against time.
We checked the plates prepared yesterday with lysate (from the HGT (horizontal gene transfer) experiment) - the plated out lysate showed no colonies, but fully transformed and the incubation condition both showed colonies producing RFP. This initial test shows the HGT experiment with lysozyme is successful, and we will be repeating it.

The two 2-part and two 3-part CBA's were amplified using PCR Rescue and gel purified. The original 4-part CBA was transformed into E. coli electrocompetent cells using electroporation and plated on kanamycin antibiotic agar plates. The 4-part CBA was repeated to ensure accuracy. Because the CBA parts contained no plasmid DNA, the 4-part CBA could be digested by restriction enzyme Dpn1. Dpn1 binds and cuts methylated DNA sites, thus destroying any plasmid DNA remaining as a contaminant.
More issues with RBS library design, as it seems very difficult to find sequences with sufficiently high TIR. Decided to use an initial condition for the calculator, which should speed it up and also ensure higher TIR is reached. More calculations ran.
Tuesday, June 10, 2014
The original 4-part CBA worked! Many colonies appeared on the plate after incubation at 37 degrees C for 18 hours, and 12 colonies were selected for plasmid preparation. These were digested with AatII and XbaI, two restriction sites that are only both contained in the final assembled 4-part plasmid. 6/12 colonies showed the correct bands on the gel. We also prepared more 1 kb ladder from concentrate.
gblocks digested to ready them for ligation into pFTV. Not enough stock of pFTV was present, so inverse PCR ran again, this time with 3 tubes.
Wednesday, June 11, 2014
3 successful colonies were sent for sequencing. In order to insert the dCas9 system into plasmid 1, dCas9 was digested with XhoI and ClaI. 4 successful colonies were digested with ClaI for 3 hours, heat inactivated at 65 degrees C, and then digested with SalI-HF restriction enzyme. SalI and XhoI are compatible sites. These digestions were gel purified, resulting in low concentrations of plasmid DNA. Only two colonies were used to continue further. We met with Leah Bug and Matthew Johnson from the Penn State Center for Science and the Schools .
pFTV digested. Not enough Cla1 enzyme was present, so this step will be suspect if there are issues in the future. More Cla1 ordered. Inverse PCR ran again, this time with added extension time (2:30 instead of 1:30"

4 falcon tubes with LB (3 ml) + Kn (1.5 μl) + Cm (1.5 μl) + 1 colony
4 falcon tubes with LB + Kn + 1 colony
2 clonings were performed to start building devices: J23 was digested with E-S and FMS1 with X-P and all was ligated into a PaK plasmid and seeded onto a LB + Kn Petri dish. On the other hand, AhpCp1 was digested with E-S and KatG was digested with X-P, ligated into PaK and seeded onto LB + Kn Petri dish.
We repeated PatA and OxyR clonings as we had not obtained good results for these parts until now. E-P digestions of PatA and OxyR were performed, taking the DNA directly from the Gblocks, and ligated into PaC plasmids. Those plasmids were transformed into DH5α cells and seeded on LB + Cm Petri dishes. For the transformation, we used LB instead of 2YT.
DH5α with pCas9-SpeC cultures were refreshed into LB + Cm  (3 ml + 1.5 μl).
24/08/2016
Checking digestions and a checking electrophoresis gel of the previous day digestions were performed. The order in which the wells were loaded is the next:   pAK - pAC - J23119 - AhpCp1 - DNA ladder - PatA - FMS1 - OxyR - KatG
Minipreps and checking digestions were performed for the pCas9-SpeC cultures (0/N and 2nd 0/N)). Null results were observed on the electrophoresis gel.

I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
Nimaya De Silva
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I go to Winston Churchill High School. I am 16 years old and this is my first year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices as well and have been thoroughly enjoying it!  Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter! I also take piano lessons, and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!

The HaeIII restriction enzyme bluntly cuts at two GGCC recognition sites and is not affected by DNA methylation and so the 62bp target sequence should be readily released upon HaeIII digestion of male genomic DNA.
Fig. 7 Sequence of the Sry target region from the mouse Sry gene located on the Y chromosome as depicted in Benchling software. Oligonucleotides corresponding to both the top strand of the 62bp target were used to test the Sry detector system.
3.  Single Stranded Sry Target Preparation
The sequence of our target was chosen by analysing the Sry gene on bioinformatics tool Benchling.  Either the top or bottom strand of this sequence was synthesized and phosphorylated. This was carried out as described in our protocol file.  The single stranded target was then ready for reaction with our Sry detector plasmid.
4.  Cloning of Sry Target into a Plasmid
Overlapping forward and reverse oligonucleotides containing the Sry target and flanking HaeIII recognition sites and that had overhanging XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites were synthesized.  Double stranded DNA was generated by primer extension in a standard PCR reaction.  Following digestion with XhoI and EcoRI enzymes this target DNA was cloned into the pBluescript SKII vector that had been cut with the same enzymes.  This was done to mimic the true structure of the Sry target.

Detector Testing and Optimization
Validation and versatility of HPV and Sry Detectors
Initial testing of the detector involved experimenting our construct with the most simple targets – either single stranded or double stranded 55bp oligonucleotides corresponding to our target sequences. This sequence was chosen as described above and synthesised for testing with the detector. An excess of the target oligonucleotide was used as our key aim was to evaluate the detectors ability to bind to the target.  A number of conditions for activation of the HPV detector were initially tested.  A control was also set up which lacked the target oligo.

Next, we began to talk about the widest synthetic biology competition, iGEM.    We said to our friends from different medical schools that gene parts named    as Biobricks distributed to all iGEM teams in plates are used to perform    functional and useful projects in an organism by the teams, especially in    E.coli, during enjoyable summer lab studies. Different BioBricks, their    certain functions and how they are assembled were told in the    talk.   
Finally, we introduced five iGEM teams from Turkey, 2 of them are software    teams while the remaining are wetlab teams. We said that we would participate    in the European semi-final in Holland as Fatih_Turkey, METU Ankara, Bilkent    UNAM as wetlab teams and METU Turkey Softlab and METU BIN Ankara as software    teams.

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Policy#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html," cursos de exatas tem aumentado? O que você vê no seu próprio curso? Acho que tem aumentado, mas o progresso tem sido bem lento; há uma boa representatividade de mulheres, mas ainda não estamos no cenário ideal. Não consigo entender porque tradicionalmente se tem menos mulheres em carreiras de exatas. Para mim é muito complicado entender isso. Nos cursos de biológicas e humanas, por exemplo, existe um público bastante heterogêneo e, às vezes, as mulheres são maioria em sala de aula. Então, a gente vem progredindo, mas ainda há essa disparidade na carreira de exatas. Vejo que há a necessidade de colocar esse tema em discussão e estimular as mulheres com exemplos de representatividade feminina em postos importantes, como, por exemplo, a Angela Merkel, que se formou em física. No meu curso, em especial, há no máximo dez meninas, os outros trinta integrantes do curso são homens. Mas não me sinto deslocada nesta área pelo fato de ser mulher. Currently, has the presence of women in exact sciences been increasing? How do you see it in your own course?
I think it has increased, but the progress has been slow. There is a good part composed of women, but we are still not in an ideal scenery. I cannot understand why traditionally there are less women in exact science careers. For me it is very complicated to understand this. In biological and human courses, for example, there is a very heterogeneous public and sometimes women are the majority in class. Therefore, we are progressing, but there still exists this difference in science careers. I see the necessity to bring out this topic and stimulate women by showing them successful feminine examples as Angela Merkel, who graduated in physics. In my course, specially, there is at maximum ten women, the other thirty students are men. But I do not feel out of place in this area because I am a woman.
Você diria que existe qualquer tipo de segregação ou discriminação de gênero, mesmo que sutis? Se sim, diria que isso pode ocorrer de forma inconsciente?
A gente vive em um ambiente muito privilegiado, porque as pessoas têm uma formação legal. Em geral, não encaramos o preconceito. Não diretamente. Vejo que, às vezes, há alguns comentários que são de cunho preconceituoso, mas que são feitos de forma inconsciente"

UCL,2018,Team:UCLouvain#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html,", we will count colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and our two Negative Control (BBa_R0040) cultures.
Step 1: Starting Sample Preparation
This protocol will result in CFU/mL for 0.1 OD600. Our overnight cultures will have a much higher OD600 and so this section of the protocol, called ""Starting Sample Preparation"", will give us the ""Starting Sample"" with a 0.1                       OD600                       measurement.
Measure the OD600 of the cell cultures, making sure to dilute to the linear detection range of the plate reader. In our case, the range is between 0.097 and 0.239. Include blank media (LB + Cam) as well.
For an overnight culture (16-18 hours of growth), we recommend diluting the cultures 1:8 (8-fold dilution) in LB + Cam before measuring the OD600.
Preparation: Add 25 μL culture to 175 μL LB + Cam in a well in a black 96-well plate, with a clear, flat bottom. Recommended plate setup is below. Each well should have 200 μL.
The scheme is the                             following:
A1 - A2: Positive Controls (cultures 1-2)
B1 - B2: Negative Controls (cultures 3-4)
C1 - C2: Blank media - 200 μL of LB + Cam (in duplicate)
Dilute your overnight culture to OD600 = 0.1 in 1mL of LB + Cam media. Do this in triplicate for each culture.
Use (C1)(V1) = (C2)(V2) to calculate the dilutions, where:
C1 is your starting OD600 C2 is the target OD600 of 0.1
V1 is the unknown volume in μL
V2 is the final volume of 1000 μL
Important: When calculating C1, subtract the blank from the reading and multiple by the dilution factor used.
Check the OD600 and make sure it is 0.1 (minus the blank measurement). The scheme is the following:
A1 - A2: Positive Controls (cultures 1-2)
B1 - B2: Negative Controls (cultures 3-4)
C1 - C2: Blank media - 200 μL of LB + Cam (in duplicate)

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Conference_-_-_TEXT.html," seminar is the connection between the modeling work and laboratory work.
The modeling work is supposed to be implemented before the experiment to make a prediction and instruction for laboratory work, while sometimes the modeling work just follow the experiments. Not all the researches are suitable to make modeling, and many biological question cannot be predicted and it can be only examined by real experiments.
In conclusion, modeling can help to design and serve as a guideline to experiment, while the data gaining from experiment can verify the degree of accuracy of modeling.
C.The 6th China Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Forum
We were honored to attend the great conference in cardiovascular field, which is held by the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University in 24th July. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to promote our idea based on the concept of synthetic biology to a variety of attendants of doctors, researchers, druggist and specialists. We introduce many applications of synthetic biology in health and medicine, such as rapid detection of cancer, killing device of virus and bacterial, in order to make them understand how synthetic biology can affect the current medical treatment, which raised their considerable interests. We also presented our project to some cardiovascular specialists and ask them for suggestions to improve the project design. During the conference, we were lucky and excited to interview Professor Hu Dayi, a very famous doctor in cardiovascular field. He said to us that gene analysis can be a medical tendency in the future, and tens of years later it may become a regular item of physical examination. It can help us know more about our heath condition and can improve the development of precision medicine. He also mentioned that our project may become a prototype of gene therapy for cardiovascular treatment.
In addition, here are some points of view gained from other specialists:
In the clinical trials, we clinical workers also expect some new development in the research of preclinical medicine such as gene therapy and synthetic biology method, so that we can have more therapies to help patients get rid of diseases.
Cardiovascular prevention is a heated and essential point for research. Thus, it is worth thinking about a way to do early detection using the method of synthetic biology."

The Seabin Project for taking the time to speak with us and for discussing potential collaborations between our projects.
Parley for the Oceans for sending us samples of ocean plastic to use in our research.
BosLab for inviting Harvard BioDesign to volunteer at a public outreach event, 'Building with Biology.'
Prof. Peter R. Girguis: Professor Joshi suggested reaching out to Professor Girguis, a member of Harvard's faculty who has previously led an iGEM team. His work was of particular interest to our team because it entails, among other things, developing microbial fuel cells for marine environments. The professor provided a number of technical suggestions: he advised the use of titanium wires instead of copper as they release ions and disturb the potential results we will get. He also suggested using a Standalone voltage data logger for voltage and current measurements and data computing. Girguis also encouraged us to consider the economic viability of our fuel cell project. To help illustrate his point, he discussed his own research and explained that in the case of electronic devices in remote locations at the bottom of the ocean, microbial fuel cells can be more cost-effective than alternatives such as batteries that need to be constantly replaced.
Erika Parra, Ph.D. Parra is an associate of Harvard's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. She has extensive experience working with fuel cells and was kind enough to visit our lab space at the Wyss to help us assemble our cell.

Collaborations
This summer, we met TAS_Taipei when we were participating the Asia Pacific iGEM conference raised by NCTU_Formosa. we are currently working on an improvement of the reprocessed paper manufacturing process. we had found the process “flotation” could cause severe paper fiber lost, which is a big problem for preserving paper fibers. After we saw TAS_Taipei presentation of how biofilm could attract nano gold particles, they were excited about whether the biofilm could absorb ink particles. Their idea might give the potential of replacing current flotation process which would cause paper fiber lost and chemical pollution. We had discuss for collaboration of improving the process. They had test the biofilm absorption of ink particles provided by our project built up protocols.
To sum up, our experiment shows the potential of attracting ink particles. That is, in future imagination, biofilm could be the candidate material for replacing the current method.
We helped TAS_Taipei independently verify that overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) produces more biofilms than control (BBa_K342003)
(caption) Figure 3-19: A) Our experiment results showed that E. coli overexpressing OmpR234(BBa_K2229200) is producing more biofilm than a control which does not overexpress OmpR234(BBa_K342003). B) CGU_Taiwan independently tested our constructs using crystal violet, a dye commonly used to quantify biofilm formation. BBa_K2229200 showed higher absorbance compared to the control BBa_K342003, reflecting a the formation of more biofilm, which matches our results."

Pst1  Schnittstellen aus den ITRs  über synthetische Oligopeptide entfernen. Die Oligopeptide wurde bereits bestellt und werden am Montag verschickt.
Bei der Kalkulation und Berechnung von zu pippetierenden  Volumina  bietet es sich an  die Ergebnisse einer Kontrolle zu unterziehen.
Tobias weist darauf hin, dass es in Genious sowohl ein Feld für Vorwärtssuche, als auch ein Feld für die Rückwärtssuche nach Sequenzen gibt.
Die Identifikation der Inhalte einzelner Eppis soll durch Nummern auf dem Deckel gewährleistet werden. Diese sind in denen hierfür erstellten Excel- Sheets einer genauen Beschreibung des Inhaltes zugeordnet. Die Excel- Sheets wurden in den Kategorien Plasmide, Oligos, Bakterienkultur, Eukaryonten und Primer erstellt. Adrian weist darauf hin dass dieses vielversprechende Ordnungssystem nur dann funktioniert wenn es von Anfang an eingehalten wird.

These results, together with positive control (Fig. 9c) validated that the encapsulation efficiency is immensely effective, as all the liposomes exhibit fluorescence signal. Negative control exhibited no measurable fluorescence with FITC filter, as expected (data not shown), confirming that no contamination was present to distort the results.

Characterization: unilamellarity validation using α-hemolysin protein pores
Most membrane proteins insert, fold and function properly only in unilamellar membranes, therefore unilamellarity is an absolutely critical parameter for studying MPs. To validate that our synthesized liposomes are truly unilamellar, we recruited the pore forming membrane protein α-hemolysin (2 mM) from Staphylococcus aureus. Monomers of α-hemolysin self-assemble to form mushroom-shaped heptameric 1.5 nm wide pores in the phospholipid bilayer. The integration of these proteins make the bilayer selectively permeable to small molecules sized 2 kDa or less8. This protein pore was chosen as it can perforate into only one bilayer, therefore a multilamellar membrane would not allow the internal content of the liposome to escape9.
To test the incorporation of α-hemolysin into the liposome membrane we used a membrane-impermeable fluorescent probe calcein. Calcein is a self quenching fluorophore - a unique molecule that exhibits fluorescence only after it is diluted. That means that if we encapsulate concentrated calcein solution inside of our liposomes, we should observe that while looking through a fluorescence filter they appear darker than the outer solution (Fig. 10a). That happens because a small fraction of liposomes inevitably falls apart, releasing calcein into the outside, thus diluting it and therefore we measure the fluorescence in the outer solution. Hypothetically, inserting α-hemolysin into the liposome membrane will increase the fluorescence of the outer solution to a much greater degree, as the calcein"

Protein Expression in 96-well Plates and Protein Extraction
Proteins were expressed in 96-well plates in a way adapted from Knaust et al. 2001. The mutants have been grown and protein expression has been induced in the following way:
1) Inoculation of single colonies in 200 µL LB containing corresponding antibiotics. Incubate overnight at 37 °C.
2) Add 1 mL LB per well containing corresponding antibiotics. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.
3) Induce with 1 % arabinose (120 µL 10% arabinose solution). Incubate at 37 °C for 3 h.
The water-soluble proteins have then been extracted using B-PER:
4) Transfer 1 mL culture to 1.5 mL Eppendorf reaction tubes. Spin down at 5000xg for 10 min.
5) Discard the supernatant and add 4 mL of B-PER per g of bacterial cells. (In this case, the mean weight of 9 samples has been evaluated and the proper amount of B-PER has been added to every sample. This amount was 75 µL.
6) Vortex to totally dissolve the pellet. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.
7) Centrifuge at 15000xg for 5 min.
8) Take supernatant and discard of the pellet.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

IGEM SOCIETY
This year (2012) was the first time that our University of Westminster participates in the iGEM competition. We encountered many difficulties being the fresh new team, and decided to organise an iGEM society to share everything we were learning with the students that may become part of our 2013 Westminster iGEM team. We organised an iSTEM project presentation and will hold an Induction Session in early October to expose the student community to the SynBio field and the iGEM!
FRESHERS' FAIR
During the fresher’s day at our University, we had a presentation stand through which we could introduce synthetic biology, the iGEM competition and our new Westminster iGEM society to the new students. We were wonderfully received by many enthusiastic students, 94 of which expressed their wish to attend our iSTEM official presentation before the Jamboree and talks on the topic of synthetic biology. Our iGEM public engagement posters were displayed both in the foyer TV and our stand, attracting many students that were curious about our project or wanted to be part of a future iGEM team (and half of them were not studying Biology, but other courses varying from Electrical Engineering to Politics!) It was a great experience to meet them all and communicate our ideas and the potential of SynBio, as well as increasing the student`s awareness of the iGEM competition.
INTERVIEW
We interviewed Dr. Miriam Dwek, who is the head of the Against Breast Cancer Unit at the University of Westminster. She talked with us about her research and her views on our project, and gave us useful advice.

Week of September 3rd
PETase HLYBD sequenced and transformed into BL21 cells. Schedule for lab during classes discussed.
Week of September 10th
PcaU sequencing primers ordered, PcaU sequenced in pGLO backbone. Sequence confirmed PcaU transformed into BL21 DE3 cells. Preliminary experiments were conducted for the scale up of PETase CBD bioproduction.
Week of September 17th
Initial PcaU results for high and low range detection were carried out. PcaU detection protocol was discussed and finalized. PNPB assay performed testing the effect of cellulose binding on PETase CBD esterase activity. Another PNPB assay performed testing activity of PETase CBD HLYBD under varying induction conditions.
Week of September 24th
Completed PcaU tests and showed that PcaU could differentiate 1uM PCA concentrations. Expressed PETase HLYBD under the dual promoter system. The condition induced with both arabinose and IPTG showed signs of secretion, with a white substance accumulating on the sides of the tube. The substance was harvested for testing. All 2018 teams involved with PET degradation were contacted and we offered to test our PCA detection device on their degradation product. Makerere, Yale, and RHIT responded, however none were able to supply product at the time.
Week of October 1st
We spent the week preparing parts submissions. PcaU was assembled into C3 backbone and we removed an EcoR1 site for submission. We also ordered a g block just in case our work ran into difficulty. Fresh PETase enzyme was expressed and harvested. We began experimenting with various buffers to determine which would be best as TPH buffer, and ordered necessary reagents including ferrous ammonium sulfate and L-cysteine HCl. We tested PcaU sensitivity in DH5a vs BL21 cells and found that PcaU was functional in 5a cells but not as sensitive.
Week of October 8th
SEM images of PETase activity were obtained. It was at this point that we discovered the HlyA secretion system was not working for PETase. The modified PcaU sequence with removed EcoR1 was tested in pGLO and found to be equally sensitive as the original. Parts were shipped out. Over the weekend, TPH buffer was made and fresh cells expressing fresh TPH enzymes were sonicated.

Overview
This project focuses on improving the yeast surface display system. Cell-surface display systems have been successfully developed in various microorganisms (Shibasaki, 2009), such as E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The baker' s yeast is one of the most suitable hosts for the technology because of its rigid cell walls (around 110-200 nm wild) and its useful platform for protein production, which facilates the folding and glycosylation of expressed heterologous eukaryotic proteins. The rigid yeast cell wall is mainly composed of cross-linked β-1,3/ 1,6-glucans, mannoproteins, and chitin. Among these components, the β-1,6-glucan, though takes up little quantities of the system, plays an essential role in anchoring cell-wall proteins (Liu, 2016). Another important part in the display system is glucanase-extractable mannoproteins which contains glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, such as agglutinin (Aga1 and Aga2). These GPI-anchored proteins can be utilized in anchoring foreign proteins by genetic engineering. The specific function of GPI-anchored proteins is described in later sections.

In recent years, yeast surface display system has been a hot spot in biotechnology. Applications of this technique exist in numerous fields. By anchoring enzymes, peptides or functional proteins on the cell wall, yeast surface display system can show the following advantages:
Heterologous eukaryotic protein expression can be accomplished simply by yeast cell propagation (Shibasaki, 2009), with few misfolding and incomplete modification;
Protein can be transported and immobilized by the secretory pathway, exocytosis (Liu, 2016). Thus, the expenditure and facilities needed for protein generation and enrichment in practical research or production can be reduced;

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html,", which is part of the surfactin biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis, can effectively modify ACPs from all PKS subclasses as well as related peptidyl carrier protein and aryl carrier protein domains from nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Only with the function of Sfp can propionyl-CoA be linked to ACPs, which is the basement of the reactions.
In the preparatory phase, we transformed pKD46 into BL21, as preparation for gene knock-out. pKD46 contains Red system which is composed from three genes (gam, bet, exo ). The Gam protein prevents an E. coli nuclease of RecBCD from degrading linear DNA fragments, thus allowing preservation of transformed linear DNA in vivo. The bet gene product, Beta, is an ssDNA-binding protein that promotes annealing of two complementary DNA molecules, and the exo gene product, Exo, has a 5´ to 3´ dsDNA exonuclease activity.
After the preparation, we achieved the target gene as above by fusion PCR, which was then transformed into BL21(DE3), yielding E. coli BAP1. Using prpE and the fragment of prpR as homologous arm, we can ensure the gene replacement happens in targeted location. And Sh Ble gene product is zeocin-resistant, helping us to screen E.coli.
Results
After gene knock-out, we achieved BAP1 as the preparation for those following experiments. According to PCR results, prpRBCD gene had been knocked out while sfp gene and prpE gene is still kept on. Obviously, the gene had been transformed into the targeted location.
Conclusion
Although frameshift mutation has taken place in sfp gene, we transformed plasmids with sfp gene into BAP1 to make up for it, which has been proved to work as the following experiments showed. Therefore, by the gene knock-out, we have successfully achieved workable BAP1.

Furthermore, some interesting guest speakers were present: Hyan Youk gave a very clear and inspiring talk about how he uses synthetic biology in his research to understand basic science. Rob Smith told us some things about reverse design and how this is useful in research.
We also participated in a short workshop “Change of Perspective”, a discussion about the stakeholders of our projects. We had an interesting discussion with some team members from the team of TU Delft, they asked us some questions about what our gel could do eventually and also why people would use our gel instead of buying one from a chemical supplier.
Wilhelm Huck
05-07-2017
After our Skype call with Zoë Robaey in which we had a small brainstorm session about possible stakeholders for our application, we thought of our system as some sort of toolbox for synthetic cells. Since Wilhelm Huck’s research is about the synthetic cells, we decided to set up a meeting with him to see whether our idea is something he would work with.
Wilhelm Huck’s first remark about our idea was the fact that a 4-4 valency would also lead to network formation, so 4-3 would not be necessary to induce a network. Furthermore, he thought that our network will form a gel instead of a coacervate, since the interactions we use are quite specific. For synthetic organelles, coacervates would be preferred over a gel. Summarizing, our meeting with Wilhelm Huck has given us some new insights in the research done in synthetic organelles.
European iGEM meet-up
07-07-2017
The iGEM team from Delft organized a European meetup, teams were present from all over Europe. On this day we started with some interesting talks. Cees Dekker started off with a presentation about synthetic biology and some hot topics in the field, like DNA origami. He also gave us some insights in his own research: synthetic cell division. Denis Murphy stressed us the importance of big data and how reliable knowledge and wisdom can be extracted from this. Finally Dirk Stemering had a more interactive talk about responsible research and innovation and asked how the iGEM teams present were incorporating societal embedding in their project.
After the break it was time for the poster session. The poster presentations were a good opportunity for us to practice our story and we noticed that our story was a whole lot clearer compared to the previous meetup. It was also very interesting to see the posters of other European teams and to see their projects.

14/03/12. Started mailing.
We started to discuss the aim of the human practices team and its role in iGEM projects.
23/03/12. Skype meeting with Ana and Dorothy:
Brainstorming ethical issues. We came up with the idea of shooting a short film.
1. The movie is a 'medium' to do ethics. So, the first thing you would need to do is to decide which ethical issue(s) is important for you.  2. Then, you will have to decide what story is best to articulate that ethical issue(s) 3. When you make your script, you need to have clear in your mind what the 'use' of this movie will be: are you finally going to show it to the public to trigger ethical debate? or will you give it another use? The point is: movies are always made to address a certain audience and to cause a certain effect on those audiences, keep this in mind!  4. Finally, please take into consideration that this is a low-cost project: needs to be cheap and short. Cheap: like I say, the cheapest is that you use what you have that is yourselves and what you can produce. Images retrieved from visual archives are often expensive. Timing: In my mind the movie should last between 3-7 min.
From last meeting onwards:
-We discussed ethical issues related to our project.   -We studied those issues and gathered information about them. Scoping exercise: it consists in scoping and mapping a number of ethical and social issues that are relevant for our talking bacteria project.   -As a source of inspiration we watched several films from the Synthetic biology film festival  -Ana talked to Artefactando, who will give us a hand shooting the film. -We are planning a meeting on 31st May (with Ana in person!) and shooting sessions on July.

Objective: Continue to degrade biofilms using household cleaners brought into to the lab to see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms.
Procedure: Degrading the July 13 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 13 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean, Lysol, Tilex, and Fantistik. Water was used as a control. 3200 μL of solution was added to each well and Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing July 13 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms from yesterday, 200 μL of LB media was added to two of the wells in the 28-well plate and to the Petri dishes that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
This process was repeated for each of the cleaners and the control listed above in the procedure for degradation of the biofilms.
The Petri dishes and the 28-well plate were left to air out on a sheet of paper towel.
Procedure: Creating Biofilms
Biofilms were made in 5 35x10 mm Petri dishes and 4 wells in a 28-well plate by putting 3000 μL of LB media, 3 μL of KAN, and 20 μL of RFP in to each Petri dish and well.
These were left in the 37 ˚C incubator for 24 hours so that they could grow.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," today had a brainstorm about our main 6 topics again, and we realised that the most feasible idea we can choose is the self-destructive plasmids (some of us already had PR ideas, like a poster of James Bond with a gun-shaped plasmid in his hand). Finally, we agreed to write a short plan on what we will do and how each one of us shall contribute to the project.

Dear Diary, today we looked at the different ideas we had for the project. Needless to say, most of the ideas seemed more appealing as we started looking deeper into them, although it was somewhat disappointing when we found out the salt water desalination using bacteria was not quite feasible. The micro-organism muscle idea also turned out to be a flop. However, there were some nice developments in the other 4 ideas, and the buoyant bacteria application in mines seemed quite promising.
Yours in unity, TUD iGEM '09
8th May 2009
Dear Diary, as we decided in last meeting, we chose the top 5 ideas from the list of subjects we had so far. We came to the following conclusion based on democratic voting:
Salt water purification
Buoyant Bacteria
Impulse Signal
Melatonin Compensation
Micro-organism Muscle
Enzyme Modulation (shared 5th place)
We agreed to divide the subjects and look at the possibilities, opportunities, feasibility and applications for the top 5 ideas, so that next meeting we could inform each other on the subjects, and possibly narrow down the list to a top 3.

Dear diary, today we had a meeting regarding the practical aspects of the iGEM project (we divided the task of looking at the project ideas among all the group members, and decided that each person would look at 3 ideas, make a small research about them and publish it on the website, so that we can choose the top 5 ideas, and out of them choose the most attractive one). We also agreed on starting to look for financial support, but then we agreed we should wait a bit longer until we have a concrete idea for our project. We also agreed on meeting with the designer of the Delft Wiki page from last year, so we can learn from his wisdom and bask in his glory.

We used the bacterial strain Micrococcus luteus which was generously donated from the chair of microbiology by Prof. Scherer`s group and is mentioned to be specifically sensitive to Erythromycin [ Wright et al., 2012 ]. Now several 6 mm filter paper  discs are placed on the bacterial lawn in adequate intervals and 8 µl of the spinned down reaction mixture is added onto one disc. The mixture diffuses from the filter paper into the agar. The concentration of the compound will be highest next to the disk, and will decrease with increasing distance. If the compound is effective against bacteria at a certain concentration, no colonies will grow where the concentration in the agar is greater than or equal to the effective concentration. This is called the zone of inhibition.

As negative controls there is one mixture containing no substrate or enzyme and two mixtures without the enzyme but with antibiotic, which were incubated for 0 minutes and 6 hours.
As expected the assay shows a gradually decreasing zone of inhibtion with increasing reaction time. In the first half hour the zone is more or less constant although the enzyme is constantly degrading the antibiotic. This can be explained by the fact that the mixture only diffuses a certain range into the agar and in the first few time steps of the reaction the concentration of the antibiotic within this range is above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) , so the bacteria is inhibited independently of the exact concentration. After 3 hours all Erythromycin was degraded so there is no zone of inhibition anymore. Also we can see that the antibiotic does not degrade by itself significantly over 6 hours since the zones of inhibition in both negative controls"

The main goal of our project is to employ affordable sensors that can detect level of gold in soil samples. Our target group was artisanal miners living in developing countries. To address the needs of our group, we investigated use of synthetic gold sensor circuits in order to provide an alternative prospecting tool and understand Malaria epidemiology. We researched soil levels and conditions to understand how current prospecting techniques are performed and means to employ our technology. We found that specificity of our device plays an important role as soil samples can contain variety of metal ions. In addition, since the gold concentration in soil samples can be low in the range of uM, we tested our circuits in concentrations less than 10uM. We performed a comparative functional assay to select the best circuit among BioBricks constructed and available in the registry. We selected BBa_K2048002 as it was highly specific to gold and showed minimum to no expression level in the presence of copper metal ions.
Additionally, we performed an analysis for resources available to artisanal miners and minimum amount of resources required to employ our technology. Due to low-setting resources presence in artisanal mining settings, we investigated use of a mobile lab and centralized community testing locations. Our analysis and interview conducted with experts in the field of malaria showed that centralized community testing locations are preferred for validated data analysis. In addition, we worked creating a cell-free testing platform that can be shipped to artisanal miners. Cell-free sensors are optimum for low resource settings as they do not require biological containment, activated with water and incubated with body heat.
In order to employ malaria diagnostics,  we conducted series of interviews with experts to understand root cause factors causing Malaria spread. Based on our research and discussions with experts, we optimized our tool to be cell-free paper based design, minimized the risk factors such as highly acidic and expensive reagents, and increased the sensitivity for gold at low concentration with visible output to enable functioning in low resource settings.

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"4M Sorbitol and cell wall degrading enzymes to obtain protoplasts, we got the idea of making tobacco protoplasts instead and keep the onion to the side.
We then tried incubating  a few pieces of a tobacco leafs (downside-down without their cuticle) in a culture plate with the same solution mentioned above. Looking at a sample of the solution after a few hours of incubation revealed burst protoplasts and other plant materials. the production of onion protoplast was tried again on glass slides and revealed no apparent degradation of the cell wall, it looked like the cells had shrunk.
After mostly getting burst or shrunk cells or protoplasts we decided to  look at the osmolarity. It was decided  to try out different concentrations of Mannitol in an MgM-MES buffer of PH 5. This time the onion cell sheets were treated the same way as the tobacco cells. both were put in a cell wall degrading enzyme solution in an MgM-MES buffer with different concentrations of Mannitol in a culture plate. We observed the solutions in a microscope after incubating the onion and tobacco cells for a couple of hours. This time we successfully produced protoplasts, both onion and tobacco. We decided from quantitative observations in the microscope to use 0.8M Mannitol for the onion cell sheets and 0.6M Mannitol for the tobacco leaves.

Bacteria preperation
We mostly followed the Hokkaido 2011 team's protocol in preparation of our bacteria. We incubated them overnight and induced them with IPTG and arabinose. the next day the bacteria were washed and resuspended, in the solution mentioned above(The solution differs in Osmolarity between onion cells and tobacco cells).  To check that our bacteria actually emit fluorescence we looked at them in a fluorescence microscope. In the microscope we saw clearly that our strains expressing Mcherry and GFP without a signal sequence gave of clear and bright fluorescence but our strains which contained the signal sequence showed much weaker fluorescence.
Leakiness characterization
1. Aim
The aim of this experiment was to examine if injectisome (T3SS)-bearing bacteria secrete proteins into the surrounding media without interaction with any target membrane. In other words we wanted to test if the E. coli expressing the injectisome was leaky and whether the leakiness was affected by presence of the reporter signal and/or co-expression of chaperones. In order to do this we needed to ensure that the signal tagged reporter protein was"

A lineage model
Aiming to obtain a better description, we studied plasmid levels in a lineage from a single cell.
As tracking bacteria and their plasmid levels is an important issue, we implemented a tree plot in our code using a matlab package .  Plasmids were given to each daughter cell following a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$
Figure 3. Plasmid dynamics over a lineage (I) As cells divide, they can suffer from variations in their number of copies of a plasmid, influencing the levels of daughter cells. Left picture shows the evolution in the levels of each plasmid (in different colors) and right picture is a lineage tree to track each cell.
Also we were able to track the plasmid levels of each bacteria at the time of their division.
Figure 4. Plasmid dynamics over a lineage (II) Variations of plasmid copy number in each lineage can be track using a lineage tree. Each tree shows the level of its associated plasmid.
The distribution at the beginning and at the end of the simulation is:
Figure 5. Heat maps of time evolution of plasmid distribution in a lineage Here we show the distributions of the plasmid levels in a lineage for the first 500 simulations (left picture) and the last 500 simulations (right picture), from a single cell with the initial conditions $P_1 = P_2 = 75$. Notice the  broadening of the distribution with the lineage growth.
Comparing with a distribution of orthogonal plasmids, we find that while both are symmetric (respect to the $P_1 = P_2$ line),  non orthogonal plasmids lead to broader heat maps.
Figure 6. Plasmid distribution in a system with no influence between different plasmids When each plasmid represses itself, the distribution gets narrower and the time-dependent evolution is lost.
A step beyond: Resistance
As a proof of concept, we modelled the bacterial time of division as a function of both plasmids, being minimal when both plasmid levels are similar. For this simple regulation, we obtained that the average level of plasmids in a population is the same for each DNA molecule.

We discuss with the senior, Hai-Xuan Chen. He is the PhD student from the lab of Prof. Liang-Ming Huang in the department of Environmental Engineering. His research is about biological modeling.
We chose Multi-fuel pure oxygen combustion reduction and Advanced                                                 carbon capture combustion technology which have closely related to our                                                 project. Interestingly, we found that in such business matchmaking                                                 conference involved in many vendors, most of them focused more on what                                                 benefit they create rather than the detailed technology process.
Our discussion is about biological modeling. At first, we have to collect the experiment data, so that we can build the model from our experiment. After that, we improve our parameter of model to make our modeling more accurate. In this way, we can operate our model before we start doing our experiment.
After discussion, we have to consider more possible pathways"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," MLA layer (Nam et al., 2013)
Based on the figure it appears that as a consequence of the differences in refractive index between the media and the lens, the light is concentrated on the focal plane. The MLA has multiple advantages in this way. First of all, it redirects the incident solar light toward interfinger regions and away from the mirror-like electrodes. Secondly, it redistributes the refractive light under the gridline areas. Furthermore, it provides a micro-concentration effect to facilitate photo-induced exciton generation and finally it protects the cell from harsh environmental conditions after being fully packaged (Nam et al., 2013) .
The efficiency of this setup have been tested and is compared to solar panels with a regular encapsulation layer. Based on published experimental results it appears that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar panels is almost 20% higher for the solar panels with MLA than for the solar panels without MLA encapsulation layer (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Efficiency measurements of different solar cell setups. (Nam et al., 2013)
Based on the published results it appears that the use of MLA as encapsulation layer is a successful way to improve the efficiency of solar panels. In this case so called GaAs-based solar cells are used.
In a comparable research project, the researchers have proved that the efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells can be increased with 50%. In their research they have used microlens arrays with spherical lenses. However, they have mentioned that this is not necessarily the optimal lens-shape and also the optimal array shape could be different (Jutteau et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is not surprising that research is done into the influence of the shape of the microlens arrays. Researchers have figured out that a curved microlens array can even improve the efficiency with more than 100% compared to ‘normal’ flat microlens arrays (Figure 4) (Xie et al., 2015) .
Figure 4: A curved microlens array (Xie et al., 2015)
The biologically produced microlens will be much smaller than the microlenses used in the aforementioned research. This will benefit the efficiency. However, it is expected that the optical properties of the biological microlenses will be different compared to regular microlenses. As conservative estimate, we hypothesize that the increase in efficiency with the biologically produced microlens is 20%. This efficiency increase we consider, without taking unnecessary risks or too much optimism, at least viable.

After successfully transforming these plasmids into competent E. coli NEB5alpha cells we then performed a diagnostic digest and gel electrophoresis experiment to ascertain that these plasmids contained the gene we expected.  Each plasmid was digested using two restriction enzymes chosen to digest DNA as specific points on the plasmids and create fragments of known length which we could then confirm using gel electrophoresis.

We began our project by identifying a range of BioBrick parts present in the iGEM 2014 distribution kit which we required as part of our cloning strategy.  These parts primarily consisted of both constituitive and inducible promoter systems with ribosome binding sites which we could then use in conjunction with our azo-reductase BioBricks to assemble a functional azo dye degrading gene.  We also decided that we would use the Red Florescent Protein expresing BioBrick as a control for any further transformation experiments.   As the level of DNA present within each plate of the distribution kit is insufficient to perform digest and ligation reactions on it was necessary to transform each of these plasmids into our NEB5alpha competent cells.  After growing our transformed cells overnight we then mini-prepped each of them to obtain BioBrick plasmids at suitable concentrations for future experiments.

A mini-game of “How to build your own MFC” was also introduced to test the public’s understanding of our project after our thorough demonstration and explanations using posters and real models.
Poster shown in the exhibition:
Other than public education on synthetic biology and MFC as a renewable energy, this exhibition also serves the purpose of initiating discussions and collect opinions through our survey on concerns that the public has when choosing renewable energy. Results from this survey will be used for the team to prioritize the area of focus for our MFC improvement.
When designing our survey, we have considered the fact that most of the public involved in the survey do not have the same level of knowledge of renewable energy. Therefore, our survey is designed such that it includes,
A short video in both Chinese and English to provide the public with the basic knowledge on how each renewable energy (wind energy, solar energy, and bioenergy) available in Hong Kong functions and each of their limitations.

Pre and post video questions set based on 4 major groups of concerns:
Environmental damage
Impacts on human health
Production constraints
Cost to society
The pre video questions take on the assumption that the public has little or no knowledge to how each renewable energy functions. The question of concern only identifies the broad issues on whether the public value environment, health, production, or society the most.
Post video questions listed out the mentioned limitations of each renewable energy and ask specifically how the public values each limitation. These questions will trigger the inner thoughts for the public to identify the areas they concern when choosing energy. This should be done before they choose a specific type on energy. This part of the survey would allow us to select an area of focus when modifying our MFC since we cannot modify every aspect of the project due to the time constraints and financing.
If the pre and post video answers are different when grouped to our identified grouping in section 2, the answers might suggest the need for education before we implement a new kind of renewable energy, especially for MFC when it requires engineered microorganisms. The differences might also be due to the fact that there are views to the issues that they did not consider.
The final question on the actual type of energy should tell us which kind of energy would the public prefer and, therefore, allow us to estimate how acceptable is using MFC as one of the energy source in Hong Kong.

These assays confirm that the presence of the plasmid containing the BsDyP sequence has no detrimental effect on DH5α growth, as it is always comparable to or higher than the plasmid-free control. This means that the BsDyP BioBrick BBa_K1336003 would be fully compatible with successful DH5α growth in industrial, highly azo-dye contaminated environments.
The next step was to investigate the functionality of the Azo-degradation device BBa_K1336007 , composed of BsDyP BBa_K1336003 plus the IPTG-inducble BBa_K314103 expression cassette, in decolourising several Azo-dye contaminated waste-waters. This was carried out by growing the BBa_K1336007 containing cells over-night, allowing them to reach stationary phase while already expressing the part, to then inoculate the dyes at the different concentrations. The differences in absorbance between plasmid-containing samples and plasmid-free was measured by OD at the corresponding maximum absorptions for each dye. The full protocol can be found here .
The first 24 hours of incubation at 37ºC shaking showed subtle decolourisation. This is represented in the graphs below. RB5 at its highest concentration (0.5 mg/mL) seems to present the most significant drop in absorbance 6 hours of inoculation of the dyes. The decolourisation obtained is not as high as expected, possibly due to non ideal temperature for the activity of this particular enzyme.

SUSTech Ear Care Campaign
In addition to student population, we thought our project must be known by a wider range of people. Besides, to make our “Sound Visualization” closer to life, we hope to make our effort turned into actual therapy idea or new way to modify genetic structure in response to mechanical stress or sound. We start to concentrate on those who have problems with hearing, not only limited to those with damaged hair cells in ear or other components of ear, but also all of the people with hearing loss in different extents.
We designed a questionnaire on the Internet (link: https://sojump.com/jq/9947898.aspx ) to collect information about the understanding and care about hearing-impaired people, and to find a way that can help them in the most comprehensive and effective way. Meanwhile, we included introduction about iGEM and the basic status of those people and we called for attention to care about them at the beginning of the questionnaire.
To minimize the acquired hearing impairment caused by noise and electronic equipment, we also designed a brochure named “Shape and Sound”. We printed more than 500 pieces and handed out on our campus as well as several residential communities. In the 6-pages brochure, we introduced the mechanism of hearing forming and the status of hearing-impaired people around the world. We called for concerns about them and also gave several tips for ear caring in daily life in order to reduce chronic hearing loss, which is popular nowadays but draws little attention actually for time course.
Booklets “Shape and Sound” designed by ourselves independently. We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

Our project this year aims to make the strains with target genes grow faster than those who don’t. Therefore, quantitative data is a must in order to confirm the difference between experiment strain and the control strain. Moreover, since the final part may consist of many kinds of transcription switches, these regulatory parts themselves need to be tested as well. In order to finish these tasks, we’ve held a huge amount of quantitative experiments this year, most of them were done with the help of a plate reader or a flow cytometer.
The experiments briefly described below were all based on our design of the gene circuits. See our designs .
First of all, we want to test the function of our growth-promoting factor (glucose dehydrogenase, GDH). We want to verify if the gene can increase the K value of the population as well as if the gene has the ability to keep the target genes we actually need. We carried out some delicate experiments and effectively dealt with the numbers. For more information, click here:  Link to Result:Specific gene circuit module 1
As for the verifying experiments of the regulatory parts, all of the regulatory proteins were connected downstream of a lac-inducible promoter and florescence proteins were used as an “effector” through all the related experiments. We know that there may be various problems when carrying out the tests, thus every move had been carefully designed and strictly obeyed. We also applied some useful methods dealing with our data to get a more reliable outcome.

Finally, we want to validate the function of the combined vector and further demonstrate our work. We need to figure out a relationship between the expression level and the growth-promoting effect. We also want to compare our engineered strain with those strains containing antibiotic resistance genes. Various experiments were held"

As we know, collaboration is another way to improve ourselves, and we are very pleased to show our thought, operation and plan in the future to visitors from other teams.
Meetups in Peking University
We were invited to a meetup with PKU and OUC in August. We discussed some significant problems that we faced and shared the experience of being an iGEMer. For example, OUC iGEM team coming from Qingdao in Shandong Provence, China, gave us a presentation of algae utilization. Not only they raised a perfect project to deal with algae blooms around Qingdao sea area, but also abstracted polysaccharides ingredient from algae.
Cooperation in BCU
BCU has tidy labs and good equipment. Teachers and students of BCU gave us strong encouragement. More importantly, we has the history working together for several years. This year we continue teamwork with them. Meanwhile, we communicated widely. Industry, research and sustainable development of Synbio were discussed in these conferences. It made us to think more about what our project means to Synbio and its future expectations. Because our project is divided into several parts, many students in BCU help us to finish the synthesis of plasmid so that they relieve our heavy burden. So I am here, feel very grateful to my friends from BCU.

Utah_State,2014,Team:Utah State#Results#IBP_-_-_TEXT.html," Functionalizing the bioplastics with these enzymes could allow for various applications of the enzymes, including reusable use with laundry detergents.
As mentioned previously, PHB can be produced via a three enzymatic pathway converting acetyl-CoA to PHB in E. coli. Three genes code for beta-ketothiolase (phaA), acetoacetyl-CoA Reductase (phaB), and PHA polymerase (phaC, or PHA synthase) (Agnew et al. 2013). These genes are currently in the Biobrick Registry of Standard Biological Parts and were available in the 2013 distribution kit( BBa_K934001 ). An interesting characteristic of PhaC is that as the PHB polymer is being synthesized the PhaC remains covalently attached to the PHB granule. PhaC helps in formation of a amphipathic molecule with  hydrophilic (polar) and hydrophobic (non-polar) ends (Rehm 2009).  Since the PHA synthase remains attached to the bioplastic granule, creating fusions of PhaC with chlorophyllase, cellulase, and amylase will allow for the creation of functionalized bioplastic
Figure 3. Typical PHB granule and attached proteins. PhaC and Phasin can be found on the surface of a PHB granule (adapted from: Rehm 2010).
To test the feasibility of the system, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker. Using a synthetic biological approach, we wanted to determine if by genetically fusing GFP to PhaC we could generate bioplastics containing GFP activity (and thus potentially activity of our detergent enzymes). This fusion construct is designated as BBa_K1418061 . The schematic for this genetic design and general concept are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Schematic for functionalization of PHB granules. PhaC remains covalently bound to the PHB granule after polymerization and GFP can be fused to the N-terminal of PhaC, thus functionalizing the PHB granule. Direct production of PHB with the phaABC operon and expression of the GFP-PhaC fusion protein are both under lactose control.
To test for GFP functionalized bioplastic granules, E. coli cells containing BBa_K1418061 were grown for 24 hrs in the presence of IPTG for induction of the Lac promoter.  Cells were then visualized with a fluorescent microscope for GFP"

This week also the first try of the fluorescence assay for the characterization biobrick parts BBa_K1670002 (cepR) along with BBa_K1670003 (PaidA_mRFP) and BBa_K1670005 (esaR) along with BBa_K1670001 (PesaRC_cfp) was performed according to our protocol with HSL concentrations ranging from 0.01 mM to 100 nM. Already at very low C8-HSL concentrations all samples containing BBa_K1670003 (PaidA_mRFP) and at low concentrations of 3OC6-HSL samples containing BBa_K1670001 (PesaRC_cfp) showed high fluorescence emission. That might indicate, that the added HSL were diluted in wrong way and thus the experiment will be repeated next week. Once again E.coli BL 21 pSB3C5_J04421 induced with 0.1 mM IPTG showed hardly any fluorescence at 476 nm confirming the result of the SDS-PAGE.
This week we miniprepped six overnight cultures of mutated AADC in DH5-alpha competent cells. Miniprepped plasmids were then digested with BamHI-HF and NotI-HF (in order to excise the gene from pET-28a) as well as PstI (to determine whether the mutation had worked and the restriction site had been removed). Unmutated AADC was also digested as a control. Digestions were analysed via gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) and sample 1 was chosen to be sent off for sequencing to confirm mutation.

Hi everybody! I am Juan Luis recently biology sciences graduated. I choose to study biology because it is a big studying area. By the time I realized that I prefer subjects related to molecular biology and biochemistry. The first time that I listened to talk about IGEM was through Joaquina Delas Vives who participated in IGEM Valencia/team 2008. Since then I wanted to participate because it is a great opportunity to prove your knowledge and creativity. See you in Amsterdam!

Hi! I am a student of marine sciences and I like to learn new things and to work in the lab.
My university gave me the opportunity to join the iGEM team and I did because I considered that as a great opportunity. And now, as I am working with the team I am enjoying it a lot.
But my summer has not only consisted on working with the team. I also like diving, travelling and reading. See you in Amsterdam!

Hi world!! I´m a recently graduated biologist and I love everything related to DNA and its regulation mechanisms, so I would like to specialize myself in molecular biology and statistics.
I decided to participate in iGEM to get involved in research. Synthetic Biology is a very exciting new field in Biology and I´m very happy I had the opportunity to learn and take part of it.
Outside the lab I´m a passionate of Bellydancing and dancing in general :)! We see us in Amsterdam!

Overview of Human Practices

A Proposed New Standard for iGEM Human Practices: The IRB Approved Survey
Traditionally, iGEM Human Practice efforts have fallen under 3 realms:
An Essay on Bioethics & Synthetic Biology (e.g. HP award in Indiana)
A tutorial or seminar for Students (e.g. 2011 Americas Regional Jamboree Winners Team University of Washington)
A survey for other iGEM team members or students.
Another trend of human practices projects in iGEM is that these projects tend to focus on the field of synthetic biology as a whole. While knowledge generated from such efforts are useful and interesting, they do not specifically address the difficulty specific iGEM projects might face once they are being applied in the real world. In other words, many human practices projects are only loosely tied to the iGEM projects they belong to.
The 2011 Johns Hopkins iGEM team has taken steps to address these problems. First, we have crafted a Human Practices survey that has successfully passed through the the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the standard regulatory body for human subjects research.  Second, the focus of the survey has been geared towards the actualization of the team’s VitaYeast project. The survey was constructed in such a way that would allow the team to find potential difficulties VitaYeast may face, should it ever reach the mass market. The outcome is a growing collection of real and eventually publishable data about VitaBread collected under the banner of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

In the genetic Flip-Flop, the amount of LacI to set ON the memory is induced by an UV-sensitive trigger. To test the lexA operator functionality, we assembled the BBa_K079050 construct (Figure 6).
Figure 6. K079050 GFP reporter protein under the control of the J23100 constitutive promoter and LexA 2 operator
Since we have not success with UV induction, we tested the correct functionality of K079050 by hydrogen peroxide induction. As it can be seen in Figure 7a, the presence of the lexA operator 2 repressed the GFP synthesis. As expected, the hydrogen peroxide, when added, inhibited the lexA repressor activity and induced GFP synthesis.
Figure 7a. K079050 without H2O2
Figure 7b. K079050 with H2O2
Our results on the use of operator sequences, as independent parts in the assembling of regulated promoters, are still preliminary. However, we are confident that these parts can give a fine-tuning of promoter sensitivity to the repressor allowing the rational design of regulation promoters for Synthetic Biology.

Collaboration with other iGEM 2008 Teams
After the last year competition, at the beginning of the 2008, we decided to get a new team started for iGEM2008 competition. In April, we got in contact with Prof. Paolo Magni, who wanted to start a new team in Pavia for iGEM2008. So, in order to share experiences and ideas about iGEM, and to show him  what kind of wet lab resources are necessary to develop a Synthetic Biology project, we met at the Cellular and Molecular Engineering Laboratory  of the University of Bologna- Cesena Campus. After this first meeting, there have been other chances to meet during the summer. In particular, several conference calls were organized and two meetings were scheduled in Pisa and Bressanone (Italy). It was fundamental to compare lab protocols and techniques to help each other avoiding mistakes and speeding up project progress. The main topics of our discussion were the optimization of plasmid resuspension"

Design Notes
The LVA tag was removed because this part's intended purpose, harvesting from cells and purification, required the protein to have a long lifespan. 6-his tag was added to the C-terminus to avoid isolation of incompletely translated peptides during Ni-affinity purification.

The original Tat a.a. sequence comes from the Tat protein in human immunodeficiency virus but does not possess any innately pathogenic features. Bsl2 safety precautions are generally recommended for Tat-fusion proteins, although Tat DNA can be manipulated without special protocols.
Design Notes
The RFC25 fusion assembly format was used because this protein domain is intended to be fused to other proteins to convey its membrane-crossing characteristics. N terminal and/or C terminal addition of the Tat domain have both been shown to be effective.

Tuebingen,2017,Team:Tuebingen#Results#Testing_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. This is called a zone of inhibition which depends on the antibiotic activity, the diffusion rate and the solubility of the substance investigated. E.coli are not the perfect chassis for aminocoumarin based antibiotic assays because they have an outer membrane protein, named TolC, which exports aminocoumarins. The lab of Dr. Gust provided us a TolC-defective E.coli strain to circumvent this problem.
Procedure
After transforming TolC-defective E.coli and likewise XL1blue, a colony was picked respectively and used to inoculate 5 mL of LB with selection antibiotics and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next morning 500 µL of the preculture was used to inoculate 5 mL of selection media and grown to an OD600 of ~0.6-0.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 µL LB without antibiotics. LB-agar was cooked and cooled down until it was hand warm. Bacteria and L-rhamnose were added and the bacteria-containing agar was poured into petri dishes. Wafers (diameter 6 mm, paper, autoclaved) were laid on the solidified LB-agar and 10 µL of an antibiotic stock solution was pipetted onto it. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C and pictures were taken the following morning.
Results
In order to find a suitable concentration of clorobiocin (small amount, measureable) for our test-system we performed a dilution series of clorobiocin using carbenicillin as a positive control and the respective solvents (MeOH, H2O) as negative control.  The radius of the zone of inhibition (z.o.i.) was measured and plotted against the concentration and linear fitted. All measurements were taken as duplicates.
Figure 1: Test results of the clorobiocin dilution series in TolC, XL1blue and C.glutamicum (data from team franconia).
From this experiment we concluded our working concentration of clorobiocin (10µg/µL) for the establishment of the constructs explained in the introduction. iGEM Team Franconia 2017 did exactly the same experiment with Corynebacterium glutamicum, which seems to be very sensitive to clorobiocin.
Our two genes, β-Lactamase and GyrB, are under control of L-rhamnose and L-arabinose dependent promoters respectively. In"

Figure 7.5: structure Nootkatol
The alcohol dehydrogenase from Pichia pastoris subsequently converts nootkatol into nootkatone by oxidation. It uses NAD+ as a cofactor which is reduced in the reaction. The regeneration of this cofactor is facilitated by the BM3, which oxidizes NADH Schulz et al. (2015) .
Figure 7.6: ADH lvl.1 PTS1 plasmid
Figure 7.7: structure Nootkatone
The first milestone to achieve our goal is the separate integration of each of our three enzymes ValS, BM3 and ADH into level 1 vectors (Dueber Toolbox) in yeast and to verify their expression by Western Blot analysis. Therefore, a 3xFlag/6xHis-tag was added to the N-terminus of each of the proteins.  It enables us to use an anti-His antibody followed by an anti-mouse-antibody to make protein abundances visible. Subsequently, the two enzymes ADH and ValS were combined in a  level 2 cassette plasmid.  BM3 is designed as a level 1 plasmid and will be co-expressed with the level 2 plasmid to achieve a nootkatone production. The expression of the enzymes in the cytoplasm is again verified by Western Blot analysis.   The further approach aims to provide the enzymes with C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signals type one, which finally converts the nootkatone pathway into our artificial compartment.
Since the production of nootkatone does not lead to a change of colour we need to apply different methods for verifying substrates. Once we succeed with the qualitative validation via Western Blot analysis, we can verify the presence of nootkatone by using high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively.
Model influence on Nootkatone expression
We modeled the nootkatone biosynthesis pathway using ordinary differential equations in order to optimize nootkatone production. We found two hard and an easy problem, all of which we could find a solution for. The easy problem is optimization of the enzyme concentrations of the biosynthesis pathway. According to our model of the Nootkatone pathway we found that overexpression of Valencene Synthase is necessary to maximize the Nootkat"

V) Results
We ran into several problems while doing the titer. After we had completed the titer, we found out that the pipet tips we had used were contaminated. When preparing the top agar, we had to melt it in the microwave which caused it to boil over. This also caused a lot of condensation in the plates and caused the auger to crack. This could have caused some contamination. While filling our -5 plate with top agar, there was only enough to put in 4mL of agar instead of the 5mL that was called for in our procedure.
None of the plates had any phage. There was just a lawn of bacteria growing. This could either be because of the problems mentioned above or because the source of T3 was bad. Seeing as nobody else was able to grow any phage we believe that the source was either old or we need a new lab technique.

Hannah Arendt: We explained with the work of this philosopher why iGEM (and as a consequence our team) would like to make contact with the general public.
Debate: we organised a debate on ethical issues surrounding synthetic biology in a way which is accessible to students, academics, but also non-scientists.
The end user: We involved the end-users (farmers) in our project. By interviewing both farmers and the general public, and in this way, having direct contact with them, our project improves already in early stages.
Education: Our goal was to spark the interest of high school students interested in science to tell them more about our project and the applications of synthetic biology.  We designed our own 3D-bacterial model and our own 'BioBricks' out of plexiglas.
Symposium: We organised a symposium with two scientific lectures by professor Robben and professor Verstrepen and two iGEM-project presentations. We are glad that the iGEM-team of Groningen came to Leuven to give a presentation about their project.
Press: After the symposium, we were contacted by several journalists who were interested in our project. We got two articles in one of the most popular newspaper of Flanders and Flore gave a great interview on Radio 2 (the biggest radio station in Flanders). After the European Jamboree, the Flemish Television Broadcast (VRT) was interested and we got an item in the news bulletin. Almost 2 million people saw us on television.

Protocols for the characterization of transcription initiation were based on the methods of Kelly et al., 2009 (1), but added rtPCR analysis to determine transcript copy number of the reporter mRNA.  We propose this methodology as a minimal measurement standard for promoters and other transcriptional parts.

Cell Growth
LB broth with an appropriate selective antibiotic was used in all cell growth experiments.
From streaked plates, three colonies were picked for each condition tested, and cells were cultured overnight (~12hrs) in liquid media.
All samples were diluted 100x in fresh LB (time = 0).
At time = 3hr, samples were collected for analysis of optical density, RNA purification, and RFP fluorescence.
mRNA
The QIAGEN RNAProtect and RNeasy protocols were followed for total RNA extraction, using 6 x 10^8 cells from each sample.  Purified RNA was eluted with 50uL DEPC-treated water, and absorbance at 260 and 280nm was used to determine RNA concentration and purity.
rtPCR analysis was performed by the Nucleic Acids Research Facility at VCU. NARF also designed and ordered primers and probes for their analysis.
The Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 was used as the reference for rtPCR analysis, and results were normalized to total RNA recovered for each sample.
Protein
To prepare cells for flow cytometer analysis for RFP fluorescence concentration, 0.5 mL of sample was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1.0 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS), for a 2x dilution.
Cells were analyzed on a BD FACScalibur flow cytometer kindly provided by Dr. John Ryan, stopping at 100,000 events or 45 seconds. Voltage settings were as follows:
FSC: E00
SSC: 350
FL-1: 474
FL-2: 550
FL-3: 750
The geometric mean of each sample was recorded and compared to that of the reference Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 .
E. coli NEB10beta cells growing on LB were used as a negative control.

Collaboration
Collaboration is the lifeblood of science! Our collaborations help us share information and improve our science. Sustainable practices can be not only a source of collaboration, but can improve the process of collaboration itself. Detailed within this Action Area are practices which can help you collaborate and form connections, while ensuring that the process of collaboration is as environmentally-friendly as possible.
#1: Share Space With Other Labs
Sharing space with other labs reduces the need for additional equipment such as freezers and incubators, as well as the lab facility's resource burden due to autoclaves and fume hoods. Coordinating between labs by implementing a structured, well-documented inventory also helps everyone stay organized. Additionally, sharing space in a lab facility streamlines division of lab maintenance duties and encourages collaboration between neighboring labs.
#2: Collaborate with Nearby Labs
BostonU is fortunate to work in the heart of Boston, where we are surrounded by labs at several different universities. Collaborating with nearby labs helps to drive our science forward! It's important to consider the environmental impacts of travelling to collaborate with other labs. Consider using public transit systems to reduce your impact when travelling - when BostonU collaborated with the Nair Lab at Tufts University, we took the subway! However, it's not always possible to use public transit or other environmentally-friendly options such as biking. For iGEM's Giant Jamboree, many teams are coming to Boston from all across the world, and will need to travel by plane. Once teams have arrived in Boston, they'll be able to use the MBTA public transit system to get around.
#3: Keep an Electronic Lab Notebook
Keeping an electronic lab notebook can be hugely beneficial for iGEM teams especially, as electronic lab notebooks allow multiple lab members to view and edit pages at the same time. Moreover, an electronic lab notebook eliminates paper waste and ensures that your lab notes are secure by keeping them backed up in the cloud. Electronic lab notebooks can be hosted on note-taking applications such as OneNote, or on lab software such as Benchling.
