Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.
Yang is a junior student majoring in Biology. He would show great earnest and passion when he is doing experiments. And he could do management very well.
When Chenmao joined our team, he was just a freshman, but he had got unique insights about GMO. Although his major is EE, he is no worse than us in doing biological research. Science fiction is always his dish.
Heng is an enthusiastic boy who comes from a beautiful coastal city. His favorite sport is badminton, and our instructor Yang often plays it with him. He believes life is movement.
Junjie Zong is a humorous and lively boy, crazy about sports and Japanese comics. He says he has an inexplicable crush on biological lab…(Do you?)
Yuwei has a very active and open characteristic, sometimes like a boy. However, when she does experiments, she could show great patience and  carefulness. She loves others' praise, so everybody follow me and speak aloud- You are the apple of my eye.
Xuan is the only person praised by Shoujie as handsome. He is very keen on basketball and almost his every WeChat' moment is about it. In our team, he is Ketong's good partner in molecular cloning.
Yuchen describes himself as a talker, however, in our mind he is a singer, though I never get a chance to appreciate his singing. He is in charge of molecular cloning, at the same time he studies English hard every day.  2
Bowen is a graceful girl who is admired by us for her fluent and native English. In her spare time, she loves watching movies and reading books. Christopher Nolan and Scientific American are her favorites.
Junjie Yu is a junior student majoring in Chemical Engineering. He said why he joined us was that Ketong let him consider biological experiments interesting. Now he is in charge of the project of plastic degradation and could do molecular cloning very well.
Haofeng would love to talk with people, creating fun of  dreary experiments. He loves racing with others on agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. In daily life, his hobby is basketball.
Jinxin once said his life was forever about  losing something, looking for it and waiting for others to send it back. He is in charge of molecular cloning now, and he just lost some base pairs as sequencing showed…

When I'm not sitting around in a lab, I can be found swimming laps in a nearby pool or catching up on some of the sleep I lost during wiki freeze from the last few years. One day I want to grow up and face the real world, but I will put that off as long as possible by going to grad school.

Taylor Remondini
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year with the iGEM Calgary team and I have been involved primarily with the ferritin , linker , and wiki design elements of the project. My main interest has been in testing the potential of chemically modified ferritin nano-particles as a reporter system for our project. Between working in the lab and harassing Keith about the design of the wiki you can find me on the golf course or ensuring that my car is spotless. Going into the future I am pursuing entrance into medical school to further my career. iGEM has been an invaluable experience for many of the trials I will face going forward with life.
Denny Hoang
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year in the iGEM team and I've largely played a role in the ferritin part of the team. I've been previously exposed in a lab involving environmental microbiology, thus this experience has given me the opportunity learn many different techniques and skills used in synthetic biology.  In my spare time I've enjoyed playing soldier, snowboarding and reading novels.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA sequences, restriction enzymes are then used to cut and stick the sequences and plasmids. These enzymes cut at specific sequences of DNA called restriction sites and allow us to stick our pieces of DNA together. iGEM specifies certain restriction sites at the start and end of DNA sequences so that any sequences can be cut and stuck together using only a few restriction enzymes. If the restriction enzyme sites were present within any of the DNA sequences (and not only within the prefixes and suffixes) then the restriction enzymes would cut within and mix up all the sequences, rendering them useless. Before using restriction enzymes, it is therefore crucial to check all of the DNA sequences for any disallowed restriction enzyme sites.
For example, the DNA sequence where the EcoRI restriction enzyme cuts is GAATTC. This sequence is present in the DNA sequence for the protein Dispersin B, meaning that EcoRI would cut within the coding sequence, leading to a shortened amino acid sequence and a non-functional protein. With this in mind, it is necessary to change the codon to alter the restriction site whilst at the same time ensuring that the same amino acid is coded for (a different amino acid means an incorrect protein). GAA codes for glutamic acid but so does GAG; thus by changing the third nucleotide from A to G, the final polypeptide sequence remains unchanged (glutamic acid is still coded for) but there is no longer an EcoRI restriction wite within the DspB coding sequence.
Once you have all the DNA sequences for everything you need, it's then time to assemble your constructs in a software like SnapGene. Together, the coding DNA sequences and the control elements make the constructs that need designing. For example, a part of our project looks at different ways of secreting anti-biofilm agents out of E. coli. If we're considering artilysin (one of the proteins we want to secrete), the construct needs to contain the DNA sequence for artilysin as well as a secretion signal (a tag that directs the protein to a secretion system), a histidine tag (enables us to purify the protein at a later stage) and start and stop sequences (enable the bacteria to know where to start reading the DNA and where to stop). We put all of these parts together in the right order so that the bacteria can understand what to make and how to make it. These constructs have to be madr for each individual component of the project. The DNA order can be made after ensuring that the constructs are suitable for DNA synthesis by a company such as IDT.
This is the stage"

Meaghan/Erin—hopefully tomorrow we’ll put promoters with gas vesicles and efflux system.
Steve/matt—digestion today, xba and spe might not be working. They’re testing them today. The only ones we know for sure work are ecoRI and pstI.
Tom/Amanda—pretty much starting over.
Tomorrow meeting with Dr. Rao at 2:00 at his office.  People who worked on fusion and ars primers should go.
Backbone—maybe the annealing temp is too low or the primers are contaminated.
Order RFC 10 primers.  Buy more plates. Buy more small pipette tips. Fill tips on weekend.
We need more e. Coli colony boil.

Backbone—Primer’s are working according to Francis’ work on Wednesday. Asked steve to get the ccdb strain, submit the order. Using this for cloning would be the easiest way to do this. Plasmid encodes ccdb toxin which kills the cell.
Need the resistant strain to grow up the plasmids, which are in the registry. Only the cells that have digested plasmid survive?
Amanda did PCR of backbones with negative controls, one without polymerase and one without template. There were bands in each lane…
Stationary phase promoter
Talk to professors about applications of our project, metal assays
Get grad students to check over fusion primers and arsR promoter primers.
Sandbox of parts registry—means they’re not submitted to the registry yet but allows documentation.
Digest PAL, ligate into plasmid.
SAP 20 min incubation at 37 to keep plasmid from re-ligating on itself. Same with Gol proteins.
After transformations, let it grow for 18 hours before we pick colonies. Don’t pick red colonies.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,". The lysogenic strain has a slightly longer lag phase but both strains reach the same maximum OD. The negative control contains no bacteria and shows that no contamination has occurred over the time-period. OD was measured every hour for 24 hours in biological triplicate.
Phage burst size
The phage burst size was calculated to determine the number of infectious phage particles produced from one bacterial cell during one infection cycle. A culture of C. difficile SBRC 078 was infected with phiSBRC to a MOI of 1 (infection titre of phage of 1.38 x 106 pfu/ml) and incubated for 15 minutes to allow phages to adsorb. The culture was washed of any unbound phages and then incubated under anaerobic conditions for 80 minutes. The number of phages in the supernatant was monitored. Figure 2 shows the number of phages present at various intervals over the period. It was observed that between 65 and 70 minutes and then 75 and 80 minutes the phage titre seemed to plateau slightly, indicating the end of the first burst cycle. It was determined by plaque assay that the final phage titre at the end of the first burst cycle was 4.2 x 106 pfu/ml and the number of unbound phages after the 15-minute incubation was 1.05 x 104 pfu/ml. These values were used to calculate burst size which was determined as 33 phage particles per cell. The burst size was a useful parameter for the phage model and allowed the number of phages over time in the model to be more accurately determined.
Figure 2: Determination of phage phiSBRC burst size. C. difficile SBRC 078 was infected with phiSBRC and the subsequent burst was measured over 80 minutes. The first burst cycle is deemed complete when the phage titre, measured in plaque forming units per ml, reaches a small plateau. The burst size was calculated and determined as 33 phage particles per cell.
Promoter library
GFP assay in E. coli
Our first objective was to quantify promoter strength in E. coli. To do this we synthesised each promoter upstream of wild type GFP [BBa_E0040] with the biobrick prefix/suffix flanking the part. The terminal restriction enzymes for the prefix and suffix were then used to clone the part into an empty pMTL84151 vector. pMTL84151 contains the ColE1 origin of replication for use in Gram-negative organisms as well as a Gram-positive origin"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 1991). Typical gene regulation mechanisms rely on up or down regulation of a promoter from a baseline expression, the fimbriae mechanism of ‘ALL’ or ‘NONE’ makes it a useful tool for synthetic biology applications.  While the FimB protein inverts the promoter back and forth between [ON] and [OFF] states the FimE protein permanently inverts the promoter from [ON] to [OFF].  This inversion can be used to amplify weak or inconsistent induction signals.
Since the part we are making is designed to amplify a weak signal which can then be detected by a downstream ‘reporter’ cell the quorum sensing system from P. aeruginosa was adapted to allow for signal transfer between cells.  The rhlI gene from P. aeruginosa produces the quorum sensing molecule N-butyryl-AHL (C4-AHL) (Parsek et al.,2000) ( J64718 ),  this molecule is membrane permeable and able to induce expression of a promoter upstream of sfGFP in another cell ( K2205015 ).
Figure 1: SBOL Visual of the switching mechanism of the Fim Switch, in the native [OFF] state the eforRED reporter is expressed (shown in red) allowing direct visualisation of the cells.  Following the inversion of the promoter region ( K1632004 ), eforRED expression is halted and the rhlI gene is expressed ( J64718 ), this is now the [ON] state.
Design Stage
To construct the Fim reporter switch 3 separate gBlocks were designed with overlapping adaptor regions homologous to the iGEM prefix and suffix to allow for Gibson assembly into the pSB1C3 backbone whilst retaining biobrick compatibility.  The individual genes and other components are shown in (Table 1).  The 1st gBlock sequence starts with a RBS ( B0034 ) upstream of the fimE ORF ( K137007 ) with no promoter region, this is to allow for other promoters to be cloned in upstream of the part.  Downstream of the fimE gene is a double terminator ( B0015 ).  All RBS and terminator sequences used are B0034 and B0015 respectively.  The switching mechanism consists of the Fim promoter sequence ( K1632004 ) flanked by two RBS-ORF-Terminator sequences.  While in the native [OFF] state the Fim promoter drives expression of eforRed ( K592012 ) and when flipped to the [ON] state drives expression of r"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#development of new methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"aq PCR reaction with the template containing the unnatural bases was prepared with a total reaction volume of 250 μL. As primers, the standard iGEM sequencing primers VR and VF2 were used in the reaction.
Figure 17: PCR of DNA containing isoG/isoCm with GoTaq analyzed with iCG and M.A.X. A DNA template containing an unnatural base pair between isoG and isoCm was analyzed in an orthogonal approach with M.A.X. and iCG. (A) After PCR reaction and PCR cleanup, four separate restriction reactions were performed with the addition of either EciI, BsaI, SapI or no restriction enzyme. In the mentioned order, the amplified DNA contains a recognition sequence for these enzymes in case of a mutation of isoG to A, T and G. The reaction without restriction enzyme was used to control if a fragment of the expected size of 761 bp was amplified. (B) After PCR cleanup, the sample was sequenced with Oxford Nanopore sequencing and subsequently analyzed with the software suite iCG. A dot-plot showing the linear discriminants of each filtered read after base prediction is shown, as well as the numerical result of the base prediction and a plot showing the normalized signal traces at the position of interest.
The results of both analysis methods presented in Figure 17 reveal that the fidelity UBP replication is not perfect for this experimental setup. In the gel electrophoresis after the digestion with the enzymes of the M.A.X system, a distinct band is visible for the EciI digest, indicating that mutations of isoG to A were occurring during the PCR reaction. The analysis with Nanopore sequencing and iCG reveals a similar result, showing that approximately 54 % of the analyzed reads contained isoG at the position of interest, while 39 % were predicted to have an A at this position. Therefore, both methods reveal that the mutation of isoG to A is the most frequent mutational event leading to a loss of the unnatural base pair between isoG and isoCm, which is in accordance to our expectations and respective results in literature (Switzer et al., 1993, Johnson et al., 2004). Interestingly, the replication fidelity seems to be considerably lower compared to our first PCR experiments with the GoTaq polymerase. Possibly, the reason for this difference is due to the longer storage time of the DNA template at 4 ℃. It was shown that d-isoCTP is quite unstable even when stored at -20 ℃ (Sw"

Human Practice (Gold)
This year, we've done a lot of works on human practices with painstaking effort. In addition, we consider seriously and extensively whether our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. Therefore, we designed and carried out numerous human practices around our project, and we integrate a lot of human practices considerations into every part of our project. Besides, we also conduct public engagement and education activities to have conversations with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM.
Based on the silver human practice, we've integrated all of the advices and suggestions we've obtained from them into our project. See how we integrate our human practice in our project in this page

1. 2016 Chengdu International Conference of Gastroenterology
Before determining what we will do this year, we made many alternative plans, and one choice was using intestinal probiotics to cure human diseases. However, for the lack of relevant knowledge, we decided to learn more before we made the final choice.
On 4th December 2016, the Chengdu International Conference of Gastroenterology was holding by the Gastroenterology department of West China Hospital, Sichuan University in Chengdu. As the students of Sichuan University, we were very lucky to have a chance to take part in this conference.
During the meeting, the report Intestinal Flora, Host Metabolism and Related diseases made by Shen Xizhong, professor of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, attracted us a lot. Professor Shen gave a detailed introduction of the change of intestinal flora during the progress of host’s metabolism diseases and he mentioned some advance researches. What he introduced exactly was what we were interested in. Thus, we tried hard to gain a chance to communicate with him face to face, after the conference. We illuminated our project to him, which is using synthetic biology method to remold intestinal flora, and using these bacteria to metabolize some metabolite in the human body to cure some diseases. Professor Shen encouraged us, but he also pointed out some problems we need to take care of. Among those problems, microorganism colonization was what mentioned by"

We did our first yeast miniprep to test the effectiveness of our outlined miniprep procedures. The resulting Nanodrop curve was ragged and lacked the attributes of plasmid DNA. We tried again to miniprep yeast, this time washing the glass beads multiple times to get rid of residual isopropanol. The results were much better: a DNA curve. Still, there was an unknown source of salt contamination in the plasmid sample.

The supernatant was discarded and the pellet frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 4 °C. After collecting all samples of each time point, the pellet was re-suspended in 50 µl Laemmli-Buffer and heated at 95°C for 10 minutes. The samples were once again centrifuged and 2 µl of the supernatant was diluted with 10 µl Lämmli-Buffer. 6µl of each dilution was loaded on the SDS-PAGE, either stained via Coomassie solution or visualized in the Western Blot.
Results
During the planning phase two preparatory experiments were run to test the conditions for light induction: Please visit conditions testing to read more about the procedures and results.
The previous idea to set up a quick Flow Cytometry assay for screening LOV photocaging mutants had to be slightly adapted due to lack of time. However, to truly confirm protein splicing SDS-PAGE and Western Blot is the more reliable and definite method. We therefore present these results first.
PVDF membranes were analysed with hexahistidine-antibody. The western blot confirms the expression of all his-tagged constructs, i.e. the mRFP and sfGFP N- and C-terminal halves with their corresponding intein, mRFP and sfGFP coexpression, sfGFP_T65C positive control and the LOV-6 and -12 constructs. The mRFP positive controls are not visible on the anti-His6 blot as they do not include a his-tag.
Figure 4) sfGFP light induction - Western blot with anti-His6
Using the HIS - Antibody, no reconstitution could be observed
For superfolder GFP no intein splicing is shown (Figure 4). In the individually expressed as well as in the coexpressed samples the bands for sfGFPn-DnaXn and DnaXc-sfGFPc are clearly visible at ~23.5 kDa and 22 kDa, respectively. However, in the coexpressed splicing and coexpressed non-splicing samples no band at the expected size of ~27 kDa exists for sfGFP. The evaluation was complicated by the fact that native-sized superfolder GFP runs only little below the size of the N-terminal construct. An additional western blot was therefore performed with GFP antibody.

Safety Details for Project-Specific Experiments
We consulted PhD advisors during more specialised experiments or when we were using specialised equipment such as a glovebox. This minimised the risk of exposure to bacteria, injury and damage to equipment.
Cloning
A fumehood was used for making the plates/gels that were used, we changed our gloves accordingly after using this area of the laboratory.
Hydrogen assaying
Our electrochemical assays involved the use of methyl viologen, which is a toxic chemical. It is kept in the poisons cupboard away from the other standard reagents in the lab. Once it had been weighed out it was put in a screw top sample tube, this was then placed in a glove so that it could be easily located and safely moved to another room in the building.
When using the glovebox we ensured that we removed watches and rings etc. since these could tear the gloves and make the glovebox unusable.
The cells were earthed to a metal cage in the glovebox.
Collaboration with University of Kent
Our collaboration with university of Kent required us to take bacteria samples to their campus so that they could be imaged using atomic force microscopy. This meant that we had to consider the safety issues involved in taking bacteria into a public environment.
We ensured that the bacteria we used were non-modified strains so that there was no risk of introducing non-natural strains that could spread.
All samples were kept in sealed containers and were carried in a box that was sealed to prevent spillages or someone taking the top off easily.
Safety forms
As previously mentioned, in addition to the safety forms required for iGEM we read and signed the COSHH forms for the experiments that take place in the lab, including the ones that we may not be doing ourselves. These forms detail the safety protocols for the experiment and the action taken in the event of an accident.
Biohazards/spreading of bacteria & how we dealt with this
Shewanella and E. coli were the bacteria types used in our project. These are both biosafety level one organisms and as such we followed the protocols relating handling them (see above).
Use of the virtual reality headsets
Due to the highly immersive nature of the virtual reality software there were some safety precautions that needed to be in place when the headsets were used.
•Age limit - the headsets were not to be used by children under the age of 13
•People should be warned before using the headsets to stop immediately if they experience any dizziness or sickness
•People should be warned that using the headsets could"
Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Dominican Republic, we have been inspired to take action.
For example, Lambert iGEM presented the 2018 project in front of researchers working at Boehringer Ingelheim, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company. Members received significant feedback on our project, altering aspects of app development, outreach, and wet-lab. Researchers spoke to us about the practicality of our project and exposed us to the reality of working in the field.
Problem Lambert iGEM Strived to Tackle
884 million people lack access to clean water, and 3.4 million people die every year from water-borne diseases. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive, efficient water-borne disease detection mechanism.
Cholera takes the lives of approximately a million people annually. Due to their prevalence in developing nations such as Yemen, strategies are being employed to solve these critical issues; however, these methods are often ineffective and expensive. Cholera cases are concentrated in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene and in places suffering from economic instability; therefore, these pathogens are able to thrive. Without an effective solution, cholera cases will continue to claim millions of lives in the future. The 2018 Lambert iGEM team strives to develop a practical, yet efficient detection mechanism to ensure that these epidemics can not only be detected but prevented as well.
Project Goals
Construct an inexpensive and efficient detection tool-kit for pathogenic cholera
Develop and distribute alternatives for expensive lab equipment such as the Chrome-Q and 3D Fuge
Contribute to an open-source platform to advance the field of genetic engineering and disease detection
Create a software model through machine learning to predict the occurrence of cholera outbreaks
Educate and inform the public about the devastating effects caused by pathogenic cholera
Empower the next generation of scientists by planning a 3-day summer camp and by designing a girl scouts kit
Toehold Switches | Why?
A significant obstacle in diagnostics is lack of accessibility and practicality.  Toehold switches have been demonstrated to be effective in cell-free systems as biosensors.
Many developing nations lack a simple yet specific test to detect waterborne diseases such as cholera proactively rather than after infection has occurred. Toehold switches are biosensors that can activate gene expression in response to a specific RNA sequence.

Lambert iGEM created an interactive timeline to display the evolution of our project. This visual timeline will illustrate how the team integrated and implemented ideas advised by experts in the field. Please click on one of the circles below for more information.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Recombination_-_-_TEXT.html," four Cre molecules on the same plasmid, the Cre recombinase can catalyze a recombination reaction to         produce a recombined product (P). The reverse reaction also occurs.
This product can separate into two separate plasmids (P1, P2) whose Cre can bind and unbind from the lox sites in the         same manner as before
The knockout eﬃciency can be calculated as
.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In our model, we do not consider the other products that could form from Cre-lox recombination. In particular, two         original plasmids with 2 Cre at one lox site on each plasmid could theoretically recombine to make a joint plasmid         together based on the principle of Cre recombinase. However, this is less likely because the lox sites are located         much further apart than those on the same plasmid. Thus, in order to simplify our model and limit the number of species         to be considered, we do not consider them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the Recombination module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
4.1 Cre-lox Recombination
Fig. 1 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre tends towards 53.5 % after around 5000 seconds         (around 83 minutes). While this knockout eﬃciency is not particularly high, we will show in the population dynamics         model that, over time, it results in most of the plasmid eventually being those of the knocked out.
4.2 Cre-lox Recombination without Reverse Reaction
In our construct we use lox66 and lox71, which are mutants of loxp for which the forward reaction is highly preferred         over the reverse reaction because the product of recombination includes a mutant loxp which has a very low tendency         to recombine. Because we were unable to ﬁnd reaction constants for the reverse reactions of lox66 and lox71 in the         literature, we simply simulated a version of the model where the reverse reaction is ignored for reference.

Model constructions: from the modelling to the characterization
Have a look at our notebook .
Our project BacterioClock is based on an oscillating FIFO synchronized at the population level. To obtain and have preliminary results of this system we divided it in three ""little"" modules as the modeling team exposed them previously.
Contents
1 The First is to demonstrate the FIFO which constitutes our core system
2 Oscillating module
3 Synchronization module
4 The constructions we were able to obtain were characterised by fluorescence microscopy (see examples below):
5 Table of the constructions we realized
The First is to demonstrate the FIFO which constitutes our core system
A simple manner is to implement two class II promoter followed by fluorescent reporter genes like GFP in a bacteria strain that is able to produce the flagella.
By this way, we are able to see in single cell the order of the activation of pFliL then pFlgA then pFlhB and then the inactivation in the same order as a FIFO will do.
These constructions are equivalent to the experiments realized by Uri Alon in the article ""Using quantitative Blueprint to reprogram the Dynamics of the Flagella Gene Network"" Kalir S, Alon U. Cell 2004.
A better way to observe the FIFO is to study the system with an inducible regulator of class II gene in a bacteria strain deleted for this gene. We are extremely grateful for Alon U. that send us the inducible gene FlhDC, and FliA in pBad18 plasmid. These plasmids with our own araC/pBad-EnvZ* will allowed us to study the system in mutated strains that we have in our lab (ΔFlhD, ΔFliA, ΔFlgM, ΔEnvZ). By cotransforming in mutated strains the inducible regulators of the class II promoters with one of this promoter associated to a fluorescent protein, we could characterize the influence of the master regulators of the flagella on their promoter. The fluorescence is normalized to the OD600.
For example below are some constructions to see and induce the FIFO:
pFliL alone
3 promoters of the FIFO in one Cell
FIFO and oscillating constructions in a single cell due to the flhDC repression by EnvZ*.
To perform such a cotransformation we take care about the ORI of each"

The three element will always be present in an argument (while not always being explicitly presented) (Toulmin, 1958, s. 98-102) and three constituents that can be present and helps backing up the basic elements 1 (Toulmin, 1958, 104-111).
In this analysis we will be using the basic elements of practical argumentation in order to understand some of the most used arguments in the debate on Mars colonization.
The Basic elements of argumentation
Claim - The conclusion, e.g. ""We should colonize Mars""
Ground - The evidence for the conclusion, e.g. ""Mars is a good place to live""
Warrant - The movement from ground to claim, in this case ""Colonization should be done in places that are good to live at""
Practical argumentation in reality is messy - putting human interaction on form is a difficult task. We have chosen to do an analysis of the argumentation within this topic, despite the messiness, and we are therefore fully aware that there might be implicit arguments that we have missed. However if we miss them, there is a good chance that they will not be present in the minds of the average citizen.
The main arguments in the debate
The choosing of arguments in a world of rowdy deliberation is not easy either. We have done our best to find reliable popular scientific sources covering the topic and then cherry-picked what we perceived as the best arguments especially in terms of having most relevance for the general public.
Claim
Ground
Warrant
1: We should colonize Mars
One day the earth won't be livable
When planet earth is not livable, we need another planet
2: We should colonize Mars
It is the next step for humanity
We want to take humanity to the next step
3: We should not colonize Mars
It is too expensive
Economy should be a concern when making decisions
4: We should not colonize Mars
We have problems that needs to be fixed on our current planet
Finding solutions to current problems should be prioritized over expanding our territory.
1. The first argument is answering the claim ""We should colonize Mars"" with the ground ""One day the planet earth won't be livable"", and therefore has the warrant ""when planet earth is not livable, we need another planet"". The argument is concerned with homo sapiens long term survival as a species, which might become an increasingly relevant discussion as climate change threatens future generations. It is often explicited by Mars colonization front runners such as Elon Musk"
Hamburg,2015,Team:Hamburg#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", liquid cultures were grown overnight and plasmids were prepped.
Verification
Colony PCR
To be able to verify, if our E.coli actually carry our desired plasmid, a colony PCR was performed. Therefore an aliquot of the liquid culture was plated out again and grown overnight. Sixteen different colonies were tested using the standard sequencing primers. The results of six of these PCRs are shown in the following figure. The gel verifies that the E.coli are carrying our desired vector containing the miRNA2911.
Sequencing
Finally we verified our new Biobrick by sequencing.
constitutive promoter and miRNA (BBa_K1860702)
We combined the generated BioBrick (BBa_K1860700), containing the miRNA2911, with a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23102), that was provided with the Standard Distribution, by 3A-Assembly.  This is necessary to further on be able to test, if miRNA2911 is:
actually expressed
stable in E.coli and
how it is actually folded
Therefore we used the standard 3A-Assembly protocol. The constitutive promoter (BBa_J23102) was provided in pSB1A3, our constructed Biobrick (BBa_K1860700) is carried in pSB1C3, hence the assembly was performed into pSB1K3.
GroEL - heat-inducible promoter (BBa_K1860701)
Design of Oligos
GroEl is a heat-inducible promoter and we started by designing oligos of GroEL. The sequence was kindly provided by Prof. Ignatova. Just like for the design of the miRNA2911 here we also needed to reconsider that the desired sequence containing GroEL had to be in line with the iGEM standard. Hence also the GroEL promoter is flanked by the appropriate restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI).
Annealing of Oligos
In the next step, the oligos needed to be annealed. We used the standard ‘Annealing Protocol’ and the following figure depicts the results of this annealing. The appropriate bands of the resulted GroEL insert are at 91 bp.
Ligation
After confirmation of successful annealing we proceeded with the ligation of the insert (GroEL) into the standard backbone pSB1C3. For this purpose the linearized backbone (pSB1C3) was cut with EcoRI and PstI and the insert was ligated into the vector"

Cells were then placed back on ice for 30 seconds and 1 mL of SOC medium without antibiotics was added. Cells were grown for 1 hour in a 37 °C water bath. Finally, transformed cells were centrifuged for 1 minute at 4000 rpm, supernatant was discarded and cells were then re suspended in 100 μl of LB medium. 100 μl of cells were then plated on LB agar plates with their respective antibiotic, 100 μg/ml of ampicillin (for CIDAR ICE level 0, and level 2 Moclo assemblies), 50 μg/ml kanamycin (for level 1 Moclo assemblies), 35 ug/ml chloramphenicol (for level 0 gBlock/Moclo assemblies) and grown overnight (12-14 hours in a 37 °C incubator).
When transforming Moclo assemblies, in addition to the specified antibiotic, in order to allow for blue-white screening, LB agar plates were supplemented with iPTG and Xgal (0.1 mM and 40 μg/ml respectively).
Plasmid purification
Plasmid purification was carried out using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit.  Colonies were selected and used to inoculate 10 ml LB overnight cultures of transformed TOP10 cells throughout the project. Elution was performed according to the standard protocol except for the initial overnight culture (10 mL), the volume in which the DNA was eluted (30-40 µl of nuclease free water) and the incubation period in the spin column (5 min incubation).
DNA quality and quantity measurement
Purified plasmid DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 100 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were found to be between the Thermo Scientific suggested purity ranges (2.0-2.2 for 260/230 and 1.8-2.0 for 260/280 ratios).
Restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis
Restriction enzyme digestions were carried out following New England Biolabs suggested reaction. Using 200-300 ng of DNA, 5 units of enzyme, 1× recommended buffer, and nuclease free water to a total volume of 20 µl, for 1-1.5 hours, reactions were then incub"

About Our Project
Overview&Background
Overview
All levels of life make decisions sometimes, or rather frequently, about what to do in short term and long. Human beings make decisions through thinking, discussing and meetings. Cells don’t talk, they have no brain and don’t hold tea parties where they can gather and chat. Instead, they use chemical signals to communicate with each other, though intracellular network to “think”, and finally alter their expression profiles in response. The high complexity of intracellular signaling network enable cells to make correct decision in correct spatiotemporal condition, and that is crucial to many biological processes, i.e. stress response and metazoan morphogenesis.
Scientists have worked on this complicated intracellular signaling network for decades, and thanks to that, we now have unveiled many basic motifs that function as basic elements to construct complex network. By creating and combining elements, synthetic biologists have built several functional logic circuits. This summer, inspired by many splendid works in the area of biological circuit design, iGem team of Fudan University carried out a new design and tried hard to work it out. What we attempt to achieve is to create a circuit that can perform all different kinds of 16 Boolean calculation in mammalian cell to help it decide its fate in different drug-induce conditions.
 
Background
Logic circuit design takes a great part in synthetic biology research, attempting to construct convenient modular parts which are capable of performing boolean calculation even within a complex network.thanks to many advances both theoretically and technically, such as the discovery of TALE and invention of Gibson assembly,scientists have made many encouraging progresses recently. Driven by success in general circuit design, more and more scientists start to concern about how to apply general parts and circuits to specific problems, which is widely agreed to have a very promising future. Here we would like to first go through some of the fantastic and inspiring works published these years, to know more about cutting edges in the field of logic circuit design and application before setting up to design our own circuit.
 
Cutting-edge in circuit design
In the field of synthetic biology, we have discovered and constructed lots of information processing elements. By modify exist element"

We also met with the Deutsche Malaria GmbH and most importantly their managing director Dr. David Hutchinson, who started working as a clinician on tropical medicine in 1971. He suggested to use the S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight mosquitoes transmitting dengue virus as well as malaria. This led to further consideration to use the S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight other threats caused by insects. Apart from mosquitoes we could target different vermins through modulation of the S.H.I.E.L.D.
We sought to gain insights from malaria and mosquito experts from malaria risk regions in which the S.H.I.E.L.D. would be used. Working in Hamburg, Germany, we could not guarantee to not miss details and technical requirements that apply in malaria risk regions in warmer climates, and environments we are not used to.
We interviewed multiple experts from Uganda and Tanzania, countries in which malaria still threatens many people despite significant efforts towards malaria elimination. With the help of iGEM Makerere, we reached out to local experts with different professional backgrounds to get an assessment of the feasibility of our project in Africa. We designed an open questionnaire for them, answering both specific questions and leaving room for advice they would like to give us moving forward with our project. From their answers we gained valuable insights on characteristics important for both the technological feasibility, and the social acceptance for people working and living with the S.H.I.E.L.D.
First and most importantly, it is beneficial to use long-maintenance devices for malaria prevention. Many preventive measures against malaria are not maintained properly due to the financial strain this puts on the population. Once placed, our self-sustaining trap would minimize this problem as well as problems caused by lacking infrastructure in rural areas. Beyond that, the main problem for people living in affected areas is that using repellents, insecticides or other precautionary methods like bed nets has an great impact of their daily life. Since people are inconvenienced by some of the necessary precautions compliance with them is oftentimes problematic. While we strongly encourage the continued use of bed nets and other available safety measures, with the S.H.I.E.L.D. we aim to provide an additional appliance that will place no further strain on the people’s comfort.

The medium for another co-transformation was made, but one of the required ingredients for the medium didn't solve. Therefore we had to make this type of medium again by another method. We picked colonies from the yeast plates and made 5ml O/N cultures and a 5 ml InvSC1 with R-GECO preculture. Unfortunately, we had to deal with some small disturbances this week. The fire alarm went off, so we had to leave the building for fifteen minutes, we spilled some yeast in the incubator, so we had to clean up for another fifteen minutes, and so on...
Our device
We tested the device, which seemed to work technically. Little bubbles occurred in the medium after activating the device. But still no fluorescent light is visible.
Bachelor thesis
Since the government of the Netherlands suddenly decided that all Dutch students need to finish their Bachelor in four years (otherwise you have to pay 3000 euros), one of our team members is slightly stressed out for finishing her thesis on the iGEM model. Luckily, her little brother was there for some support.

USNA visit to the Pentagon
The team was extremely fortunate to meet at the Pentagon with representatives of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), as well as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in Washington, D.C. There they gave a short presentation about the danger of conotoxin, as well as our efforts to combat the danger. Additionally, we conducted our work at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with funding from DTRA. These organizations ensured we kept our focus on the defensive, medical nature of our project. In coming years we hope to test the effectiveness of the sense and respond mechanism in E. coli in the lab with actual conotoxin. The extreme toxicity of conotoxin makes testing hazardous, however our unique relationship with NRL allows us access to resources which reduce the danger sufficiently in order to conduct future lab testing. As we integrate our sense and respond mechanism into a simulated human microbiome, we hope to predict the effectiveness of the sense and respond mechanism in the human environment."

Outreach
- We dramatically increased awareness and visibility of iGEM and synthetic biology on UVA Grounds as part of recruitment over the past year, attending as a group or running informational tables at events related to bioethics, engineering, and synthetic biology.
- We organized and helped lead a Flash Seminar on Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology with a member of the Presidential Bioethics Commission. Flash Seminars are one-time student-organized “learning flash mobs” open to undergraduate and graduate students, community members, and faculty, during which people from diverse backgrounds can meet and discuss topics of interest ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/20/AR2011022002666.html ).
Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology
Led by Bioethics, Philosophy, and Public Health Professor John Arras
Two years ago, the J. Craig Venter Institute announced that it had created the world's first self-replicating synthetic genome in a bacterial cell of a different species. The discovery prompted many people to consider the benefits and drawbacks of the emerging field of synthetic biology. While new innovations present opportunities for progress in clean energy products, pollution control, affordable food, vaccines and other medicines, they also introduce harmful risks to humans and communities. This seminar will focus on the safety and security issues posed by the new technology and discuss some of the future-oriented concerns involved with human enhancement.

Introduction
The emerging field of synthetic biology generally aims to make biology easier to  engineer by adapting engineering methodologies to biological systems (Endy, 2005). It promises  to produce fundamental advancements in fields ranging from biomedicine to energy, but is also  rife with concerns regarding ethics, safety, and governance.
Synthetic biology also spotlights issues of intellectual property, sharing, and innovation"

Throughout the Worm Buster project we have at many times felt the need for assistance or input on different parts of our project. Without those small but immensely meaningful things our project would never had gotten this far and in the worse case never been possible at all. Therefore we would like to express our gratitude to all the people that supported us throughout the project.
Project Support and Advice
Margareta Krabbe, Senior Lecturer at Uppsala University: Margareta is our primary PI, our course co-director and our closest university contact. We can easily say that this project could not have been possible without her help and guidance. She has taken care of administrative parts like booking of lecture halls, labs and getting us a iGEM-hub on campus. She has always listened to our needs and has strongly contributed in creating a good working environment for the team. We also want to thank her for the work she’s done together with our Human practice group regarding the Symposium.
Anthony Forster, Professor at Uppsala University: Anthony is our course co-director and have given us support at all situations, both in the lab and some subgroups. He has kindly offered his expertise and provided us with valuable contacts and materials, such as cells and reagents, throughout the project. We are very grateful to have such an experienced professor within the field of synthetic biology to support us.
Alice Anlind, Research engineer at Vidilab: Alice has kindly given us advice throughout our project. She has not only introduced us to the common problem of poor diagnostic tools applied to detect parasitic infections in horses, she has along with Bitte Ljungström and Sara Ljungström also been able to support us by letting us borrow some reagents from the lab at Vidilab. In addition Alice has been very helpful by running our samples through Vidilabs’ minION device that we couldn’t get ourselves. In conclusion, without Alice the Worm Buster project would never have happened and we"

iGEM Grenoble team:
We helped Jerome and Nadia improve their safety sheet proposal for the parts registry, considering the content, layout, and its accessibility.
Team members came to our debate, and were part of the adjudication pannel, they gave us detailed feedback at the end.
iGEM UCL team:
Bethan and Philipp came to Paris! We helped them set up meetings with researchers from La Paillasse (DIY bio lab) and Fabelier (DIY tinkerers) and offered them crash.
Philipp kindly participated in the debate as part of the adjudication pannel, and Bethan brought an interesting perspective to the post-debate discussion.
iGEM TUDelft team:
They've kindly sent us two biobricks from the 2009 team: the I-SceI restriction enzyme and the corresponding restriction site .

TU_Dresden,2017,Team:TU Dresden#Project#Secretion_-_-_TEXT.html,"cence assay was performed as described above. Protein purification from the supernatants to check the functionality of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher and FP fusions was performed according to the protocol .
Fluorescence assay:
The protocol for the implemented assay can be found under the experiments & protocol page. For all the assays biological duplicates and technical triplicates were used.
Purification and SDS-PAGE:
To prove the functionality of the SpyTag and the mini. SpyCatcher as a part of the fusion-proteins, the supernatants were purified with a quick protocol using agarose beads. The samples were mixed with a loading buffer containing a reducing agent and heated for 5 min at 95°C. 10 μl were then loaded onto a 12,5% SDS gel, which was run at 200 V for 45 min. and stained in Coomassie Blue over night.
Results
Fluorescence assay of supernatants derived from strains with single copy genes
The first obstacle that we had to overcome was establishing a suitable protocol to boost the secretion capacities of our generated Bacillus subitilis producer strains. After initially testing various media and incubation periods we performed all experiments using 2xYT medium and an incubation time of 16 h.
Applying this protocol, we observed good fluorescence in the supernatants harvested from the eight strains (combinations of fluorescence proteins (FP) with SpyTag/SpyCather (Tag) constructs) secreting either mCherry or sfGFP.  We were able to detect higher fluorescence when compared to supernatants derived from the wild-type (Figure 4).
The supernatant of the wild-type shows a relatively high fluorescence in case of sfGFP , because of the autofluorescence derived from the medium (data not shown). When compared with each other, all of the different fusion possibilities of a FP and the Tags show a similar fluorescence, with the exception of the N-terminally fused mini. SpyCatcher constructs. Apparently, this fusion either inhibits the native folding of the FP or decreases the secretion efficiency.
Figure 4: Endpoint measurement of the fluorescence from supernatants carrying our constructs and the wild type. Expression of the single copy mCherry or sfGFP fusion SpyTag/SpyCather constructs (purple) was induced with 1% xylose and the supernatants were harvested after 16 h of incubation. Wild type supernatant is shown as a control (pink). Excitation wavelength for sfGFP was set to 480 nm and emission was recorded"

6/1/2011-6/11/2011
Participated in iGEM bootcamp.  For the week we we learned bio-basics, CAD basics, Tuberculosis overview, digital logic design and clotho.  For clotho we built an application that would show hello world and then we modified the app so that another user could input a part sequence that would be stored in the clotho database.  Finally we had a group outing at Jillian's.
6/6/2011-6/10/2011
On the last day of bootcamp we learned more information on synthetic biology and gave the Wellesley team a tour of the wetlab and our liquid handling robot.  The next day I worked with Kyle Jones to look for constitutive promoters in the MIT Registry of Parts. We decided to use BBa_J23100, BBa_J23101, BBa_J23109, and BBa_I14053.  The first three are part of the Anderson Collection and are Amp Resistant. These promoters had RBS inside their plasmids. The last constitutive promoter is Kan resistant. "

When reverse osmotic plants are located inland there is no possibility to pump the concentrate into seawater, making it even more complicated to discharge it [3].          The cost of this process increases the total production costs for inland desalination plants up to 33%, making it an inefficient solution for e.g. industries or municipal          sewage treatment plants [8,9]. There are alternative possibilities to discharge the concentrate into the sea but these methods often have low productivity, need high chemical          dosages and have high investment costs combined with high energy consumption [3].

Results
We first show that there is regulated expression of the bacteriocins in E. coli.
Western blot reveals regulated expression of bacteriocins. In the image on the left, expression of Bactofencin A (BBa_K1931006), Enterocin E760 (BBa_K1931007), and truncated MBP (BBa_K1931005) were observed (lanes 3,4,5) whereas no signals were detected from uninduced negative control (lane 2). On the right, expression of lysostaphin (BBa_K1931011) was observed in the crude extract and the eluent fraction (evident from the two significant signals).
We proceed to characterize the efficacy of the bacteriocins via zone of inhibition and growth curve assays:
Zone of inhibition data for Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Purified maltose binding protein (MBP) was used as a negative control, and the beta-lactam antibiotic ampicillin was used at standard working concentration (100 ug/mL). Total protein concentrations for bacteriocin samples were adjusted to 1 mg/mL. Error bars denote a 95% confidence interval. BBa_K1931006 and BBa_K1931011 displays promising efficacy against S. aureus. BBa_K1931007 displays promising efficacy against S. epidermidis.
Zone of inhibition data for several species of gram negative bacteria known to cause mastitis in dairy cattle. Purified maltose binding protein (MBP) was used as a negative control, and the aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin was used at standard working concentration (30 ug/mL). Total protein concentrations for bacteriocin samples were adjusted to 1 mg/mL. Cit"

Rik van Rosmalen
Rik just finished his Bachelor in Molecular Life Sciences and will start his master this fall. Within the team he works on … well, everything. Officially, Rik is responsible for fusaric acid resistance within the biological control agent and works on the Wiki and the Sponsor team but he is involved in almost all projects and teams to a certain degree. Seemingly always patient and friendly, Rik will wait for two months for samples from Taiwan and still gets his work done. It’s magic! If you want to make Rik angry use a butter knife to chop tomatoes, but apart from that there is nothing you can do to get him off balance.
How will we remember Rik:
“Rik, how do you do that?”
“Like this.”
“IT’S MAGIC!”
Max van der Ploeg
Max just finished his Bachelor thesis in Biology this summer but in between got thrilled with synthetic biology and will start the Biotechnology master’s program this winter. Within the team he works on the kill-switch system. The circuit of this system is strongly influenced by Max’s enthusiasm for the genetic toggle switch. He presented the first version of the kill switch to the team drawn on a piece of napkin, because paper was not at hand when he had his flash of inspiration. Max is full of energy and his laughter is contagious. In Boston just follow the most funniest, loud and the most cheerful laughter and say hi to Max.
How we will remember Max:
Very passionately: “This is super amazing!!”

Also adding another carbon source like glucose or glycerin (that does not need autoclavation but sterile filtration) would improve the yield and reduce the costs. Using a defined medium would just elongate the process in terms of analysis, control and preparation measurement. Considering the generation of the sequence of the perfect binder the culture should be harvested in the stationary phase, because there the concentration of plasmid DNA is the highest.
Graph 1. : Amount of pDNA in comparison to OD600 (cell number) during cultivation (Dr. Schleef)
Therefore, when using a repeated batch letting only the last batch grow into the stationary phase would speed up the process as well as the yield. The type of E. coli used in production is also crucial. A fast growing and well characterized  strain has to be used in order to speed up production as well as approval. Also the characteristics of the strain when our plasmids are transformed into the cells have to be determined to further optimize the system because characteristics may change due to that. Another hurdle we had to consider was the approval by the government institutions. They differentiate between generics and biosimilars. Generics are a complete synthetic copy and thus the approval is shortened for its effect and side effects are already known. However, biosimialars root from a different amino acid sequence but the same target as the original. Because we are changing the sequence in search for the best binder, we belong to the second category. That means we have to go through all phases of testing. But aside from the pharmaceutical field our Evobodies can be freely used in research. In research our advantage is that it is in silico which means fast, flexible and a guaranteed outcome. Therefore, research labs can instantly react to new or mutated pathogens. Additionally, they can focus on how they plan to kill the pathogens instead of spending valuable time on finding ways to bind the target. Their possibilities are large because of the high stability of our Evobody various enzymes and proteins can be fused to it.
Business Plan
Executive summary:
Our goal is to introduce Evobodys (custom binding proteins) to the market. We produce customer specific binding proteins for all areas of application. Our system is fast and cost efficient. Thus, a competitive product is available to everybody. Even small research labs can work with it and medical facilities can use it as a head start against new or reemerging pathogens. Due to its focus on research use we do not have to go through the phases of approval resulting in accessibility to everybody. By marketing on websites and magazines with scientific content we effectively get in contact"

In my leisure time, I like to study some programming and computer science knowledge, hoping that one day I can combine my computer science skills and principles in biology and cognitive science to dig deeper into the Artificial Intelligence field. My name is Weiyu DU and I’m from China. I always have great passion for robotics, engineering and neuroscience. As a girl, I specialize in control of mobile robots and programming. Since Grade 8, I have participated in a number of robotics competitions such as WER and FTC. In my first competition of robotics, I won the champion of Jiangsu Province. Moreover, our team ranked the 6th place and got into semi-finals in the 2015 FIRST Tech Challenge Asian-Pacific Invitational. Now I’m President of Robotics Club in my school and would like to pursue my dream as an excellent engineer in the future. Not only do I possess interest in robots but also in neuroscience. I find the mystery of brain and neurons fascinating and get most excited when it overlaps with robot engineering. I do seriously think that we could get inspiration from the communication between neurons and the delicate design of neuro system that could apply in the fields of engineering and communication. After all, everything’s possible as long as our imagination lasts. Hi, my name is Jiaping Wang, and I come from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I have always thought that I am a science type person, because I am crazy about physics, attending numerous competitions and projects.

D: Here you can see the measured amounts of electricity and carbon dioxide which was bound. The other line shows the amount of produced isobutanol at the testing ground in Alabama.
P: The curves look good but how about the safety issues?
D: The implemented safety system succeeds in all three forced accidents. First we drilled a hole in the fermenter. The bacteria pouring out died immediately. No living bacteria survived. Secondly we increased the electricity input which killed all bacteria but result in no further damage. Thirdly we simulated an explosion with nuclear radiance. Although mutations happened, all bacteria died cause of the two step safety system.

P: Mr. Johnson. What potential does this technology have in your eyes?
H: Mr. President. This technology is a real gold mine. The sale of this system will generate lots of revenue. In addition we will be able to achieve the carbon dioxide reduction goals much earlier than any other country which will encourage them to follow us.

Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to consider when creating a novel organism and even more when you are talking about integrating a cell into an environment. It is almost impossible to be certain how a new cell will react in the environment; it is fairly likely that a long term effect would be detrimental.  By having an ATP balancing system you can adjust the ATP so that the cell can fulfill its purpose and then die off shortly after. This is a critical safety precaution and should always be considered when talking about introducing anything new to a new environment. By implementing this guideline in synthetic biology, you would be one step closer in integrating it with the environment.
Questions:
Q1: Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
A: Environmental safety is the issue that comes about with our project.
Q2: Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
A: There is no biosafety group that we are aware of.
Q3: What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
A: Had there been a biosafety group, they would probably be able to see the benefits of our project to have in many   aspects of science, health and environment as long as necessary environmental safety measures are taken when implementing the information our program provides.
Q4: Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
A: We did not create any new BioBricks.

MoWestern_Davidson,2009,Team:MoWestern Davidson#notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html,", but pTet+RBS produced colonies on the second ligation. These colonies were PCR screened and we found 3 pLac+RBS colonies to miniprep and digest for insert check.
We also recieved confirmation of sequencing for our 5mer reporters this week. We had 5 100% matches for RFP and 3 100% matches for Tet. However, all of the RFP sequences had a 25 bp insertion between the stop codon and the Bio Brick suffix. Because this insertion is not within the gene, we will continue to use this clone.
Week 9 (July 20-July 24)
5mer Reporter Project
We cut one of our good Tet clones and one good RFP clones with XbaI and PstI to make insert that will go downstream of the promoter and RBS. After we ran this on a gel, we gel purified the inserts.
We also digested pLac+RBS (with EcoRI and PstI) and ran our viable clones on a gel to check the insert size of the colonies from ligation. The insert looked about 50bp longer than we predicted, so we miniprepped the clones and decided to send it off for sequencing.
We decided to make vectors out of the pLac-RBS just in case the sequences yield 100% matches. We also went ahead and ligated this promoter and RBS to every Tet-5mer and RFP-5mer we had. When we PCR screened colonies resulting from the transformation, we discovered we had some successful ligations. We sequenced some of the clones resulting for each promoter.
Additionally, we ligated and transformed pTet with RBS. We PCR screened almost all the colonies that grew from this ligation and grew of up cultures of viable pTet+RBS. After mini prepping these contructs, we digested them to check insert size. The sizes of the inserts seemed larger than we had anticipated so we sent off seven clones for sequencing.
Assuming that we could still proceed with the ligation of our tRNA to the reporters, we digested the Tet-5mer and RFP-5mers with XbaI and PstI to make an insert. We will ligate this insert downstream of the pBad-tRNA.

We obtained colonies from our ligations of pBad-tRNAs and PCR screened the colonies. We discovered that there were several successful ligations. We are sending some clones for sequencing and will also digest them with SpeI and PstI so"
Missouri_Rolla,2016,Team:Missouri Rolla#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," for the synthesis of leupeptin, commonly used in protease inhibitor cocktails (and expensive). Named leupA-D, we believe that leupA and leupB are sufficient for leupeptin production from acetylleucine, leucine, and arginine. Mutation of leupA demonstrated that it is necessary for leupeptin synthesis, and a vector containing the region around A and B resulted in production of leupeptin in E. coli. The domains of leupA and B have homology to proteins with condensation actions similar to those proposed for the synthesis of leupeptin, including arginine and leucine. We ruled out most candidates for leucine acetyltransferase that could have been included in the 70 kbp vector with BLAST results to known genes except for a 18.84 kDa hypothetical protein, which differs significantly from the 27 kDa observed previously and occurs upstream rather than downstream as Barona-Gómez suggested two additional genes may be. From this, the presence of the acetyltransferase in leupeptin non-producing mutants of S. roseus, and the demonstrated ability of E. coli to convert acetylleucine to leucine, it is likely that some amount of acetylleucine is present naturally in E. Coli and sufficient for leupeptin production. LeupA has a predicted product similar in weight to the predicted 260 kDa for leupeptin synthase. Leupeptin acid reductase was noted to always elute with leupeptin acid synthetase, and had an estimated weight of 320 kDa, almost identical to the combined weights of LeupA and B. Thus we believe leupA and B together catalyze every step in leupeptin synthesis excluding acetylleucine formation, which might occur naturally in E. coli. Finally, natural leupeptin producers degrade leupeptin in the stationary phase, meaning we could see much higher yields with heterologous expression.
We obtained three S. roseus strains and attempted to amplify leupA and leupB from the genome using primers to add the entire RFC[10] prefix and suffix, designed using the unassembled genome sequence of strain ATCC 31245. PCR did not appear to amplify the desired products under a variety of conditions, with the long additions making the primers too long for use with the template, which has a GC content of over 70%. New primers with more favorable annealing temperatures were designed"
Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Loop_-_-_TEXT.html,"                         will vary. However, it is possible that Cas9 interacts                         with a PAM region even though there are mismatches between them (2). In order to know if this affinity for                         regions with mismatches was significant, we studied the                         ΔGPAM obtained for all possible PAM                         combinations.
Figure 11.                             Energies obtained by combining all possible RNA and DNA pairs with different PAM sequences. Units are kcal/mol.
White spaces in picture above represent PAM                         alternatives which do not bind significantly to a -NGG-                         PAM. The lower binding energy is clearly for PAMs with                         the structure -NGG-, achieving less than -9kcal/mol.                         However, there are other alternatives with affinity                         enough to let the Cas9 bind to them. The potential of                         these regions as possible off-targets relies also on                         the Cas9 specie being used, as there are some more                         “promiscuous” than others. We opted for including this                         potential off-target PAMs in our off-target search                         algorithm.
This PAM-energy assignment is implemented in the Matlab                         function energy_PAM.mat. The input is the target                         sequence. Comparing the PAM extreme nucleotides of the                         input sequence with a table containing Cas9-PAM binding                         energies, it matches the information of the string                         input with the corresponding energyΔGPAM .                         In the particular case of targets implemented in our                         testing system, the value of this parameter is in Table 2.

Secondly, the release of the energy from PAM binding                         will be used to hybridize the gRNA and nucleotides from                         the DNA sequence. In order to know the energy                         associated to different base pairs, we built a table                         with the energy increment for all possible matching                         duplexes. This table provides all necessary information to                         calculate the ΔΔGexchange,gRNA:target (8,9,10,11), as there should not be mismatches between                         both of them.

Furthermore it explained                 in a very graphical way how our system works and where it can be applied. By showing how we are able to encounter natural evolution                 we wanted to retrieve public participation in our project.                 We received almost instantly feedback through financial support and comments through social media. Our initial aim on                 opening our project to a broader audience was just as successfully achieved as our monetary goal.
Of course we also established contact with local press to gain the general public attention for Evobodies and synthetic biology. Several press reports in print and digital media contributed to the awareness regarding genetic engineering.
Expert consultation
To analyze our project on a scientific level we further did our best to search for potential flaws or improvement             in applicability and relevance of our system:
We were highly ambitious in contacting the science community to discuss and reflect our project.                 That is why we contacted a lot of scientists from different fields (e.g. virology and protein engineering)                 and discussed in a constant dialogue different aspects of our system. Especially Dr. Manel Camps from Santa Cruz                  University helped us a lot by answering our questions and giving us recommendations were to improve our project.                  We also attended different symposia to stay in touch with state of the art research and presented our poster                  at the CeBiTec Symposium to get in touch with other scientists in an uncomplicated way.
Process development
To further examine how applicable our system is regarding manufacturing processes, we created a concept on how to apply our method of                 Evobody generation on an industrial level. We developed a complete process from start to finish about using our molecular biological techniques                 on an up scaled level.
Business plan
Based on the process development and the integrated modeling, we did around our project, a business plan concerning Evobodies was constructed.                  In this plan we analyze not only applicability  but also compare the parameters of our designed process to existing generation techniques                  in binding protein producing industry. Furthermore we examined aspects regarding legal guidelines, tax law, accreditation and marketing."

iGEM is not only about realizing an astonishing project to save the world, but also about learning and helping each other. Every year, new projects     are started, new challenges arise and as students with limited experience in many fields of the iGEM competition,      it is very difficult to always find rapidly the right solution to occurring problems. Hence,     it is required to work together and to share knowledge with other teams.
Our Team, like many others, has gone through     rough times and we want to appreciate  every team that helped us going through all kinds of adversities. In return,     we were able to support other teams which have been struggling with their project's realization.
But iGEM is not only about the projects themselves. It has evolved to a worldwide community with hundreds of teams taking part in.     Enjoying iGEM with other young people who share similar goals and ideals is also an important part of the     competition.

Cell harvest (see protocols)
05/13:
Cell pellets thaw on ice for 1.5 h. Pellet weight: 0.677 g and 0.655 g respectively
Cells are resuspended in 1.5 mL icecold S30-buffer (with 3 µL 1 M DTT added each) with 10s vortex - 30 s ice resting cycles until pellets are fully resuspended. Suspensions are each transferred to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Cell disruption via sonification. Our power calibration (see protocols) revealed that the energy input of this specific Sonificator (Bandelin HD2070, MS73 tip) at this specific setup (70% power, cycle = constant) was about 3,69 J∙s-1. Therefore, for a total energy input of about 900 J, 24x 10s sonification - 10s cooling cycles were performed. The tip was dipped in about 2/3 of the cell suspension. During sonification, the microcentrifuge tube rested in ice rather than in an ice bath. As we observed that the tube becomes slightly warmer in the first case, all later sonifications were conducted with an ice bath.
After 10 cycles of sonification / cooling, we took 10 µL of the first tube after each further cycle and diluted them in 990 µL each. These samples were later used to conduct our first test about how effective our sonification kills E. coli: 20 µL of the diluted samples were plated on LB
Last steps of cell extract harvest were carried out as described in the protocol section with following variation:
cell extract in tube 2 has to be centrifuged a second time as the unsolvable fraction did not precipitate completely after the first  centrifugation

We are still waiting for the sequencing results to come back to us. We also will present the research we have done on Lambda.

After we completed our overnight prep, we set up an experiment to test to ability of our plasmid to give off a color response to cholera. We prepared the 5 tubes that Kendall explained above, we then put them in the 30 C room overnight and we will check on them tomorrow.

The fourth and fifth tubes have cholera, E.Coli, and LB. The fourth has a slightly greater number of cholera (500 microL of cholera-saturated broth) compared to the fifth (100 microL of cholera-saturated broth). These are the results after two days of shaker-incubation at 30 degrees C, when the cultures are viewed under UV light. We went over the quorum-sensing circuit with Dr. Grose.

By mentored from college team, we could get a lot of useful advices not only for our experiment but also for our overall progress for IGEM. We also learned that sharing different genuine thoughts and applying different ideas from many people is the crucial way to improve our project.
3. YouTube Collaboration
We contacted with East Chapel Hill High school team in North Carolina through our facebook page and made YouTube collaboration. We first contacted through our facebook page and decided to make tutorials of lab techniques and lab safety with many other teams which is called Tasty-Style Lab Technique Videos. We could choose any of our lab techniques from our experiment and create a short 1-2 minutes video. So our team created a ‘Ligation prep’ video for about 2 minutes and made collaboration with Peshawar 2017, UNBC 2017 and East Chapel Hill 2017. We first discussed what technique to choose and when we made the lab meeting, we made this video. Not only our team but also each of team created a great lab video. For Peshawar 2017, they made a transformation procedure video, serial dilution method for East Chapel Hill 2017 and Agarose gel method for UNBC 2017. By doing this collaboration, we could not only look through other teams method for their experiment but also how different methods could be use in different application of synthetic biology.
4. Wiki Revisions
To potentially improve our team’s wiki, our team basically checked many other teams wikis and vice versa. After the process of contacting with many teams, we finally get to contact with igemusp(Brazil) team, British_Columbia IGEM team, UiOslo_Norway team, and Bordeaux team. They sent us some comments after reviewing our wiki and our team reflected the comments and made revisions. During revisions, we pointed out improvements of each other’s’ organization of the wiki such as defining terms before the result section to trivial mistakes like grammar errors. Our team was surprised by imaginative ideas and visually conspicuous graphic and was able to receive innovative ways to portray our project on wiki better. We were also able to get inspirations from these teams’ projects by going through their wikis. Especially, in team Britain Columbia, we were really surprised by using  CRISPR/Cas9 to combat virulent bacteria although they were lack of collaboration and exposure of validation of modeling. Teams that made the wiki revisions with us had various subjects for their projects. Team UiOslo Norway team’s project is to create the functional bi"

The sleeping center once                                         carried on a project about developing a melatonin sustained release tablets.                                         Also, it has done lots of other researches on melatonin. Thus, we believed West                                         China sleeping center would give us the authoritative answer we want. With the                                         help of team “SCU-WestChina”, we got in touch with Professor Tang Xiangdong and                                         his postdoctor Doctor Zhang Ye from the sleeping center.
Fig. 1 We had a face to face conversation with Dr.                                             Zhang on efficacy of melatonin as well as our project at West China                                             hospital’s sleeping center.
      After we interviewed them about sleep                                         disorder treatment and our project design,                                         we improved our understanding about our project deeply.
Fig. 2 After our interview, we are greeted for Dr.                                             Zhang to share his rest time to talk with us.
      Firstly, we were more confident about the                                         potential use of melatonin as a common                                         medicine for sleep disorder. As Doctor Zhang mentioned, melatonin, with a short                                         half-life, is more appropriate for sleep disorder due to smaller 'hangover'                                         effects on the following morning. And previous studies indicate that patients                                         are unlikely to develop dependence and tolerance on melatonin. Doctor Zhang                                         emphasized that our project, using microorganism to produce melatonin in                                         intestine, is more economical compared with chemical method. So we were                                         convinced that our project is possible to generate economic benefits in the                                         future.
      Additionally, with the help of Doctor Zhang,                                         we found there were so many things                                         to do in order to optimize our project. For safety purposes, we were recommended                                         to use a safer bacterial strain in the final products. What’s more, Doctor Zhang                                         explained sleep associated neural circuits to us, which enlightened us to                                         consider the relationship of melatonin expression and sleep associated neural                                         circuits or other neural activities.

Based on last year's feedback, we improved our KELN software which automatically changes experiment notes to HTML-language and distributed it to Team Gifu and Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo. The following is their feedback:
From Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
・It was easy to use even for people who are not computer-savy. So we could divide the work among many people.
・It was easy to customize the ""KELN"" software because the edit display is simple.
・Our experiment sample numbers was so many that we couldn’t write all sample data into a single cell.
・If we can use copy and paste in the software, we will complete the wiki more smoothly.
From Team Gifu
・ Without any special knowledge ,KELN can be used to get HTML code from a lab notebook, so we recommend this software to all iGEM teams!
We are very happy that KELN was helpful for you. All iGEMers can download KELN from here! All iGEMers can download KELN from here!"

Collaborations
Synthetic biology relies heavily on collaboration within the scientific/engineering community, so it is of the utmost importance to develop and foster continuous relationships with other lab groups and the community. We have worked extensively with the University of Texas, University of Valencia, and University of Virginia iGEM teams in order to facilitate the communication and relationships necessary for the success of synthetic biology in the modern world.

The students have learned about the iGEM and synthetic biology in general. We presented our project to the class, and explained various aspects for our endeavour in more detail.
To give interested students some overview of how they can get involved in synthetic biology, Vera, Florian, Ansgar and Björn gave short presentations about each university program at RWTH represented in our team: Biology, Biotechnology, Computational Engineering Science and Informatics, respectively. We gave them examples for typical classes and specialization options as well as career perspectives in each program.
While discussing some more career perspectives, we handed an evaluation sheet out to each student. This way the class could give us some feedback about our work, and leave some comments on what they liked best and what we can still improve on. On average, the students gave us an A (1,9 or 87%) for the teaching module. We are really happy about this great mark, and will try to improve on all the things the students suggested.
Unfortunately, the bell already rang when the students finished handing in their evaluation sheets. However, some students still followed our invitation to stay after class to ask more questions about paths into synthetic biology, and for some cookies.
Overall, all parties seemed really satisfied with our collaboration and we are looking forward to repeating the teaching module with other high school classes!

Result
the more people have knowledge on biology, the more people would get interested in activities or fields of biology. In addition, knowledge strongly   exert effects on their understandings although it didn't give effect on what kind of fields in synthetic biology they want  to be develop. Thus we can say our   hypothesis was partly correct in that projects which are far from our daily life tend to be underestimated.
From those above, we noticed the importance of basic education on biology.
1.Abstract
We considered that biological information processing researches like Turing pattern are not regarded as important among people who don’t know well   about biology and that can have a bad influence on these researches. For example, many of such people who aren't ready to invest these researches. That’s why we   investigated whether it is true or not that there are differences of thinking between people who know well about biology and people who don’t.
We took a survey and analyzed the data.
2.Survey
We asked to the guests 6 questions below:
Q1.Which field of synthetic biology do you expect more development?
1.Food/Consumer Electronics
2.Medical health
3.Environment
4.Simulation
5.Basic Study
6.Computer/Information
Q2.Were your understandings of SynBio study of each field deepened? (5 scale)
Q3. Do you know Central Dogma?
Q4.Are you interested in formation of Zebra’s stripe?
Q5.Do you want to study the formation?
Q6.Do you want to join iGEM?
Question 1 and 2 were also handed out to other iGEM teams in Japan so that we can see whether there is a difference in the 2 points: interest and   intelligibility,                 between general and people related to synthetic biology.
3. HYPOTHESIS
From the background written above, we made more detailed hypothesis.
1.General is likely to choose options related to daily life(a,b) because it is easy to imagine the effect of development, on the contrary,   iGEMers would like to choose others(c, d, f) because they know those 3 options can’t be eliminated for developing whole field of synthetic biology.
2.Q2 would also give us a proof that the more test taker has knowledge on synthetic biology, the higher understanding for q(c, d, f) after   explanation would like to get. In other words, basic projects are more complex than others which are relatively close to our daily life and thus"

DNA Origami Overview
A string is one of the most versatile product mankind has ever manufactured. The DNA is similar to string in many ways such as it is flexible, it can be folded in a complex way to create structures. The process of folding of a single strand of DNA into a complex shape is known as DNA Origami and we wanted to utilize this feature to create a DNA scaffold. Our team at Ingenuity Lab got the inspiration from the amazing work of Dr. Seidel’s group at the Leipzig University to create an electrical nano-circuit.
Our project uses the principles behind DNA Origami to design an organic/inorganic bionanoarchitecture that serves to function as DNA-based gold nanowire. There are vast potential applications using DNA nanotechnology. The project inspiration came from Dr. Seidel’s group at the Leipzig University. Following their work, we have designed a boxed structure with hollow using 214 short oligonucleotides (called staples) and a 7249nt scaffold DNA from M13mp18. Subsequently, this hollow cavity will then be seeded with a gold nanoparticle (AuNP). Seeding occurs because the inner cavity will contain polyA capture strands whereas the AuNP will have its complementary polyT strands. Once the AuNP is seeded, the DNA origami structure will be placed in gold ion solution, H[AuCl4], to allow the precipitation of gold within the hollow cavity. In other words, the DNA uses the gold nanoparticles as a reaction seed to mould and grow into the desired shape, pattern and complex components needed for programmable circuits.

USTC_Software,2009,Team:USTC Software#hoWAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," offspring for successive generations. The probability of an individual mating is proportional to the fitness of the environment. The generation with better fitness will be obtained generation by generation. As the topology, the interaction forms and the parameters for each component function are all necessary in the final result, we employed a multi-level optimization. The lowest level optimization is to give the suitable parameters with the topology and the interaction forms known. For the next level, we are trying to find the interactions forms of component functions with the known topology with genetic algorithm. At last, for the upper level, the potential topologies are selected also with genetic algorithm. And the fitness functions are the similarity between the dynamic behaviors and the target, which are measured by the standard error.
Optimization Processes of GA
Step1: Randomly generate a population of topologies.
Step2: For each topology, generate a population of networks with a serial of random interaction forms.
Step3: For each network, obtain the fitness score by optimize the parameters.
Step4: Obtain the fitness score of a topology by searching the most favorable network.
Step5: Evolutes the topologies with each fitness score.
Parameter For GA
Population: the number of members in one generation
Mutation ratio: the ratio of each gene alter its status in a generation
Recombine ratio: the ratio that whether a gene change with its allel in mating
Max_cycle: the maximum number of generations considered for the evolution
Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO)
Introduction to PSO
What's PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is an optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence theory. Motivated by the evolution of nature, a series of evolutionary computation techniques, such as evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, are proposed, in which a best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, individual swarms are evolved through cooperation and competition. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. The position of each particle represents a potential solution to a problem.
The following is excerpt from"" http://www.swarmintelligence.org/ "", it shows clearly how PSO works: ""Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far. (The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best"

Wiki Freeze!!!
This week is hectic! We still had to complete the BioBricksTM and submit them to the registry. The wiki had to be finished, completely, by Wednesday! Furthermore the presentation must be finished. HELP!
Update Monday
We were just completely flabbergasted (wow, I always wanted to use that word!) when we stated our WIKI-TO-DO-LIST on the whiteboard..
Update Tuesday
Even pizza-boxes are used for scratch paper.. is this a normal iGEM symptom?
Update Wednesday
Do you remember Last Project Night [1] by iGEM Calgary 2011? When we watched this video at the start of our project we were laughing, but we didn't think it would be like that for real... until last night! LAST PROJECT NIGHT IS REAL! ;)
Last!!! Update Wednesday [4:06 AM]
It is exactly 2 hours before the deadline and we made it, with a lot of coffee and bad jokes we not only finished the wiki but also had an enjoyable evening together. I (Jody) would like to thank everybody who contributed to our iGEM project, especially my team members for making this project a real success!!! We finished before the first overload of the iGEM server.

WET LAB
Proposal for Experiments with BBa_K381001
1- Proposal # 3 was done
The 3 tubes contained:
10mL of LB
20µL KNO3 1M solution
9,7µL chloramphenicol 34mg/mL
A tube as negative control was prepared, without  KNO3
Inoculated tubes with e. coli transformed with BBa_381001
Tubes were set with different temperatures:
Negative control at 37°C
37°C
15-20°C
20-30°C
2- Calculations for the preparations of the solutions utilized during the experience:
Preparation of 10mL of KNO3 1M stock solution:
MMKNO_3=101,1g/mol
<center>(1mol KNO_3)/1L×(101,1gKNO_3  )/(1molKNO_3 )×1L/1000mL×10mL=1,011gKNO_3
Expected Results
The functionality of the Biobrick is to detect presence/absence of nitrates, in this case was KNO3 0.20% in LB, in the tubes set at the indicated temperatures.
It’s expected that all tubes, except in the negative control, was observed a green fluorescence under UV light. And in the negative control, red coloration

Warsaw,2012,Team:Warsaw#Wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," constructs we aquired so far. But the first step was E. coli electroporation. After receiving colonies and plasmid isolation, we inoculated B. subtilis 168  to prepare competent cells. We tried to transform them with pUB110 (control) and pTG262.
Great thanks also to Slovenia Team - we got CMV promoter, which we can add to our mammalian construct! This week, we also inoculated SuperFolder GFP construct. PCR problems on pCEP4 template made us design new primers. We digested all previous constructs and preparated a full one – ligation P+RBS+GFP+pSB1C3, subsequently transformation and inoculation. Electrophoresis of digestions proved wrong placements of inserts.
Week 12 (10.09-14.09)
We made isolation of plasmid DNA P+RBS+GFP+pSB1C3, NanoDrop measuring of DNA concentration and prepared samples for sequencing. Then we digested P+RBS+GFP+pSB1C3 construct and ran electrophoresis to check the placement of the insert. PCR of pCEP4 – we set some changes in gradient annealing temperatures. Digestion of all our parts in the purpose of ligation into pSB1A3 and pSB1C3 and transform TOP10 with it.
Week 13 (17.09-21.09)
Putting the final constructs together! Last preparations before shipping our parts to Boston!

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Project#Light pattern#Logic design_-_-_TEXT.html," Because expression of CI is also controlled by the PRM promoter, this acts as a positive feedback loop to stably switch the bistable part to state two, where RFP is produced.
The system now has memory!
Furthermore, regardless of whether or not CI is no longer externally added to this system, the bistable switch will remain in its ""memory"" state, or state two.
IF&NOT Module
This module involves conditional logic designed to elicit the third state only after a light change occurs following activation of the second state. Because the second state (the memory gaining of the bistable switch) occurs when the light turns ON, the third state must occur when the light turns OFF. Thus our conditional must depend on:
an inducer produced in the second state
either an inducer produced when the light is OFF or a repressor produced when the light is ON
In the case where the third state is triggered in part by an inducer produced when the light is OFF, logic points to an AND gate. In the case where the third state is triggered in part by a repressor produced when the light is ON, logic points to a hybrid IF and NOT design, where a promoter must be activated by one factor only in the absence of another.
For the third state, we opted to go with the hybrid (IF and NOT) approach, as it simplifies the number of constructs in the system (plus, team Missouri-Davidson '08 has some cool looking hybrid promoters we wanted to try out). Specifically, we used part <partinfo>BBa_K091104</partinfo> in the design of our module to achieve the proper IF&NOT logic. This pLac/Mnt hybrid is described as activated by a combination of LacI/IPTG only in the absence of Mnt; thus, LacI serves as the inducer produced in the second state (the memory ON section of the bistable switch) and Mnt the repressor expressed when the light is ON - namely, light ON component of the Conversion Module.
AND Module
This module regulates the expression/activation of the fourth and final state of the circuit. As with the third state, it is desired that the fourth state will only be triggered given prior activation of the previous states. Thus, an AND gate, where transcription is dependent upon the positive presence two transcription factors, is necessary to prevent the fourth state from occurring at the improper time. We looked at past team's attempts at AND gates, and found PKU 2009's description of the supD/T7ptag AND gate appropriate.
The AND gate as outlined by"
Beijing_Normal,2008,Team:Beijing Normal#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"enzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) were introduced into the biosphere on a large scale as by-products from the manufacture of chlorinated phenols and the incineration of wastes. Due to their high toxicity they have been the subject of great public and scientific scrutiny.
The evidence in the literature suggests that PCDD/F compounds are subject to biodegradation in the environment as part of the natural chlorine cycle. Lower chlorinated dioxins can be degraded by aerobic bacteria from the genera of Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia.However, higher chlorinated dioxins requires anaerobic degradation process.
Organic pollutants such as PCB and dioxins, produced in human beings activities in the last century, are toxic and carcinogenic which are able to promulgate widely and accumulate to a high level of concentration by food chain. Due to their inherent thermal and chemical stability, it is commonly considered as indestructible under normal incineration or burial.
Nonetheless, by endowing some bacteria ability of utilizing such molecules as carbon source, cooperative evolution makes all possible! Enzymes assembled from related degradation pathways into our host strain serve as the function part. We introduce popular components involved in chemotaxis, quorum-sensing to regulatory parts, sense the environment signal, respond to move, accelerate growing and produce related degradation enzymes. After the cleaning work being finished, bacteria will return to the normal state.
Taking the condition of our lab into account, we decide just deal with the aerobic degradation path way. And do some work on increasing the degradation effeciency.
Project Details
background information
Although many environmental pollutants are efficiently degraded by microorganisms, others such as PCBs and dioxins persist and constitute a severe health hazard. In some instances, persistence is a consequence of the inadequate catabolic potential of the available microorganisms. Gene technology, combined with a solid knowledge of catabolic pathways and microbial physiology, enables the experimental evolution of new or improved catabolic activities for such pollutants.
Catabolic pathway for degradation of biphenyl and organization of bph gene cluster is as follows:

Probiotic Production
Probiotics, by definition, are living microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. It has long been suggested to be health beneficial with effects like prevention of AAD (antibiotic associated diarrhoea) [1] , increase HDL in blood [2] , and when prescription of antibiotic has interrupt microbial balance in the gastrointestinal tract, probiotic may be able to restored the balance [1] . Nowadays, people have increased awareness of probiotics’ importance for health, the demand from the market thus rise and various production techniques are employed. In order for the probiotics to maintain their effectiveness all though their shelf-life, they need to be dried into pallets or powder before releasing into the market. Spray, freeze, vacuum and fluid bed drying are four major ways [3] . However, stress would be induced during the drying process and will severely affect the viability and thus the effectiveness of probiotics after rehydration.

This would be the dairy that the people have on hand. Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and grow the yeast in there. Because there will be a specific amount of lactose in each section, and our promoters are sensitive to galactose, our yeast will stop producing progesterone after it consumes all of the lactose.
We have found multiple ways to insert our genes into Y.lipolytica and we made pros and cons lists for each method to decide which one would be the most effective and time-efficient. The methods are regular homologous recombination using homologous arms on our plasmid, EasyCloneYALI: CRISPR/Cas9‐based technique for engineering Y.lipolytica specifically, and Drag and Drop cloning.

We confirmed that using a constitutive promoter would be better than an inducible one, at least initially, because it will use up energy to keep producing progesterone after the growth media has been consumed. Our website has gone through several prototype designs, but it seems like we may be getting close to a final design we would like to use to represent our work. One fun feature that is a work in progress is an interactive map that will, when moused over, provide information about different countries and our outreach there. We have also been working on finalizing our logo, which will include the name of our project: PoPPY. PoPPY stands for Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast, an accurate description of the goal of our project. A low this week for the team was realizing that most of the survey responses received from one of the groups we reached out to about contraceptive accessibility were unreliable, since many answers between supposedly different women were the exact same, word for word. However, we hope that this was a problem specific to the group, and not the norm. We have some more legitimate groups who are willing to send us photos of the women filling out the surveys, and we hope to see good results.

There is also a selfish plasmid system utilizing the toxin-antitoxin system to kill the ‘slackers’ but limited for low plasmid concentration microbe. [Previous work to prevent the plasmid-loss]

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Transforming E. coli cells with Plasmid DNA
Competent e.coli cells were first prepared, according to the protocol here.
Sample C,D,E,H,J,L and N to be transformed, according to the protocol here.
Day 4
Growth and Culture of Bacteria
For the protocol please click here.
Plates incubated overnight show that vectors corresponding to C,D,E,H,J,L and N were taken up [however, later we find that ligation had failed, and so gBlocks C,D,E,H,J,L and N were never inserted]. There are at least 5-7 colonies for each biobrick.
Choose three colonies from each plate. The colony should not be too small or too large and should be reasonably spaced from the others.
Separately incubate each colony in test tubes overnight.
This process would significantly increase the amount of plasmids containing biobricks that we want. Plasmids can be extracted later.
Transformation of J and G (24/06 PCR Product) into competent E. coli cells
Competent cells are already made in stocks and can be found in the -80℃ freezer: we don’t need to prepare them again. J and G comes from repeat PCR done in Day 3.
Primer Design
Since A, B, F, G, I, K, M have repeatedly failed to be PCR-amplified, longer primers were designed to replace the old primers for the PCRing of these gene sequences.
Primers that would give the sequences new restriction sites to allow their insertion into pBAD33 and pBAD/HisB expression vectors were also designed.
Day 5
Plasmid Extraction
For the plasmid extraction protocol see here.
pSB1C3 shipping vector containing gBlocks from Day 1, as well as blank pSB-1C3 shipping vector, pBAD/HisB expression plasmids, and pBAD33 expression plasmids were extracted from overnight cultures of E. coli DH5 using E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I.
(refer to pages 10-12 for Mini Kit protocol. Some special notes:
All optional steps were carried out except equilibration step.
After centrifugation in step 2, the tubes were pulsed before the excess supernatant was removed through pipetting.
Steps 6 and 7 (involving solutions II and III need to be carried out in quick succession (adhering to the short incubation time) to ensure good results. It is advisable to do these two steps in pairs as in step "

Week 13: July 22 - July 26
The sequencing of the J04500 + Beta-lactamase with a His-tag construction from last week revealed that we had successfully completed this part.Mutagenesis primers were designed for this gene as a BsaI cut site is present in the sequence which could interfere with any Golden Gate assembly attempted with this part. Successful mutation of this part was completed and confirmed via gel electrophoresis and sequencing. A preliminary test was also attempted with this part in order to see if the leaky properties of the LacI (BBa_J04500) promoter could successfully produce beta-lactamase at levels large enough to allow the transformed cells to survive on plates containing ampicillin even though this part exists in a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid (pSB1C3). This test successfully displayed that active beta-lactamase was being produced by our cells. Also produced this week was the plasmid switch of the beta-lactamase gene with a His-tag at the C-terminus, the beta-lactamase gene with a glycine linker at the N-terminus.
Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Realizing the time constraints we have for the submission of our parts, we reviewed our Golden Gate assembly experiment to ensure we can submit the parts to the registry. In case this method fails, we also began development of Gibson assembly primers to see if this assembly assembly method cooperates with us.
We began characterization of prussian blue ferritin through kinetics experiments. Our first goal was the construction Michaelis-Menten plot to determine the activity of our peroxidase-like catalyst with the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) substrate which ended up looking like this: INSRERT GAPHHHH These experiments then continued on to optimization experiments wherein we determined the optimal pH, temperature, and concentrations of ABTS and H2O2. We intend to repeat these experiments 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine so that we could compare the two substrates and determine the most viable one for our final system.

Perchlorate salts are found in the Martian regolith covering the surface of Mars at a concentration of up to 1 %. Perchlorate is a highly oxidising compound used in rocket fuels and munitions. It is dangerous and toxic to humans. Current disposal methods are via expensive bioreactors, or contained explosions. So, if humans are to colonise Mars, we will have to remove the perchlorates from the soil in order to have a chance of developing agriculture for our survival. The University of Exeter 2018 iGEM Team are developing a bioreactor that will remove perchlorate salts from soil, and dispose of waste perchlorate in a cheap, safe manner, by using genetically engineered bacteria with (per)chlorate and chlorite reducing enzymes.
To assist their project, we have recorded the affects of perchlorate on the growth of our free-living nitrogen fixing, soil bacteria. This has helped show the importance of their project in aiding the development of agricultural methods on Mars, as well as disposing of perchlorate in a safe, contained way so as not to harm the environment and affect soil ecosystems. The results of our experiments are displayed in Figures 1 to 3.

This resulted in a       really nice piece and animation, to explain our project to the       general public. The article is available here (in Dutch).
Bionieuws (Bionews)
Thanks to the team of Eindhoven, we got the opportunity to advertise our project in the magazine of the Netherlands Institute of Biology. Together with all the Dutch teams we filled one page. Every team explained themselves in one sentence and included a team logo and contact information. (Translation title picture: The Netherlands is fully represented in Boston at the global iGEM competition.)
The Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute (GBB)
We were invited by Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute (GBB) to present our project at their 24th Annual Symposium. The Symposium was held at the
Biotoop
, the former Biological Centre. Our audience consisted of postdocs, PhD and MSc students with a Biomolecular or Biotechnology background. This gave us a chance to practice in front of a big audience and to handle critical questions. All in all, this was a valuable learning experience.
Riddle
Besides communicating our project to the general and scientific     community, we wanted to do something to bring the iGEM teams     together. To let people explore the CryptoGErM system, we developed     a game to play during the jamboree. The game explanation can be     found here . The idea is for     the contestants to find our poster and to interact with our team     members.
Interviews with Dagblad van het Noorden & OogTV
On Monday October 17th we had an interview with Dagblad van het Noorden (Local newspaper). In addition, we will still get an interview on Friday 21th of October with of OogTV, the local TV channel of Groningen. Both the article and the TV interview are yet to be published.

Endy's 2006 paper is interesting, but it only presents characterisation for one part. It would be useful to have more parts characterised, especially if they actually work. We are submitting a few parts to the Registry: a signalling circuit, a reporter, mutants - all with various combinations of promoter and terminator sequences. It would be useful to characterise as many of them as possible, even if it's just for static and dynamic respones, so that future users have a quantifiable way of comparing performance. We are testing a signalling-reporter combination, but we don't know how much the reporter will affect our model of the signalling circuit. For example, if we consider response time, we don't know if our circuit response is limited by the signalling circuit, the reporter circuit, or a combination of both. If the circuit response is slowed mostly by the reporter circuit, it would cast doubt on the validity of the model as soon as a different reporter or sexy circuit were implemented. If there is a way to characterise the reporter by itself along with the signalling + reporter (and if we could do the same with the mutants, that would be interesting too), it would help us assess how good our model is for the signalling circuit by itself, and how it will perform when used with a different reporter or sexy circuit at the end.

Verification of cl lambda inverter in psB2K3
Plasmid miniprep of overnight cultures with Sigma Genelute Miniprep kit. Standard manufacturer protocol used; elution in 40µL of ddH2O.
Vacufuge to concentrate.
Verification digest with XbaI and PstI. Control: cl lambda part from the Registry distribution plate.
Results: Faint bands were present.  Looked into vector characteristics and it turns out it is high-copy number with IPTG induction (Thanks Thane!)

Isolation of cl lambda; Sequencing for LuxPQ-LuxOU construct
Six overnight cultures of cl lambda colony 1 were prepared with LB-Kanamycin broth. Plasmid was then isolated using the Sigma GenElute MiniPrep kit. Two plasmids were not successfully isolated, but the other four tubes were pooled into two tubes and vacufuged to increase their concentration. A restriction digest with XbaI and PstI was then set up for 2 hours at 37ºC.

Seminar and Workshop at Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung
Once again, on June, 16th, we had the chance to promote synthetic biology and iGEM competition to the students at UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung. ITB_Indonesia public relation had contacted the university since 2 months ago. We were very excited, finally, we were able to conduct this event after so much preparation. The seminar was entitled, “Biodiversity as Basic Knowledge for Synthetic Biology”. This time, we did not only hold an usual seminar where the speakers shared about synthetic biology and iGEM, but also we had a bioinformatic workshop as an innovative human practice activity. As we had investigated before, most of the students or respondents whom participated in our survey/questionnaires were interested in synthetic biology. So, we realized and though of a way to help the students to gain more insights about synthetic biology. There was a saying, “Practice makes perfect!”. Therefore, we designed this workshop in order to help the students understand about primer design, allignment, and how to create a phylogenetic tree. The students from the campus learnt from us enthusiastically since this was the first time for them to learn more about synthetic biology and bioinformatic for the first time!
After the event ended, we had more time to discuss with the Head of Biology Department of the campus, Dr. Tri Cahyadi. He greeted us warmly and were looking forward to collaborating with ITB in the future. Since one of the university visions is to go international, participating in an international competition such as iGEM would be really awesome. He planned to delegate some of his students to ITB to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM. The following video showed his support for us:

3. Test of restriction enzymes
Before starting with the cloning procedures it was necessary to check if the ordered restriction enzymes work properly. Therefore the pSMF2.1 plasmid was digested separately with each restriction enzyme (MluⅠ, SacⅠ, SphⅠ) that should be used for the following cloning of has2 and UDP-glcDH into the expression plasmid pSMF2.1. Displayed in Figure 3 all restriction enzymes (MluⅠ, SacⅠ and SphⅠ) linearised the plasmid, indicating proper functioning.
