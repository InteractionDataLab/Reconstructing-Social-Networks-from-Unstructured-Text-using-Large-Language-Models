Week of 8/29/2011
8/30: first HCI lab meeting of the semester! :D What are issues we still need to address?  How’s the website coming along?  Are we thinking about the presentation yet?  How did the results for the usability studies go?
Week of 9/5/2011
Started finalizing the design for the website, after doing brainstorming.  Over the week of the 9th to the 12th we will focus on polishing the website and working on the brainstorms for the presentation itself.  Is there an overarching theme of some sort that we can focus on?  Perhaps the iterative science research process?
Week of 9/12/2011
Worked on making tutorial videos for the eLab Notebook prototype and also Optimus Primer. Somehow the format for the videos isn’t compatible with the wiki will figure this out.
Week of 9/19/2011
Wiki freeze on Wednesday! AAAHHH
9/26: methodology page was updated, with focus on user-centered design.
9/27: final touches on the wiki.  We started ordering team t-shirts for iGEM.  WIKI-FREEZE at midnight!

Collaborations
An important aspect of synthetic biology is the collaboration and exchange of ideas and techniques. An exchange of ideas between colleagues can lead to important advancements and progress in the field. Since this meetup is among iGEM teams, we not only looked to better the field but to also better the iGEM community. This summer we hosted two conferences at BU between teams in the New England area in order to promote collaboration and provide vital feedback on each other's’ projects and presentations.
NEGEM
Several teams attended our two NEGEM (New England iGEM Meetup) conferences, including Tufts, Harvard, Wellesley, MIT, WPI, UMass-Dartmouth, and Northeastern. We were also able to host all of the teams’ advisors and representatives from iGEM HQ, who gave everyone a lot of important feedback.
At the first NEGEM meetup on June 19th, the 8 iGEM teams in attendance were encouraged to share their project ideas and give insight and suggestions for each project. Everyone had a 20 minute presentation outlining their goals and plans for the summer. It was exciting to hear about the different projects that teams came up with, and how much they wanted to accomplish over the summer! Our team got some great feedback from everyone through questions and comments brought up by our NEGEM peers, and this prompted us to think more deeply about the motivation and feasible use of our project idea.
After all teams presented, team members from different colleges grouped together in smaller groups to speak further about different iGEM aspects - getting more specific feedback about their projects, learning about how to tackle the wiki, and identifying potential collaborations with other teams. It was through this meetup that we were able to meet the Wellesley iGEM team and eventually test (link to wellesley) their prototype. Most importantly, this NEGEM meetup gave us (and other teams) a chance to bond with the other synthetic biologists taking part in iGEM this summer. We made a lot of new friends!

Analytically, this amplification factor can be calculated as follows by setting $P_{FP threshold}'=\frac{1}{\beta}$:
$$\alpha_{required} = \frac{\beta}{1-\beta} \frac{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}} \tag{10}$$
We can see the reliability of the system increase as a function of α for different rations $\left( \frac{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}\right)$ and can read-off the amplification factor required to achieve an input that is 95% reliable (i.e. the probability of a true positive given a positive output).
Figure 9: Reliability of the detection system for different on-target amplification factors. Reliability of the output as a function of α for different ratios $\left(\frac{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}\right)$. The intersection between the different graphs and $\beta$, which we set to 95% as per example, allows reading off the required amplification factor required to achieve the desired reliability.
Collaboration iGEM LMU-TUM Munich
Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm.
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software, which is already available from NCBI for homology search.
We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH"

However, if both systems utilize the same receptor protein, no competitive binding of repressor and activator occurs. Therefore a different receptor is required. In that way the light receptor (desired value) can express A (activator) and the odour receptor can express B (inhibitor).
The blue lagoon
Today was about finding answers to the questions posed yesterday.
We searched for information about the optimal growth temperature for E. coli and temperature profiles for ponds in summer. We found that E. coli can grow in temperatures as low as 7,5 °C, while ponds should be well above 18°C. So, temperature should not be a problem.
We also continued working on the refinement of the ideas for our Blue Lagoon. After a short talk with Inge, we started looking for suitable cyanobacteria to replace E. coli, since it would solve a lot of the problems we were still facing with E. coli.
Our preferred cyanobacterium will be a strain from P. marinus, it will either by the SS120 strain or the MIT9313 (?) strain. Both strains have desirable properties, but we will have to make adjustments to the biobricks if we want to use these.
Tomorrow will be about further searching for information about P. marinus and it's possible use.

Lab protocol for bacterial transformation
Written by Matt D'Iorio
Introduction
In this protocol, you will be using chemically competent E coli that have been placed in a calcium chloride solution prior to freezing. The solution acts to neutralize the cells so that they don't repel each other. The bacteria and plasmid mixture will be chilled on an ice for 30 minutes. Placing the mixture in a 42 degrees Celsius water bath for 30 seconds will heat shock the mixture, which will cause the transformation. Once the LB is added and mixed with the transformed bacteria, it can be plated on the LB plate with an antibiotic. Since a lot of the bacteria will not be transformed after the heat shock, plating E. coli with an antibiotic will ensure only the transformed E. coli survive. Separate reagents from materials
Basic Terminology and concepts
Transformation – The process in which the genetic makeup of a cell is changed by introduction of DNA from the surrounding environment.
Competent E. coli – E. coli in a state where it can allow the uptake of DNA
Heat Shock – A sudden increase in temperature used to propel a plasmid into a bacterium
Safety precautions
This is a benign lab protocol, but don't forget that PPE is necessary at all times. The E. coli you will be working with will be non-pathogenic but it should still be handled properly, which means it should not come into contact with your skin or gloves. If you are removing materials from the -80 degrees Celsius freezer, do not use your bare hands or regular lab gloves, use gloves designated specifically for the freezer.

Detection
The first problem we should consider is the production of free AIP in the medium given the proper activation stimuli, which in our case is the absence of Cystatin C. This problem is a simple enzyme/substrate interaction, where as a first approximation, the effective enzyme concentration can be assumed to be
from which we considered a 1:1 ration in the   Cystatin/Cathepsin interaction. The cleaving process obey the reaction:
which can be modelled by a simple set of first order differential equations, given by:
where
is the kinetic constant that regulates the amount of free Cathepsin in the solution, taking into account the unbinding of the enzyme-substrate complex (yES), as well as taking into account the releasing of Cathepsin after the cleavage (Kcleav). We considered that no new surface proteins are generated, given that we have a negative diagnosis, this is the worst case scenario.
The problem is a bit more complex than what is presented here, given to the diffusion nature of this process, but in equilibrium it is wise to assume that AIP concentrations are steady an homogeneous in the equilibrium state. Having the dynamics of AIP described, the next step is to understand the phosphorylation process of the ComE protein.
Signaling
Our signaling system consists in the phosphorylation of the ComE protein, altering it to a functional state, where it acts as a promoter for the production of LasR. The chemical pathway involving ComE has 4 steps:
The binding of AIP to the ComD receptor.
The phosphorilation of the AIP-ComD complex.
The biding of the ComE protein to the AIP-ComD* complex
The releasing of ComE* in the medium.
in terms of chemical reactions, this process can be described as:
which can be simply described by a set of first order differential equations, given by:
in the equilibrium condition all  equations are dependent only by the initial values of [ComD] and [AIP], which are give by the equations derived in the detection section of the modelling. According  to London team the value of [ComE*] will eventually reach a limit concentration of 5x10^-11M. Considering that the detection/signaling steps reach the equilibrium state rather rapidly, it is possible to consider the response step as the limiting factor, and the initial concentration

- can act as a repressor or an activator, we would use it as an activator, binding to a promoter region B4-BARE (2.4kb) taken from a gene UGT2B4, (known primers for promoter region)
- specified exact FXR binding site, therefore possibility of integrating FXR binding site into another regulatory region
- upon binding to bile acid it would activate output gene
- In the experiment using FXR as transcription factor in human cells 30mM DCA was used, however presumably lower concentration should be sufficient for triggering of FXR.
Output:
- GFP: fluorescence = light indicator = hard to quantify
- ligaments: colour = clear indicator = influenced by the red colour of blood cells = cell free mechanism for hospital use = accurate measurement = filter/ membrane mechanism for home use
- protein expressed on surface of bacteria causing aggregation (either of bacteria or of bacteria to a substance in blood)
Modelling:
- Binding of activator to GFP gene is a positive cooperative reaction.
- Once activator molecule is bound to the enzyme, its affinity for other activator molecules increases.
- Hence, Hill equation can be used as a model.
Hill function for transcriptional activation:
k1: Maximal transcription rate
Km: Activation coefficient
n: Hill coefficient
A: [activator]
- This equation gives the % bound by activator as a function of activator concentration.
- after Hill equation modification, the system behaves like a switch
- In addition, we also need to model the diffusion of blood and GFP in the bacteria culture
Cell –free mechanism:
- for hospital use, the blood must be processed through a cell-free system to give an accurate test result, as well as the bacteria to reduce the risk if they leak from the container ( after the cell-free process, the bacteria are not able to reproduce)

Official Team Profile
Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that productive wet labs routinely face. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories, including the amount of time spent on each step, the use of specific brands of reagent, or conditions under which an experiment was performed. As such, current online protocols are often vague and inefficient, and diminish the reproducibility of experiments.
Learn more about the issues with current protocols
To improve protocol efficiency and reproducibility, we developed a free online catalog of laboratory protocols: Protocat. With a built-in rating, favoriting, and commenting system, Protocat condenses the vast array of laboratory protocols into one easy-to-browse location, increasing protocol reproducibility for labs across the globe.

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"  damage. RecA and LexA proteins play an important rule on the regulatory of SOS Recombination System.  A LexA binding site is present in all the SOS promoters genes' and it works as a repressor of SOS system. In presence of DNA damage (DNA Single Strains) RecA becomes active and interacts with LexA protein , the repressor of the SOS genes [Wagner et al., 1999]. This interaction triggers the autocatalytic cleavage of LexA and consequent destruction of its ability to function as a repressor, which results in the derepression of SOS genes (Mustard and Little, 2000; Fernandez De Henestrosa et al., 2000).
When the damage is repaired, DNA single strains are not present in the cell and the RecA protein no longer promotes the auto-cleavage of the LexA which is restored to its initial repression level.
LAB Experiment
In our genetic bi-stable, the amount of molecules produced to switch the system from the two possible steady state is ruled by LacI and TetR protein. The production of LacI molecules by UV induction can be tested replacing the LacI gene by GFP, so it is possible to have a relation of the strength of LacI synthesis measuring the value of its fluorescence. BBa_K079049 and BBa_K079050  are two new construct submitted to the registry by Bologna’s Igem Team 2008. These UV test circuits can be presented schematically by the following sequence:
Promoter Constitutive Family: BBa_J23118 (1429 strength ) or BBa_23100 (2547 strength);
LexA Operator Site Binding (K079040 ) ;

In order to generate the induction by Uv, a box with UV lamp was realized.

The pBAD promoter holds great potential to regulate the expression of the relB gene in our system, as it is capable of both an induction and repression. The HKUST-Rice iGEM team from 2015 found that the pBAD promoter exhibits an almost all-or-none behaviour upon induction with arabinose when located on a high copy vector, but allows for gradual induction when cloned into a low copy vector. Thus, it was evident that this promoter on a high copy vector would be inappropriate for the regulation of RelB expression. Based on these findings, a low copy vector was used to investigate the ability to inhibit gene expression subsequent to induction of pBAD.
RelB expression was simulated by fluorescence microscopy using a pBAD-YFP reporter system, BBa_I6058 . For this purpose, an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used with an exposure time for YFP at 200 ms. Transformed E. coli MG1655 cells were cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, to avoid catabolite repression from glucose residues present in LB medium. Two cultures were incubated, of which one was induced with 0.2 % arabinose from the beginning. At OD600=0.1, designated time 0, the cultures were split in two and 0.2 % glucose was added to one of each pair. Samples were obtained at time 0, before division of the cultures, and at 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min.   The resulting images revealed, that the inducer arabinose was required to stimulate expression of YFP, and that the addition of the repressor glucose to a uninduced culture had no effect. Furthermore, it was evident that addition of arabinose induced expression of YFP, and that subsequent addition of glucose terminated the pBAD regulated gene expression on a low copy vector, resulting in a reduced fluorescence level. 30 minutes after inhibition this reduction was already evident, and after 120 minutes the gene expression controlled by pBAD was even further decreased, as seen in Figure 19.

PUR Esterase
Cell lysate assay
Since the PUR Esterases were not secreted, initially the cells were lysed to obtain crude cell extracts in order to test whether the enzymes are active. The Western Blot results showed that the constructs EstCS2 BBa_K1149002 , PueB BBa_K1149004 and PulA BBa_K1149006 were being expressed. The cultures expressing these three constructs were grown, lysed by sonication and utilised in a colourimetric assay with the substrate analog para-Nitrophenyl butyrate. The data shows that PUR Esterase EstCS2 BBa_K1149002 is definitely active.
para-Nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NP) is commonly used to indicate an enzyme’s esterase activity. The enzyme cleaves the ester bond and releases the 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), thus causing a colour change from colourless to yellow and an increased absorbance at wavelength 405 nm.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Outreach#Events_-_-_TEXT.html," Science Festival laboratories on Paris-Sud University arrange visits and events for general public. Because it is sometimes difficult to talk about science to children, we tried to didactically approach with experiences and simple visual presentations to illustrate synthetic biology and our project.
Meeting with high school students
One of the objective of iGEM competition is to promote synthetic biology and to make people aware about the future challenges that it will represent. Thus, we decided to introduce synthetic biology to student from a high school in order to present what synthetic biology exactly is and to collect their feelings about this new science. We were greeted at the high school: “Lycée Jacques Prévert” in the city of Longjumeau near Paris.
We first describe briefly what a gene is and how it is expressed to clear their head up. Hopefully, they knew perfectly this subject.  We wanted to know what were their first thought when we told about synthetic biology without described it. They usually answered by explaining the meaning of each words: built something with biological organisms.  They were surprised to learn that a bacteria can be used as a machine to produce so many things. Then they realised that maybe we can do whatever we want and it could be dangerous.
The question of GMOs was raised at this point. They said that GMOs were only profitable for company who made them. They underlined the fact that GMOs were used for a short period and maybe we do not know yet all the effects and it might occur some side effects too. Underlying the fact that GMOs can also produce some medicine, they finally believed that it must be a good tool for high and effective production.
At the end of the day, they had all the arguments to make their own project when we asked them to write on a paper what they wanted to do with synthetic biology. We collected the paper and realised that they understood what we presented to them. Here are some of their projects:
Feed poor countries with specific transformed plant which can survived to the dryness
Transform human to have wings
Create a bacteria which can produce paper
Rainbow human: decrease racism with humans genetically modified to change their skin colour all along the day
This experience was very helpful to really understand what young students think about this new science. We did not expect them to be so open-minded and it made us confident about the future for synthetic biology.

CHATTERPLANT APPLIED DESIGN
Nowadays, most fruits and vegetables come to the cities either from intensive farming or greenhouses. Current concerns of the world made several proposes to reduce the impact that human activities have on its society and the environment. This field is no exception.
On this basis ChatterPlant looks to contribute in changing into new sustainable agriculture. Going further and controlling every single aspect of plant growth. Since SynBio and other cutting-edge researches usually get stuck laboratory benches, a real application point-of-view is mandatory for an accurate development of an innovative project. However, although we got diverse SynBio tool to internally regulate plants, we faced a lack of implementation
Thus, an integrated control system was essential in order to carry our SynBio technology to current society. A  finely detailed hardware device and a refined software tool were both key features in developing our multidisciplinary project.
BACKGROUND ANALYSIS
Our muse of inspiration was closer than we thought, nature, open agriculture and a combination of similar projects built the pillars of our main idea.
BIOART AND CUTTING-EDGE TECNHOLOGIES
Nature always has inspired artists throughout Art History, but art can also aid biology via symbiosis between both fields. Different art movements have integrated biology with avant-garde art techniques, conceiving cutting-edge bioart concepts, such as molecular and scientific photography, transgenic performances or microbiology exhibitions. In order to analyze bioart background, Salomé Cuesta, a UPV fine arts teacher, guided us where art and biology meet.
STATE-OF-THE-ART AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGIES
To date, other projects have risen to try shaking up this situation with revolutionary concepts of agriculture such us:
MIT Media Lab Open Agriculture Initiative, is on an objective to create affordable, more economical, and more innovative future food systems, controlling environmental conditions.
AeroFarms, who have patented an aeroponic growing"
NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," exosomes are injected into the bloodstream, the iRGD peptide will guide exosomes deep into tumor tissue and the exosomes will specifically recognize tumor cells. Once fused into tumor cells, KRAS siRNA will be released, targeting and destroying KRAS mRNA. In this way, the expression of KRAS will be potently shut down. In theory, the delivery of KRAS siRNA to tumor cells will be achieved, whereas non-specific uptake of KRAS siRNA in other tissues will be avoided. As a consequence, the inhibited expression of KRAS oncogene will repress the proliferation of tumor cells, ultimately presenting therapeutic effects on lung cancer.

- KP We started today with each group presenting their research and game plan for the coming weeks/months. It seems like we all know, or at least have a direction, to our next plan of action. Our E. coli turned out well and we were able to single out a colony in order to prepare overnight. After further research, it is clear that we will not be able to use T phages in our E. coli as a means to destroy cholera biofilm. We have all done more research on lambda, and it appears to be our best lysogenic phage choice. It is well studied and the mechanism for turning on the lytic cycle is very well understood.

- KK Not this Friday, but next Friday, we will have our Final Presentations. They will be done by sub-group; my sub-group is the cholera-phage approach. As part of the project, I need to attend a science seminar. Tomorrow I’ll attend the seminar by John Roth on something to do with molecular biology, then write a one-paragraph summary of HOW the presentation was done, the showsmanship of the presentation. On the day of our presentation we need to explain the background of what we have done, then go into our methods and results, then give our conclusions. Today we followed the mini-prep/Alkaline lysis procedure to purify plasmids from our overnight samples. We followed the step-by step protocol given in the kit we used. We chose to use 1 mL of our E.Coli overnight solution in our samples ... and at the end, our plasmid concentrations were low (24 ng/microL and 16ng/microL, respectively). We used the spectrophotometer in Dr. Grose’s lab to determine the concentrations of our plasmids. So, in the future, we ought to a) include Dr. Grose as we follow the protocol to ensure we are doing things correctly, and b) probably use more of the E.Coli sample to get more plasmids and hopefully a higher concentration.
- KP April Today we purified the plasmids and got them ready to be sequenced. We used Dr. Grose’s spectrophotometer."

Report regarding Bioproduction of Thepatical uses proteins
As a part of our Human Practises collaboration, we asked the Jurist of the Evry/Paris-Saclay team, Maxime de la Fouchardière, to help us about the legal issues that could come with the production of recombinant proteins in France and in general in the EU.
Studying and producing proteins for the research.
Our first question was about the production of recombinant proteins for the research purposes, would it create any issues. Maxime told us that research in France and moreover in Europe know actually very few regulations regarding the act in itself or its subject. This freedom is guaranteed by the French Code of Research. Besides this legal freedom, there are strong regulations regarding biomedicals studies, if they are conducted on animals or on human beings. Nevertheless, if GMO in research is authorized, their use and their deliberate release are strictly set by the French Environment Code. It means for us, that we can use and produce recombinant proteins as long as the GMO we use to produce them is safely kept.
But let’s not forget that our project is to produce recombinant proteins for human therapeutic use. Maxime then explained to us that in France the drug market is tightly controlled by the French Agency for Drugs Safety, the ANSM. According to the Fench Public Health Code, is considered as a drug every substance that is said to have any curative or preventive properties. To be authorized, a drug candidate must go through the Drug Marketing Authorization process or AMM in France. This a difficult procedure where the drug needs to fulfil precise criteria: it must have a favourable risk- benefit balance, have a therapeutic effect and have the same composition as the one registered in the application form. It must go through several phases of test on animals and humans where a lot of data will be gathered to provide the right information on the well-used of the drug.
This whole process can take up to 10 years and costs billions of euros.
However, it exists few case where a drug can be sold with no AMM:

In the same way, the 8.8ml of RFP DNA + sodium acetate + ethanol solution was then divided into 8 Eppendorf tubes – each Eppendorf tube containing 1ml of solution.
Both sets of Eppendorf tubes were then stored in the fridge for further work tomorrow.
Preparing cultures containing pMUTIN4
For this exercise 2 x 500ml flasks were used. Into each flask 100ml of LB solution was added (under aseptic conditions) and also to each flask 0.5ml of ampicillin was added (ampicillin resistance is conferred by the pMUTIN4 plasmid). A sample was then taken from an agar plate containing E.coli possessing pMUTIN4 and was added to each of the two flasks. The 500ml flasks were then left in the 37ºC shaking incubator overnight.
Preparing the chosen BioBricks
Mathew pipetting the sterile distilled water needed to hydrate the BioBricks
Jess carefully rehydrating one of the BioBricks from the Spring Distributions
There are five BioBricks which are likely to be used by our system. They are:
BBa_C0056 – cI repressor (lambda phage)
BBa_B1002 – Terminator sequence
BBa_C0077 – CinR activator
BBa_C0076 – Autoinducer synthetase
BBa_R0077 – Promoter (CinR and HSL regulated, RBS+)
Each well containing these BioBricks was firstly identified and marked with a pen (in the corners of the wells). Once we had confirmed that the correct wells had been identified, a pipette containing 15ml of distilled water was then used to pierce the film lids of the wells and hydrate the DNA within. After a few rounds of mixing the DNA inside the wells, the BioBricks were extracted and placed into Eppendorf tubes which were transferred to the -20ºC freezer for storage.
The locations of the BioBricks can be found here – all are contained within the iGEM spring distributions. The hyperlinks for each BioBrick below will direct you to the distribution information page:

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#safety_-_-_TEXT.html," lysis of a cell using intracellular AMP production.  Our team is using that tool as a potential method of drug delivery (amongst others discussed on our wiki), but tools are utilized to fulfill the aims of the user.  Our project could infact even be implicated in reducing risks posed by GEMs by allowing scientists to control there viability out with the lab, either by using a negatively controlled promoter dependent on a substance only presented to the bacteria in the lab or using a positive promoter to cause the bacteria to self destruct when in the presence of some chemical found widely in the natural environment.
Since we are altering a non-pathogenic E. coli strain to die in the presence of its natural environmental niche (i.e. the human gut), the bacteria will be less pathogenic, less of an environmental threat than in its wild-type form, and less of a security concern.  This is no accident, we were careful to engineer our design to minimize risk right from the outset.  The only cause for concern may be the drug our bacteria will release upon self-lysis, but because what we are performing are simply proof of concept experiments, the intracellularly-produced his-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) should not be cause for concern.  Any data we collect that presents point to the contrary will be posted on both our wiki, as well as the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts website.
St Andrews Safety
Our institution operates under the guidelines set by the University of St Andrews Biology Health and Safety Committee. We have not discussed our project with them, nor do we plan to, as we feel that the guidance of advisors who are seasoned with past iGEM competition experience should suffice.  A copy of the School Health and Safety Policy written by the Health and Safety Committee is posted and available in every lab on campus.  We received basic lab training at the start of the 10-week iGEM process, including sterilization protocols, bench cleanliness, chemical and bacterial waste disposal, how to handle potentially harmful chemicals, and standard laboratory conduct.  Compounded with the lab training most of us had received throughout our course of study, we felt we were more than prepared to handle the lab in an appropriate manner.
The United Kingdom abides by the laws set out in the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health ( COSHH ).

Correct vs. scrambled DNA program
Pictures above are an output of a 3d animation. The molecular and environmental dynamics on both scenes are the same, but there is higher amount of L-Tryptophane  (marked red) on picture a) and higher amount of violacein (marked magenta) on picture b). Eventhough the system variables may not be accurate, the picture enables us to visualise the advantage of using a DNA program (more end product).
Results
E. coli containing chimeric enzymes and either correct DNA program (123456), scrambled DNA program or no program were grown for extended time. In addition, The E.coli strain carrying plasmids with violacein operon ( Part:Bba_K274002 ), prepared by the 2009 iGEM team Cambridge, was also grown for comparison.
Bacteria containing chimeric proteins were able to produce violacein (no program), demonstrating that the addition of zinc finger domains does not interfere with their enzymatic activity (Figure 1). However, the production of violacein was delayed compared to the cultures that contained DNA programs.
Figure 1a: The bacterial culture carrying plasmids containing the DNA program roduces significantly more purple color than cultures carrying plasmids containing a scrambled DNA program or no DNA program. Cultures of bacteria carrying plasmids with BioBricks BBa_K323132, BBa_K323135 and i) plasmid containing a DNA program (123456), ii) plasmid containing a scrambled DNA program (341256) and iii)  plasmid without a DNA program were incubated at 30°C in a Luria Bertani media. Purple color could be observed in the culture with the DNA program after several hours by the naked eye, while the remaining two cultures were not colored. Figure 1a: represents cultures after 24 hour incubation. As it can be determined from the picture, the color of the culture containing the plasmid with the DNA program is notably more purple than the color of other two cultures. Figure 1b: significant difference in color of violacein extracts of the incubated cultures. Violacein was"

Education & Public Engagement
Warwick iGEM have secured a number of events in the UK as part of their Public Engagement program, and have collaborated with several organizations in a bid to help students and members of the public learn more about synthetic biology. This year, the team reached further afield by creating accessible and educational YouTube videos which have been watched around the world.
We firmly believe in raising both general awareness and understanding on the potential benefits associated with Synthetic Biology to as wide an audience as possible. However, we don’t claim that genetic engineering is without risks, and so we were keen to encourage attendees of our sessions to ask questions and debate the ethical questions which Synthetic Biology presents.
27th July 2017
International Biology Olympiad
This year, the University of Warwick hosted the International Biology Olympiad (IBO) in partnership with the Royal Society of Biology. Approximately 260 students from over 60 countries came to compete at the world’s largest biology competition. The IBO is a unique opportunity for gifted young Biologists to display their talents and to help them on their way to a career in biological research. Over the course of the week, there were two full days of exams for participants, alongside excursions and activities for both participants and accompanying adults. Besides the competition itself, the IBO also provides an opportunity for collaborations between students, researchers and academic institutions from all over the world.
We had the opportunity to exhibit at the IBO’s “Cultural Night”, where students were able to talk with our iGEM team, and discuss any queries that they had. Many hadn’t heard of iGEM before, and so we gave a talk on what the competition is about and how they can get involved in the future. In addition to this, we spoke to the students one-on-one about our project, including the applications and biology behind it. It was pleasant to see young biologists grasp quite difficult biological concepts. On top of this we also organized a game of ‘Biology Taboo’ as a fun way to introduce attendees to some of the ethical issues that can arise within the field of synthetic biology. The students made some interesting and thought-provoking points, and considered both the risks and benefits of this relatively new technology. Our homemade agar-plate biscuits were quite popular too"

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," first legal mean to claim authorship of an invention: a new age for intellectual property began.
Instead, the justification for patents became quickly socio-economic. Patents are now conceived as an incentive for production and knowledge spreading. When a patent is awarded, the description of the invention goes public, in exchange for a maximum twenty-years commercial monopoly to the owner.
Patents are actually supposed to promote innovation and the disclosure of technological knowledge, which means allowing the latest inventions to be known by anyone, though their commercial use is forbidden without a license from the patent owner until the patent ends. On the one hand, the benefits that patents are expected to offer to society are very clear as their design is specifically supposed to improve the global technological level. Indeed, huge technological steps have been made since the patent’s creation (although it is not the only factor). On the other hand, stimulating the competition FOR the market (i.e for “new” markets) by granting some kind of monopoly rents generates economic costs for society, which derive from a weakening in the competition IN the market (i.e. in the “same” market).
As a result, the patent system rests on a socio-economic balance, in which society is supposed to be beneficiary. Nevertheless, as we will further see, this balance is fragile and depends on the answers to the following questions :
What is the patentability scope ? What can be patented ? ;
How patents are granted ? (i.e.  the toughness of the conditions required) ;
What are the rights of the patent owner ? ;
How long do these rights last ?
Economic limits of the patent model
Several factors (change in laws and in the practices of patent offices, technological and industrial evolution, etc.) may lead this balance between social costs and advantages to be broken. In some cases, the patent system may lead to hamper the innovation dynamics.
For instance, narrow patents are sometimes granted to different companies on very specific elements, the gathering of which may be necessary to develop an innovation (a new product for example). Nowadays, major worldwide companies use patents as defensive or offensive tools to block competition by preventing (potential) rivals to use specific useful components.When powerful enough, these rivals strike back by doing the exact same thing on other components so that they are mutually blocked. This case is known as the ""patent thicket"" problem. As an example Google has recently bought Motorola Mobile and its 17000 patents for 12 billion dollars, which means they spent a lot of money to get these patents probably as offensive / defensive ends instead of spending it into pure R&D. Consequently patents sometimes paradoxically discourage innovation.

However, the initial cost would be very high, somewhere between $5,000-$10,000, because of the pipe system and having to pump the water mechanically. But once set up, it can maintain itself for many years.
Q: What are other ways people can be exposed to fluoride?
A: People can be exposed to fluoride by breathing in air pollution from industry, drinking tea (tea leaves are very high in fluoride), and eating certain foods - whose concentration depends on how much fluoride is in the soil and certain types of pesticides.
Ethics in Synthetic Biology Reddit Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, we created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team, the Duke, and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange . The thread was allowed us to engage with the public in discussions about ethical implications of synthetic biology. Contributors had an opportunity to talk with others about pressing current issues like GMOs and CRISPR. With this thread, we are able to reach out to the public and share our knowledge about genetic engineering and iGEM and their social impacts (and of course, to share the iGEM memes).
Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created a playlist of short lab technique videos with contribution of other iGEM teams: iGEM Peshawar 2017, UNBC iGEM, and TNCR Korea. While we created a video on serial dilutions, they created videos documenting the lab techniques of transformations, agarose gels, and ligation prep. Our intention in creating these videos was to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors! We wanted to give assistance to the group of scientists who may be new at lab techniques, and give the public an idea of what happens in the lab."

Wet lab:
The bacteria we are modifying is supposed to improve the predation capacity of B. subtilis. In order to determine if our bacteria is more efficient than the wild type bacteria, we have done predation tests by using the strain WT 168. The bacteria that our B. subtilis is supposed to limit the growth is Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25.
We have done PCR on the big pSB0K-P plasmid to reduce its size, from 9,3 kbp to 5,7 kbp, hoping the cloning will become easier. We started to clone our gBlocks pNagA, mazF and AfA in this plasmid.
Problems with the cloning in pSB1C3 of our predation genes were still present.
Dry lab:
We designed new primers to optimize the Gibson cloning of our predation genes.
Wet lab:
The iGEM Imperial College of London asked us to collaborate with them. We had to determine the optimum growth conditions (pH and temperature) of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens. We have done experiments realizing cultures in different conditions during the all day, and we measured the OD every hour. Due to these data we determined the doubling time of each conditions, and we selected the best one.
Now that the small version of the plasmid pSB0K-P is circularized, we transformed it in Bacillus subtilis. The cloning of our three inserts in the pSB0K-Mini worked, and we also succeed in transforming B. subtilis with these constructions.
Wet lab:
The problems with the Gibson cloning are still present, but the origin of the disturbance is unknown.
We started to test our promoter pNagA in B. subtilis. It was supposed to be inducible in presence of NagA, and then give off RFP. In parallel, we tried to test the efficiency of our antifungal operon. It was useful to determine if our B. subtilis is able to affect the growth of other bacteria.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html,"GAC & PAC).  On the one hand, the by-products produced after the redox reaction catalyzed by ozone (O3) have unknown ecotoxic effects. Coupled with slack control of removal rates due to the variability of wastewater content, skepticism is raised regarding Ozonation’s suitability. Commenting on Ozonation, Christian Baresel voiced: “Ozonation of untreated wastewater leads to the ozone targeting other carbon sources than the ones you want (i.e. pharmaceuticals), which leads to high ozone levels needed, which is not economical. Ozonation large scale system like the size of Linköping (serving approximately 100,000 people) is 0.1 SEK/m3 which is relatively affordable. However, you need polishing after Ozonation, and that pushes the cost quite higher’’ (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
On the other hand, despite sufficient efficiency of Activated Carbon on removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater, financial concerns associated with its usage keeps its implementation limited. Regarding Activated Carbon Christian claims that: “Activated Carbon is a better solution than Ozonation because combined with biological filters (MBR) tenfold increase can be achieved in the lifetime of activated carbon granules. However, you need to have really clean water in order to use it. Otherwise clogging becomes an issue” (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018). Even in this case, the increase of activated carbon granules’ lifetime cannot offset MBR’s installation and operational costs.
In our quest to better understand the profile of the existing solutions we visited Kungsängsverket WWTP, located in Uppsala. There, we learned that investigator engineers, Elin Kusoffsky and Jesper Olsson, concluded, after conducting a thorough assessment, that either Ozonation, Activated Carbon or a combination of both could be the chosen solution for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals in their WWTP. Specifically, the designated investigators estimated for Uppsala WWTP that 15gr of O3 per m3 of wastewater and approximately 20 minutes retention time will be needed for sufficient removal of pharmaceuticals, resulting in acceptable costs for Kungsängsverket WWTP standards. Although it was clearly admitted that the energy consumption will be increased from 0.05 to 0.1 kWh/m3 (between 10 and 30 % more of the existing value without advanced treatment) the investigators still considered Ozonation as a satisfactory solution. Additionally, Jesper Olsson’s statement “With PAC, the pharmaceuticals are not eliminated, they end up in"

Another set of plates with 10-5 and 10-4 dilutions of Chloramphenicol were prepared.
The plates were divided into quadrants with CHOP on the top left and bottom left quadrants and crcB on the top right and bottom right.
CHOP had the most growth at 100μM F at 10-4 dilution.
Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.
A fluorinase gene can be utilized to bio-remediate the excess fluoride in water."

Introduction
Many different ideas were discussed during the startup of our iGEM project. We finally decided to focus on the skin disorder Vitiligo. We have discussed our project idea with two leading Vitiligo researchers in Sweden (Mats J. Olsson & Håkan Hedstrand, Uppsala University), both who have shown interest and encouraged us to go ahead with the project. We have also been given a grant from the Swedish Vitiligo Association .
Vitiligo - in short
Vitiligo is a skin disorder causing affected parts of the skin to turn white. This is due to abnormal melanocyte function, resulting from the immune system mistakenly targeting the pigment cells, making Vitiligo an autoimmune disease. Vitiligo usually begins before the age of 20 and is estimated to affect 0.5-2 % of the world population. It is a very complex disorder and there is a lack of good treatments.
Spot on Treatment
iGEM Stockholm on the Vitiligo project This article is an effort from us in the iGEM Stockholm team to explain our Vitiligo-treatment scientific project in words that anyone can understand, consequently we will keep the scientific explanations on a basic level.
Our primary goal is to merge current scientific knowledge with an innovative new investigative approach known as Synthetic Biology, in order to hopefully help Vitiligo patients achieve faster and more efficient repigmentation of affected skin in the future.
Background
Vitiligo (leukoderma) is a skin disorder in which pigment cells known as melanocytes are destroyed,   resulting in white patches of the skin1. Melanocytes are the cells responsible for creating skin color, so when these are destroyed, the normal shade of the skin turns white. Vitiligo is in itself not dangerous and does not lead to any severe health problems, but patients’ life quality may be seriously altered by the cosmetic appearance that is a result of the white spots from Vitiligo. Between 1-2 percent of the world population are estimated to be affected by Vitiligo, with varying levels of severity. The disorder is characterized by patches occurring on the skin in various parts of the body, hair"

Theory and Bioethics
Bioethics are defined in different ways according to the subject one is applying it to. A definition that suits that view is Battin’s who sees bioethics as a hybrid consisting of philosophy, medicine and law BATTIN, M. P. 2003. Bioethics. In: WELLMAN, R. G. F. C. H. (ed.) A Companion to Applied Ethics. Blackwell Publishing Ltd. . That definition is now 13 years old and it still fits if there is added a long list of subjects to go with it. Bioethics are ethics about flora and fauna – and the hard questions that emerge in the humane world. Questions e.g. when - or if - a fetus is a person or whether it is wrong to use the nature – bacteria for example – to help the human race thrive.
Theories in normative ethics
One of the interesting aspects of bioethics, as a field, is that there is no dominating strain of normative ethics. The arguments are both deontological in nature as well as utilitarian. When an argument is deontological it focuses on duties. Deon comes from the ancient Greek word for duty or obligation. Simply put: There are some things that one just has to do and things one never does. In deontology there is a principle called Universalizability Principle which states, that for an action to be morally acceptable the maxim which the action is based on has to be universalizable NIELSEN, C. F. 2014. Deontologi In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. .
An example of a deontological argument would be “it is wrong to play God”, that falls under the category with religious arguments. Some group those arguments with teleological-, religious - and nature arguments KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The utilitarian arguments are focused on the consequences of our actions. The consequences are all that matters when it comes to the decision of whether something is morally just. The consequences which utilitarianism focuses on are utility and it’s often the most positive arguments in bioethics"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," companies and one Dutch company. To do this, we have developed a standardized questionnaire, that you can find here .
The main key points of the potential customer analysis are:
Micro lens arrays are new and revolutionary in the solar panel industry. Most manufacturers have never heard from them.
Final customers are probably not willing to pay a higher price for environmental produced solar panels.
The manufactures do not have the knowledge and the production facilities to produce the MLAs by themselves.
The efficiency is not determining for most solar panel manufactures. It is important that the return on investment and the eventual price are good.
The quality of the solar panels is very important. The encapsulation layers have to be strong and protect the cells from the environment.
The complete report can be found here .
Final users
We believe that it is important to not only take into account what the needs of your direct customers are, but also what kind of needs the customers one chain further in the supply chain have. After all, they eventually will indirectly have an enormous influence on the requirements of our final product. Therefore, we have done a final customer analysis as well. Based on the analysis it appears the solar energy market is dynamic and a fast growing market. There is increasing demand for environmental friendly and renewable energy sources (Centraal bureau voor Statistiek, 2015) . However, currently the total photovoltaic capacity is only sufficient to supply 1% of the world's total electricity consumption. It is expected that the total demand of solar panels will increase even further in coming years therefore (IEA, 2016) .
To analyze what the opinions and needs of the final consumers of solar panels are, we formulated, likewise for the producers, a standardized questionnaire that we have sent out to users and possible users. Both the opinions individuals and companies have been analyzed. The template questionnaire can be found here .
We have interviewed over 50 possible final customers. Based on their opinions the needs of the final customers have been formulated.
The main key points of the analysis are:
Final customers are not prepared to pay a higher price for solar cells because they are more environmentally friendly.
In most cases final customers do not in particularly think about the environmental aspects of the solar panels itself and the way they are produced..
If the price is comparable, most final customers would buy the most environmental friendly solar panels. However, they do not want to spent too much time figuring out what the most environmental friendly type is.
The complete report of analysis with quantitative data can be found here .

Compare this results with Are you hot? results .
One  question of interest is whether  the increment observed in the ratio IF/OD is caused by an incement of fluorescence during the time elapsed, or it is caused by a varying dilution effect due to a decrease in the specific groth rate during that period [1].
To answer this question notice that the absolute growth rate can be obtained from the regression model OD(t)= p1+p2*t obtained above. Notice t is expressed in minutes in our model. Indeed, the specific growth rate at time instant t can be roughly estimated as mu(t)= [dOD(t)/dt]/OD(t). This gives mu(t) = p2*60/(p1+p2*t) if mu(t) expressed in h^(-1).
Therefore, we took our models and weighted them by mu(t60) and mu(t120) respectively. The result can be seen in figure 6. Indeed, the increment observed in fluorescence from t=60 to t=120 minutes could have been caused by a dillution effect. Of course, the main point to keep is that the ratio IF/OD (or, alternatively IF/OD*mu(t)) increases with temperature. So...our construction works!

Modeling Yeast
For our yeast construct: How long have you been fermenting? We propose a phenomenological model to explain the relationship between glucose concentration and fluorescent protein production. The following model was assumed:
where
x1 = yeast concentration
x2 = glucose concentration
x3 = fluorescent protein
γ3 = degradation/dilution rate for the fluorescent protein
k0 = basal production of fluorescent protein
kpn = Hill-like coefficient. Notice that the exponent n also appears associated to x2.
The graph below shows a simulated theoretical time evolution for the three variables.
As observed in the figure, once the glucose is depleted, the concentration of fluorescent protein increases from a basal value. Compare this results with Yeast fluorescence results

""PERFECT BODY is a product that goes just one or two steps further than our every day life now referring to social tendencies concerning the obsession of beauty and the availability of body (and woman).  I guess – if PERFECT BODY as a product comes up on the market a lot of people (especially girls in their puberty) would buy and use it. As they than loose their own body it would change their personal life – and with this a whole generation, influencing the society itself.  If we can buy body parts (things) that adhere in a minute on my own body, that become my own body - where is than the boarder between subject and object?  How will this change subjectivity and the meaning of individualism?""

The basic design of Comput-E.coli dictates that colonies of different cell lines, containing the same general gene regulatory network (GRN), must reside in a system within close proximity of each other. Additionally, these colonies should be able to communicate with each other effectively while using a process that allows them to differentiate between themselves and each of their neighboring cells (left and right).Based on these vital parameters; the method decided upon for this critical task was Acyl-Homoserine Lactone Quorum Sensing.
Quorum sensing is the process by which many species of bacteria, and some other organisms, regulate important secondary metabolic processes/outputs as a function of being part of a large group of individuals (Waters 2005). In essence, quorum sensing allows a population of bacterial cells to act in unison as a symbiotic whole; resembling a multicellular organism (Miller 2001).
Gram-negative bacteria achieve this form of communication via small diffusible hormone-like chemical signals referred to as autoinducers (Waters 2005). Autoinducers are acylated-homoserine lactones; composed of a lactone ring and a variable acyl side chain (Galloway 2011). The autoinducer-provoked modification is executed through transcriptional control; either repression or activation. A well characterized example of this transcriptional change, which ultimately leads to a symbiotic relationship between organisms, can be found in the Hawaiian Squid Euprymna scolopes.
In this squid species, and other eukaryotic hosts, a pure culture of the bacteria V.fischeri colonizes a specialized light organ. This light organ provides a nutrient rich environment for the bacteria to grow, and in return the bacteria attain high cell densities and emit bioluminescence; which can be used as a benefit to the host (Miller 2001). The unanimous transcriptional activation of the V.fischeri bioluminescent pathway, within the culture, is achieved through AHL signaling. The development of this signal, and its subsequent effects, requires the presence of two critical AHL genes; Lux I and Lux R. After many decades of"

2.2 Device Two: Projector Tracker
2.1 Basic mechanical and optics
We need 395nm light to activate Calcium indicator protein GEM-GECO by Lumencor LED Illuminator. Then both red light and blue light activate CoChR or Chrimson by LCD projector. LCD projector and LED Illuminator are merged by a double LH Adapter contained a semi-transparent mirror. Double LH Adapter connect to entrance of light in microscope. So we can use these two light source together.
Fig. 2 Light Pathway of projector and microscope
We choose projector as red and blue light source, because we can activate single cell or //C. elegans// with adjustable color and intensity. Because the focus distance of origin lens in projector too short for our microscopy(Nikon Ti-E), a longer focus distance lens is replaced. We install a new lens in projector. To purify light of the projector, origin blue channel filter is replaced in Chroma ET480/20X and red channel filter is replaced in Chroma ET630/20X .  Dimirror is 89402bs , and emssion filter is 89402m .

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ly, we wanted to extend the scope of our solution to more than just one chemical and more than just students.
To achieve our goals, we pursued the following three measures:
1. Lesson Plan
2. Biosensor
3. Antimicrobial Footprint App
*Click through to jump to the section!
*Continue scrolling to read about our design process or jump to the lesson plan material!
Motivation
Our motivation for developing a lesson plan to be used in conjunction with our biosensor was two-fold: (1) to engage students in STEM by demonstrating that biology and chemistry have real world applications and (2) to raise awareness and accountability around chemical use by enlisting the help of students to monitor environmental levels of triclosan.
Development
To aid in our lesson plan development, we reached out to Community Resources for Science (CRS) , an organization that works with scientists to bring their work into the classroom and engage students in hands on, inquiry based learning experiences. Sasha Stackhouse and Morgan Seag at CRS provided valuable feedback on how to present our project more clearly and how to fit our lesson plan to Next Generation Science Standards. Once we got the approval that our lesson plan met their standards, we connected with CRS’ network of teachers in our area -- just a portion of their network of 1,400 teachers.
While we are excited to share our lesson with schools in the area, delivering the instructions ourselves somewhat limits our scope. Ultimately we want to reach students around the nation. To better understand how we could refine our lesson plan to allow for wider distribution, we spoke with Ann Moriarty, an AP Biology/biotechnology teacher at Davis Senior High School.
Ms. Moriarty has a background in research herself and propounds the value of hands on activities in engaging students. In her classroom, for example, students develop an appreciation for biotechnology through running protein assays and performing gel electrophoresis to verify that their restriction enzymes cut the plasmid in the right location.
Ms. Moriarty provided valuable insight on the considerations that go into developing a lesson plan- the most salient being constraints imposed by lack of funding and needing to teach to a curriculum.
In regards to budget constraints Mr. Moriarty talked about the difficulty in planning field trips due to lack of funding. In explaining the first iteration of the lesson plan, which involved taking a field trip out to a local body of water where students would collect a sample for measurement, Ms. Moriarty raised some valid concerns. For example: what happens to students who don't want to go on field trip? Who is going to cover the cost of a substitute"
BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html,"KP 5/6/13 Today we ran a gel to check our PCR products. Unfortunately it ran farther than it should have and our control came out the same as our test, so we obviously didn’t get what we wanted. Today we started three new PCR’s. BI7701, BI7707, BI23----. We will check them on Wednesday and hopefully we get the results that we want.Our picture.
5/8/13
KP 5/8/13 We did a few different procedures today. We started out by doing a PCR purification for BI7701, BI7707, and BI23.... It was successful, but our concentration was very low (11.9). We also set up another PCR for BI7701, BI7707, and BI23... It will be done tomorrow. Today we also did a digest of our plasmid and our cro insert.
KK 5/8/13 Having confirmed that our CRO insert was indeed PCR amplified (see picture above; very faint lines about 500 base pairs; wells 1-3 represent three strains of lambda, while 4 is a negative control), we performed a PCR cleanup on ALL 3 of our samples, in an attempt to isolate concentration of CRO insert possible. On the spectrophotometer our A260 reading gave us a concentration of 11.9 ng/microL.   Following that we ran a digest of our CRO insert and pLAT plasmid with pBAD promoter using restriction enzymes PST1-HF and ECOR1-HF. Our pLAT sample was a mixture of pIG12 and pIG13, which according to the parts database are the same plasmid, taken from two different colonies.  Having set our vector and inserts to digest, we started a low-melt gel with Jordan’s help. Low melt gels follow a slightly different protocol than normal gels, and use a smaller dock. Our dock was broken so our gel didn’t set very well. Because we don’t have time today, tomorrow we’ll run our vector and insert on the low-melt gel to see what happens.
5/10/13
KK 5/10/13 We were able to cut out our vector from the low melt gel, but our insert was not visible. So, today, we made preparations to run our CRO insert on a low melt gel again. I made the low melt gel and set it to cool, and to remain in the fridge over the weekend. Kelton and Clarice performed the PCR cleanup of a second CRO insert PCR reaction that"

The fatal future
If things do not change
The fatal future - This is not an unlikely situation for many parts of the rainforest if the rubber consumption and production do follow the prospects. The rubber tree is native to the rainforest and has its optimal growing conditions in tropical areas of distinct climate conditions; often regions already grown with rainforest or other arable lands. Furthermore, rubber consumption is estimated to increase by approximately 5-6 % annually. This will result in an expansion in both number and size of rubber plantations in the tropical areas of the world. Source: The International Rubber Study Group IRSG (Link)
The establishment of new plantations leads to deforestation of rainforest and destruction of natural flora and fauna. For instance, the Xishuangbanna region of China is one of the richest regions in terms of flora and fauna diversity. Most of the region was covered in tropical rainforest and broadleaf forest, but  deforestation has led to a decrease in woodland. In 1976, 70% of the region was covered in forest and in 2003, this was down to 50%. This was amongst other factors due to the establishment of rubber plantations."

Root measurements
Aim: To determine whether the different induction methods or the Methyl Salicylate (MeS) had an effect on plant growth.
Experimental setup: We measured the roots of the same plants used in the experiments to determine aphid population and predator preference (see above).
The plants were cut off at the bottom of the stem and removed from the pot.
After most of the dirt has been removed, they were carefully washed to remove the rest of the dirt.
After using the ladybugs, we collected them in a different tube and didn’t use them again.
The roots were then dried and weighed.
The roots were then measured and recorded.

Random Forest gives a lot of good predictive value-scores, which may indicate overfitting. After examining the SVMs and the RandomForest, I will use RandomForest from now on. 85% accuracy from the SVM vs 99% accuracy from the RandomForest.
The way I worked I have some cry proteins left that I havent touched with any machine learning approach, this will be my true validation set to see if the highest scoring methods indeed do as I want.

Today we started to do titers on the .5 mL fractions that were taken from the Cesium Chloride gradient. In order to get a general idea, and save some time, we did every other fraction.
We also did a spot test to verify that there was/ was not phage in the lower and higher dilutions as we suspected.
8/20/13
Today started the dilution series for the other half of the fractions from the cesium chloride gradient, so it will be ready when we want to plate them out.
From the spot test and plating of the dilution series, the fractions look like this: Plate 1: 10^-4 Plate 3: 10^-2 Plate 5: 10^-2 Plate 7: 10^-2 Plate 9: 10^-2 Plate 11: 10^-2 Plate 13: 10^-4 Plate 15: 10^-4 Plate 17: 10^-4

SURVEYS
Throughout the working process we completed a number of surveys compiled by various other iGEM teams. This has provided us with the unique ability to not only exchange knowledge, but experience too.
The first survey we filled out was submitted by Team Bielefeld – CebiTec (Germany) and it was on the Dual Use Research of Concern.
Another team that sent us their survey was Team IISc – Bangalore from India, regarding Antibiotic resistance by improving phage therapy.
Team Lund from Sweden’s survey, appropriately named iGEM Workplace Evaluation, was not only interesting to think about, but the questions evoked curious enough answers.
The next survey we completed had, probably, the most memorable name of all and it was, you guessed it, Vagineering – hormonal method of contraception. This carefully compiled survey with a catchy name done by Team Montpellier, France left us gagging, but also wanting to learn more.
Another survey we took part in was regarding the Relationship between art and science by Team UCL from the UK. It left a lasting impression on our team members and provoked good discussions over lunch.
Team Macquarie (Australia) too sent us their survey. We were absolutely thrilled to find out it was about human practices as we are all particularly interested in this subject.
Another survey we were excited to fill out was the Synthetic Biology Survey done by our friends over from Team Tessaloniki, Greece.
It was our instructor, Kristian’s job to take on the survey done by Team Warwick (UK).
The last survey we got our hands on was done by Team Estonia and it was very meaningful to us, because our country is very hot and sunny in the summer. The survey was for sunscreen usage and its impact on the environment.

Overview
 
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most harmful types of air poisoning around the world. CO gas is mostly released from the internal combustion of engines as well as the use of fuels such as wood and coal. Since CO is highly produced in urban areas, it presents a big danger for any living organism. The aim of our project is to convert CO into CO2 biologically, which then can be converted into oxygen with photosynthesis by photoautotrophic organisms. In order to achieve this, we plan to construct a biofilm containing the enzyme Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH). With the production of this biofilm, it may be possible to obtain a biological filter that can fix the ratio of CO and CO2 present in the environment. We also try to integrate a kill switch, previously developed by Berkeley, to our system for safer use of our biofilm as well as a cell limiter for better characterization of the biofilm activity

Since in this case the protein itself is the product of interest, pathway engineering as we discussed in the meeting today wouldn't apply the same way, except that an adequate supply of ATP and amino acids would be necessary. chris 20:09, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Recombinant Protein Production and Transport Outside of the Cell
A problem that is protein based drugs are not transported out of the cell, the cell must be destroyed to harvest the protein.  We could implant a transporter that can be found in a Gram positive organism into the membrane of the cell to transport protein across the membrane.
There are 7 or 8 secretion systems that are very widely studied that could be looked at for this.
Redesign Characterized Promoters into Environment-Responsive Promoters
Once we have a list of characterized promoters we could look at their design and find a similarity between them and a promoter that is responsive to either a chemical signal or an environmental trigger.  If we can redesign a promoter into a responsive promoter than we should do that for all of our characterized promoters and see if they have the same relative gene expression intensity after redesign.  If so than we could explore redesigning them to respond to a multitude of different signals.  If we do this than we would have a diverse toolbox of promoters that would be a huge step toward standardization and characterization.  - Bussingkm 15:50, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

Mr. Teng (52-year-old)      Pancreatic cancer sufferer
It was in May or Apr., 2016, Mr. Teng went for examination due to abdominal pain. At first, he thought it might be a gastrointestinal disease, but later results showed that it was actually pancreatic cancer. He had side effects like skin rash and hair loss, but his mental state is pretty good.
Mr. Teng has been applying chemotherapy since August this year. His treating cycle was 15 days of infusion followed by 8 days of withdraw, and his treatment costs 15k RMB (around 2200$) each time.
Mr. Teng did not take new treatments such as molecular targeted drugs into account because he thought it may not be practicable, and he emphasized the use of chemotherapy to get his situation under control. However, the patient did have a good understanding of new therapy, and he showed us some of the new cancer treatment that he knew before. For example, he mentioned a ‘cancer cell hunger therapy’ discovered in Zhejiang University, and also interference therapy from Japan. Mr. Teng has fundamental information related new therapy, but his understanding of cancer and therapies still left deviation.
Mr. Zheng (72-year-old)  colon cancer sufferer -> liver metastasis sufferer
In Nov. 2014, Mr. Zheng suffered from blood in his stool, and stool was too soft to form normal shapes. Then he went to hospital for colonoscopy. The results showed that there were distinctly 9 polyps in his gut, two of which have red tips. The doctor suggest two treatment options, one of which is to remove these polyps from anus, and the other option is to apply minimally invasive surgery for the removal of polyps. At the same time, metastatic cancer cells were also detected in his liver, forming two lesions of different size.
Now he mainly takes treatment combining chemotherapy and interventional therapy. Chemotherapy has been practiced for more than a year and most commonly, twice in each month. To be more exacted, he goes for 3 days of chemotherapy every 12 days. Previously he used Irinotecan, but recently it started to develop resistance, so he replaced it by Oxaliplatin. In addition, Mr. Teng has been applying interventional treatment for about once a month, but it’s not fixed, depending on his specific circumstances. The drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as ""starve cancer"

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#description_-_-_TEXT.html," this would implicate a more complex genetic circuit which takes into consideration things like the environment, inducible promoters, and secretion of the enzymes through proteic capsules. Also, it would be important to analyze which bacteria would be the ideal considering that it would be in direct contact with crops for human consumption.
A more simple application could be the creation of a spray product that contains the enzymes in the solution. In this case, it would be necessary to consider facts like the concentration of the proteins in the product, storage, proteic capsules, the protein's lifetime, as well as economic viability.
At last, the team’s vision of the project was the creation of a transgenic plant able to defend itself against E. amylovora. This vision could mean that there wouldn't be a need to use antibiotics anymore having a positive impact on the economy of the agriculture sector. However, creating a transgenic plant for the human consumption would imply several issues to consider like the genetic circuit, briefly described above, as well as the possible effects that the enzymes could have inside a human body (toxicity, bioavailability, etc.).
To be honest, at the beginning of the project, the whole team was really lost on the final application of the project due to several ideas that emerged along the project development. It wasn't until we started our Integrated Human Practices that we were able to establish this edition project as a biocontrol which the main component is modified/sterile Erwinia. We took the Sterile Insect Technique as an idea where the sterilization means that Erwinia has lost all of his virulence factors. It is important to highlight the fact that all of the genetic requirements to be a biosecure product and the implications were reviewed with gorvernamental entities (also as part of our Integrated HP and implemented directly into our design ).

Overview
Experiments
1. Designed a set of highly sensitive nickel ion detection systems and construct a genetic loop to express it in the large intestine, resulting in Nickel Hunter 2.0
2. The bio-luminescent gene luxCDABE is better than the fluorescence gene; it avoids the interference from E. coli DH5α's self-produced fluorescence, and the LuxCDABE luminescence response sensitivity is greater, which is more conducive to detection and accuracy.
3. Compared with the wild type, the E. coli with the gene nikABCDE introduced increases the absorption of nickel ions by 40%, and the detection accuracy is also improved.
4. Prepared to build a system for real-time monitoring of nickel ions using the principle of photoelectric conversion, and display these results on a mobile APP.
5. Submitted the functionally tested bio brick.
Human Practices
1. Established the iGEM club in the school，introduced the synthetic biology knowledge to students and explained our projects through the club cultural activities; conducted lectures in our school.
2. Participated in the school science and technology festival，introduced synthetic biology there，shared iGEM knowledge and our project to the people.
3. Collaborated with a high school, and used OUC-China’s comics to bring them a unique interactive class, and invited their students go to our lab to study and exchange during their free time.
4. Participated in CCiC, learned about many good HP projects from other excellent universities, discovered many problems with our own project, and helped our team make progress. Here, we received a lot of inspiration, improved our work, and also cooperated with other universities.
5. Conducted an online survey to discover people's understanding of water pollution issues and synthetic biology.
6. Designed a research questionnaire in cooperation with HBUT Dandelion Volunteer Service Team to investigate the lakes’ protection and management in Wuhan in general.
Future Plan
1. Reproduce all of the experiments that we have done this summer to make sure the results are credible.
2. Realize the real-time monitoring system, moving from idea to reality, to achieve a more convenient nickel ion detection system.
3. Add an absorption system based on the detection system.  We envisage the absorption of nickel ions by the isolation of the vacuole of S. cerevisiae.  We found two nickel ion"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,"omolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.
Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

Fig 26: The correct red one
Comparing the results from the gelelectrophoresis with the streaked colonies (fig. 27), one can see that mostly light-red colonies showed the right plasmid-size. Maybe this was the reason why we didn´t find Red_mazF with the proper plasmid in the tenth week anymore, because we always analyzed colonies that grew dark-red.
Fig. 27: Eight re-streaked colonies (LB-amp plates) from a plate with Red_mazF transformants from week 10.
Week 12 (26.09 – 30.09)
Protein expression control in culture media
Because the SDS-Gel of the proteins wasn´t that clear, so we couldn´t say if the toxins were produced or not. We analyzed the protein expression in flasks with LB-media. Therefore we prepared an ONC of Blue_ccdB and Red_mazF and let the ONC's grow to OD600 ~0,1. Four main cultures were made: two with Blue_ccdB and two with Red_mazF. We let them grow to OD600 ~0,5. When the OD600 was reached we induced one main culture from Blue_ccdB and one from Red_mazF with IPTG (1 mM). We took a sample of our main cultures every 30 minutes over several hours and measured the OD600 (Fig. 28 and Fig. 29). Additionally we plated 100 µl of each culture on a LB-Agar plate (dilution 1:100; Amp 50µg/ml). The plates were incubated over night at 37°C.
Figure 28: One Red_mazF main culture was induced with IPTG (1 mM).To compaire the results the other main culture wasn’t induced with IPTG. The OD600 was measured every 30 minutes over 3 hours.
Figure 29: One Blue_ccdB main culture was induced with IPTG (1 mM). To compare the results the other main culture wasn’t induced with IPTG. The OD600 was measured every 30 minutes over 2.5 hours.
In figure 28 and figure 29 the time was plotted against the measured OD600 to get a growth curve of the cells. The Blue_ccdb induced curve is lower than the not induced Blue_ccdB curve. Therefore we can say that the toxin in Blue_ccdB induced was produced. Additionally we can see that our cells in the not induced culture grew better than the induced culture. Red"

In this book you will find some of the interviews which we conducted with patients in Ninewells, our local Hospital. These people are our honorary team members, and we are indebted to them all. They were extremely generous with their time and helped to give us an insight into living with Cystic Fibrosis, whilst advising us on many aspects of our project, especially the design of our final product and it's implementation.
We have tried to put the patient's voice at the heart of The Lung Ranger, and we hope that these interviews convey their involvement in the project to you.

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser"

Elias explains some of the procedures used by synthetic biologists while helping children to build-their-own chromoprotein-expressing E. coli.
At the World Maker Faire in New York, the Brown University portion of our team introduced young and aspiring scientists to the world of synthetic biology. Over the course of the two-day event, the team interacted with thousands of attendees, giving individuals insight into the day by day life of a molecular biologist. Our team’s booth consisted of two hands-on activities designed for audiences of all ages and knowledge levels. Using paper cutouts, team members took turns walking subjects through the process of assembling a plasmid to expressing a chromoprotein gene of their choice. Individuals then glued their plasmids onto a paper template representing a wild type E. coli, while team members explained the methods of transforming host cells in the lab. Finally, gene expression was represented through a ‘phenotypic change’ that we demonstrated by overlaying the wild type E. coli with a colored paper cutout with respect to their gene of choice. Younger patrons loved the activity!
On another portion of our stand, teammates let individuals extract DNA from strawberries and bananas based on the procedure shown in the Bay Area Maker Faire banner above. Children and adults alike were fascinated at the ease with which large amounts of DNA could be accumulated and visualized. Our team answered many questions such as “Why bananas?” or “Why strawberries?”, to which we responded by detailing the octoploid nature of strawberries and the triploid nature of bananas. Some young attendees mixed their finished banana and strawberry DNA products, exclaiming, “Look, I made a bananaberry!”
To more knowledgable, older attendees and Maker Faire Editors, our team members detailed the intricacies of our project, highlighting the sustainability of creating a biodegradable balloon membrane. After many iterations of our interactive demonstrations, our team had created decent amounts of waste, which we sorted into recyclables, compost, and trash.

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

14. COPPER PRECIPITATION
Calibration curve:
Make 100mM solution of Bathocuproinedisulfonic (BCS) reagent.
Make serial dilutions of 1mM to 10pM CuSO4 in LB media.
Add 1µL of 1M ascorbate and 1µL of BCS to 100µL of each standard copper solution.
Measure absorbance of each copper solution at 483nm.
Use LB media without copper as blank.
Growth of the coltures:
Grow the bacteria in 20 mL of LB + antibiotic and with 2mM CuSO4 until reach an OD of 0.6.
Split the cells into two new sterile tubes and induce one of the two with 0.1 mM IPTG.
For each sample measure the OD every hour up to 5 hours.
Transfer all the media from the cuvettes to 1mL eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 13,200 rpms for 2 minutes. Collect the supernatants.
Add 1µl of Bathocuproinedisulfonic to 100µl of supernatant and mix.
Repeat this step for each supernatant you collected.

Strengths
The main strengths of carrying out market research include:
Able to understand market needs, both met and unmet
Assist in the development of new products/services
Able to influence the market with presence
Limitations
Informative market research takes time and money to carry out and then analyse. Meaningful results take time to collate so there needs to be a balance of good marketing research as well as quick marketing research.
A broad range of people should be targeted for the research to minimise any bias. The number of people involved is also a highly important factor; the sample size must be large enough to justify the meaningfulness of results.

Leiden,2018,Team:Leiden#Newsletter_-_-_TEXT.html," crowdfunding campaign took a lot of time as well. Still, we managed to                                                   publish                                                   three new pages: The featured page, the newsletter page                                                   and the crowdfunding page. Furthermore, the team page received an extensive update. It is now possible to learn more about each of our team members by clicking on their picture.
The crowdfunding page took a lot of time, particularly to incorporate some cool features. The page started out as a countdown to the start of our crowdfunding campaign and automatically changed to a                                                   'Click-here-to-donate' page when our campaign launched. On                                                   desktops, a very soothing animation of rising circles complements the DONATE-button. Programming this seamingly simple animation took great effort!
With the start of our crowdfunding campaign, the crowdfunding page (on our wiki) was in need of another update, including the Hall of Fame for our donors. In this Hall of Fame, the rising circles                                                   return                                                   once again, even more glorious this time. All donors are                                                   given their own circle floating across the page. It took more than a week to get this concept to a working web page. Make sure to check this page out (on a desktop) and don’t forget to donate if you also                                                   want a personal floating circle on this page!

During the EL CID Symposium we had multiple teams participating in our self-made Escape Room. The goal of an Escape Room is to solve the puzzles as fast as possible and escape to freedom                                                           before the                                                           timer runs out. This of course enabled us to pick a winner!

From the naked eye the slides appeared to be successful, the Gram stained slides were all purple and the spore  stain slides were completely pink, but they will be analyzed at a later date under a microscope.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
Unfortunately, we are having troubles biobricking lacZ. In the meantime we transformed B. subtilis again using primer product and got similar results.
Week 22: September 21 - September 27
Post sporulation and regeneration imaging
Michael Wilton, University of Calgary Health Sciences Campus, allowed us to use the microscope in his lab to  image the slide stains for the regenerated B. subtilis spores.  All of the slides gave desired results:
Gram stain:
All slides gave a purple colour, showing that the bacteria still behaves as a Gram-positive bacteria after  sporulation and regeneration.
Figure 10: B. subtilis post-sporulation Gram-stain.
Spore stain:
All slides showed vastly more pink cells compared to green spores.  This is good because it shows that the  regeneration of spores has a high efficiency even when the spores are only grown on LB at 37 °C overnight.
Figure 11: B. subtilis post-sporulation spore stain.
Treatment of spores
We wanted to test if the spores could still be regenerated and generate viable bacteria after the spores were subject to harsh conditions.  To do this, a collection of short term storage of spores (kept in distilled water at 4 ° C), and a collection of long term storage (kept in distilled water and frozen) were separated into five 0.5 mL tubes, one for each condition.  Each of these tubes was then centrifuged, for five minutes at 14 000 rpm,  so that the distilled water that the spores were suspended in could be removed before the spores were subjected to  each condition.  The chosen conditions were designed to subject the spores to a wide range of conditions, some of  which were chosen to simulate some of the conditions that the diagnostic tool might be subject to, such as excessive heat, while others were chosen to see what exactly the pores were able to survive through, such as chemical conditions.   The five chosen conditions were; 1% bleach, 70% ethanol, complete drying, heating at "
Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," protease is added. This would enable us to understand the background rate of transcription and consequently the rate of false positive diagnoses from the repressor being ‘leaky’. Both TetR parts were created with CFP as fusion proteins so we could visualise them in a fluorescence plate-reader.
In addition to the TetR parts, we also created auxiliary parts to test them. We have designed a non-self-cleavable TEV protease with an mCherry tag ( BBa_K2450101 ), and a DNA part which contains a medium-strength tet operator and eYFP ( BBa_K2450301 ).
The design of the pTet-RBS-eYFP is essential to having an appropriate balance between false negative and false positives for our diagnostic device. Our modelling showed that we wanted to use a strong RBS so that we could produce our output at a rate which was fast enough to prevent blood from clotting, and in a time frame that was appropriate for a point-of-use diagnostic. Thus we chose an RBS, BBa_B0030 , that was reported to have the kinetics to fit these parameters of our model, as seen in the registry and confirmed by additional teams.
The combination of CFP, mCherry, and YFP was chosen because they have very limited overlap in their absorption and emission frequencies, meaning it was easier to confidently quantify them relative to one another.
Overall, our proof-of-concept system consists of three parts:
BBa_K2450101 - TEV protease, with mCherry, expressed in pBAD33

Protein-Based System
Having identified some of the problems associated with the cell-free DNA-based system, we innovated a system that overcame these. In our DNA-based system, TEV protease is activated in the presence of cruzipain; this mechanism relied, however, on DNA expression which may act too slowly for our desired output (see section on output). We decided to generate an entirely protein-based circuit that still produced the TEV protease.

About the Team
We are a group of students from Uppsala university and we are all interested in the field of Synthetic Biology. Our group consists of most promising young talents from different education programs. The mixing of international master students of the program in applied biotechnology and the Swedish engineering program in molecular biotechnology gives our team a broad base of knowledge and skills in all sciences that compose the field of synthetic biology.
The Uppsala University has a long history of making valuable contributions in biochemistry and biotechnology. There are many research groups at the university working with projects related to Synthetic Biology. Our team is supported by the department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science (Fotomol).
Here we are, the jolly crew of the Uppsala iGEM team.

My part in this competition is mainly project development and laboratory work. I like the iGEM competition due to the large degree of freedom it offers us as students to create and explore an idea independently. Having just finished my last courses I am currently searching for a suitable project for my thesis.

During the project I have worked mainly with laboratory stuff and sponsorship. The best thing about iGEM as I see it, is the freedom and broadness of the project, from actual work in the laboratory to finding sponsors and developing your own ideas.

The application of biological knowledge in order to tackle nowadays and future problems has an incredible potential. Thus I decided to dedicate my studies towards Biotechnology. In particular the iGEM competition is a great opportunity for me to realize my own ideas, exchange with people all over the world and to learn more about Synthetic Biology.

In our wet lab part, we synthetized network and constructed plasmids transferred into Hela cells, and we made some adjustment in our design for a better realization in experiment:  We assumed that input (I) is not regulated by the network and remains constant.  We fixed two certain edges (I inhibits A, A inhibits O), because when constructing the system, the components to function as inducers are quite few. So we tend to use 2 repressors to substitute it.  We limited the maximum number of regulatory nodes to 2 to restrict the problem to an acceptable scale.  We chose relative parameters close to the actual experiments in our simulation. According to previous research, we guaranteed that most parameters are within the already confirmed range, such as reaction rate.
Basic Function Analysis -- Massive Parallel Data Processing
The ideal network in our project must be sensitive to the input signal and be able to distinguish the low input and high input from each other. So we expected that the target structure should have a low-input-low-output and high-input-high-output character. Besides, it should avoid ambiguous interim region between low input and high input.
We firstly raised two basic indexes, High-low Ratio and Interim Slope to evaluate the performance of all three-node network structures. To each structure, we scanned the value of input ranging from 1 to 1000 and recorded the corresponding output.
Then we enumerated all possible network structures and illustrated the filtering result in a 2D map. The X-axis represents High-low Ratio and the Y-axis represents Interim Slope, and there are 19683 three-node structures illustrated as docs in grids in the map. According to our target, only networks with high High-low Ratio and high Interim Slope can achieve the required function. In other words, only networks located in the top-right corner of the map are acceptable.
Finally we screened 476 three-node network structures out of 19683 network structures in total, which can achieve the high High-low Ratio and high Interim Slope. The whole process involved massive calculation and parallel data processing. Especially, it requires serious computing power to solve all the ODE equations of 19683 networks and computer cluster is a powerful tool. Computer cluster connects a group of incompact computers which collaborate together to offer stronger processor power and larger space. We finished the first round of screening with the help of High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) in Tsing"

ANALYZING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT
Advantages
The launch of biosynthetic palm kernel oil is thought to have positive effects on the global market of the commodity. To analyze the benefits, we will first give a short insight into the global market for palm kernel oil.
Figure 1: The CPKO prices from 2011 until July 2018 [30]
Since 2011 the crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) price have showed a general increase (Figure 1). As can be seen in the figure above, the CPKO fluctuate heavily and there is a dramatic pike in 2016/17. Due to the prolonged drought induced by the El Niño phenomenon in 2015, the production was down by 13.93% and therefore the export of CPKO fell by 13.46% (317.043 tons) in 2016. The reported tree stress induced by El Niño reduced the overall output and led to a higher average price of CPKO [8]. 2011 high CPKO price are related to world supply tightness of vegetable oils and low domestic palm oil stock level during this period [9].
Several factors including world population and income, governments (US/China trade war), demand (demand for energy), financial markets (exchange rates), weather (El Niño) and supply influence the price of palm oil and palm oil related products. Furthermore, the price of other vegetables oils interacts with each other.  Since in the last years China is not able to satisfy all of its soybean imports from non-US origins and is likely to shift imports from soybeans to oil palm products, the global palm oil demand will increase.  Since 2007 the biodiesel production trebled and is now claiming 18% of the total palm oil usage, but in 2018 the EU decided to ban the use of palm oil in all European biofuels by 2020, which will have strong effects on the future demand [10,11,12]. Such sparring actions between trading nations have negative impacts for the global economy, particularly palm oil producing nations and implicate uncertainties in the global market and stagnation of global trade in the commodities sector [3,8].
Over the past years the global consumption of oils and fats has grown steadily from a level of 155 million tons in 2007 to 214 million tons in 2017. The world average per capita consumption has also grown each year from 23 kg in 2007 to 29 kg in 2017. The growth"
