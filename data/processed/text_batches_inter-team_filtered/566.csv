Detection Module
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module
Detection Module
Overview
The two-component regulatory system in S. pneumoniae, consisting of the receptor ComD and its response regulator ComE was to be used in detecting the       autoinducer molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) and so detect S. pneumoniae populations correspondingly. The activity of the comCDE operon      promoter (PcomCDE) is induced by phosphorylated ComE. In order to facilitate characterization of PcomCDE, we use the phosphorylmimetic ComE       mutant, ComED58E, in the pKHS plasmid which was kindly sent to us by Martin et al., from the Université de Toulouse. The characterization of       PcomCDE is for the purpose of linkage to the σx promoters module by regulating expression of the sigma factor.
Construct
Bacterial Strain
The bacterial strain of E. coli used was DH10B.
comD and comE gene
comD gene and comE gene were cloned from NCTC 7465 S.pneumoniae strain genomic DNA by PCR using Phusion Polymerase.
ComD Tag Protein
We engineered in a FLAG protein tag in the 3’ end of ComD by including the sequence in comD extraction primer.

Fig 2. (A) Schematic diagram of a temperature controlled promoter expressing the toxin protein (mazF) circuit. (B) Fluorescence levels per OD at different salt concentrations. (C) Fluorescence images at different salt concentrations.
      We set the temperature concentration 25℃, 30℃, 35℃, 40℃. In Fig. 2, at the same OD value, the measured GFP fluorescence value increased with increasing culture temperature. In addition, the green fluorescence at different culture temperature can be visually observed, and it is concluded that an increase in culture temperature enhances the expression of a temperature controlled promoter, an increase in the expression of green fluorescent protein, and an increase in GFP fluorescence value. At the culture temperature of 40 degrees, the fluorescence intensity of the unit OD value was significantly weakened. We speculated that the higher culture temperature has an adverse effect on cell growth and temperature-controlled promoter expression.
Precise comparison
      The araC+pBAD promoter can be controlled tightly by arabinose. We transformed the plasmid consisting of araC+pBAD+B0032+mazF ( BBa_K2120002 ) in E.coli. MG1655 and induced expressions with different concentrations of arabinose.       Furthermore, the lethal efficiency of the toxin protein can only be roughly obtained by measuring the OD values. We have obtained more accurate experimental data through bacteriostatic experiments under different conditions.
Fig. 3 Point board data map. Reflects the lethal state of the toxin protein.
      Using bacteriostatic experiments, we obtained more accurate experimental data compared with the lethal efficiency of BBa_K2120002 . Under the condition of adding arabinose concentration of 50% and reaction time of 150 min,  we can achieve the best lethal efficiency, and it is expected to be applied as a suicide switch in futher environmental projects. In addition, we obtained the sequence of wild-type mazf toxin protein from E. coli and utilized it as a positive control.       Finally, in this experiment, interlab's quantification and correction ideas guided our data analysis.

This year we selected lignin peroxidase (Lip) and manganese peroxidase (Mnp), which are non-specific lignin-structure decomposing enzymes produced by white rot fungi. It can effectively degrade PCBs, PAHs, DDT, fuels, explosives, other chlorides and azides in wastewater and soil.
This year we selected the lignin peroxidase (BBa_K500000) and manganese peroxidase (BBa_K500001) from iGEM10_Tianjin in 2010. They are expressed in yeast and can oxidate phenol type which are rich in electronic or non phenolic aromatic compounds, since the electron transport system can attack substrates. After that, it can take an electron from phenol or benzene rings of phenols to oxide subsrances into free radicals, which in turn to produce many different kinds of free radical chain reactions, thereby tetracycline.can be degraded and eliminated.

The iGEM team from Göttingen helped us testing the cytotoxic activity of miniColicin in other organisms than E. coli. Shimwellia blattae was transformed with miniColicin without mutation (\(\text{mCol}_{\text{WT}}\)) and with mutation (C266A) \(\text{mCol}_{\text{Mut}}\) under control of the T7 promoter (BioBrick BBa_K525998 ) on the BioBrick backbone pSB1A3. Previously, the \(\text{mCol}_{\text{WT}}\) construct seemed to show a significant cytotoxic activity in E. coli, even without induction of protein expression. We sent Patrick (Team Leader of the killswitch team) to Göttingen and he was in their lab to carry out all the experiments. It was a great experience to work in another lab and we learned a lot about the iGEM team Göttingen and how they are structured. Of course, there were also some social events which leads to us and iGEM Göttingen stay in contact and visiting each other. Thank you for this great exchange!
The Shimwellia blattae cells were transformed via electroporation with the miniColicin variants and cultivated on LB-Agar plates supplied with ampicillin. This procedure was performed twice. In order to ensure that pSB1A3 is suitable for amplification in Shimwellia blattae, original pSB1A3 was also tested.
No significant difference in colony amount on each LB-Agar plate was obseverd between the two Minicolicin constructs: \(\text{mCol}_{\text{WT}}\) transformed cells yielded \(220\pm20\) colonies and \(\text{mCol}_{\text{Mut}}\) cells yielded \(200\pm50\) colonies (mean of the dublicate with standard deviation).
Collaboration with TU Munich and LMU Munich
One part of our robot is a do-it-yourself syringe pump which we constructed and 3D printed on our own. Also the iGEM team of Munich had the idea to work with syringe pumps . They want to construct a feature to easily upgrade a 3D printer to a bio printer. The essential part for this transformation is a syringe pump, they constructed. Since our robot basis is a 3D printer and we also use a syringe pump it was natural to work together. Munich sent us their system and we printed the"

July
Week 4
Orientation literature research, found articles on BEEHAVE model. Proceeded to read the modeling articles BEEHAVE is based on. Also installed NetLogo and ran a few standard simulations.
August
Week 1
Started looking into BEEHAVE model and figuring out how to integrate BeeT into it. Identified ways of adding mite mortality to the model. Made a very rough first approximation of mite mortality and fixed resultant bugs.
Week 2
Start looking into how to have transport BeeT into the hive. Initial idea is to add an additional 'BeeT' patch, turns out patches are hard coded into the model and adding in a new one is difficult. Got started with a new BeeT module 'BeeTproc' since the changing the patch was a dead end.

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Modeling#Fingerprints_-_-_TEXT.html," not distinctly group together which means that it would not be possible to deduce which fingerprint corresponds to which donor based on their PCs. The donor dots appear to follow faintly separate trajectories along the first PC axis, this suggests a distinct intradonal variation across all donors. This partly confirms the feasibility of a fingerprint age presumptive test.
Figure 3 is difficult to interpret due to the wide range of colours. The graph shows that the older a fingerprint is, the more difficult it is to pinpoint their age. The lack of distinct groupings between tandem day intervals shows that fingerprints do not age at a constant rate across all donors. This suggests that to construct an age curve would require intraspecificity. This allows for the rejection of the hypothesis of creating a 'one size fits all age curve' for any random fingerprint of age deduction.
Figure 4:  Age Curve for a specific donor. The lipid compounds on the graph are squalene (Red), palmitic acid (blue) and hexadecenoic acid (green). These compounds were found to contribute the most to the first two principal components in figure 1. The bars represent the standard errors.
Figure 4 is an age curve for a specific donor focusing on three compounds from the dataset. Squalene, palmitic acid and hexadecenoic acid were found to be the biggest contributors to the first two principal components. Hence, these were chosen to be put plotted exclusively. Squalene appears to significantly decrease around day 15 which was found to be slightly lower than the expected degradation at day 21, suggested from current literature (4) .
Figure 5: This is a one dimensional scoreplot that shows the aged fingermarks samples against only the first principal component. This is an attempt to view how fingermarks age across donors in a clearer graph than figure 2. This graph shows that as time increases so does the inter and intra variation.
Building on the conclusions drawn from Figure 3 . In order to visualize the behaviour of fingerprint degradation across all donors more clearly, only the first principle component was used to align the data. The result while slightly clearer, shown in Figure 5, but still difficult to interpret. There is a strong change in composition of the fingerprint from Day 0 and Day 2 that is consistent across all donors. Apart from this observation, variance appears to increase the older the fingerprints become.
Method
Principal Component Analysis is a broad term used to describe the general procedure of reducing the number of variables from a multivariate set of data while still keeping the correlations intact. PCA has many possible appliances including neuroscience and image"

In AST Space activity, at least 6 iGEM teams participated in the provincial science and Technology Museum activity. We take children to play games which help them to touch base with the science like we led them to finish the extraction of artificial colors. We also give a speech on the stage to summary the project of each team and its contribution to society. Moreover, we brought out two education lectures about metal contamination and synthetic biology in the main hall of Zhejiang Natural Museum. For both lectures, around fifty audiences participate to the lecture. The first part of the lecture explained the destruction of metal contamination and how our product can solve it. The second disseminates the basics about synthetic biology and genome biology. Moreover, we set out an experiment for banana DNA extraction which helps to support the participants to understand. In Hangzhou Low Carbon Science & Technology Museum of China we educate the public on the benefits of a low carbon lifestyle and provides space for exhibitions relating to science and technology. ASTWS-China worked in conjunction with the Museum, as well as three other IGEM teams, on a public engagement event. Eventually, three events ended consummately and successfully.
Adjust our research project
We adjust our research project and product design in several ways in response to public concerns and professional suggestions:
1. Clarify the project direction step by step, from solving water pollution problem to heavy metal pollution, then copper pollution in water and soil;
2. The strain selection of engineered microorganism and additional design of self-suicide parts for the final version product, so as to minimize the potential bio risks might bring to the natural environment.
3. Proceed the project in two phases: phase one, copper pollutant detection; phase two, copper pollution and copper industrial wastewater treatment. Add copper detection parts as a very important component of the project.
4. For application, design both a low-cost and easy-carry copper detection device as well as a low-cost and environmental friendly copper wastewater treatment system.

Repressor name: PhlF (PhlF repressor)
Part Length: 603 base pairs
Fold of repression: 83-fold
Inducer name: DAPG (2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol)
Effective inducer range(μM): 0.0244-25
In Pseudomonas bacteria, PhlF represses phlfp which regulates the phlACBD operon involved in plant defence. In our project, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) was used to induce phlfp driven expressions. DAPG is an anti-fungal derivative of phloroglucinol which is synthesised by PhlD. DAPG promotes its own synthesis by preventing PhlF from repressing the phlfp promoter.
Mechanism of phlFp - PhlF - DAPG Interaction
Figure 1. Behaviour of PhlF in the presence/absence of DAPG
In the absence of DAPG, PhlF would bind to phlFp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing GFP expression to a halt. In the presence of DAPG, however, PhlF would lose the ability to bind to phlFp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting GFP expression.

Gel extraction was performed as described the manufacturers protocol (Quiagen). However, the determined concentrations (NanoDrop) were quite low:
8 ng/µl for p123 (Xba/Pst1)
11 ng/µl for p136 (Xba1/Pst1)
This results in a yield of only about 20% (original concentrations were between 50 and 60 ng/µl) Thus, a new over night culture was prepared (see below) to gain a higher initial concentration of plasmid DNA. The next gel extraction will be performed with bidestillated water (instead of elution buffer EB), temperated at 50°C.

Methods
 
We performed a halo experiment to test if S. aureus has sensitivity to subtilin, produced by B. subtilis. This was performed in the ML-II lab of the MolGen group at the University of Groningen and supervised by Renske van Raaphorst. Below we report what steps were taken and give an overview of the results. Also we provide you with some references of the strains we used.
 
30-09-2014
 
- Inoculated three different strains of S. aureus (see below) in 3 ml Nutrient Broth (Difco). Also two different B. subtilis strains were inoculated under different conditions (see below). The ATCC6633 strain was inoculated in 3 ml LB and in 3 ml of the defined medium SMM. Also the 168 strain was inoculated in 3 ml LB. These samples were grown overnight at 37ºC in a shaking incubator.
 
 
Used strains S. aureus: (All strains were provided by Auke van Heel)
 
1. CAL (MRSA obtained at the UMCG hospital)
2. NWZ (MRSA obtained at the UMCG hospital)
3. CECT240 (Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Rosenbach 1884)
 
 
Used strains B. subtilus:
 
1. ATCC6633 LB
2. ATCC6633 SMM (Preparation of SMM (Spizizen, 1958) with trace elements (Harwood and Archibald, 1990)
3. 168 LB

- Of all the S. aureus strains two different blood agar plates were made. The first set was named CAL1, NWZ1, CECT1, which meant that per plate 200 μl of sheep blood was added to 10 ml Colorado Blood agar. These were poured in different plates and afterwards 120 μl of each S. aureus strain was streaked out on top of it.
 
- The second set was named CAL2, NWZ2, CECT2. In these plates 200 μl of sheep blood was added to 10 ml Colorado Blood agar per plate. These were poured on top of 120 μ"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,"3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) reached a final OD600 of 0.664 ± 0.033.
The results obtained by iGEM team UNIFI validate our results, since the same difference in growth can be observed between the truncated version PtNTT2(66-575) and PtNTT2. Also in a 96 well plate, E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 reached only 49.5 % of the final cell density of E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) (40.2 % for the cultivation carried out in 12 well plates). After 27 hours, the final OD600 of the strain carrying the full-length version of PtNTT2 was 0.329 ± 0.037, while the final OD600 of the strain expressing the truncated version PtNTT2(66-575) was 0.664 ± 0.033. These results clearly indicate that it is highly beneficial for higher cell densities and better growth to cultivate in larger well plates. Furthermore, shaking at higher frequencies can improve the growth, as show in the validation of micro cultivations [LINK].    The graphical determination of the maximum specific growth rates is shown in figure (7).
Figure (7): Graphical determination of the maximum specific growth rates for the cultivations carried out in 96 well plates by the iGEM team UNIFI.
Graphical determination of the specific growth rates and the minimum doubling times revealed significantly weaker growth of the cultures in 96 well plates compared to 12 well plates or shake flasks. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) reached the highest specific growth rate with 0,11 ± 0,002 h-1. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 showed much weaker growth with a maximum specific growth rate of 0,041 ± 0,004 h-1. The maximum specific growth rates and minimum doubling times are summarized in table (5).

1. 活性酸素による大腸菌の生存曲線について
<背景>
E.coli Pen製作にあたって、E.coli PenのインクにH2O2反応系の大腸菌(DH5 Alpha)を用いました。しかし、高濃度のH2O2は大腸菌に対して濃度依存的毒性を示すことが知られています。そこで、効率的にH2O2反応系を利用するために、大腸菌(DH5 Alpha)の生存曲線を調べ、大腸菌(DH5 Alpha)が死滅しない程度のH2O2濃度を求めることにしました。

Clone CRO behind HapR promoter DONE by Mid-May 4. Modify tails of phage (after C1 and CRO steps complete) DONE by summer 5. If possible, use selectable marker on phage to purify many E. Coli that have prophage incorporated into the genome. So these are the steps we set out, we need to discuss with Dr. Grose where we should be the C1 and CRO genes, because the plasmid is already very full. Personally, I need to understand the plasmid we’re using, the Lambda repression circuit, and the Lambda tail proteins better.

- KK The other cholera-subgroup is successfully growing biofilm. They have found that cholera biofilm grows best in a salty solution (their best imitation of seawater) at 37 C. Today we set up a quick experiment to see how our pIG78d+ E.Coli would respond to the presence of cholera. Using a cholera sample that was NOT growing much biofilm (the sample had been grown in normal LB at 30 C), we set up 5 test tubes. 1. 4 mL plain LB 2. 4 mL plain LB + 500 microL V.Cholerae solution 3. 4 mL plain LB + pIG78D DH5alpha E.Coli 4. 4 mL plain LB + 100 microL V. Cholerae solution + pIG78D DH5alpha E.Coli 5. 4 mL plain LB + 500 microL V. Cholerae solution + pIG78D DH5alpha E.Coli We set the overnight tubes in 30 C room on the shaker. Also, we set up two E.Coli overnights for miniprep on Wednesday. As part of our presentation on Friday we plan to present the results of whether our plasmid is functioning to detect cholera or not and why. We are still waiting for the sequencing results to come back to us. We also will present the research we have done on Lambda.
- KP I worked with kendall to set up an overnight so that we can do a mini-prep tomorrow to continue our sequencing of our plasmid. After we completed our overnight prep, we set up an experiment to test to ability of our plasmid to give off a color response to cholera. We prepared the 5 tubes that Kendall explained above, we then put them in"

For starters, we offered timely help to them around May on how to establish a team by sending basic plasmids and answering questions through social media. After many rounds of discussions, we invited them to Nanjing University to have a face-to-face communication about each other’s project on June 9th. In return for this little conference, on September 24th, some of our team members and our team leader joined the meeting up with TMMU-China along with a few other teams. It is indeed a wonderful collaboration experience and both of us benefited a lot from each other by regular discussions. We sincerely hope that we can hear good news from each other in Boston!

Design of our PAHs-degrading Bio-composite material
Figure 1:  Assembly of the basic structure
Process
Our approach to deal with the air pollution issue was inspired by nature. Atmospheric water condensation is able to naturally absorb and concentrate atmospheric particles. Therefore, we imagined a framework that can condense water droplets. The mechanical aspect of our bio-filter device is based on the spider web structure.
However, the main component is the enzymatic system capable of attacking and degrade PAHs.
A. The PAHs degrading enzyme cocktail
Our device must be able to degrade air pollutants. We chose to focus on the degradation of the organic components namely the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and more precisely the anthracene molecule, an endocrine disrupting and carcinogenic pollutant. We implemented a 4-step degradation pathway of this molecule, requiring 4 different enzymes.  The anthracene pollutant which is originally insoluble in water may, at the end of the degradation process, be recovered as sub moieties in an aqueous solution.
The PAHs are stable molecules that can be degraded through complex and very aggressive chemical processes. Due to the specific resonance properties of anthracene, it can be chemically modified on the central ring by oxidation through hydrogenation, oxidation with anhydrous chromic acid Cr03, yielding anthroquinone.  However, as we plan to use a biological process to proceed to the degradation of PAHs, we had to devise an alternative strategy for attacking the aromatic systems present in them. The first enzyme we chose is naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida.
This enzyme is a homodimer (E1-1 (BBa_K2198000), E1-2 (BBa_K2198001)) that is able to attack the lateral ring of anthracene to introduce the same modification as the harsh chromic acid chemical step, i.e. an oxydative hydrogenation (Figure 2.a). This oxidation with dioxygen forms a vicinal diol and adds two hydrogens"

Elipse shaped colony can also be observed at 10 -4 M however a large spread of bacteria can also be observed to the right side of the plate. Bacteria exposed to 10 -2 M, 10 -1 M concentrations, appear as circular colonies, however the colony spread is smaller it is possible due to saturation by malate at high concentrations.

UCL_PG,2013,Team:UCL PG#Social_-_-_TEXT.html," them to be interested… To me, my art is the converter-tool needed to translate outstanding research to the public. This is the first step to get a greater public response.”
We recently had a chat via Skype with the Germany based multitalented artist, discussing the possibility of working together in an attempt to initially get the public interested and, in a long term, involved in science based research. His approach is the obvious one: “We produce art and make it public”.
Engaging with the public via this straight forward approach inspired us to be more optimistic about the link between science and public awareness and engagement. Manuel agreed to work with team SPECTRA, because: “Cancer is such a devastating development within the body. Raising awareness is very important. I like aspects of competitions like iGEM, especially that it shows research from a different point of view – more accessible, like I try to do within my art.”
Interacting with other teams
We had kept a close connection with UCL Undergrads team, Spotless Mind. We helped each other in resources and sharing ideas. Coming from Cancer Insitute, we gave away many clues of cell cultures and cloning.
Attending YSB 1.0 is a so much fun. We met many teams across Europe, presented our idea, slides and posters, and received many valuable feedback from all the teams.
Following that, we established collaborative contact with iGEM team from Exeter after knowing we are both working on photosensitive circuits.

Luna Eresta Jaya
The Teacher. Luna is a great teacher and leader. She’s very organized and quite perfectionist in her work. She is clear about what to do in the next step and focus on how to modify experiments in order to get a more reliable and persuasive result. Every day in the lab becomes smoother and easier because of the Workflow Plan that she initiated for our group. She’s also very good in delegating work for other people while considering their strengths and weaknesses. Besides, she’s secretly a quite sensitive and careless person, but she’s very professional when it comes to work. She also loves to tell jokes (although some of them are not funny) and take good photo of our team so that we can leave behind wonderful memories.

Mike Dorothea
She is a very well organised people and very responsible. She always asks us for the content we need to present before the general meeting and then send the email. It is lucky for us to have her to be our secretary. Also, she is good at using photoshop and other software and is willing to teach us to use it. It helps a lot when we need to design a team logo and t-shirt. And she loves singing, she always sing when she is waiting for the PCR or gel.

Olivia Winata
The Gel Loader. Olivia, or usually called OW, is super helpful and responsible in everything. She is very good in handling any work in the busiest days in the lab, she’s also known as the gel loader due to her talent in it. Her hobby in the lab is filling pipette tips box, while singing. Basically she sings every time there’s any waiting time in doing lab work, even during heat shock or cold shock. Funny thing about her is her panic response. Whenever she suddenly finds out something wrong, she will say “eh.. eh..” with a slightly louder voice.

Raymon Rui Chen
Raymon spends a lot of time studying and aiding the work in modelling for the tri-stable switch. Moreover, he is always willing to provide help to people who are short in hands. He is the kind of person that you want to work as a partner since he is hard-working and willing to pursuit an accurate and reliable result which often requires more work. All in all, Raymon is a reliable and undoubtedly valuable member to the team"
Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#BacillusSubtilis_-_-_TEXT.html," unsporulated cells remaining, the eppendorf tube containing the spores was placed into a dry heat block at 90°C for 10 minutes which would be high enough to kill any normal cells. To reanimate the spores and to observe if they preserved the mutation that allowed the cells to change colour after sporulation, the spores were streaked on two plates, one containing nutrient agar and 200μg/ml of X-gal and one containing only nutrient agar as a control. The plates were incubated overnight and the results are shown in the figures 3 and 4 below.
Figure 3: Bacillus subtilis Sporulation Test - Negative Control
Figure 4: Bacillus subtilis Sporulation Test
As can be seen in these images, the growth on the plate that contained X-gal turned blue-green and the growth on the plate without X-gal stayed white as expected. This proves that throughout the sporulation process, the Bacillus subtilis cells retained their mutation that allowed for a colour change to occur.
Conclusion
As such, we can conclude that this bacterium would be ideal for use in our design should we have the chance to work on it for a longer length of time. The Calgary 2014 iGEM team worked on a Bacillus subtilis based biosensor which could provide further knowledge should a team want to explore this avenue in the future.

4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
The main use we want to give to our project is to generate metabolic reactions within the BMCs, and thus decouple metabolic pathways from organisms and bring them to an in vitro level. This pipeline will help to solve biosafety concerns and problems. For example, not using any kind of microorganisms (MO) for those processes will decrease the use of selection markers such as antibiotic resistance cassettes and the lateral gene transfer would be much more difficult.  Additionally, another important point in the global discussion on GMOs such as the effect of synthetic MO in the native organisms could be avoided. As we describe above, we hope to reduce the use of living organisms and all complications in terms of biosafety that entails.
Our project has another relevant feature: an autolysis system. It meets two very important functions, one of them is helping the extraction of BMCs and the second one is that it is safety way to eliminate the microorganisms that we are using. With those functions, we are making sure that it will not be dispersed to the environment.
Click here for more information about the autolysis device.
Other idea that came to our minds in a certain point of this project development is the generation of bricks with removable resistance. This could be achieved using an invertases-based system in which the invertases come from phages. Thus, we would generate deletions in the DNA regions with the resistance and later switch the resistance locus with  a new marker like a a fluorophore or chromophore.
Through this simple strategy, Synthetic Biology could face one the main drawbacks of not-target strains with undesirable antibiotic resistance. It is well known and documented that some laboratory bacterial strains are antibiotic resistance and they represent environmental risks because they could transfer the resistance to other pathogenic bacteria or other unwanted organism.
Our idea is inspired by the somatic recombination of the immune system. This immune strategy is based in the principle where RAG-1 and RAG-2 recognize specific segments called Recombination Signal Sequences (RSSs). The complex of proteins can invert or remove segments of DNA from the genome depending on the position of the RSSs. The whole process is performed in order to generate"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-3_-_-_TEXT.html," we sent it out.
Another small group designed a poster to be displayed at the Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. This poster included details about our three parallel experiments, our research, and our outreach. Three team members presented the information to interested audiences at the Symposium.
After successfully linearizing pUC19 and pXRL2, we repeated the same experiment with larger volumes to get more product for future use. Using this product, we performed several DPN1s and clean and concentrate experiments. The first four tests were failures. We used both our advisor’s reagents and Zymo’s reagents. Our solution that eventually worked was to prewarm the 30 uL water we were using as the elution buffer and let it sit for several minutes, in the final step. On the fifth experiment, the clean and concentrate worked but still not very well. We tried one more time using only 10 uL water to elute and got sufficient concentrations for our Gibson reactions.
We tried many PCR reactions with the new templates but still saw multiple bands for each gene, so we decided to extract the correct bands from the gels and use those as our templates. We tried using larger reaction volumes in the gels to get more DNA from the gel extraction, but we didn’t get clear enough bands to properly extract the correct sized genes. We also tried amplifying the loxP-URA3-lox71 gene cassette with our existing primers, but the reaction didn’t work due to the difference in annealing temperatures between the forward and the reverse primer.
This was the week in which we discovered our collective error in the PCR protocol we had used up until this point. This was a lesson to us and the rest of the team about blindly following protocols without questioning them. Upon redoing our PCR experiment with the corrected protocol in a 10uL reaction, our gel showed bands indicating a successful linearization. We also went through the protocol for the creation of chemicompetent yeast cells in anticipation for our transformation into Y. lipolytica. Protocol was successful and yielded 2.5 mL of glycerol stock of our chemicompetent Y. lipolytica.
The glycerol stocks of E. coli were successfully streaked to verify viability. Contacted lab support for pH meter electrode issues.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulans from which we borrowed a CBD sequence [2]. Our first glue candidate uses this CBD in a fusion protein of four CBD’s with GSGGSG linkers in between each; our hope was that this could act as a mycelium specific “cross linker” in a sense. Our construct also included a six residue polyhistidine tag and a Lumio fluorescent sequence (CCPGCCGAGG) for detection with Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Lumio Detection Kit [3].
Another protein-based adhesive candidate we investigated was csgA, the major subunit of the bacterial curli system which is secreted in monomers and self-assembles into longer polymer fibers that contribute to the biofilm formation [4]. The csgA protein has been known to be highly adhesive and have amyloid-forming properties, so it was reasoned that it would be a good starting point for bioadhesive proteins [4]. Furthermore, the manner in which csgA fusion proteins express the functionality of the introduced polypeptides while retaining their self-assembly behavior has made them a molecule of extreme interest in engineering functional biomaterials [5].
Our third glue candidate was a combination of the first two: a csgA-CBD fusion protein. We hoped to take advantage of the self-assembling nature of the csgA as well as its known tendency to aggregate under isoelectric conditions [3, 6]. The rationale for this fusion protein was that csgA has a strong affinity for binding its own monomers and CBD of course has a strong affinity for binding chitin. We theorized that a fusion protein with both of these domains would bond tightly to itself and to the mycelium surface.
Lastly, we decided to test the mussel foot fusion protein fp151 developed by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology [7]. The fp151 fusion protein is comprised of repeats of the most adhesive segments of marine mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) 1 and 5 [7]. MAPs are the proteins responsible for adhering marine mussels to the rocks and other hard surfaces they live on in marine ecosystems [7]. It is thought that much of MAPs adhesion properties’ can be attributed to the high number of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-alanine (L-DOPA) residues, which require the hydroxylation of tyrosine [7]. To facilitate this post translational modification, we ordered an additional DNA construct encoding the tyrosinase enzyme, which would be able to hydroxylate tyrosine residues in vivo. We also ordered mushroom ty"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.

Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.

Pre-analysis
1.We've carried out an eSWOT Analysis. eSWOT is an enhanced SWOT analysis in order to evaluate Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) of our project.
So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you can win a hundred battles without a single loss. If you only know yourself, but not your opponent, you may win or may lose. If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself.-The Art of War by Sun Tzu
In order to holistically evaluate our idea in the context of the real world, we explored the process of identifying favorable and unfavorable factors during the SWOT analysis after examining the findings of the Helms & Nixon., 2010 [ 2 ]. We employed a brainstorming method of our own invention termed PCR (Parameter Chain Reduction) analysis in order to feed validated-only SWOTs in the final analysis. Our PCR includes the following steps:
(1) Possible SWOTs are proposed through team discussions.
(2) SWOT candidates are decomposed into simplified complementary statements.
(3) Socratic method (also known as maieutics, method of elenchus) is utilized as a way to thoroughly investigate possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The team is divided into groups of two interlocutors, one that asserts the proposed SWOT statement and one that targets for refutation.
(4) Only SWOT candidates that survive the in-depth debating (during multiple rounds) are tampulated in the final eSWOT analysis.
eSWOT Analysis helped us realise the opportunities of our idea and inspired us on finding other future applications of pANDORRA.
2. We've created a Stakeholder/Value Matrix to identify all stakeholders that might have interests or concerns regarding the proposed project. We've obtained our first look of a sample of multidisciplinary experts who can provide greater insight into detected or emerging project issues.
Stakeholder/Value Matrix worked as another reminder of how important biosafety and the safety of patients is. Therefore, we worked even harder to chisel a project with as many safety checkpoints as possible.
3. We've created a Stakeholder (Expert) Map in order to map the stakeholders (experts) according to power and interests.

Safety
In our project we want to establish a new production platform for biofuel production                 based on ‘artificial endosymbiosis’. We choose two of the most used and well established                 model organisms in genetic engineering: Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.                 By following and extending the guidelines for responsible and safe research, we are able                 to ensure minimal risks to experimenter and environment. Here, you can find all important                 safety aspects we followed through the course of this summer. Additionally, we focused a                 whole side project on safety - we created a complete database of all kill switches ever                 designed within the iGEM competition and were able to model four of them in detail.
Lab Safety
Before starting our lab work, all students received a detailed safety instruction by covering                 all important aspects of working safely. This instruction was held by the safety officer of the                 Max Planck Institute for terrestrial microbiology Prof. Dr. Brandis-Heep, as well as Volker Vincon.                 A lab specific safety instruction was also given by our instructors. This covered for example:
proper behaviour in the lab, S1 safety measures and practices
documentation of experimental work
use of personal protective equipment
waste disposal of biological samples
chemical handling and hazards
accident prevention measures
fire safety regulations and emergency behaviour
Additionally, each student received an in depth training in every facility and for every instrument                  we had to work in or with (e.g. confocal microscope, FACS, HPLC) and was supervised during their measurements.
Project Safety
Since our project is meant to work as an industrial scale production, we wanted to keep safety                  issues as minimal as possible. Especially concerning our ‘endosymbiosis’ approach, we rejected                  several ideas for safety reasons. In the beginning of our project we wanted to use invasin and                  listeriolysin as an invasion method for our symbionts - this mechanism originates from Yersinia pestis and Yersinia tuberculosis and is part of their virulence factors,                  which makes them BSL3 and BSL2 organisms, respectively. Therefore, we choose a different and passive                  approach,  a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated fusion of vesicle enclosed microorganisms with                  yeast spheroplasts, which does not involve any pathogenic factors and therefore is harmless for                  humans"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," set of sgRNAs is generated for our fusion protein, we determined the time during which the detection of the gene doping DNA in an athlete’s blood sample is possible. This was accomplished by modelling gene doping administration. We considered the entire process of gene doping to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of gene doping and its effect on the athlete. With our chosen model gene being the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene based on the recommendation by Prof. Hidde Haisma from Groningen University, we included the EPO dependent production of red blood cells in our model (figure 2).
Figure 2. A representation of EPO based gene doping. Viral vectors infect kidney cells, increasing their production of EPO. The increased concentration of EPO in the blood leads to an increased production of red blood cells. The endogenous production of EPO is inversely related to the red blood cell count.
Vectors in Gene Doping
A vector is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to carry foreign genetic material into another cell. Once, there it can be expressed and replicated. The effect and detection of gene doping is highly dependent on the vectors that are being used. In the early stages of our project we spoke with Prof. Hidde Haisma from Groningen University, a gene doping expert, who told us the main vectors he would expect athletes to use. He suspect that the most common vectors are plasmids and adenoviruses, because of their relative safety compared to vectors that integrate the DNA into the genome of the cell. Integrating vectors, such as the retrovirus, present the threat of insertional mutagenesis which can lead to the development of cancer. Table 1 shows our analysis of possible gene doping vectors and some of their properties based on the work of Ratko et al. 2003 .

(Link) Accessed 17 September 2015 Thus the amount of peptide aptamer bound to target protein, provides a measurement for the affinity. The ELISA is competitive, thus the amount of target is realavlively small compared to that of peptide aptamers, this means the peptide aptamers will have to “compete” for binding the target protein.
Figure 1: Illustrates the detector with the Sensor chip, as the aqueous solution containing the target proteins flows by.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a technology designed by Biacore and could be used to investigate the affinity and the specificity of the peptide aptamer.  Central for the SPR method is the movable sensor chip. This chip monitors the interaction between the peptide aptamer and its target. The operation of the instrument, data and the analysis of the data will be handled by a software. The sensor chip consist of a glass surface covered with a thin layer of gold, which forms a good basis to optimize the binding of a variety of molecules. To this chip the peptide aptamer would be bound. The target proteins will pass over the surface of the chip in a continuous, pulse-free and controlled flow, maintaining constant target protein concentration at the sensor chip surface.   SPR measures changes in refractive index, thus senses changes in mass in the aqueous layer close to the sensor chip. Reference: An Introduction to BiaCore's SPR Technology. Available from BiaCore.com (Link) Accessed 17 September 2015 Figure 1 illustrates the principle.  This method would besides providing quantitative information of the peptide aptamers affinity towards the target, also provides information of its specificity.
Since we have been working with E. coli BTH101, a β-Galactosidase Assay would also be an option for examine the affinity of the peptide aptamer towards the target. The assay exploits β –Galactosidase’s ability to recognize the synthetic compound o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside (ONPG). The enzyme cleaves ONPG to galactose and o-nitrophenol, which has a yellow color. The production of yellow color can be used to determine the concentration of the enzyme, since when ONPG is in excess to the enzyme, the production of o-nitrophenol is proportional to the concentration of β-Galactosidase. From the assay, the miller unit"

$$DF = \frac{No. of cells * V_{E.coli}}{V_{Bead}}$$
Figure 6 Predicted XOR behaviour for the whole cell model with leakiness
.
With Leakiness and Crosstalk
We modelled cross-talk by fitting Hill-functions to experimental data.  For each quorum sensing module, there are two levels of cross-talk . At the first level, we could have any of the two AHLs binding to a given regulator thus activating the promoter while at the second level there is cross talk between regulators and their respective native promoters. Thus, for activation of a given promoter, we can have four Hill functions corresponding to the combinations of inducer and regulator interactions. Since we are using two quorum sensing modules activating two different promoters, we have eight Hill functions.
As all the measurements were in terms of fluorescence, the Vmax for each Hill function was also in terms of fluorescence. In order to observe the effect of cross-talk we normalized the Vmax of non native interactions (in Lux system, PLux being activated by LasAHL-LuxR, LasAHL-LasR or LuxAHL-LasR complexes) with the Vmax of the native interaction (LuxR binding to LuxAHL and activating PLux). These ratios acted as weights for the effect of a non-native interaction on the promoter.
Figure 7 The four cases for the whole cell with basal leakiness and cross-talk
For an ideal whole cell model, it was necessary  to have no or minimum leakiness and cross-talk. However, in reality this was not the case. Although we were able to reduce leakiness significantly using riboregulators, we still had the issue of cross-talk. However, we observe that the system acts as an XOR gate till about 300 mins even with cross talk.  In Figure 7 we observe the four cases with both cross-talk and leakiness.
Figure 8 The four cases for the whole cell with basal leakiness and cross-talk
Figure 8, shows the predicted XOR gate performance by a single cell model with basal leakiness and cross talk for different concentrations of LasAHL and LuxAHL at the end of 270 min. The system turns OFF when the input concentration of either AHLs is greater than 100 nM due to the effect of cross-talk.

3. Lycopene pathway
(Group: iGEM2009_Cambridge)
 
Assessment:
 
Lycopene is visible red and its substrate, FPP, is colorless. So measurement is quite feasible. But there are at least three proteins in this pathway, which will increase the burden of cell. But in future work, we could have a try.

To minimize the background fluorescence from the media, synthetic complete without riboflavin and folic acid was used since they have been reported to be fluorescent [2].
The cells were grown in this media overnight to reach an OD high enough for inoculation of the microtiter plate for the BioLector.  The cells were inoculated in the mirotiterplate in 1 ml media with an OD of 0.15 with the following carbon sources
1.glucose (20 g/l)
2.ethanol (15,7 g/l  = same cmol as glucose)
3.galactose (20 g/l = same cmol as glucose)

Interlab help out
Over the past two years, iGEM has advanced the frontiers of science with the two biggest interlaboratory studies even done in synthetic biology. These studies establishing a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements and identified likely key sources of error, and have now been published as an open-access journal article in PLOS ONE.
But some accidents occur during the delivery, so we turn to each other for help. We offered device 3 plasmid to JLU and get positive control of Interlab from NKU and give back device 2 plasmid.
We are grateful for the concept raised by the iGEM committee that all iGEM teams should offer each other helps during this whole voyage of attending iGEM competition. This had indeed brought mutual benefits and long-term friendships to teams.
In all, HUST-China is a friendly and helpful team, we are eager to help more in the whole iGEM and synthetic biology~"

Cell free expression of Encapsulin
We exploited the fact that Encapsulin is made of protein exclusively, and thus, can be fully expressed as a recombinant protein in a bacterial expression system. However, accelerating the pace of the vaccine production requires a new approach for the rapid expression of proteins encoded on plasmid/linear DNA constructs. Current standard bacterial expression systems require days due to cloning and in-vivo transformations.
This is why CAPOEIRA uses a cell free expression approach, which preserves the protein production capability and regulatory mechanisms of E. coli. Cell-free systems (Figure 7) use all of the inner workings of a cell without having the constricting boundary of the cell wall and thus the precondition of keeping cells alive ( Rollin et al., 2013 ). This allows speeding the design-expression process. When preparing the cell-free systems, all genomic DNA and membranes are eliminated, resulting in a solution containing all of the cells proteins without the limiting factors of a living cell.
The cell free expression has 2 advantages in for CAPOEIRA:
Faster expression of proteins from DNA constructs (8 to 10 hours of expression), allowing for fast and easy expression of libraries of proteins
Faster & Easier purification of protein products from cell free expression reactions compared to purification from cells
Figure 7. Cell Free Expression of the Vaccine
Heat Purification of Encapsulin
The combination of a protein with high heat resistance further improved after Histag modification, along with a cell free expression system allows for an efficient one-step heat purification of our vaccine product. In short, after the expression of the vaccine construct using the cell free expression system (which takes around 10 hours), heat purification of the sample goes as follows (Figure 8):

The bacteria would have to be separated from the milk in order to not spoil it though. A stripe like the coolness indicator on beer cans would warn you if the milk is bad.
Detection of movement A system consisting of two organisms, a) Bacteria and b) a creature able to move over solid surface (Amoeba, nematode, snail…). The bacteria would cover the ground (agar plate) completely and would detect the organism moving over them, either by a chemical which this organism releases or by pressure, depending on size of the moving agent pressure might not work, and start to produce a fluorescent or color signal hence leaving a mark of the organisms way .Using chemotaxis the organisms could be sent through a maze or be steered in order to gain world domination.
The tron version of movement detection In addition to a color or fluorescence marker the bacteria also produce a repellent for the used organism. This will hinder the organism of crossing its own path or the path of another “Player”. Which basically is what Tron does. For all sorry souls who have never played it: http://gamepuma.com/action-games/Tron.html

This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing the two sites to attL and attR at the meantime. This inversion can be reversible by appropriately controlling the conditional expression of integrase and an excisionase in Bxb1 named gp47 at certain ratio. We change start codon ATG to GTG for a appropriate expression quantity.
The second one contains a switch, two reporters, two RBS and terminators. At first, the plasmid expresses GFP, when gp35 is expressed, the switch will turn around and RFP on the other side of the plasmid is going to be expressed.

Map of those two circuits are shown above. And figures below show us circuit 1 and 2 using Agarose Gel Electroporesis.
We performed experiment to see whether our circuits work. From the figure above, we can find out that when only circuit 2 is transformed (A), GFP is expressed, when both of the two circuits are transformed, the switch turns and RFP is expressed.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,"C protein binds to the half sites araO2 and ara I1 which creates a loop within the DNA, thus blocking the RNA polymerase from binding to the pC and pBAD promoters. This can be seen in Figure 2, where it’s possible to comprehend the position of the relative half-sites.
Figure 2: The red circles in the AraC pockets denote the inducer, L-arabinose. (Schleif, 2003)
When arabinose is present, it binds to the AraC protein and this destabilises the AraC protein binding to the araI1-O2 half-site looped complex, but stabilizes binding to the adjacent half-sites araI1 and araI2, which are upstream of the pBAD promoter. This then ‘straightens’ the DNA loop, (Carra and Schleif, 1993) allowing the activation of the transcription of pBAD (Schleif, 2011).
Creating a model
The modelling was established using the theoretical equations used in St Andrews 2010 iGEM team which can be found in their wiki under the subheading “Typical ODE Elements”. Our system is a series of five ordinary differential equations which attempt to mathematically describe the very basic functions in our biology, they are as follows:
List of Equations
Notation Table
Programs Used
We considered coding our own basic iterative method but consequently decided that there may be too many complications and bugs to worry about so opted to perform our modelling in the MATLAB environment. We also opted for the same strategy that last year’s St Andrews team adopted, namely the 4th order Runge-Kutta solver. This solver is inbuilt to the MATLAB environment, and is stated as ode45.
Parameters Used
The various parameters were researched throughout previous iGEM team’s findings, several journals and numerous articles. The initial relevant findings and their sources are given below:
Referring back to the equations, it can be seen that we had difficulties in locating five of the parameters within any literature. These particular constants and constraints were attempted, via parameter sensitivity analysis, at being established. We used ranges for these elusive parameters to find optimal values.
Parameter Ranges
These rates were estimated from a variety of sources. The optimal extracellular arabinose concentration is actually assumed to be around 1x10-6M, as if the extracellular arabinose concentration exceeds 1x10-7M then it allows the induction of the AraC promoter [8] and according to the Standard Registry of Biological Parts [1"

S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module
Overview
The activity of Com-Box promoter is turned on by a specific sigma factor that is produced by a regulatory gene comX. The σx will bind to the Com-Box promoter region and activate gene expression. σx serve as an inducer with high specificity as it binds to an area of several specific 8 base pairs (TACGAATA) on the Com-Box promoter. This σx-Com-Box system could be used as a highly specific reporting system in our S.pneumonia detection platform. However in nature, ComX protein will be degraded by ClpXP enzyme which exists in E. coli and some other bacteria. Hence, to ensure the induction of Com-Box promoter by σx, ComW protein is needed as it functions to protect σx from being degraded by ClpXP. ComW protein will be degraded instead, increasing the amount of σx produced.
Construct
The three main components of the construct are comX gene, comW gene, and Com-Box promoter. We assembled comX and Com-Box promoter in one       vector plasmid, while comW in a different plasmid. The system will be fused with a tagging protein and a reporting protein. Tagging protein is essential       for detecting the σx and ComW protein expression by means of western blot. Reporting protein which is fluorescence protein is needed for       reporting purpose, hence σx-Com-Box system could serve as a specific reporting system that will be useful for many synthetic constructs. σx generator and Com-Box promoter construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one plasmid.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Pace_-_-_TEXT.html," split T7 polymerase towards improved auto-reassembly. Furthermore, we outline our unexpected journey on setting up PACE from scratch. Finally, we provide detailed information about our PACE bioreactor and the protocols required for running it. Taken together, we created a custom-made PACE bioreactor and demonstrate its successful application for in vivo directed evolution.
Introduction
Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) is a powerful in vivo directed evolution method invented by Kevin Esvelt (now at the MIT media lab) and David Liu (Harvard University)
RN44'
. It can in principle be applied for directed evolution of any gene or protein of interest (GOI and POI, respectively), provided that the function to be evolved can be coupled to gene expression in E. coli
RN44'
. Conceptually, PACE mimics a closed evolution circle composed of (i) variant replication, (ii) mutation and (iii) selection in a bioreactor.  The basic principle of PACE is shown in Figure 1. In brief, PACE employs M13 phages that encode protein of interest (POI) to be evolved. These phages have a knockout for gene III, an essential M13 gene essential for phage replication.
Figure 1: Basic principle of phage-assisted, continuous evolution. (see main text for details).
During PACE, the POI-encoding phages are propagated of E. coli host cells carrying two plasmids. One it the mutagenesis plasmid (MP), which encodes highly mutagenic genes strongly reducing phage replication fidelity and error repair. As these genes are toxic to the E. coli host, they are set under control of an arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter. Different MP variants have been reported, which cause mutation rates up to ~2.3 substitutions per kb during phage replication when fully induced
RN159
, thereby highly accelerating the evolution.
The second plasmid is called accessory plasmid (AP), and is the PACE component inducing the selection pressure directing the evolution towards the desired goal. The AP thereby encodes gene III, the aforementioned essential M13 gene required for phage replication. Importantly, gene III expression from the AP is made dependent on the function of the phage-encoded POI, e.g. via a synthetic circuit. In other words: the AP induces a selection pressure towards optimizing POI for the function required to activate gene III expression. In the simple case of evolving a transcription factor as depicted in Figure 1, gene III would simply be expressed from the promoter"
BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered function of microorganisms themselves.
So, Can we regulate environmental pH in a more simple way and meanwhile maintain the effectiveness?
Is there any possibility to regulate environmental pH by microorganisms themselves?
Basing on these questions, we come up with our idea.Here is the bacteria, now it faces this serious problem: how to survive in acidic and alkaline environment, and regulate environment to neutral pH, to protect the fermentation world?
At that moment, pH controller appears. When the bacteria get this weapon, it can balance the pH to neutral level. To achieve these goals, we firstly constructed PC in E.coli, and designed two subsystems in gene circuits. First system is resistance system to ensure survival of bacterium and regulate intracellular pH, while the second system--regulation system, focuses on regulating environmental pH to suitable range."

Initially, to model the OR operating region a statistical thermodynamic model developed by Gary Ackers, Alexander Johnosn, and Madeline Shea was used. This model appeared in a 1981 paper entitled Quantitative Model For Gene Regulation by Lambda Phage Repressor. The model consisted of the following equation, which related the probability of the OR operator region in configuration 's' to the Gibbs free energy of binding of repressor to that site and the concentration of unbound repressor dimer.
The following graph was produced showing the probability distributions of all eight possible configurations of the model as a function of the unbound repressor dimer concentration in molar.
By summing the probability distributions of specific configurations an overall fraction of repressed operator as a function of unbound dimer can be determined as is shown in the graph below.
This model however was too simplistic in that it only took in to account repressor concentration and not CRO concentration. Therefore this model was ultimately abandoned in favor of a more complex model taking in to account CRO and RNAP concentration inside the cell as well as repressor concentration. This new model, also developed by Madeline Shea and Gary Ackers appeared in the paper The OR Control System of Bacteriophage Lambda A Physical-Chemical Model for Gene Regulation published in 1983. This model had 40 configurations of operator region in it while the previous paper only had 8, which makes for a more accurate representation of real life. Once again it relied on a statistical thermodynamic model of the form:
where Cs is the probability of the operating region being in the specified form, and the values i, j, and k refer to the number of repressor, CRO, and RNAP molecules bound to the OR region respectively and have values from 0 to 3. In this model when specific configurations were summed the probability of RNAP expressing protein could be determined as a function of the repressor and CRO protein concentrations. The following contour plot shows the probability of RNAP being bound to OR3 and repressor at OR2 as a function of the concentrations of CRO protein and repressor protein in nM. This model shows the deactivating nature of CI repressor at PRM and the activating qualities of CRO. At very low concentrations of CI repressor the promoter site is relatively transcriptionally active, while at higher concentrations the RNAP is unable to transcribe protein.
This particular graph was equal"

In green. CatA fusion proteins' activity was measured in Sodium Phosphate 50mM at pH 7, with 30mM of Catechol as substrate, as recommended in the literature. Measurements were taken after 35 min, timepoint at which all the substrate had been consumed by the native protein.
In red. XylE fusion proteins' activity was measured in Potassium Phosphate 100mM at pH 7.5, with 30mM of Catechol as substrate, as recommended in the literature. Measurements were taken after 12 min, timepoint after which all the substrate had been consumed by the native protein.
Figure 6 can have two interpretations: either the binding of the FBDs affects the activity of the proteins, or it lowers their expression. Both interpretations would explained the decrease in the activity that we observed. Nonetheless, the enzymes were still active, except XylE-FBD1.
Testing our enzymes on their ability to degrade Anthocyanins
The next step is to test our enzymes fused with the FBDs on their ability to degrade anthocyanins. A similar assay to the one performed with Catechol will be performed using Malvidin or a solution of Anthocyanins.
Testing our enzymes on their ability to degrade wine stains
Following the assay with the Anthocyanins, a similar assay to that performed with the fabric assays on the FBD-CBD fusion proteins will be performed, only this time it will be carried out with fabrics stained with wine, on the assay developed by the assay team and analysed with the software designed by the same team as well.

The trehalose biosynthetic operon – otsA and otsB
Trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-[1,1]-α-D-glucopyranoside) is a non-reducing disaccharide in which two glucose units are linked by an α,α-1,1 bond and is common in nature. In yeast and fungi, trehalose plays an important role in protection against environmental stresses such as desiccation, heat, frost, and high osmolarity(1, 2). The pathway for trehalose synthesis induced by osmotic stress in E. coli is the same as in other species(3, 4).
The genes otsA and otsB are required for trehalose production in E. coli. The otsA gene encodes trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. This enzyme converts UDP-glucose and D-glucose-6-phosphate to trehalose-6-phosphate. The otsB gene encodes trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase. This enzyme converts trehalose-6-phosphate to trehalose.
The operon otsBA is induced by osmotic stress, extreme heat, extreme cold, desiccation, and entry into stationary phase. Therefore, we decided to culture E. coli under high salt level in order to overexpress the genes.
Construction of Biobrick
otsA gene and otsB gene were cloned from E.coli K-12 genomic DNA. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and PstI and were inserted into pSB1A2.
otsB gene and otsA gene were ligated with four different promoters and double terminator (BBa_B0015)(Fig.1).
Fig.1 Constructed plasmids
One of those promoters is arabinose inducible, and the others are constitutive promoter.

Evaluation of trehalose production
1. Optimization of culture condition
It has been reported that the expression of E. coli - derived trehalose increase when E. coli reaches to stationary phase (1). At first, we monitored the growth of transformants and optimized the growth condition for further experiments.

Oct. 3th -  Oct. 5th
Subpopulation testing
For flow cytometry in Wageningen I was allowed to bring a limited number of samples. Therefore I chose to use 2 subpopulation clones B6 and C10 as well as 2 controls: one constitutive mRFP expresser and one strain of DH5alpha unable of mRFP production. The samples were inoculated in the morning in LB with arabinose and Cm as selection antibiotic. At 21:00 the same day, 1-5µl of the samples were transferred to fresh LB with Cm35, arabinose and both with and without glucose. The volume used to refresh the samples differed to provide roughly equal starting densities.
The next day, refreshed the cultures in fresh medium with the same composition as 21:00 the day before. We analyzed both samples for each: the samples from 21:00 and the refreshed cultures for those. We were easily able to differentiate between background in the medium and cells in the actual cultures. We related different values to each other including forward scatter, side scatter, fluorescence intensity and cell count. We found that the size of the cells correlated to the red fluorescence. The constitutive mRFP expressors - used as positive control - show a high mean fluorescence. The cells containing the subpopulation system have a lower, but substantial mean fluorescence per cell. At first glance it seem that the subpopulation system causes a more diverse population in mRFP expression, but this could well be an artifact because of the logarithmic scale on the x-axis.
