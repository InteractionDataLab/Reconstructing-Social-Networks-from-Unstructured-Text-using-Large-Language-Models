Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Device Testing
We quantified the activity of our device both in E. coli and in Pc. denitrificans so that to justify the decision to use a paracoccal strain instead of a standard chassis organism. We would also quantify the responses of untransformed E. coli, Pc. denitrificans, and N. europaea after being treated with an “ammonia spike”. Our assay would be conducted in a erlenmeyer flask on top of a hotplate set to 30 C and a magnetic stirrer. We tracked the levels of nitrates, ammonia, dissolved oxygen, and the OD 600 of each culture over time after introduction of excess ammonia. Ideally, data from the growth curve assays will inform the project and allow us to grow cultures to mid-exponential phase for maximum responsiveness to excess ammonia. The responses of each strain to an ammonia strike were then standardized against the corresponding reported OD 600 so that the ability of a unit of biomass to oxidize ammonia and reduce nitrates can be calculated and compared to the results of other strains.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.
Figure 1: The Chain-Node Model of a E.coli cell
Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLac"

Introduction
Cellular Automata
Cellular automata consist of a regular array of cells, termed a grid, of arbitrary dimension.        Any cell can be in two or more distinguishable states.        Given an initial configuration of these states the grid evolves without any further intervention,       hence the term automaton, with every new configuration based solely on the previous configuration        and a set of fixed rules. Often the evolution of cellular automata progresses in a discrete way,        in this case every new configuration is called a ‘generation’, nevertheless continuous cellular automata do        indeed exist (fig 1.1). Since the 1940’s when the concept of a cellular automaton first arose as a purely        mathematical problem [1]
J. von Neumann, and A.W. Burks. Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata. Univ. of Illinois Press, Urbana IL, 1966.
, these systems have found new implementations in a broad range of disciplines.        In physics, chemistry and biology cellular automata are widely used in simulations involving emerging        complex behavior and self-organization, while from the viewpoint of computer science the fact that some        cellular automata display what is called turing completeness is of considerable interest [2]
S. Wolfram. Universality and complexity in cellular automata. Physica D 10:1-35, 1984.
.        Also in cryptography cellular automata are considered to be useful because of their uni-directional        evolutionary character [3]
S. Sen, C. Shaw, D.R. Chowdhuri, N. Ganguly, and P.P. Chaudhuri. Cellular Automata Based Cryptosystem (CAC), ICICS ‘02. Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Security, 303--314. Springer-Verlag, London, UK 2002.
.
Additionally these systems are thought to be present in nature as being, for example, the mechanism leading to texture formation on animal skin. Computer models of cellular automata in the continuum approximation are able to reproduce patterns similar to these textures, which in nature emerge from the continuous interaction between pigment cells [4]

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for all annotated transcripts in RefSeq Gene hg19, were downloaded using the built-in --downdb argument in the annotated_variation.pl package. This argument allows you to                   access files directly from the UCSC Genome Browser Annotation Database. Furthermore, the reference gRNA files were created using the retrieve_seq_from_fasta.pl package in Annovar. The VCF4 were annotated using the core function of Annovar,                   the annotate_variation.pl program. Standard parameters were selected and the hg19 refGene was used as a reference. The annotated variations are outputted in two different VCF files. The variant_function VCF file, contains the information                   regarding the nature of the variation and the position in the exome. This file summarises if the variant is exonic, splicing, or if it hit a non-coding RNA genes, as well as the gene containing the mutation. The second file, exonic_variant_function                   VCF file, contains the amino acid changes as a result of the exonic variant and furthermore identifies the type of functional consequences caused by the variant (frameshift insertion, deletion,frameshift block substitution...). The exonic_variant_function                   VCF annotations, were translated into protein sequences through the coding_change.pl tool in Annovar. This outputs a FASTA format containing the wild type and mutated protein sequences under a header containing the original mutation,                   gene affected and amino acid sequence change. All the annotation results can be found in Ginga’s Github.
Sort Annotated Proteins - neoExtract
The proteins annotated in Annovar contain both the mutated sequence as well as the wild type protein. Moreover, since neoantigen sequences are typically 8 to 11 amino acids long, the major part of protein sequence which doesn’t contain                   any functional variation associated with the cancer mutation of the sample, has no implications on the end library of neoantigens. For determining the final neoantigens, only a short amino acid sequence around the mutation is required,                   in the case of SNVs. neoExtract was used to sort the annotated proteins, removing the wildtype from the Annovar FA output file, and only retains a short amino acid sequence of specified length around the mutation. The coding change exonic                   variant function, was processed by neoExtract, using standard parameters. The output FASTA file contains all the possible combinations of neoantigen candidates derived from the mutated proteins. neoExtract can also process other functional                   consequences of the variant such as insertions, deletions and frameshift.

Protocols can also be more or less fast, depending on the the supplier’s technology.
2.2 Paper-based technology
A famous field of research consists in paper-based extraction technology. It permits low-costs diagnosis. The point is that these technologies permit easier way to perform sample preparation. For example, it is possible to make an automated DNA extraction from the human whole blood in only 7 minutes [12].
Some scientists also developed an automated way to proceed DNA extraction : it combined magnetic beads, paper, stepper actuators and a micro-computer called Arduino. [13]
Thanks to that technology and using 96 well plates, it is possible to target the apicoplast genome for malaria diagnosis [14].
2.3 Isothermal amplification - LAMP
Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an isothermal technique for the amplification of DNA [15] widely used in point-of care diagnosis because it is cheap and simple[16] [17]. The sensitivity can reach 92% [17] making it a serious technology for malaria diagnosis.
Combined with paper-based technologies, it is possible to develop low-coast paperfluidic molecular diagnostic chip that can extract, amplify and detect DNA from clinical samples in less than 1 hour even in resource-limited settings [18].
3. Vibrio Cholerae extraction
3.1 Vibrio Cholerae sensitivity
To lyse bacteria, several disinfection solutions were prepared, such as 2-5% phenol ; 1% sodium hypochlorite ; 4% formaldehyde ; 2% glutaraldehyde ; 70% ethanol ; 70% propanol ; peracetic acid To 2%, to the hydrogen peroxide to 3-6% and to the iodine to 0.16% [19]. As mentioned before, V.cholerae is not supposed to survive in acid mediums [6]. Another possibility to kill it is to create a thermal shock (0°C)[20]
3.2 Lysis buffer
After many intern discussions, DNA amplifications were dropped because the bacteria is overexpressed in the sample. Lysis buffer is used to extract DNA from bacterias. It contains Urea 4M and DNAse inhibitors. Urea 4M allows a lysis efficiency of 90% in less than"

P3HB toxicity was only tested at one concentration in LB - 31 μg/L, it was also tested at 31 mg/L however the resulting OD was over 1, so this data was not considered accurate. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion:3HB is toxic above 10mM and P(3HB) had no effect on growth at 31 μg/L. These data can be utilised to determine the maximum level of 3HB which should be present in our final bioreactor design. We have shared these data with our modelling team in order to determine maximum P(3HB) production at or below 10mM (3HB). In light of these data we have modified our design to include the expression of bdh2 (BBa_K1149050)</b>, which is a 3HB dehydrogenase that can convert 3HB into acetoacetate, a common metabolite in E.coli. Expression of bdh2 should overcome the toxicity limit of 3HB, since E. coli can metabolise acetoacetate</b>To this end we tested whether an increase in acetoacetate would present any toxicities.
Acetoacetate
Toxicity of acetoacetate in LB with phaCAB and EV expression. Acetoacetate was also tested for toxicity at 4 concentrations - 1 μM, 100 μM, 1mM and 287 mM. In phaCAB and EV this manifested itself between 1 mM and 287 mM. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion:Acetoacetate toxicity lies somewhere between 1mM and 287 mM.

6/22:  Today I set up a gel electrophoresis of restriction digest samples that the rest of the wet lab team had set up the day before (see notebooks of Alberto, Margeux, and Vanessa).  The samples were E0430 (YFP composite), E0240 (GFP composite), R2000 (constitutive promoter), and B0015 (terminator).  Each sample took two wells and were followed by their uncut plasmids.
We also had our Wet lab meeting today in which we discussed our division of work: a team to work on combining the composite parts with promoters and another team to start making constructs with our fluorescent protein genes (BFP, RFP, EYFP, ECFP).
6/23: This morning I did restriction digest of our GFP+term composite part, J61101 (RBS), J61100 (RBS), J61127 (RBS), and K156010 (BFP).  The RBS's I cut with Spe1 and Pst1 while the BFP I cut with EcoR1 and Spe1.  The GFP+term was cut with Xba1 and Pst1.  A gel electrophoresis was run.  The GFP+term still only showed one band, the same result we had two days earlier.  Thus we decided that the restriction digest was not the conflict here and rather the ligation did not work properly.  With the BFP and RBS samples, the separation looked good and the samples ( lower bands for BFP corresponding to the smaller insert and higher bands for RBS corresponding to the large backbone) were cut out and purified through gel extraction quickprep on the QIAcube.
6/24:  Today I started the day with a restriction digest of RFP, ECFP, EYFP, and RBS (J61101 and J61100).  The samples were loaded into a gel respectively, each followed by their uncut plasmids.

Student feedback allowed us to refine our activities after each summer school session (Table 1). For example, we converted the TinkerCell computer based bacterial photography system activity into a paper based game so computer access was no longer needed, and we also developed a formalised ethical washing line workshop after finding students disengaged  by an unstructured ethical discussion.  In addition to workshops, Zoe F gave a university style lecture about synthetic biology and our project to students at the Northwest Science school.

3. PCR amplification of insertions
Insertions can be amplified by any polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase or other high-fidelity polymerases). It will not interfere with the recombination efficiency whether there is A-tail in the PCR products or not, which will be removed during recombination and missing in the final construct.
Take a small amount of products and run agrose electrophoresis after PCR to confirm the yields and specificity of amplification. Exnase MultiS is compatible with most PCR reactions. As a result, PCR products can be directly applied to recombination reaction without further purification if the PCR templates are not circular plasmids which share the same antibiotic resistance with the cloning vector.
4. Recombination reaction
Set up the following reaction on ice. Spin briefly to bring the sample to the bottom before reacting.  See Table 2.
Table 2
The recommended amount of DNA for recombination reaction is 0.03 pmol per DNA fragment (including the cloning vector and insertions). Their corresponding mass can be roughly calculated according the following formula:
The mass of each fragment required = [0.02 × number of base pair] ng (0.03 pmol)
Notice:
The mass of linearized cloning vector used should be between 50∼200 ng. Use 50 or 200 ng if the calculated mass is out of range.
The mass of insertions should be over 10 ng. Use 10 ng if the calculated mass is less.
When applied to recombination reaction without gel recovery, the total volume of unpurified DNA used should be less than 1/5 of that of recombination reaction, which is 4 µL.
After finishing setting up, gently pipette up and down several times with a pipettor to mix thoroughly and try to avoid the formation of bubbles. Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 30 min and immediately place it on ice for 5 min. Recombination product is now ready for transformation, or otherwise it can be stored at -20 °C before transformation.
Both “5. Transformation and plating.” and “6. Selection of positive colony.” are the same with that in ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit.

Modeling
In order to depict the whole transportation process, models on formation of concentration gradient, E. Coli movement, and transcriptional regulation are essential.
Formation of concentration gradient
In our experiments, we first build a concentration gradient inside an agar bar as in any other traditional practice. When put in the water, the gradient agar bar will dictate the formation of a concentration gradient in water as solutes inside the agar can diffuse out. We use a dialysis membrane to wrap the bar and some water up, and then stir the water outside the membrane so that excess of solutes can diffuse outside the membrane and maintain the gradient inside the dialysis membrane.
The effect of dialysis membrane is crucial as shown in the animation here.
In light of this model, it’s advisable to construct the model for gradient based on diffusion across two surfaces.
Supposing the concentration inside the bar is linear, the length of the agar bar l, and the distance from the dialysis membrane to the bar d, we might set up the coordinate with x-axis along the bar and y-axis perpendicular to the bar. The points close to the bar are on the line y=0, while points close to the dialysis membrane are on the line y=d.
When the concentration is almost steady, we shall assume that the concentration close to the bar is equal to the bar and the concentration close to the dialysis membrane is zero. Hence, concentration u
The diffusion abides by
When the system is steady, differential of u by t is zero. The equation is as follows,
The marginal conditions can be deduced as follows
Concentration plot is solved in Matlab2011a with the help of Tsinghua-A Team.
The concentration close to the bar is nearly linear, which serves as the basis for our later experiments and modeling.
E. Coli movement
It is known that movement of E. Coli is dependent on phorphorylation/dephorphorylation cycle of CheW protein and consequent shift between swimming forward and tumbling. Based on this mechanism, movement of E. Coli is largely a random process, the probability of which is modulated by certain chemicals.
Assuming that movement of E. Coli is independent of each other,"

From Cheolwon Choi, 10th of July
Hi everyone. The two subjects that we thought were good turned out to be not that suitable for iGEM. We need MORE ideas!!! We also need a clearer concept on synthetic biology. These are homeworks due to our next meeting, 17th of July.
1) https://2009.igem.org/Instructional_Videos Watch the videos.
2) Study the videos on iGEM 2009 home and tell us what you learned.
3) Divide our team into groups for each subject.
4) We need to learn more about Wiki. Wiki seems to take great part in judging. Although we are not that good in English, try to post your ideas. Try to visit our team Wiki everyday.
5) Please!!! Post me if you can't come.
From Cheolwon Choi, 5th of July
This mail has a linked file that contains the lists of our team member's e-mails and contacts.
From Cheolwon Choi, 4th of July
Hi everyone. We narrowed our ideas to two subjects, which are ""Morse Code"" and ""Bio Sticker."" If you would like to share any other ideas, you are more then welcome. Let's discuss about specific models for these two subjects at the upcoming meeting. Our next meeting is on 10th of July, 3 p.m. I recommend you think about at least one of the two subjects and how they should be developed. Tell me your schedules via mail so that I can fix our meeting time to the most suitable for all. I would like to share my experience at the iGEM workshop at Dongkyung about Wiki and other stuffs that you might be interested, so bring your notebooks. As I said before, prepare a specific model for the meeting. Try to document your ideas so they could be shared with others. A specific model should include these:
1. How will the chosen subject be used?
2. What are its limits?
3. What materials would be needed?
4. What former knowledge would be required to process the subject?
5. Why did you choose the subject?
6. What contributions can you make?
7. Etc.
See you next Friday.

Basic Part
Bba_K0026550 is a decoy binding array containing 85 TetO repeat sequences, and was derived from an addgene plasmid from Finney-Manchester et al. (2013) (“Harnessing mutagenic homologous recombination for targeted mutagenesis in vivo by TaGTEAM). This part can be used to shift the transfer function of an aTC inducible promoter to the left (Figure 1). See decoy binding array page for more information.
This part was assembled using restriction cloning with EcoRI and SpeI, as accurately performing PCR on the sequence is close to impossible due to the large stretches of homologous sequences.
Figure 1: Population level FACs data comparing the relative fluorescence of a pTet sfGFP and TetR reporter with and without a tetO binding array. While the data is noisy, it is clear that the inflection point of the circuit with the binding array has shifted to the left as expected. Additionally, both circuits experienced a decrease in fluorescence at higher aTC concentrations, this is likely due to the toxicity of aTC in high concentrations. (See binding array page for more details)

Background
Climate change is argued to be one of the greatest challenges faced by mankind. The current climate change is mainly caused by us humans as we have been using the Earth’s precious fossil fuel stocks without returning the emitted gases into the natural carbon cycle. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), even if we could stop all the emissions right now, the Earth’s average temperature would rise 0.6°C. This means we must act now. To fight climate change we have come up with a solution which would tackle the emissions made by the road transportation. These emissions make up a considerable 11% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
While power generation accounts for about a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, 11% might seem like a small number. What makes emissions made by transportation significant, though, is that there are currently no good alternatives for gasoline. Electric cars are emerging, but they still have quite a way to go before reaching the price-range suitable for middle class. Propane is already widely used as a replacement of gasoline . In South Korea, 2.2 million vehicles run on propane and in Turkey, 37% of passenger cars use it. On a large scale though, only 1.2% of vehicles worldwide are suitable"

Ryan: The difficulty I see is that meeting with you, I can’t just go and implement this. So, if this is going to go any further with the city, your group is going to have to do a lot more work. What I would recommend is based on our conversation, you go out and you come up with a proposal for this. Within that proposal you would say there is a bee problem and you would explain the whole bee problem. These are the benefits and this is what we propose. Within that proposal, you would say the city use this dryland meadow seed mix on all of the roadways. Within this mix [are these flowers,] and you list a mix that actually might work. This is the potential cost of this mix and these are the benefits. If you brought this to city council, that would make my job a lot easier and I would get direction from council to say “this is what you need to do and we accept this, we like this, let’s trial it out”. Then we could actually do something.
iGEM: Would you as a community member approve of what we are doing?
Ryan: Oh, yes. For sure.
iGEM: Do you think it would make Lethbridge aesthetically pleasing if the flowers ended up growing properly along the roadways?
Ryan: I think so because I know that the problem with it and it comes in terms of feasibility, is that to get a good mixture of meadow seed that would actually work here, would be very, very tricky. The types of plants that you may have to use maybe be confused with weeds.
iGEM: Do you think city council and your office would be okay with the mixture if it was also non-invasive?
Ryan: That would be an issue as well. I think that it would have to be non-invasive. I know that if there are lots of residents who live right beside some of these areas and if they start getting this mix in their lawn, [the city is going to get complaints]. So it would have to be as non-invasive as possible.
Taking into consideration what Ryan had advised us to do, we drafted a proposal for a meadow mix to be used in developing areas of Lethbridge.
Proposal for a Meadow Mix in New Areas of Development:
Abstract
The City of Lethbridge is known as one of the sunniest cities in Canada. Lethbridge is steadily growing and allowing for the development of subdivisions. With an increase in roadways, more native flowers should be planted to show the diversity of Alberta plant life. An"

Membrane Accelerator in Alkane Biosynthesis
Flexibility of Reaction Space
Fig.7 shows we can easily change the reaction space from cytoplasm to periplasm with Membrane Accelerator.
As mentioned above, fatty acyl-ACP is produced in E.coli by a nine-component enzyme system, in which FabG, FabZ, FabI play crucial part. AAR and ADC could then convert fatty acyl-ACP into alkane, the main constituents of diesel fuel. At first, we planned to link FabG, FabZ, FabI, AAR and ADC with constitutively assembling membrane anchors to create a new Membrane Accelerator. In this case, all enzymes face cytoplasm. However, a problem would occur because alkane is very hard to be exported to periplasm. To much alkane would pose stress on E.coli.
As we know, aldehyde is more easily to be exported through cell membrane than alkane. Considering the uniqueness and adaptability of Membrane Scaffold system, we decided to place ADC in the periplasmic function domain of Membrane Anchor, as shown in Fig.7. Thus, after the production of fatty aldehyde by AAR in cytoplasm near inner membrane, the long chain aldehyde molecule is readily exported to periplasm. In periplasm, fatty aldehyde is processed by ADC to be converted into free alkane. The upgraded Membrane Accelerator is expected to facilitate alkane production in E.coli not only by aggregating enzymes but also by improving alkane exportation.
We have constructed corresponding fusion proteins shown in Fig.8. Full result and data analysis will be out soon.
Fig.8 demonstrates the construction details of Membrane Accelerator for use of alkane synthesis.
Result and Discussion
Membrane Accelerator in Fatty Acid Biosynthesis
Overview
Excitingly, the fatty acid biosynthesis was accelerated sharply by recruiting membrane accelerator. The introduction of TesA on membrane alone results in 50% increase in fatty acids yield. By gathering FabG, FabI, FabZ and TesA on the membrane, the production of fatty acid was enhanced significantly by"

7th June
The team discusses findings from the initial research - further agreement that the 'Anti Cancer' project seemed to be the best idea, preparation of 'project sheets' to be sent to Dr. Darren Nesbeth for review and subsequent meetings.
11th June
looked a bit at the possible chassis species: salmonella, clostridium, helicobacter, E. coli. according to the tissue type/cancer type we shall decide which works with which. We start with E. coli in the lab.
We considered a pro-drug approach - bacterially directed enzyme pro-drug therapy which suggests that we may establish a transformed bacterial population with an enzyme capable to activate an ingested prodrug. This pro-drug would be connected to an antibody (possibly part of the tail) and would also have linking consensus sequence targeted by the enzyme produced locally by our bacteria.
From this above point Alex distinguished 2 scenarios built on the circuit sketch that he and Laia posted a while ago. These would be:
1) Kill unit produces tailed protein pro-drug (possibly tailed perforin) and signaling molecule, A. When A reaches a threshold amount, perforin and a protease to remove the confounding tail is produced, bacteria lyses and activated pro-drug acts on surrounding cells.
2) No protease is produced, because the tail can be cleaved off by matrix metalloproteases.
Goals for the end of this week:
- Alex, Andy and Weiling continue investigating possible candidates to fill in the parts for the scenarios
-Tom, KC and Ruxi make sure we have everything set up to start the work in the lab: protocol, parts etc.
12th June
Ruxi and Tom went through a general cloning protocol but then realised that the best way to prepare for the lab is to get familiarised with the iGEM distribution kits. We discovered that we are given almost everything we need in order to get it right.
Alex filled in the form with our proposal requested by Darren - we have the sequences and details of potential new biobricks.
We formulated a new proposal regarding the Alzheimer’s disease amyloid plaque degradation.
Andy searched potential cancer killer molecules:
- CD95 - Fas agonist
- Tumor Necrosis Factor, Histamine - induces inflammation
- HAMLET (human a-lactalbumin) - induces apoptosis
- endostatin, thrombospondin - reduce cancer growth

4. Conclusion
First of all, the Chinese people are more familiar with the gene. This is mainly related to the education of Chinese in middle school and high school about biology. However, the synthetic biology is a discipline which has been produced in recent years and its influence in China is not very large. So the public not familiar with synthetic biology. But from the results of our investigation, we can see that the synthesis of biology and iGEM propaganda by our school and our team, to a large extent, improves the degree of popularity of synthetic biology in our school.
Secondly, the public supports the genetic technology. People believe that scientific progress is always good for society. The genetic technology is skeptical, because there are a lot of risks and drawbacks in the public perception. In the questions that I don't list, there is a question (question 18) showing that the public wants the government and scientists to enhance the level of regulation of genetic technology.
People's attitudes toward creating life are not clear, and it may be because that people can’t create a living creature very well with modern technology. There is no clear answer to the question of whether or not creating a living creature is a disrespect for"

Welcome to Genespace's Open Lab Project
The Open Lab is a key step towards democratization of synthetic biology. It is the complete set of knowledge, tools, and resources required to successfully develop a thriving community biolab, all created following open source principles. The project has four parts.
The Open Lab Blueprint , a website guide to launch and develop a sustainable community biolab. It includes the following components: starting up a lab, physical space, acquisition of key equipment, and efficiently implementing safety, standards and best practices, community-building, generating content and sustainability.
Open source equipment development in the form of a liquid handling robot, customizable with shareable protocols.
Set of IP-free fluorescent protein genes in open plasmid backbones to be made available to citizen scientists in the form of a starter activity kit.
Bioglyphics , a visual protocol design tool to lower the barrier of entry to synthetic biology practice, especially geared toward visual thinkers.
We feel that the Genspace Community Lab adds significant value to the New York City community. With our Open Lab Project we hope to inspire others to create their own community lab.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," several people spontaneously mentioned the scandals associated with the agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto. One of them even accused the United States of being “the greatest terrorists on the planet” concerning their use of GMOs. For Prof. Duboule, the problem stems from the often confusing debate in which GMOs are all tarred with the same brush “We have to distinguish political, ethical and scientific problems. […] If you ask me about GMOs from a scientific point of view, I can assure you: they are not dangerous. […] However, I am totally opposed to the policy of corporations that sell sterile seeds”, he adds as an illustration.
Dreams and red flags
Our goal was also to gauge the public’s reaction to the use of genetically modified organisms in various fields. We therefore asked passersby to give their point of view on a few examples of GMOs designed to be used in medicine, environment or agriculture ( see our survey ). We purposefully introduced polemical uses of GMOs, such as the modification of human embryonic cells in order to cure genetic diseases. Surprisingly, the sole statement that collected a majority of negative reactions was related to agriculture, i.e the engineering of a wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions. Agriculture seems to be the scapegoat of all synthetic biology’s excesses. Prof. Duboule suggests the following analysis: “Via association mechanisms, wheat and GMOs bring people back to sensitive issues such as nutrition, the challenge of third world development, overpopulation. […] Unlike the idea of conquering Mars, life sciences are not so evocative of dreams”.
Managing transparency
Unquestionably, it will be difficult if not impossible to free the word OGM from all the prejudices that now define it. This is an example of how the the scientific world was unable to successfully communicate with and inform the general public. In the light of this failure, how should the scientific community efficiently communicate with the outside world? What should be done to prevent an expression like “GMO” from drifting away from its original meaning? Transparency may be an answer. “We should make the system so transparent that people don’t even need to look into details. Trust is important!” claims Oliver Peter, head of the high-throughput screening group at Actelion Pharmaceuticals.
However, transparency also has downsides as it may nurture a form of scaremongering: communication must be managed with care.  We can take the very heated and publicized debate around the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an example. This protein makes the editing of the genome quicker and cheaper than ever, thus opening new"

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," (parts of PET) can be observed. On the basis of their structure, which is similar to those of the female sex hormone estrogen, phthalates bind to human and animal hormone receptors and act there as endocrine disruptors. Estrogens are not only known as sex hormones, they also regulate the growth of muscles and bones, play a big role in the evolution of the hormone and nervous system (Gilbert (2003, page 740). If this fragile system is disrupted by endocrine substances like phthalates, men can become sterile, women show a higher risk for breast cancer and a lot of other diseases like neurodegenerative ones or malformations in development are associated with phthalates. Although these facts are not mystery worldwide there are hardly any arrangements to change this situation and reduce the amount of PET in environment. This causes a huge deficiency for human beings. How can this deficiency be reduced or even eliminated? Bloch postulates for a new future technique which can be used to eliminate human deficiencies, increase freedom, justice and peace and leads to a better relation between human and nature. A true utopia in a way Bloch favorites can only be realized, if science is not orientated on profit goals but on human needs (Bloch, dPH, page 771). The inventor of this new technique should forget that we live in a world which is based on hyper production and profit maximization. He should better turn to new concepts which enable global crisis management borne by interest of the community. In this case it would mean to deal with the problems which arise by the use of PET. Let´s start dreaming: Take the case that mankind has understand that micro particles of PET are a huge threat for life on earth and that there is no way to just stay in this situation. Primarily small interest groups try to convince other people that it is time for a change. After a while more and more interest groups start to communicate and build a global network. They mobilize other people to vote in their countries that this problem is one for their national political agendas. While public pressure is growing, politicians in the international community are forced to work together to find solutions for the PET problem and ignore the claims of the powerful lobbyist. One outcome of the first meeting is that PET will be substituted by renewable resources but this does not solve the actual problem. In a second meeting the international community evaluates plans to use synthetically built organisms to help reducing the amount of PET.

Optimization of Prussian Blue Ferritin Reaction Conditions
The next step of our process was to determine the optimal conditions in which our commercial Prussian blue ferritin reporter could operate. This is a very important step in determining how we will move forward with creating a portable sensor device. The first variable tested was pH. For this variable we can see that the lower the pH the higher the activity of Prussian blue ferritin in the case of the ABTS substrate. As we raise the pH for this substrate we see that the activity drastically drops off (Figures 10 and 11). We did not test below a pH of 2 as the ferritin subunits would dissociate at this point. For the TMB substrate however we see that the activity has a much higher relative activity at a neutral pH compared to the ABTS substrate. This would be beneficial in our system as it means the substrate solution can be a lot less harsh, which will prevent chances of functional disruption to other proteins on the strip.

    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:

Synthetic Biology CAS-conference Munich
3 days of learning about synthetic biology, presenting our project to experts in the field and having fun with our and other teams.
early bird special: road trip to Munich
One of the big learning and team building experiences that we have had in during the project was our adventure to Munich. Here, the Centre of Advanced Studies held a three day conference about Synthetic Biology at the end of July. The conference would include talks of amongst others Jay Keasling (Berkeley), Martin Fussennegger (Zurich) and Eriko Takano (Groningen). There was also the possibility to apply for a talk or poster presentation at this conference. We as a team were not only very interested in the broad applications of synthetic biology, but also interested in presenting our project to these experts and hearing their opinions about our vision.
We therefore applied to present two projects, our main project and the constructor. Both abstracts were accepted for poster presentations. It was a great learning experience for us to make a good scientific poster. It was the first time we did such a presentation for a big audience, so it was a good training for making the poster for the jamboree.
Fortunately, other iGEM teams also joined the conference. In total, 10 teams were present. 8 teams from Germany and the UCL (University College of London) team also applied for poster presentations. The"

Therefore, we focused to attach the BMP2 by the use of a cellulose binding domain (CBD). We choose the CBD of the scaffolding protein of C. thermocellum (CBD cipA) because the higher affinity compared to other CBDs, reported by the Team Imperial_2014. Moreover, in an effort for a longer broad application of a functionalized bacterial cellulose, such as wound healing, we also fused the CBD cipA with an elastin like polypeptide (ELP_C5) derived from the ELP- [V-150].

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#The Jellyfish Factory_-_-_TEXT.html," could be extracted in about 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The precipitates of crude aequorin were purified at our laboratory in Princeton. The purification was done in several steps of column chromatography, mainly by Sephadex gel filtration and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, all at 0°C. It was indeed a lengthy, time-consuming process, notwithstanding the fact that aequorin should be purified as quickly as possible because it is constantly decomposing through spontaneous weak luminescence, even in the presence of a high concentration of EDTA. To purify an extract of 50,000 jellyfish, which contains a large amount of total protein, chromatography had to be repeated 30 times for only the first gel filtration step, and the total number of chromatography runs required for complete purification was more than 60. An extract of 50,000 jellyfish yielded only 150-200 mg of purified aequorin in the early ’70s but as the techniques improved, the yield gradually increased, exceeding 500 mg by 1980. Since 1975, all of the steps in the purification have been done by my wife, Akemi, who is highly knowledgeable in handling aequorin.
The purified aequorin was used in various studies of luminescence in our laboratory. Thus, the chemical structure of the light-emitter was determined in 1973. Then the structure of the aequorin chromophore “coelenterazine” was elucidated and the regeneration of spent aequorin into active aequorin was accomplished, both in 1975. The molecular characterization of various aequorin isoforms was reported in 1986. The improved forms of aequorin-“semisynthetic aequorins” with widely different calcium sensitivities-were produced in 1988-1989. Purified aequorin has also been supplied to hundreds of cell biologists and physiologists who study intracellular calcium, leading to many important findings about intracellular calcium. Aequorin was cloned in 1985 by two groups simultaneously, one in Georgia and another in Japan. With the recent progress in molecular genetics, studies involving recombinant aequorin are now flourishing.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pneumosensor#modules_-_-_TEXT.html," by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), which is a 17-     residue long pheromone that is species-specific. Our team aims to adopt the specific CSP sensing mechanism of S. pneumoniae to detect its populations.
The mechanism we adopted is controlled by a two-component regulatory system (TCS), which consists of the histidine kinase (HK) ComD and its      cognate response regulator (RR) ComE ( BBa_K1379051 ).  When CSP binds to it, ComD autophosphorylates to become phospho-ComD, ComD~P; at the expenditure of ATP.      The cytosolic protein ComE is then phosphorylated by ComD~P through transphosphorylation reactions, producing ComE~P. Genes coding for ComD and ComE are constitutively      expressed in our Pneumosensor.
ComE~P binds to repeat sites adjacent to the comCDE and comAB operons (Ween et al., 1999), creating a positive      feedback loop, producing both pre-CSP and its required machinery for maturation and transport. The signal is thus amplified and competence is      coordinated throughout the population.
As part of our detection circuit design, we make use of the inducible promoter from the comCDE operon, PcomCDE. We obtain the sequence by oligos,      and will characterize it using green fluorescence protein (GFP) that we constructed the downstream of the promoter by BioBrick RFC10. Rather than using ComE~P that has to     be phosphorylated by ComD~P, which involves a chain of reactions, we use a phosphorylmimetic ComE mutant, ComED58E, kindly     shared with us by Bernard Martin et al. After characterization of PcomCDE, we hope to put PcomCDE together with the S. pneumoniae σx promoters module, for the ultimate goal of creating a tightly regulated automatic detection of S. pneumoniae.
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module Description
σx - Com-Box mechanism
Figure 1. σx-Com-Box promoter mechanism
The reporter system contains a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for Com-Box promoter induction. σx will then bind to Com-Box promoter and express green fluorescence protein. The whole construct was built in E. coli DH10B strain.
In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under"

     We shared iGEM Interlab kits and iGEM plate kits with SYSU-Software. During our experiments, we found out that one of our Interlab plasmids (Device I) could not be transformed well in bacterial culture medium. So we borrowed some plasmids from SYSU-Software. Furthermore, SYSU-Software had used up one of their plate kits (B0015 terminator) and we gave them ours. Reference can be seen in the Collaboration site of SYSU-Software .

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the concentration of inhibitor decreases further, the killer gene can start to work. Conversely, more inhibitor remains, the killer will be repressed harder. Thus we can say the ""in-promoter"" can have different responses to the inhibitor.
SECOND step: The relationship between the inhibitor and arabinose.
Meanwhile, the concentration of the inhibitor is the most important factor connecting with the ""in-promoter"". So under different concentrations of the arabinose, how can we know the concentration of intracellular inhibitor? In order to make the model simulate the real condition better, we use another circuit to model and combine it with the experimental results to improve it.
We use the same inducible promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor protein and replace the gene locus of inhibitor protein with RFP.
Fig.6 The circuit constructed to find out the relationship of the concentrations of inhibitor and arabinose.
The main reaction is similar with the first part, after adding different concentrations of the arabinose, the AraC protein will combine with the inducer. Then the complex will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the inhibitor. The reaction direction is from the DNA → mRNA → inhibitor protein.
Fig.7 Then the complex of arabinose and AraC protein will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the inhibitor.
According this mechanism, we modeled this circuits to build the relationship between the inhibitor protein and the arabinose. Main considerations in this model are the process of repression, induction, transcription, translation, degradation and catalysis.
The assumptions we made are:
(1) AraC protein is enough to combine with the arabinose.
(2) The concentration of repressor protein will not change while some are combined with the promoter sequence
(3) When the arabinose doesn’t exist, PBAD promoter can be completely silent
The reaction processes of circuit are described as below:
PBAD promoter activity:
And groups of differential equations are:
The initial values and description of variables are:
So we can get the curve describing the relationship between the inhibitor and time under the different concentration of arabinose.
Fig.8 The concentration of inhibitor protein expressed by PBAD promoter changes with time, induced by different concentrations of inducer.
After this, in order to get the relationship between the protein intensity and the concentration of arabinose more intuitive, we also got this curve about the relationship between protein intensity and arabinose when the protein intensity was stable
Fig.9 The concentration of inhibitor expressed by PBAD changes with different concentrations of inducer.
From this curve, we can clearly"

Warwick,2015,Team:Warwick#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," it could be due to issues with the ethidium bromide gel we were using. At the iGEM 2015 London Meet up we met the team from Glasgow University. They had just presented an ethidium bromide free method of producing gels, which then did not need to be visualised using a blue light. Instead these gels were visible under normal conditions, which we saw as extremely helpful to solve our issue. Glasgow kindly packaged off and sent us some AzureA, with which we set out producing the gel. While this did not ultimately solve our issue (we ended up using a different dye altogether) we are still thankful for the opportunity to test out a fellow iGEM team's ideas.

Manchester-Graz Collaboration
A key element of iGEM is outreach into schools in order to get the next generation of scientists thinking about synthetic biology and what they can do. As one of our team was born and bred Mancunion, we decided to set out on a collaborative outreach with the Manchester-Graz team. This involved iGEM members from the competing teams pairing up via the web to prepare lessons and presentations; ultimately leading to a full day of teaching where we presented to over 450 students. Our aim was to get the students thinking about going to university, studying a scientific degree, and for the older students; what they could achieve with synthetic biology. This collaboration brought together two teams to work alongside each other to plan and execute outreach within a school, this enabled a variety of experiences to be shared with students. We see this collaboration as a success; the Manchester-Graz team were fantastic to work with, and feedback from teachers has been hugely positive!

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," as it shows how much most of the iGEM community’s actors do not know their legal rights concerning the IP.
Opinions on the patentability of BioBricks
Two questions were asked to the participants :
Do you think BioBricks CAN be patented in your country ?
And do you think they SHOULD be patentable ?
To the first question both opinions were equally represented. Nevertheless, it would have been interesting to know the country for each answer, even if the IP legislation is quite similar in most of the represented countries.
However, to the question “Should BioBricks be patentable ?”, more than a half (56%) answered “no”. This is probably linked to the fact that most iGEM competitors already use them without paying a license, so that they completely oppose such an idea. It also points out that most iGEM team members support the iGEM knowledge policy, which makes us believe that they would be inclined to acknowledge iGEM as a commons and would favorably respond to the changes resulting from the common reflexion we proposed at the end of the first part of this human practice study.
Different ways to get to know the IP protection procedures
The iGEM competitors who planned to get their work protected used different ways to approach applying for IP protections. Three tendencies come forth : they did so by talking inside their team (to the graduate student advisor, to another team member and / or to a faculty instructor), but also outside of it (to an industry expert, to a member of the university’s commercialization office or to a legal professional). The last tendency was to search on the Internet.
These inclinations are more or less equally represented in this poll, so that it does not reveal many things. The only really interesting point which has to be put forward is that most iGEM competitors who want to apply for IP protections do make some research on it, which emphasizes the complexity of such procedures and the lack of knowledge they probably had.
Conclusion
Our work with the University of British Colombia made us realize how often the Intellectual Property Rights interfered with the different iGEM teams’ project. Nonetheless, we were disconcerted when we found out the patents were not the main problem. Indeed, their source was copyrights and trademarks.
Besides, this survey deepened our main reflexion (see Part I) as it emphasized the problems due to the superimposition of the commons and the patent models. It also highlighted the global lack of knowledge of the iGEMers upon the Intellectual Property Rights, which shows the necessity of informing about this particular topic. We sincerely hope we have helped to"

First, we determined the current state of dialogue by consulting previous dialogue studies and reviewing how language is used in the media. We then generated our own guidelines to help future researchers to develop dialogue in a constructive way. Finally, we put this into practise by creating activities and sharing our work in a way that established a dialogue and encouraged discussion.

Integrated Human Practices – Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Sensynova was a project founded in Human Practices. Each branch of our project is rooted in a barrier to biosensor implementation identified by in-depth conversations with stakeholders. We identified not only technical issues, but also societal issues, as these are equally important in ensuring successful implementation of biosensor projects. The aims of our human practices were to:
Determine how current biosensor developers design, produce and implement biosensor projects
Use these talks to determine the common barriers to biosensor development and implementation
Create novel solutions to identified problems, producing frameworks and guidelines to aid future researchers
To achieve these aims, we emailed, skyped and attended conferences to speak to stakeholders in biosensor development, from the early research stage to the end-user. Check out our integrated human practices page for more information

Why social media may not be optimal for internal communication
Several members expressed their will not to use Facebook for various reasons, and along with personal reasons that many team members expressed, the fact that Facebook lacks key functions for streamlined collaboration and possibilities to customize. Discussions regarding other means of communication started and the idea of the Hub arose as a common place for teams to discuss and collaborate both within the team and with other teams.
In Aalto-Helsinki, the team from last year had managed to continue a sponsorship to use Flowdock communication platform in 2015. They had started with it in 2014 and found it a good way to keep on track about the project. It doesn’t have similar problems as Facebook: as all of the team members were new to Flowdock, there was no extra clutter: everything that happened on Flowdock, had to do with the project. Emails and Tweets could also be forwarded to different subforums called “flows” to keep on track with other platforms as well. Some problems did however rise: as Flowdock was new to everyone in the team, it took some time to get used to checking it on a regular basis as well as organizing the information. You can create separate flows on Flowdock to discuss different things and tag people as well as discussion topics, but conversations have a tendency to get lost when many ongoing topics are discussed at the same time. For this reason, some of the team members tried to initiate the use of Facebook instead of Flowdock, but as the team was afraid of the same issues that Stockholm had run into, Aalto-Helsinki stuck with Flowdock. Another problem with Flowdock was that even though Aalto-Helsinki could use it for free, there was no way all iGEM teams could get Flowdock for free. For this reason, it is by no means a platform to collaborate with other teams, and the use of an additional communication platform for this purpose is inevitable.
Then there was the Hub
Following the discussions within Team Stockholm, a network was set up by Hugi using the open source
Click the picture to take a look at the Hub!
Tools matter
An example of how the Hub can be customized is how we integrated the ’Team seeker’ and ’Biobrick seeker’, made by Aalto-Helsinki 2014, into the Hub. They can now be used directly within the Hub. This allows users to search for other teams or Biobricks"

Bring Biological Modeling to the Next Level
Chain-Node Model (Figure. 1) is a brand new Complex Modeling Concept incorporating its detailed structure description with universal applicability. Instead of treating complex as a whole while ignoring their basic composition and structure, Chain-Node Model view complex as a construction of it basic Parts . Just as its name implies, our model includes two components: Chain and Node. As a correspondence to natural polymer chains, each Chain consists of an arrangement of its basic unit, Part, whose concept has been greatly extended and includes but not limited to Biobrick Parts. The Node component is not a natural correspondence but an abstract concept to describe binding states of two or more parts: each binding will create a Node. The abstract nodes may continue to bind with other parts or nodes to form a tree structure. However, parts or nodes in bound states are not allowed to bind again. With help of chains and nodes, it is possible to model any complex with arbitrary architecture. Simple and inaccurate modeling of biological process could not keep pace with the development of synthetic biology and undoubtedly, our Chain-Node model provides a possible solution to the imbalance.
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
A simple example, tetR dimer, is shown to illustrate our simple modeling idea (做一个tetR2的模型放在右边做为配图，否则右边太空了). It has two chains with each containing only one part, tetR. Dimerization of tetR will create a node to indicate the bound state of two parts. To explain more clearly, bound parts are also considered as nodes so that in this example, all nodes are organized in a tree structure, which includes two children (leaf) nodes and one parent node. We will conform to this convention in our wiki.
To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea and deeper understanding of our modeling system.
Modeling with Templates
Modeling manually of biological system is widely used for synthetic biology modeling but it requires an overall understanding of the biological network. It is difficult for even professionals to provide such large amount of data"

PCR Clean Up
Purpose: PCR clean-up is done after digestion and ligation in order to remove salts and to concentrate the product of these reactions. By using a small amount of dd H20 at the end of the clean-up, it is possible to use all of product at a higher concentration since most of the reactions in PCR reaction tubes are volume limited. This will give more colonies with the desired plasmid inserted compared to using the same volume of a less concentrated solution.
Procedure:
Clean-up for Digestion
1. 250 µL of DNA Binding Buffer was added to the PCR tube with the Digestion products and was mixed via pipette.
2. This solution was transferred to a Zymo spin column and the column was placed in a collection tube.
3. The tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1.5 minutes.
4. The flow-through was discarded and 600µL of wash buffer was added to the center of the column.
5. The tube was spun again at 14,000 rpm for 1.5 minutes.
6. Steps 4 and 5 were repeated.
7. The flow through was discarded and then the column was dry spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes.          Note: Dry spinning is important to remove all of the ethanol from the wash buffer because this can interfere with transformation.
8. The column was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and 10 µL of dd H20 was added to the column.
9. The column was allowed to sit for 1 minute.
10. The tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes and then the concentration of the DNA was measured via nanodrop.
Clean-up for Ligation
1. 200 µL of DNA Binding Buffer was added to the PCR tube with the Digestion products and was mixed via pipette.
2. This solution was transferred to a Zymo spin column and the column was placed in a collection tube.
3. The tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1.5 minutes.
4. The flow-through was discarded and 600µL of wash buffer was added to the center of the column.
5. The tube was spun again at 14,000 rpm for 1.5 minutes.
6. Steps 4 and 5 were repeated.
7. The flow through was discarded and then the column was dry spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes.          Note:"

Abstract
Plug 'n' Play with DNA: a novel assembly system
The DTU-Denmark 2 team is designing a novel standardized assembly system, called ""Plug 'n' Play with DNA"", where any biological parts can be gathered without use of restriction enzymes and ligases. Our goal is to create a new assembly standard of biological parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, which can be directly mixed with a vector. This will make synthetic biology faster and assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergillus nidulans ready to plug 'n' play. The simple and easy use of this new assembly system has been demonstrated by developing a reporter system for mammalian cell lines as well as for A. nidulans. This novel assembly system represents an improvement of the conventional Standard Assembly of BioBricks, which has its limits when creating eukaryotic biobricks.

These last iGEM-months have not only been marked by a lot of research and labwork, but also by a lot of fun and teamspirit. At this point we want to thank everybody who helped us to realize this project. May it be with help to get started, organisational hints or scientific background information.  In the following we want to give special thanks and credit to the people, without whom it would not have been possible to establish our project.
Laboratory and Expertise
Institute of Synthetic Biology
Prof. Dr. Matias Zurbriggen, one of our PIs, supported us with technical and theoretical input. Furthermore he offered us space in his laboratory to work on our project and has always been willing to help us with problems or questions. Prof. Dr. Matias Zurbriggen will also accompany us in Boston.
Tim Blomeier who showed us how to work with cell cultures and assisted us during our work in their laboratory.
Institute of Plant Biochemistry
Prof. Dr. Andreas Weber, who is also our PI, was the one who brought up iGem in the first place. He informed us about the competition in one of his lectures and encouraged us to participate. After we formed our team and project idea Prof. Dr. Weber provided us with space in his Lab and also financial aid.
Samantha Kurz who spent a lot of her time with us in the lab to help us with techniques and general know-how about the work in laboratories.
Institute of Microbiology
Prof. Dr. Michael Feldbrügge supported our team with a laboratory and also with one of his technical assistants, Ute Gengenbacher, to assist us during our work in the lab.
Ute Gengenbacher, our Instructor, accompanied us during our project and helped us with basics as much as with difficult techniques. She spent a lot time with us during our lab work and lend us a hand wherever she could, even though it was her freetime.  U"
Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Press_-_-_TEXT.html," Ein durchaus prekärer Plan. Denn es muss unter allen Umständen verhindert werden, dass die Killerbakterien selbst von dem sorgfältig ausgewählten Bakterientoxin ausgelöscht werden. Damit das nicht geschieht, wird der Killerstamm mit einem Immun-Gen gegen dieses Gift ausgestattet.    Aufspüren, infizieren und leise töten - ein mikromilitärischer Schlachtplan mit praktischen Hindernissen. Während dieser Tage etwa die anderen jungen Geningenieure versucht haben, ihre ""Killerbakterien"" gentechnisch so zu verändern, dass diese ihre Beute sicher erkennen und sich direkt darauf zubewegen, benötigte die ""Simulationsgruppe"" von Maria Münch und Kolja Schleich entsprechende Parameter und Daten. Manches muss deshalb, wenige Wochen vor Abgabetermin, noch aus bereits veröffentlichten Daten hergeleitet werden.
Für kleine Fehler sorgt man dagegen schon mal selbst. An einem Tag - es war der Tag, bevor die ""Killing-Gruppe"" ihren ersten Erfolg in der Petrischale verbuchte - ist der Zentralserver am ""Bioquant"" buchstäblich in die Knie gezwungen worden, nachdem die Simulationsgruppe einen kleinen Programmierfehler eingebaut hatte. Jan Eufinger, einer der ""Instruktoren"" und Ratgeber der Gruppe, nimmt das ebenso gelassen und sportlich wie Angela Oberthür, die Koordinatorin im Bioquant-Haus, in dem die Studenten praktisch jeden einzelnen ihrer Ferientage verbringen: ""Ganz glatt läuft das selten ab, auch in der Laborpraxis später.""
Wenn es nur die technisch bedingten Fallstricke wären, die den Studenten das Leben bisweilen schwermachen. Anna Stöckl, eine einundzwanzigjährige Biologiestudentin, und Dominik Niopek, ihr gleichaltriger Kommilitone aus dem ""Mobi""-Studiengang, haben zusammen mit Philipp Bayer, einem angehenden Biologiestudenten, bei allem schöpferischen Drang die gesellschaftlich-moralische Dimension ihrer Ferienarbeit in den Blick genommen. Solche ethischen Reflexionen sind eine längst schon klassische Übung für ambitionierte Biotechniker. In einem"

We attended Synbiobeta Activate, a great and informative event that celebrated the official opening of the BBSRC-funded Edinburgh Genome Foundry - the first fully automated DNA assembly platform in the UK!
Later in this week we also went to the Design Meets Synthetic Biology workshop at the Genome Foundry, where the limits of synthetic biology were discussed in reference to the the capability of the host organism or chassis.
The MoClo team used Gibson assembly to successfully generate the level 1 MoClo vector for Rhodococcus.
Meanwhile the fungi team faced troubles with initial attempts to assemble the AMA1 gBlock fragments. On a positive note, all other LV0 parts fungi parts were confirmed by sequencing.
On a more positive note, Scotland experienced it’s one and only sunny day of the year!
July 18th - July 30th
Northern Meet-up
This week we co-hosted the iGEM Scotland and Northern England meet-up! It was a great chance to meet with fellow iGEM-ers and share ideas, tips and some pizza, courtesy of The Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre.
LTeam MoClo demonstrated combinatorial assembly using parts library to show that our vectors are functional. Successful transformation of Rhodococcus was also demonstrated.
During the last days in the lab the fungi team were busy adjusting several protocols to achieve a successful transformation of P. roqueforti and MoClo assembly of LV1 and LV2 devices.
August 1st - August 18th
The Dissertation
Laboratory work was stopped during this timeframe in order to give us enough time to work on our individual Master’s dissertations. We celebrated the end of our dissertation lab work with some doughnuts and a goodbye and thank-you to Heather Barker for supporting our project.
August 18th - August 27th
Back To Work
After handing in our dissertations (what a relief to be done!) we’re straight back to work on the characterisation of our parts in our new home in Chris French’s lab.
We also said goodbye to the team members who had to return home or start new jobs. The remaining members worked hard on characterising the Sac-6 promoter.
August 29th - September 9th
Collaborations
During this time we focused on expanding our collaborations with the University of Newcastle and Dundee High School iGEM teams. We also spread news of our CARE tool and engaged 20+ teams in our chassis safety assessment.

We observed that in 2 h apoptosis increased from about 2% of the population in non-treated samples to almost 70% in cells incubated with TRAIL. After 4 h the apoptotic cell number increased up to 75% (see Figure 1). As the number of apoptotic cells is increasing slowly after 2 h, we decided to use this as our standard time for TRAIL incubation.
Figure 13. Jurkat cells with 0 and 100 ng/mL of TRAIL after 2 and 4 h. Apoptosis was detected in all cases with Annexin V (Q3).
Once we confirmed that TRAIL was effectively inducing apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we wanted to do the complete experiment, in which we determine the concentration of TRAIL we will use in future experiments and contrast Jurkat cells with 3T3 (a non-cancerous cell line).
Jurkat cells and 3T3 were incubated for 2 h in 0, 10, 50 and 100 ng/mL of TRAIL. Then, we followed the protocol detailed in Experiments . Annexin V was added to detect apoptosis, as it binds to phosphatidylserine which is found in higher proportion in apoptotic cells. To differentiate apoptotic and necrotic cells, PI dye was added. Annexin V and PI were detected by an emission filter at 488 and 561 nm, respectively.
Our data shows that 3T3 are not affected by TRAIL after 2h, whereas Jurkat cells are (as have been shown in the previous experiment). For Jurkat cells we decided to use a concentration of 100 ng/mL, as it allows to have a higher number of apoptotic cells in a relatively short amount of time (2 h).
Figure 14. 3T3 (upper image) and Jurkat cells (lower image) with 0, 10, 50 and 100 ng/mL of TRAIL after 2 h incubation. Annexin V-Alexa488 (488 nm) was used to detect apoptotic cells. To differentiate necrotic cells, PI was added (561 nm).
In Figure 14 in the upper image, for 0 and 50 ng/mL one can see that there is no necrotic cells (Q2). This is probably due to a mistake in manipulation, and these sample lacked PI.
