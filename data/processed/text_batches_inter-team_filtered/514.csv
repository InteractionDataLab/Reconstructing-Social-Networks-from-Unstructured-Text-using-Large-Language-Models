darwin
Results
We produced software which implemented the algorithms described in our novel approach on specially cleaned input files and ran them through a typical version control system. We performed experimentation on transformations between iterations 3-6 of our wetware team's yeast plasmids. As a control, we compared darwin's output running through the git version control system to simple processing with git (vanilla_git). We expected darwin to run faster and show fewer changed lines in the diff output than vanilla_git.
As expected, darwin's preprocessing produced a significantly faster diff, with an average speed of 5.763 seconds per file, as opposed to 10.640 seconds for the vanilla_git. However, against our assumptions, that performance did not seem to rely upon the reduction of changed lines reported by git, since darwin actually produced more changed lines. More research is required to find the correlation between the number of changed lines reported by git and the number of lines actually changed in the file.
Future Work
Future work mostly revolves around bringing darwin from a standalone diff-producing executable to an integrated system with a GUI usable by novices. The major challenge with that is parsing the plethora of different file types used to represent DNA although the implementation of other formats such as SBOL, ApE, etc., could be done easily by extracting the actual genetic sequence from the file.
In addition, the current algorithms are unable to deal with introns of any sort in the input DNA sequence, and will attempt to split the file into ORFs regardless. The ability to correctly identify non-coding regions like this would create a far more valuable piece of software, able to deal with prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," you can read by     mapping the DNA and translate. Marco, Jarko and Daniel came in our     lab to discover what it is like to change something in DNA of     bacteria. The same as the other students they cloned GFP inside E.     coli and B. subtilis.
“The days were a few learn full days, but also fun. The     explanations were clear and we were helped good. In this     combination our experiment was a success!”
Students Lieke, Anouk & Imke
Lieke, Anouk and Imke are currently busy with their high school     thesis about GFP in guppies. Since we, as iGEM Team, are not     allowed to work with animals, we invited them to clone GFP in     bacteria.
“During our days in the lab of Groningen we learned a lot, we     really liked to clone GFP in bacteria and the program was well     arranged. The help was good and kindly. We learned a lot of this     experience, it also was fun to do.”

Virginia,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Internal#Papers_-_-_TEXT.html," (UTC)
I think this paper is hilarious. ""...microprocessors and other electronic systems are not built directly from chunks of metal and silicon lying about the countryside.""  He alludes to the standardization of a cellular ""chassis"" when he talks about the different groups using different strains of ecoli to develop different devices (p450, right column).  Do you think it makes more sense to use a standard strain or to more clearly define the differences between strains or even different organisms.  For example, wouldn't it be nice if work on e. coli could be reliably translated for use in T. fusca? - chris 02:17, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
The promise and perils of synthetic biology by J. Tucker and R. Zilinskas
What are some of the major risks associated with synthetic biology research projects? - GMcArthurIV 00:08, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
The risks range from accidental to deliberate and include accidental release, testing in an open environment, and the deliberate misuse of the technology.  Self-regulation seems to be the best avenue to address these risks early before any unforeseen mishaps. - Albergca 15:04, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
Anyone with a decent knowledge of genomic engineering and access to University equipment and literature could easily turn into a crazed bio-terrorist. It's not too difficult to isolate something like MRSA and just grow massive vats of it, putting it into spray bottles and hosing down public transport and other high-volume/distance transmission venues. Not that I've ever thought of that. - Jalvin 16:45, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
Refinement and standardization of synthetic biological parts and devices
What does it mean to refine a biological part? - GMcArthurIV 11:28, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
In the context of this article, refinement of a biological part refers to establishing a widely accessible, standardized library of data regarding a biological part or device.  This data informs engineers how the device will interact with the cell once it is transformed.  The device must consistently perform as expected in the standard conditions and cannot be majorly effected by differing variables from situation to situation.  A refined device is analogous to the engine in a car.  If we take that engine out of one car and move it to another than the power output and fuel consumption of the engine will be about the same.  Also, if we change another part of the car, such as the steering wheel"

Symptoms
Pernicious anemia shows its effects mainly on three systems; blood, gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system. General weakness and abnormal fatique are observed as the most common symptoms that are observed in the patients diagnosed with pernicious anemia. Gastro-intestinal symptoms such as gastric ulcer are also common. Additionally, loss of weight, sore tongue, decayed teeth, poor appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pains and symptoms related with central nervous system may occur as a result of pernicious anemia. (4)
Treaments
Patient with pernicious anemia requires a life long treatment. Pernicious anemia usually treated via injecting vitamin B12 to patient’s body or by taking vitamine B12 as shots or pills. To keep vitamin B12 level in body constant, vitamin B12 injections are done in daily or weekly basis. In the case of pernicious anemia related with the intrinsic factor deficiency, this requires another special treatment procedure. Also, patients with pernicious anemia should be under a regular medical control to prevent the progress of the disease or prevent the possible side effects of the treatments. (5, 6)

The visitors participate alone or in a group up to four persons. Each group is accompanied by an iGEM team member as expert, who will inform the participants about the biological processes and how to carry out the different steps.
After getting a lab coat and a pair of gloves, each participant may choose one of the possible BioBricksTM from the computer screen. When the participant clicks on the desired characteristic, a screen opens with the DNA sequence of this BioBrickTM. Next, the participant will order the BioBrickTM and will receive an envelope, containing a flask with fake DNA. Subsequently, the DNA will be mixed with water using a vortex. The DNA will be well mixed and ready for use. Each participant will get his or her own test tube and will pipette some fake bacterial culture in this tube. The DNA will be added to these test tubes as well. The test tubes containing DNA and bacteria will be put in an electroporation-device. The participant may push the 'flash'-button. The next step will be to plate the bacteria on an agar plate. Therefore the participant will genuinely pour some bacteria from the test tube on the agar plate and smear it on the plate with a spatula. The agar plates are then put into something that looks like an incubator. After removing the plates from the incubator, the results are shown to the participants.
Furthermore, the visitors can share their views on new topics, by answering the question: 'What would you like to make using genetically engineered bacteria?' We are looking forward to introduce them to the wonderful world of biology!

Teaching at Oud-Beijerland
A photo made during the lesson provided to high school students.
On Friday morning the 21st of September, two members of the team went to Oud-Beijerland (near Rotterdam) to teach 23 high-school students about biology and synthetic biology. After a short recap about DNA and proteins, the students were taught to write a research question and a hypothesis. The assignment was to compare the filthiness of two articles of everyday use, by comparing the amount of bacteria after a week of growth. The students will take pictures of their petri-dishes twice a day to monitor the growth. Next, the principles of synthetic biology are elaborated and some iGEM topics of previous years are discussed. Then, the students got the chance"

Implementation
The part has been obtained by gBlock synthesis from IDT and subsequently assembled into the plasmid using NEB HI-Fi kit. The assembly mix was heat-shock transformed in competent DH5α and plated on Chloramphenicol LB plates. The colonies were tested through colony PCR and confirmed by sequencing.  Sequencing data can be found on the Parts page .

In the presence of arsenic, the repression will be avoided by binding the repressor ArsR This bound allows the transcription of the downstream gene, lasI. This gene encodes for the quorum sensing molecule C12, which acts as a connector to the processing cell.
Characterisation
Qualitative assay. Due to time constraints only a preliminary qualitative assay was carried out. Co-cultures of Arsenic detector, processor unit and 3 different reporter modules carrying two chromoproteins ( BBa_K2205016 , BBa_K2205018 ) and sfGFP ( BBa_K2205015 ) were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol (12.5ng/ul). The day after the cultures were diluted at OD600 0.1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:13 (detector:processor:reporter). The samples were supplemented with different concentration of Arsenic (0ppb, 10ppb, 50ppb, 100ppb) to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 6, 7, 8).

Additionally, a GSH derivative, glutathione S-transferase, reacts with a number of harmful chemical species; such as ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and xenobiotics including environmental carcinogens (Dasari et al., 2017).
In consideration of these studies, we have come to the conclusion that, the concurrent overexpression of GSH and FucO would increase cellular growth rates, lifespan and ethanol production yield (Ask et al., 2013).
The Working Principle of Our Parts:
The strong promoter we used, BBa_J23100, is active depending on the availability of RNA polymerase holoenzyme as it is a member of the constitutive promoter family. Our bacterial ribosome binds to the strong ribosome binding site from the community collection, BBa_BOO34.
Figure 4: Representation of our gene circuit.
The first protein coding region we have, placed after the RBS, FucO, codes for L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase (a homodimer enzyme) in order to act upon furfural presence in the field (Zheng, 2013). The metabolism of furfural by NADH-dependent oxidoreductases reduces the toxicity of the chemical by turning it into furfuryl alcohol, a derivative (Zheng, 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2010).
Our second protein coding region (GSH), codes for bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione synthetase which is composed of a non-protein thiol group, and a tripeptide: cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid (Lu, 2013).
GSH is usually found in the thiol-reduced form in living organisms which is crucial for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and the other free radicals (Ask et al., 2013).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are harmful substances that alter protein based matters by interacting with their electrons as themselves have an unbalanced electron state (Lu, 2013; Burton & Jauniaux, 2011). Because many benefits of GSH include scavenging of ROS, protection against endogenous toxic metabolites and detoxification of xenobiotics, we chose this gene to include in our bacteria (Höck et al., 2013).

PRODUCT DESIGN AND GLOBAL COLLABORATION
A key component of demonstrating the accuracy and precision of scientific data is through reproducibility and external validation. We believe that collaboration with other iGEM teams is a powerful method to disseminate information, and in this spirit, we have worked with the University of Georgia iGEM Team and Taipei American School iGEM Team (TAS_Taipei) to verify the functionality and practicality of our device. Throughout multiple trials conducted by both teams, the ElectroPen was demonstrated to successfully electroporate GFP into E. coli, as seen with the trials conducted by Lambert iGEM. The transformation efficiency obtained from these tests is also on par with those from commercial electroporators, thereby confirming the data obtained across all trials conducted. In addition, the ElectroPen was tested using three different cell lines: DH5a, BL21, and Nissile 1917, confirming its versatility.Through this, we demonstrate that the ElectroPen (patent pending) is a powerful ultralow-cost device that can be applied in various settings from low-resource high school groups to equipped university laboratories, and we envision the application of this device in these settings across the world.
In order to ensure effective implementation of this device across the world, we have received feedback and design inputs for improvements and suggestions for the ElectroPen. From both the TAS Taipei and UGA teams, we received suggestions to increase the length of the wires and create terminals on the cuvettes such that the ElectroPen can connect to it. We also received recommendations to create a latch for the toggle to remain secured within the casing. In recognition of these suggestions, we will soon develop another iteration of the ElectroPen as an improvement.
We recognize the importance of collaboration in the validation of the ElectroPen's"

Cost analysis
Our test is much cheaper than existing solutions, especially when you consider the final product will be a multiplexing assay which will test for many diseases simultaneously.
Qiagen PAXgene blood RNA tube: 1 @ £752 / 100 kits [11]
£7.52

£0.85
Other lab equipment e.g. sterilisation: tubes: gloves (approx) [13]
£0.30
Total
£18.66
We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:

Although we give the transformed  bacterials  some advantages  compared  with the wild type, the advantages just exist in the tumor-targeting therefore it’s still safe for us to use and manipulate.Given that we always keep the bacterials in the cell cultures , there is no chance for them to contact with the outside so it’s harmless for the environment.
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, our team is supported by the Department of Life Science, Nanjing University. So we are under all the Department’s safety regulations. Evaluating the experiments process in terms of safety, the department always reminds our team to put the safey to priority and arrange some experienced research assistants to help us.
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
In terms of the safety issues, when the synthetic products have the chance to be commercial products,we should consider the harmony between synthetic and natural products and find an appropriate place for the synthetic products ,most importantly, establish some particular protocols for these products which are created by human.

Features
Accurate model of E. coli motility
A versatile bacterium model is specified in the BSim core libraries. The default BSim bacterium exhibits physically correct run-and-tumble motion powered by a flagellar motor, and can be made to replicate and produce outer membrane vesicles in a biologically realistic manner.
Flexible interactions
BSim allows the user to specify the actions and interactions present between different elements in the simulation. The specification allows for easily specified and adaptable behaviour based on what is actually required for a specific simulation. Everything can interact!
Delivery
Another common type of collision is the delivery of a small particle (a molecule or a vesicle) to the collision partner (a bacterium). This can be easily added to the simulations.
Force based dynamics
All of the dynamics and motion in BSim is calculated based on the forces acting on each particle. This applies to many of the other features such as Brownian motion, where any motions are added as a force to the particle.
Choice of boundary types
If an update to one of a particle's Cartesian coordinates causes the particle to stray beyond a solid boundary, the coordinate is updated again to place the particle an the same distance inside the boundary as it was outside. Wrapping boundaries cause the particle to reappear an same distance away from the opposing face of the box. Boundaries wrap by default. This can be modified to have solid boundaries instead.
Brownian motion
Brownian motion is handled by including a Brownian force in the sum of external forces acting upon all of the specified particles in the simulation.
Vesiculation
Many bacteria naturally produce outer membrane vesicles, and the size and rate of production seems to be based on rate of change of bacterial surface area. BSim includes physically based OMV production dynamics which were incorporated into our main iGEM project to allow us to analyse the effectiveness of OMV based communication.
Chemical fields
Chemical fields play an important part in many biological systems. BSim allows the user to specify an arbitrary chemical field and use this to realistically interact with the bacterial behaviour."

Binding site ""a"" contains two direct tandem repeats; binding site ""b"" is a palindromic target which contains two inverted tandem repeats while binding site ""c"" consists of three half sites with both direct and inverted tandem repeats. The binding sites ""abc"" have been previously localized in the PalcA by footprinting experiments and it has also been shown that each AlcR target in the PalcA contributes differently to the activation of the downstream protein expression [3].

This assembly method can be used for BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, called vector. So you have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.

Again, the responses were still in a range from positive to very positive, however with less enthusiasm than for the first question, probably because in their situation, improving dressings was their top priority.
Other comments
We also included the possibility to make additional comments in the survey and there were some very interesting suggestions of new applications using Cerberus:
Molecule to heal burns and moistening products
Antifungal molecules
Hemostatic molecules
Anti-odor molecules
Fibrinogenic or anti-fibrinogenic molecules
There was also a very smart suggestion to create dressings with different localized properties depending on the position (for example, favoring epithelialization on the side and antifibrinogenic in the center).
Conclusion
These surveys clearly showed that new functionalities for cellulose could have very desirable applications in the medical sector. There are real needs from both patients and practicians. We had very exciting feedback and very interesting suggestions to improve our project. Finally, the interest for Cerberus goes beyond medical applications and nearly all the people we asked  believe in a wide importance of this project for society.
EXPERT'S ADVICE
The Cerberus project was very ambitious, even from the start. Somehow, it was not one project but several since we decided to tackle several problematics but with one universal solution. This universality came at a cost since grafting organic and inorganic molecules is a very different challenge. For organic ones, we had synthetic biology with us. But for inorganic one, the challenge was to gather biology and chemistry, the latter being, at the start of the project, a big unknown field for us. We therefore had to explain our project to international and national experts, get their feedbacks, and integrate it in our design. Here are some of the most important ones for us.

After graduating from USTC in 2010, Han joined the Ph.D. program at the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). His thesis work with Prof. Peter G. Schultz focused on expanding the technique of genetically incorporating unnatural amino acids in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and applying this technique for better cancer therapeutics. In 2015, Han joined the laboratory of Prof. Carolyn R. Bertozzi as a Good Ventures Postdoctoral Fellow of the Life Science Research Foundation at the Stanford University. In his postdoctoral work"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

Internet users
To people of our age, internet is an almost indispensable  part of our life. It is therefore necessary that we have a way of “spreading  the word” online to tell even more people about synthetic biology and iGEM.
To people of our age, internet is an almost indispensable part of our life. It is therefore necessary that we have a way of “spreading the word” online to tell even more people about synthetic biology and iGEM.          For internet users, the easiest and most passive way is to simply build a website and wait for people to come. We build our wiki early-on and had updated it along the way. However, with all the trillions of websites, why would people just come and click on yours? This is why we utilized other more fashionable ways of advertising: Blogs, School Website, Renren.com (the equivalent of Facebook), and Weibo (the equivalent of Twitter). We also designed an app for android that we passed around to other students.  
Collaboration
Throughout our project, we’ve had collaborations with various other  iGEM teams. Such collaborations have benefitted all of us, and we would like to  write it down here for future team’s reference.
Collaboration with Tsinghua-A team
The team we collaborated with the most is definitely Tsinghua-A. They  proved to be very good partners, and we helped each other in many ways along  the way. For example, we communicate a lot about our team project and we give  many suggestions to each other. Besides, we held a joint seminar to introduce  iGEM and enjoyed great success – many of the undergraduates, even some graduate  students came to listen.
Collaboration with Peking team
The second team we had a lot of collaboration with is the PKU iGEM team.  At the PKU team’s invitation, we attended a joint meeting to promote iGEM in  PKU, and exchanged our ideas and inspirations. We learned a lot from the PKU  team, and the two teams have kept a friendly relationship since. They soon  returned the favor: when we needed to obtain some AHL for testing, it was also  the PKU team that quickly came to our help and provided the reagents.
Collaboration with SUSTC-Shenzhen-B
We also helped some other teams with their projects. For the SUSTC-Shenzhen-B  team, we helped them test their terminator efficiency calculator"

</br> The goal of this module is to control the expression of bacteriophages using V.fischeri’s quorum sensing system.  To do this, we will use three parts: luxI, luxR and the pLux.
First, a chromosomal integration of the two genes of interest (luxI and luxR) is required. This integration will take place in two different loci (lpp and msbB). The idea is to insert these genes and simultaneously knock out two genes of the bacterial membrane (for more information see <a href=""module1.html"">Module I</a>). This way, the genes will be expressing the autoinducer synthase and the LuxR protein at all times.
The second part of the strategy is the direct mutagenesis of the phage M13 at the promoter of the PII protein. The PCR mutagenesis will add the pLux as a promoter of PII protein. This protein is responsible for the replication of the single strand by nicking the double stranded form of the genome. For more information, refer to <a href=""module2.html"">Module II</a>.

In the second step we have done extensive research into our customers. We have talked to multiple potential customers in order to determine exactly what their needs are and how our product can meet these needs.
In the third, and final, step we have used the knowledge of the previous two steps to write a complete business plan that can be used to talk with potential investors and can function as blueprint for our future startup.

Key Partnership
We have to establish several key partnerships with multiple parties. First of all, the suppliers of raw materials can be considered as important key partners. Among them there are, for example, companies that deliver the required mediums, nutrients, etc. With those companies we will have a buyer-supplier relationship, motivated by a need to acquire key resources. Another key partnership is with the suppliers of production equipment (reactors). With these companies there will be a longtime relationship. For example, a service contract could make them responsible for irregularities, while we guarantee them monthly revenues. It is important to analyze which companies are unreplaceable. For example, are there companies that produce a specific raw material that only they produce. In that case, we are very depending on that specific partner and this could be a risk. When the company, for instance, is not able to deliver the products or even goes bankrupt this can result in production problems. Therefore, it is important to analyze those possible risk and, if possible, to find alternatives in order to reduce the risks.
Key Activities
The company has two possible main activities, the manufacturing of the MLAs or being a licensor of the MLAs. As manufacturer we will produce the MLAs and sell them to a specific or multiple different solar panel manufacturers. It is important that the production pathway of the company, and the final product is adapted to the solar panel companies. As producer we have to decide what production process we will be using and decide on the right technologies, machines, inventory management system, etc. Furthermore, we have to think about aspects such as the right production capacity, quality, cost control, etc.
A second option is to be a licensor. In that case, an external party will get permission to produce their own biologically MLAs. A solar panel manufacturer could for example prefer to produce the MLAs"

Meeting up
Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project of iGEM. We found some problems in the design of each                         other's projects through communication, and discussed some solutions and ideas. Each team                         received a lot of pertinent suggestions from the others, which helped a lot to our project.
Meetup in Shanghai
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. All of the teams exchanged ideas about their project and original design                         and have a quick exhibition of the poster, give some simple but classic presentation. Among                         which we also try to find ways to better collaborate with other teams, especially in the                         modelling and outreach. We received more than 10 useful advises about our project and having a                         great time!

Public Engagement Summary
Since the beginning of planning our project, it was decided that engaging with the public in an array of settings would be central to all activities of our team. From teaching teens about synthetic biology, to talking to Synbio entrepreneurs, we were consistently trying not only to gain information from those more informed but also to impart the knowledge we had to younger generations.
Through the UCC Societies Summer Camp and Secondary School presentations we were enabled to teach school age children about the creativity which can be associated with Synbio along with some of the more specific Synbio applications in society. Producing our Golden Rice Video enabled us to teach the students about how simply putting a gene from a plant into a bacterium, could facilitate the risk of many blindnesses being dramatically reduced. Presenting genetic modification in a concise and simple way really aided the students in not only understanding what synthetic biology is, but also in coming up with some of their own ideas for how it could solve a variety of problems across the world. Our original song I like it Lactis conveyed what Synbio can do especially with the GRAS organism Lactococcus Lactis which we used in our project. To add to all of this, next month we will also be partaking in events around Cork City for Science Week. This will involve giving a workshop based around DNA and also teaching about synthetic biology to inspire an interest among a variety of young people across our city.
Our involvement with the Synbio accelerator IndieBio allowed us to truly appreciate how synthetic biology research can be applied to solve real world problems such as malnutrition. We also came to grasp the logistics involved in setting up or working as part of a Synbio startup.
The fundraising component of our public engagement was definitely among the most enjoyable elements of our project. From getting drastic haircuts, to running 5km while getting powder thrown at us, to freefalling through the clouds we had a fantastic time while also making a contribution to numerous worthwhile causes.

1. Identification of glyphosate uptake systems
1.1. Interaction between glyphosate and Bacillus subtilis
To create a proper detection system using the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, we first had to evaluate how this organism behaves in the presence of glyphosate. Previously, it was shown that glyphosate negatively affects growth of B. subtilis due to the inhibition of the EPSP synthase AroE (Figure 1A) (1). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 1.8 mM of glyphosate was required to inhibit the growth rate by 50%. To re-evaluate the effect of glyphosate on growth of our B.  subtilis laboratory strains 168 and SP1, we performed growth experiments in CS-Glc minimal medium that was supplemented with increasing amounts of glyphosate (Figure 1B). CS-Glc medium contains glucose and succinate as carbon sources and ammonium as the nitrogen source (see Notebook ). While the B. subtilis strain 168 is auxotrophic for tryptophan due to a mutation in the trpC gene, the strain SP1 can grow in the absence of exogenous tryptophan (2).

It is clearly visible that the induced chips are exhibiting a significantly higher fluorescence than the non-induced chips. This shows that the constructs also work  as intended in the sensor chips: The TEV protease cuts the linker so that the fusion protein is separated into GFP and a dark quencher, disabling the quenching. GFP has a clear fluorescence emission after the fusion protein has been successfully cut into two pieces by the TEV protease.

K1319013 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008 and K731520 in an non-induced (top) and induced (bottom) chip
Comparing the factor of fluorescence increase of induced (bottom) and not induced (top) sensor chips to the first frame of the measurement. The tested constructs are K1319013 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008 and K731520. After five hours, the fluorescence in our dual-plasmid REACh construct contaning K1319014 had increased by a factor of about 8, while K731520 fluorescence increased by only a factor of 2-3.
The analysis of the different sensor chips with the three different construct K1319013 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008 and K731520 demonstrates the same fluorescence response kinetic as in the shake flask experiments. The double plasmid systems exhibits a faster and stronger fluorescence response compared to a standard GFP expression in K731520. The build up pool of fusion proteins allows for a faster, stronger fluorescence response when the induced TEV protease cleaves the fusion proteins and releases GFP from its dark quencher.
Outlook
The system of the GFP-REACh fusion proteins with an inducible TEV protease has been established and shows the desired results of being faster than standard expression. The next step will be to devise an expression of the TEV protease inducible by HSL instead of IPTG and then to incorporate both the HSL inducible TEV protease and the fusion protein into one plasmid backbone. This would also allow us to choose a high copy plasmid for both inserts, instead of a high copy plasmid for the TEV protease and a low to mid copy plasmid for the fusion protein which should yield an overall higher fluorescence readout.

In difficult problems, success is made more probable and easy by multi-team involvement. Waterloo has participated in both bilateral and multilateral collaboration activities.
Bilateral
We have collaborated with the new Ryerson iGEM team in building their wiki, providing web construction technical support by: generating graphics, co-designing their pages, holding basic coding tutorials, and directed the team to helpful resources.
Toronto approached us to build the platform for one of their human practices project, creating an immersive directory of synthetic biologists.  It will be an ongoing collaboration between our teams, with the support of Ontario Genomics.  We have created the directory’s user authentication system and a simple mailer for newsletter, as well as made arrangements with one of our advisors to oversee the continuity of this project in future iGEM seasons.
Our lab also supplied Dalhousie Halifax NS with the pJC8 cosmid and associated protocol to assist in the construction of their metagenomic library.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," The growing neo-fascist movements, for example.’ (Saul, 2001).  He elaborates this point by saying ‘The levers of power are inside.  If you’re not there – elected and present – your only hope is to influence those who are.  Suddenly your role is not that of a public person, but of a courtier – a lobbyist.  You are on the outside, lobbying for change.  Even if the cause is good, a lobbyist is a lobbyist is a lobbyist.’  This is not to argue we should only protest ‘via the ballot box’ after all it could be argued the lack of legitimate representation by their politicians has driven many to form and work for these NGOs.  This necessary point raised, it must be noted that when it comes to synthetic biology, trade and justice, facts such as ‘Not only are industrial agrofuels driving the world’s poorest farmers off their land and into deeper poverty,  they are the single greatest factor contributing to soaring food prices’ (Mitchell, 2008)(in a leaked report from the World Bank) and a large degree of the research and work being conducted in synthetic biology is by companies such as BP, GM, DuPont, Pfizer, Cargill, Dow Chemical, International Paper, Microsoft, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil etc (ETC Group, 2008).  These companies represent the largest or some of the largest corporations in their fields, which when coupled with many having a less than unassailable ethical record perhaps validate concerns that there is no reason to expect that synthetic biology will be any different than many other areas in terms of balancing the rights of all stakeholders. To return to the nature of patents and intellectual property regarding synthetic biology, there are many past examples that we should use to anticipate likely developments and hopefully improve on past mistakes.  The company Myriad Genetics could be said to embody some of the fears concerning intellectual property and genetics.  It patented mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene, the presence of these mutations show increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers.  The company ‘has demanded that even not-for-profit labs screening for mutations pay a license fee, thus discouraging screening.’ (Stiglitz, 2006)  Dr Skolnick of Myriad argued in favour of such patents saying ‘If it’s not patented you won’t get some group to spend money to develop it, and you won’t get a high-quality, inexpensive test’ (Rimmer, 2008).

Introduction
We envision a new paradigm for treating infections of the human gastrointestinal tract through exploitation of engineered probiotics that produce anti-microbials with high specificity for pathogens. The anti-microbials we are exploring do not utilize a one-fit all therapy mold, but target unique features specific to organisms at the genetic level. Towards this aim, we have utilized a general-purpose system that will be delivered to pathogenic bacteria from an engineered bacterial species found in the GI tract (Escherichia coli), which will cleave pathogenic genes with single nucleotide resolution. To achieve specific genome targeting, we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 system with gRNA engineered to recognize genes from infectious bacteria that contribute to pathogenicity in humans. Our CRISPR/Cas9 system will be delivered from the engineered E. coli to infectious bacteria using bacterial specific phages, minimizing any side-effects to native microbiota and human-host cells. As a proof-of-principle for our engineered probiotic, we are starting by targeting Vibrio cholerae, however we hope to expand the system to other pathogens of the GI tract.
Probiotics
Once complete, our system will be able to remain as a stable population in a person’s gut until the event of a V. cholerae infection. Detection of V. cholerae will then activate production of the phage delivery system, which will package the gRNA and Cas9 targeting system into a phage coat, exit the probiotic and transfer the system into V. cholerae present in the gut (transmission of a heterologous DNA message via phage was demonstrated by Ortiz and Endy in 2012 and featured in Waterloo’s 2013 iGEM project (2)). Once inside V. cholerae, the targeting system will bind and cleave sites complementary to the gRNA that correspond to selected pathogenicity genes. We proposed using Cas9/gRNA to target and kill pathogens as opposed to traditional phage therapy using a targeted lytic phage because it allowed us to differentiate and kill harmful pathogens of a strain that has both harmful and harmless serotypes. The gRNA in our system, while specific to V. cholerae, can easily be altered with PCR to target unique regions in other gastrointestinal pathogens.

Modeling the Gene Regulatory Network
Our group seeks to assess the optimality of the synthetic system that modulates pucBA gene expression and LH2 complex assembly in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Project#Detector#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"pestris (Boch et al., 2009).
In addition to RVDs, the DNA binding affinity is also subject to polarity effects. Point mutations at the 5’ end of the target sequence affect TALE-DNA recognition more than the ones at the 3’ end (Meckler et al., 2013). Taking this in consideration, recommendations for TALE design include incorporation of strong RVDs close to the N-terminus (Streubel et al., 2012).
Because TAL effectors can be engineered to bind virtually any DNA sequence, they represent a powerful tool in synthetic biology. They have been extensively used in gene modulation by fusing an activator or a repressor to their C-terminus. Slovenia 2012 iGEM team designed and created repressor TAL effectors by adding KRAB repressor domains and activator TALEs through fusion VP16 activation domain.
Besides gene regulation, TALEs can be fused with DNA cleavage domains of endonucleases and serve as restriction enzymes (Beurdeley et al., 2013). These engineered proteins are termed TALENs or Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases. TALENs can also be used in gene knockout as they are able to promote gene disruption (Bogdanove & Voytas, 2011).
Our team, however, proposes an innovative application for TAL effectors: detection of pathogenic E. coli (EHEC) and other entero-haemorrhagic bacteria in feces of super-shedders in cattle populations. As sensors, TALEs can bind to specific regions of the Shiga Toxin II gene (Stx2) and capture the DNA of interest from a feces sample, making it available for a second TALE, whose binding domain is specific for another region of Stx2. This second TALE is connected to a reporter, which turns the TALE-DNA interaction visible in a short period of time. To find out more about our EHEC TALEs, click here .

Sequencing
Sequencing is the final step of the journey and generally makes up a lot of different and varying methods with the common purpose of determining the primary atomic-level structure of what you’re interested in, resulting in sequences of bases making it all up. Most often this includes proteins, polymers or as in our case the keys to life: genetic material; enabling us to read it like a book of sorts.
Oxford Nanopore’s MinION third generation sequencing device make use of nano-sized holes called nanopores with an applied voltage across them. In essence: when your material of choice passes through one of these pores, each base fluctuates this current by a given amount which acts as a fingerprint to identify the given base [1].
Figure 1. The MinION device.
Experiment
Sequencing the final library-prepped RNA includes three primary steps: Priming, loading and sequencing.
Priming the Flowcell
The flow cell is essentially where the magic happens. Before the sequencing can take place, a type of storing liquid which protects the flow cell has to be emptied and replaced with a mixture that primes the flow cell, essentially making it ready to sequence. A scan is also performed during this step which tells you how many pores are actually working.
Loading the Flowcell
Loading the flow cell is a bit tricky, as the wrong action can completely destroy the whole cell. By sucking up the primer mixture carefully with a pipette through a disposal vent, a kind of suction is created over the actual pore-membrane area which lets you (with some quick manouvering skills) drop by drop load your sample into that chamber with the help of a pipette which sucks it all down.
Being to slow in this process can result in bubbles forming across the membrane which effectively kills all of the pores.
Sequencing
At this step the sequencing can be started, as the software essentially takes care of everything!

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Welcome
   Wuhan, composed of the three towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, is the capital of Hubei Province. Two bridges link the three towns, separated by the Yangzi River and Hanshui River, and because these municipalities are so closely connected by waterways, Wuhan is also called the ""city on rivers.""
   In addition, being regarded as A Thoroughfare to Nine Provinces, Wuhan is the most significant water hub and rail transportation and communication of China. Today, Wuhan has been the political, economic, and cultural center of Central China.
Introduction to SEA project
   Super E.coli Architect (SEA) is a kind of design software for engineering bacteria and offers a convenient and efficient design platform, having capability to integrate scattered simple ideas into a complete solution.
   However, most existing synthetic biology softwares involve merely such specific functions as finding genes, metabolism pathways, and biobrick design, and it is just because of the intense specificity of those softwares that they are limited only to scientific researchers.
    In order to make synthetic biology softwares more available to common designers who would like to do jobs on synthetic biology but might be not so familiar with it as scientists do, we are determined to alter the science of artificial biosystem into an engineering program with the standard process.
   At the thought above, we constructed the software, SEA, for not only scientists but also common designers.
   Fortunately, it has been proved that the SEA we have developed is able to release designers from technical details by helping them work as specific architects and allowing them to take more attention to constructing engineering bacteria to solve practical problems.

Domino
With the hope to change the tendency of society, we tried to explore more creative ways to show the public that art-and-science work can be so easily-achieved but can make our daily life so colorful and vigorous.
For the public, especially those with limited knowledge of biology, a complicated and conventional circuit description was a barrier preventing them from lasting interest and further understanding. How can we combine the science rationale and fun to present our circuit in a brand-new way? We thought about domino. With dominos’ falling down denoting genes’ expression, small balls’ rolling denoting small molecules’ delivering and other interesting design, students we invited all agreed that it’s a wonderful and imaginative way to practice edutainment. Watch the video and find all those ingenious points we hide in the domino! We will be glad to know if you like our innovative idea. Broaden your horizon and be the pioneers like us!"

NYMU-Taipei,2014,Team:NYMU-Taipei#project#3c_-_-_TEXT.html," good indicator for tooth decay – even more so than S. mutans, its main cause! Also, like S. mutans, it is present in almost everyone’s mouth, meaning it is safe to use and safe to insert. Lastly, a peculiar trait for S. sobrinus is that its population rises sharply right before tooth decay is about to occur. Therefore, if we inserted a modified S. sobrinus, and allowed it to manufacture a distinct signaling product, we can detect when tooth decay is about to happen by the sudden flood of that product.
But what will that product be? A fluorescent protein is very visible, but natural low levels of S. sobrinus in your mouth would mean a perpetual colored glow on your teeth, which can be embarrassing and unsightly. Something that’s more pleasant, just as effective, but not quite as conspicuous is a smell, and specifically the smell of banana, caused by isoamyl acetate.
Isoamyl acetate is produced from many possible pathways, but a convenient three-step mechanism uses L-Leucine as the raw material, and involves Saccharomyces cerevisiae, otherwise known as the Baker’s yeast or the Brewer’s yeast. In this case, we stand on the shoulders of past teams, as the [2006 MIT iGEM team] has already biobricked the three enzymes. Because of this, we simply constructed the three enzymes together into a full circuit.
Aside from that, we added two terminators in front of the main enzymes, in order to act as a threshold (Please see [Control: Target] for more information on the use of terminators as thresholds). The significance of this addition is that it prevents a constitutive expression of the banana odor, and thus makes it less detectable and annoying to users. Only when tooth decay is about to happen and the amount of S. sobrinus multiplies hugely do users start to detect the characteristic banana odor.
Putting it to the test!
Part introduction
(1) Branched-chain amino acid transaminase (banana 1): Branched-chain amino acid transaminase is a branched-chain amino acid transaminase derived from BAT2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BAT2 catalyzes the first step in isoamyl alcohol biosynthesis: conversion of leucine to α-ketoisocaproate via enzymatic reaction.

UCL,2016,Team:UCLA#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," new wacky species of animals that are crosses of other species. It was really awe-inspiring to see the young people of our society thinking creatively about science, and furthermore how many of these students wanted to pursue careers in the sciences. Following this brainstorming activity, we held a Socratic seminar-like activity focused on bioethics and thinking about the implications and consequences of synthetic biology and progress. It was impressive how many students were able to think critically about the situation, but also hold positive outlooks and convincing arguments for science and research.
We believe our Human Practices project has had a highly positive influence on these students, and while our direct impact is small, our reach does not stop there. Our education for these students will inevitably prompt further discussion and creativity not only for those we worked with, but those who these students come into contact with. Whether it be at home, when they tell their families and friends about what the learned at school, to years from now when they enter college and embark on the same journeys as we at UCLA iGEM have."

Tyrocidine has an unique mode of acton wherein it disrupts the function of the cell membrane. Unfortunately, it has high toxicity towards human blood and reproductive cells and can only be used in topical applications. This makes tyrocidine an interesting target for drug improvement.

Potential NRP targets for drug improvement
In addition to tyrocidine, ciclosporin (or cyclosporin) is an important nonribosomal peptide drug used as an immunosuppressant in transplantations [12]. It consists of eleven amino acids which are cyclized upon releasing from the NRPS, like tyrocidine and contains D-amino acids and amino acids with modifications (Figure #). It was first isolated from the filamentous fungi Tolypocladium inflatum in 1969. In 1972, its function as immunosuppresant was discovered by Sandoz (now Novartis). Despite, its widely use in clinal applications it is associated with side effects (adverse drug reactions) [12]. In ciclosporin G which is also isolated from Tolypocladium inflatum, the a-aminobutyric acid residue in position 2 has been replaced by norvaline [13]. Ciclosporin G has reduced side effects in some clinical applications and it highlights the possibility of drug improvement by NRPS engineering. A total of 25 derivates of ciclosporin are known  [-1].

Microfluidic Agent-Based Model
Motivation and Aim
Digital microfluidics is an area of study intersecting biology, computer science, electronics and several different engineering disciplines. The technology has seen a number of advances and improvements over recent years, with the dream of a “lab on a chip” inching ever closer. Digital microfluidic devices satisfy the requirements of our project very well as they allow the process of switching modular components to be automated. We explored how digital microfluidics could be used to automatically mix the the different modular cellular components in our biosensors in different ratios to optimise the biosensor response characteristics. Our first step was to develop a simulator to model the behaviour of droplet movement on droplet-based devices.       The aim of creating this model was to eventually create software to be used alongside microfluidic devices to continue the theme of automation of production of modular components in the project.
Why Digital Microfluidics?
The motivation behind working on a project creating software for digital microfluidics over other microfluidic techniques stems from the numerous advantages that it confers over a more traditional setting involving continuous flow microfluidics. The most basic of these advantages is very simple in that it allows for a reduction in consumed reagents and samples. A natural bonus of this is the expenses saved in using lower quantities of reagents. This also offers another less obvious advantage in that as other microfluidic techniques have shown, a lower reagent volume causes a faster overall result (Whitesides, 2006). The comparatively larger surface to volume ratio which can be achieved with the droplets also aids the speed with which reactions can occur. (Haeberle and Zengerle, 2007). As such, when dealing with single droplets of reagents, as is always the case in a digital microfluidic setting, digital"

The more male fish there are the greater the chance is that an egg is fertilized. Increasing this number increases the number of male fish                     needed to fertilize eggs (a large body of water will have a greater value for this parameter).

The more male birds there are the greater the chance is that an egg is fertilized. Increasing this number increases the number of male                     birds needed to fertilize eggs (a large body ecosystem will have a greater value for this parameter).
Insight
In the following section we explain the reasoning behind the two stochastic processes employed in the model:                        • Feminization of the male fish                        • Reproduction of the birds/fish. All male fish accumulate estrogen in their bodies when exposed to high levels of estrogen in their environment.   Juvenile males will be more affected by exposure to estrogen, thus they will store it at a faster rate than sexually   matured males. The rate of estrogen storage for a juvenile male fish is captured by the formula below:
Mature male fish store estrogen at a slower rate. A male fish is defined as mature when its age is greater than or   equal to the age it is old enough to reproduce. The rate of estrogen storage for a mature male fish is captured by   the formula below:
The model updates the state of each agent each tick. A tick is essentially representative of all the life functions   an agent needs to carry out. In a tick each organism will consume food, increment its age, move, reproduce, and   determine whether or not it needs to die. Each tick, the model of a male fish will call a function that uses a random number generator (RNG) to   determine whether or not they are feminized. The chance for a male fish to be feminized is captured by the   formula below:

For her master thesis in the group of prof. L. Brunsveld, she worked on synthetic signaling networks, investigating combinatorial inhibition of scaffold proteins and extension of the existing network by incorporating phosphorylation. During an internship at the Centralised and Point-of-Care Solutions division of Roche Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim, she developed an assay to quantify an enzyme of interest in complex matrix. Currently, Lenne is a PhD candidate in the Chemical Biology group of prof. L. Brunsveld. Her research focuses on heterodimerization of the scaffold protein 14-3-3, following two directions: orthogonal and human heterodimerization. In the orthogonal dimerization project, orthogonal 14-3-3 heterodimerization modules will be created, which form the basis for synthetic signaling networks. The human heterodimerization project aims to create a better understanding of human 14-3-3 isoform heterodimerization by making use of 14-3-3 fusion scaffolds.

One of the major advantages of whole cell biosensors is that they are able to detect substances by class, and not only one specific substance [3]. Another advantage is that microbial biosensors can give not only analytical output (ie. what is the concentration of the analyte?) but also functional output (ie. how does my living system respond to the analyte?) [2]. In our discussion with Mr. Van Der Burg of BioDetection Systems , he mentioned in this context that with their whole cell biosensors, they stay close to the physiology of the subject to exploit this.
The biggest advantage of microbial biosensors however is the fact that evolution has already created an enormous amount of biosensors for us. Organisms sense environmental compounds to influence their decisions; they will only make a certain metabolic enzyme if the specific metabolite is sensed. Evolution has optimized such systems, thus creating bioreceptors for a lot of compounds [4]. This is used to find to find “new” biosensors: Mr Van Der Burg has told us that to find a dioxin bioreceptor, they  “[search] for dioxin receptors which might have arisen in species living in contaminated areas.”
The most used sensing elements are promoter regions involved in the response of the cell to the target chemical. [3] With synthetic biology techniques, it is possible to isolate and enhance this promoter region and connect them to the appropriate reporter system. Currently, the most used reporters are genes which yield an optical (colorimetric, fluorescent, bioluminescent) signal. [3] These signals are processed with the use of various microscopy set-ups.
As already mentioned, nature has provided with a large array of possible microbial biosensors. With this as a start, a lot of whole cell biosensors have been developed.  This is illustrated by the fact that only in iGEM, hundreds of  biosensors have been developed. Also, D’Souza [4] published a list of 44 papers describing biosensors already in 2001. However, microbial biosensors have only very limitedly been commercialized. Su et al. [5] state:  “Commercial microbial biosensors are just tips of the iceberg compared to the great amount of academic research on them”. They relate this to “the intrinsic disadvantages (slow response, low sensitivity, and poor selectivity)” of microbial biosensors, which, however, can and will be solved by the developments in synthetic biology [5].
One major reason microbial biosensors are currently limitedly used is not mentioned by Su et al., namely the fact that most current microbial biosensors require a"

Self-assembled DNA Tweezer Nanomachine
In a biosensor, a bioreceptor interacts with the analyte and this interaction will be converted into a                 measurable signal by a transducer.
In our design, a split DNA aptamer is integrated into G-quadruplex tweezers to detect the miRNA 25. It                     is found that comparing with various DNA machine mechanisms, DNA tweezers hold some specific                     advantages for sensing applications as the mechanism does not involve strand displacement and the                     structure is formed from only a small number of single-stranded DNA molecules. [1] Besides, it is                     believed that aptamer-based sensors act as a better sensor comparing to antibodies because they are less                     expensive, more stable than antibodies. Similarly, comparing with antibody-antigen interaction,                     aptamers also show high thermostability and specificity in binding the miRNA 25 through Watson-                     Crick base pairing. [2, 3]
Regarding to reporting system that enables exhibition of results, G-quadruplex, which mediated                     peroxidase activity with hemin can be observed colorimetrically, could be adopted into the tweezer                     well. Therefore, a quadruplex-hemin reporting system is ideal compared to fluorescence as it is                     relatively low-cost and visualizable by eye for potential future diagnostic application in a rapid                     diagnostic device. [4, 5]
Tanner and co-workers demonstrated that a DNA tweezers nanomachine can successfully recognize the                     Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase. In their design, a split DNA aptamer is integrated into                     a G-quadruplex tweezers and closing of the tweezers enables G-quadruplex hemin mediated peroxidase                     activity. [5] A similar nanostructure is designed in our project for the recognition of has-mir 25.
Tiamat, which is a tool to design large and complex DNA nanostructure, is used to design our                     nanostructure [6]. According to figure 1, the nanostructure designed consists of three single strand                     DNA oligos. DNA oligo 1 refers to the longest one in the middle; DNA oligo 2 refers to the"

Sensing Plasmid
The second half of our project revolved around an assembly that sensed the production of L-DOPA.
In our sensing assembly, we employed the transcriptional factor pp2551, a member of the lysr family of transcriptional factors,
Our sensing construct consisted of two primary transcriptional units: one with the pp2551 coding gene and one with the Venus fluorescent protein coding gene. We constructed this assembly using golden gate, gibson, and traditional cloning techniques.
We had some trouble cloning our sensing assembly, and as a result, we transitioned from using golden gate assembly methods to gibson assembly methods to traditional cloning techniques. Initially, we attempted to clone our assembly using gol

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," offer some explanations for our wet-lab results. The disadvantage of this approach is that there are no reaction constants available for it, so we will have to estimate them.
Approach 1 – cofactor saturation assumption
If we assume that the levels of cofactor in the enzyme's environment are high enough that they are at saturation, the probability of finding an enzyme that is not connected to a cofactor is negligible. We also need to assume that the concentrations of both cofactors are almost equal, so the inhibitory effect [need article] will not affect the reaction (as we will show later, a large ratio of one cofactor in relation to another will inhibit the other direction of the reaction). The new kinetic schematic is:
Figure 3 – kinetic schematic for high cofactor concentrations
Since both levels of NADPH and NADP are saturated, we'll assume product inhibition occurs only with DHT and \(3\alpha-diol\), so the reaction will resemble a Michaelis-Menten reversible reaction. Since the degradation rates of the hormones on the scalp are unknown, we will neglect them by assuming the degradation is slower by several orders of magnitude than the enzymatic reaction.
We can summarize the reactions by the following coupled differential equations:
\[\left( I \right)\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}{\frac{{d\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{dt}} = \frac{{{V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{k_s}}} - {V_{{m_r}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{k_p}}}}}{{1 + \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{k_s}}} + \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{k_p}}}}}}\\{\frac{{d\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{dt}} = \frac{{{V_{{m_r}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{k_p}}} - {V_{{m_f}}} \cdot \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{k_s}}}}}{{1 + \frac{{\left[ {DHT} \right]}}{{{k_s}}} + \frac{{\left[ {3\alpha diol} \right]}}{{{k_p}}}}}}\end{array"

Initially, slicing and printing took place at the local hackerspace with counseling by experienced members of the groups. The printer, a Printrbot Plus v2 was made available by the hackerspace community as well. After a total of roughly 34 hours of work, a first model was successfully printed from ABS. Like the models described in the MFC-Evolution paragraph , the design was changed several times. Some of the results can be seen in Figure 17. In early August, Bielefeld Universities Faculty of Physics offered their help. They printed out all subsequent designs with their RepRapPro Mono-Mendel using PLA plastic and also executed the slicing process.

The final model, illustrated in Figure 19, was finished in September. It features a 4-part design like the second generation model described in the MFC-Evolution section and has tube connectors for aeration of each individual chamber. Polysiloxane is used instead of rubber gaskets, the membrane and electrodes are fixed between the four frames of the reaction chambers. The end plates are held together by M3 threaded rods with M3 nuts. The materials necessary for building this fuel cells chassis cost less than 4€ and the cell is biodegradable.

BBa_K2633000 proB + RBS + Pseudomonas acdS+ linker + GFPmut3b + term FCP2-01
This part is used to constitutively express a fusion protein of Pseudomonas sp. acdS and eGFP. Our team transformed a restriction-illegal version of this part into FCP2-01 and inoculated Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species, with this transformed bacteria. We observed colonization of roots with this bacteria up to 4 weeks after inoculation."
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Finance_-_-_TEXT.html," over 500 sampling sites mandated to be monitored for their water quality in the province of Alberta.  Each one of these monitoring sites are required to take a variable number of samples at different locations around the sites as well as a variable number of periods throughout the year.  By estimating the potential number of sites that could use our technology, our group estimates that the total market potential of our general toxin sensor is $7.5 Million annually.  If our technology could displace 30% of this market, their is the potential of producing a $2.25 Million annual revenue for our general toxin sensor alone.
Cost To Develop Our Product
From our manufacturing analysis which was done in collaboration with provincial government programs, we were able to determine the potential cost of developing our prototype into an actual product. From this analysis we have been able to predict that our prototype development will take approximately 1 year at a cost of ~$250,000.  A single cartridge for the detection of toxins in a water sample could cost approximately $4.10 and the detector could cost approximately $251.00. The sales price of our cartridges and detector systems were set at $100 and $5,000 respectively to be competitive and more cost effective than other products presently used in this market. Being almost 20x below our sale price, these numbers appear reasonable to obtain profitability and were used in determining our profitability in the market (see below).
Financial Barriers To Market
Numerous hurdles exist in being able to bring this technology to market, the largest of which being the necessary regulatory assessment hurdles needed to for our technology to be used as a standard (a single EPA application could cost as much as $350,000 posing a critical issue in developing our company).  In addition, marketing will be a critical aspect to ensure that the market adopts our technology.  Government endorsement, and industry backing from end-users will aid in this development.  A summary of the findings of major barriers to entry into the market is below:
Technology Development (Biological, Engineering, Hardware, Software)
Prototype Development - Bench Scale and Up-Scale
Regulatory Approval (EPA, Health Canada, Environment Canada, etc.)
Marketing
IP Protection
Team Selection, Attracting and Retaining Talent
Overhead and Expenses
Below is a breakdown of the expected expenses of the business for the years of 2014-2016, dictating the amount of capital that will be required in order to achieve our goals.  This was also inspired by our milestones timeline whereby we expect to have a product ready for the market by 2016.
This makes several assumptions listed"

Safety
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/permits/inspection/index-eng.php)
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge are equipped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eyewash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services. (http://www.uleth.ca/risk-and-safety-services/)
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.(http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/index-eng.php)"

TU_Dresden,2017,Team:TU Dresden#Project#Peptidosomes_-_-_TEXT.html," project is the encapsulation and cultivation of bacteria inside the Peptidosomes. For this, it is crucial that while the Fmoc-FF network should hold back the bacteria on the other side it should allow the interchange and communication with the surrounding environment. Thus, allowing fresh nutrients for the organism to enter the inside, and/or to allow the release of secreted molecules to the outside of the Peptidosomes.
Figure 8: Diffusion between the inside of the Peptidosomes and the surrounding environment. The Peptidosomes are shown directly after transfer in water (transparent liquid) or LB medium (yellowish liquid) and after 30 minutes.
Using a straight forward experiment, applying the pH-indicator we were able to prove that a diffusion between the inside of the Peptidosome and the surrounding environment is possible. We transferred Peptidosomes to water or LB medium and monitored the time the pH indicator needed to diffuse outside of the Peptidosomes.
The yellow color of both Paptidosomes (in water and LB) faded over time (Figure 8). In water (left panel), the yellow color completely vanished after about 25-30 minutes. In LB the same effect was visible after 45-50 minutes (right panel).  These observations met our expectations, as the Fmoc-FF membrane is a network of tiny pores, rather than a closed shell. These pores allow the exchange with the surrounding liquid.
Proving that diffusion between the inside of the Peptidosome and the surrounding is possible, we next tested if diffusion between two Peptidosomes which are in direct contact is possible. For this experiment, only one of the two connected Peptidosomes contained the colored pH indicator solution. Over the lapse of 1.5 hours, it was possible to observe a diffusion of the color between both Peptidosomes until it reached an equilibrium (Figure 9). This proved that there is intercommunication, between the two Peptidosomes.
Figure 9: Diffusion between Peptidosomes Different time points of the experiment are shown. The yellow peptidosome (with pH indicator) was fused with an empty Peptidosome (transparent). The color change was then observed over time (1.5 h).
Additionally, to the previous described method of Peptidosome generation, we also tried a microinjection-technique. By doing so, we injected a coloured solution to the inside of the Peptidosome (Figure 10). To close the membrane hole that was introduced by the thin glass capillary, the Pept"

araC-pBad-B0034-tetR-b0015-pTet-B0032-RFP
But we can not get the recombine the bacteria all the time until we test the primer sequence. We use the 3A assembly to connect the gene circuits because the result of OE-PCR was always negative. The primer sequence was got from iGEM. But the design of restriction sites was not considered the protection base so that the restriction enzyme can not work efficiently. So we design the new primer with the consideration of the protection base and build our all gene circuit again. Luckily we get a positive gel result and we send the sample for DNA sequencing.
But the result of sequencing shows that the device, araC-pBad-B0034-CI-B0015, has a base mutation in B0015. And the device, araC-pBad-B0034-tetR-b0015, has a base mutation in tetR so that it becomes termination codon. But the adviser suggests we continue to do the further test because there was something mistake in it probable. The LacIq was completely wrong. We have to build the gene circuit araC-pBad-B0034-LacIq-b0015 again. The results of pTac-B0032-RFP-B0015 and pR-B0032-RFP-B0015.

Sample loading buffer will also be needed.
Materials: bottle, tray, cast, comb, electrophoresis chamber, voltage/current generator, pipette, microwave, weight, spoon, labcoat...
Method
To prepare the gel:
Weight agarose, place it into a bottle with a cap, add TBE 1x buffer
Place the bottle into a microwave, <gras>loosen the cap</gras>, heat it untill it almost boils and the agar is dissolved
Cool it down until it can be hold (that can be done under water)
Add 1.25µl of GelRed
Pour into the casting tray (it is easy to assemble the casting but a way to difficult to discribe), put the comb and wait until it polymerizes
To run the gel:
Take out the comb and place the tray with your gel into the electrophoresis chamber (usually already filled with buffer) so that your wells are nearer to the cation, red side.
TBE 1x buffer should be covering the tray, add more if needed
In a PCR tube mix ~10µl of your sample with 1.5µl of loading solution (quantities indicated may vary with the sample concentration )
Load about 5µl of your sample (this quantity varies with the thickness of the comb used"

HNS/HNST108I
We aimed to compare bacteria motility between two kinds of HNS knock-out E. Coli; first one expresses HNS protein and the other one expresses HNST108I mutant gene. In order to produce these proteins in high amounts, we chose to combine GadE sequence with T7 promoter, a promoter which has a high rate of transcription. In addition to this, to have a controllable system, LacI protein attachable Lac operator was added between these two gene’s sequences and T7 promoter sequence. We searched to find a vector which can lay down all those conditions and found out that peT-45 expression vector is useful. When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of HNS and HNST108I and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning them into peT-45. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequences and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered HNS and HNST108I genes into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final constructs after this cloning are; respectively T7"

The Ice Nucleation Protein protein has been used to display enzymes [1], typically for biocatalysis applications (e.g. Edinburgh iGEM 2011). To make the protein a more manageable size, we truncated the protein to the N and C terminal domains only. The C terminal domain is displayed at the cell surface, while the N terminal domain remains in the outer membrane. We sought to apply this system to health/medicine by displaying DARPin H10-2-G3.

DARPin H10-2-G3
The lab of Andreas Plueckthun at ETH Zurich has pioneered the development of Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) technology. DARPins are engineered antibody-mimetic proteins consisting of 3-5 ankyrin repeat motifs. These proteins have been rationally evolved to high binding affinity with targets through ribosome display. In 2007, the group developed H10-2-G3 [2], a  14.7kDa DARPin  evolved to 90pM affinity with the extracellular domain of HER2 (Figure 2).

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Procject#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," ssDNA binding protein [22,23]. This native Bacilli reecombineering system yielded higher efficiency compared to λ Red in B. subtilis, but lower efficiency in E. coli [21]. Based on heteroloogus expression of many recombinases of different origin in Bacillus subtilis, it was included that recombineering efficiencies were optimised by using a recombinase derived from a phage which host was closely related to heterologous host. We noticed that codon usage of lambda beta is not optimal for expression of B. subtilis and that expression level (likeli due to codon usage) varried among the recombinases tested in the study. In addition, the length of the oligo tested is drastically different from the optimal length in E. coli based on the λ Red Lambda recombineering system.
