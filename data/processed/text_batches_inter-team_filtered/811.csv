Phillip's Notes
Introduction:  Today begins the first attempt at expressing the protein cage received from Yeates.  The glycerol stock will be used to streak a new plate, the bacteria will be grown and protein expression will be induced with IPTG.  Afterwards, affinity purification will be used to obtain a relatively pure protein cage sample for analysis to be determined.
Streaking plates:
Procedures:
A sample from the glycerol stock was scraped using a sterile wire loop and streaked onto ampicillin plates.  Plating was done in a zigzag fashion, and with aseptic techniques. The plate was set in the 37C incubator. LB was made using 25g of Difco LB mix, and autoclaved for 30minutes in a liquid cycle.
Observations:
The cells may have been burned as the tip was not cooled upon the second streak!  Olivia suggested to warm the plate up for ~ 20-30 minutes before use.  The plate was set in the 37C incubator at 2:40PM."

The colonies   from yesterday’s transformation have grown, we have a problem though, THE NEGATIVE CONTROL HAS ALSO GROWN!!!We found out the reason why our results weren’t satisfactory: The antibiotic concentration was too low (20ug/ml of chloranphenical), but the transformations did not result in colonies.
In order to get more accurate and satisfactory results we are going to perform the transformations in the RR1 line once again by doing the following:
- Negative Control, no DNA;
- Positive Control from the Transformation Efficiency Kit;
- BBa_E0840 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
We have followed iGEM’s Transformation Protocol  LB plates – agar with 34ug/ml of chloranphenicol.
We are waiting for our synthesis to arrive!!!

Environment & sustainability
One of the obvious concerns when we first settled on the sticker design was waste. Consumers eat fruit and throw stickers in the bin, or stick them somewhere they shouldn’t be. By mass-producing even more packaging in this way, we are perpetuating the issue of landfill and pollution.In conjunction with discussions we had with OzHarvest volunteers, it was agreed that the way to overcome this problem was to ensure our stickers are biodegradable.  See Integrated Human Practices and Applied Design for more!
Social Justice
Our interaction with OzHarvest, a non-for-profit organisation, was extremely influential in the design selection of our product, as they emphasised the importance of biodegradability. Engagement in this way also provided more depth in our outreach efforts, because we were engaging with an audience already educated in the issue of food wastage.
Collaboration
Collaborating with other iGEM teams worldwide was an invaluable experience. We did extensive collaboration with the UNSW iGEM and Hamburg iGEM teams in particular, as well as engaging in minor collaboration with 6 other iGEM teams. On top of that, we connected with 46 more iGEM teams on Instagram. Check out the Collaboration page for more details!
Integrated Human Practices
Through Skype sessions and site visits, we engaged with Zespri Kiwifruit, Avocados Australia, and Fresh Produce Australia, to gain an insight into the context of our project. To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Integrated Human Practices page.
Theory of Knowledge
This aspect of our human practices was somewhat unplanned. It came about following a discussion about our amilCP mutants, and how they should be classified. These mutants have identical sequences as the wild type, with the exception of a single nucleotide. However, they are all vastly different colours.  Is it appropriate to refer to them as amilCP variants, when amilCP is by"

Interlab Study in V. natriegens
Our goal is to bring Vibrio natriegens and all its advantages to the synbio community as a whole. To do that, we need to learn more about how it behaves in other labs. In order to find out more about this was to have other iGEM teams conduct experiments with V. natriegens. With this in mind, we decided to expand on the InterLab study, because the participants were already  familiar with it. The plan was to include as many teams as possible and provide them with the same protocol, V. natriegens, and have them conduct the same simple experiment, the InterLab Cell Measurement.
The original InterLab was designed to solve one of biology’s biggest problems, inherent unpredictability of living organisms, like bacteria. This unpredictability makes it difficult to compare measurements  and compare devices from one lab to another. Therefore, a common basis of comparison is paramount for scientists to be able to build on each others work. This is especially true in synthetic biology because our models that require precise measurements. This engineering approach makes standardized units even more important. With this in mind, iGEM created a GFP measurement procedure and compared the data from labs all over the world (Beal et al., 2016) . All teams tested the same constructs, the only variables being the lab. Since we want Vibrio natriegens to become the new go-to chassis, testing it like E.coli can give us valuable insight.
Nearly everything was done the same as in the original iGEM InterLab, E.coli was just replaced by Vibrio natriegens. The teams transformed the plasmids into Vibrio natriegens and conducted GFP measurements. This gave us invaluable insight into how people unfamiliar with Vibrio natriegens adapt to using it.
To complement the results of your experiments we asked all participants to fill out a quick survey.  We wanted to hear about their"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
The model should impact your project design in a meaningful way. Modeling may include, but is not limited to, deterministic, exploratory, molecular dynamic, and stochastic models. Teams may also explore the physical modeling of a single component within a system or utilize mathematical modeling for predicting function of a more complex device.
Please see the <a href="" https://2018.igem.org/Judging/Medals ""> 2018  Medals Page</a> for more information.
Best Model Special Prize

Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ating and Optimising Maxicell Protocols
We investigated 3 ways in which to produce maxicells in order to present the easiest, most efficient production method for current and future synthetic biologists wishing to use them as a chassis! These three methods were by:
Ultraviolet light exposure
Cleaving a palindromic hairpin loop on the chromosome
Cutting the chromosome with a homing endonuclease
We then attempted to modularise the UV production method by creating knockdowns for DNA repair genes using RNA interference.
UV Production Method
This is the established method of maxicell production, which uses ultraviolet light to damage the DNA within the cell. The exposure to UV light causes pyrimidine dimers to form, which in regular cells would be restored  by nucleotide excision repair, however, the maxicell producing strain CSR603 is a knockout for recA - an enzyme involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination - and uvrA - an enzyme involved in nucleotide excision repair. As the cell has no method of repairing the UV-induced damage, the entire chromosome is degraded by exonucleases, leaving an achromosomal maxicell.
We decided to evaluate the efficiency of maxicell production using two Escherichia coli strains: CSR603, the uvrA- recA- strain; and DH5-alpha, a standard recA- lab strain. DH5-alpha was used to test how effective standard, recA+ lab strains are as maxicell producers. After the effectiveness of maxicell production by these strains was investigated, we set out to further increase the modularity of this system by producing a MicC-RecA-UvrA construct to knockdown recA and uvrA using RNA interference. This would allow theoretically any E. coli strain of your choosing to be used as a maxicell producer, and potentially many other bacterial species.
Palindromic Cleavage Method
The next maxicell production method we investigated was suggested to us by experts in Molecular and Cell Biology from the Leach Lab. This uses an E. coli strain developed in their lab, DL 3355, which contains a palindromic site on the chromosome that causes a hairpin loop to form. This hairpin loop may be cleaved by sbcCD exonuclease, causing a double strand break in the DNA. As the strain is recA-, this break cannot be repaired, and the chromosome is degraded by exonucleases.
Homing Endonuclease Method
The last method of maxicell production was"

Meanwhile, we transformed BBa_K1152013 in E. coli DH5α which gave us blue colonies after 48 hours as reported by the Heidelberg team.
Week 19: What next?
We decided to co-transform both BBa_K1152013 and pET-43.1b containing glnA in E. coli BL21(DE3).However, both have pMB1 ori hence we decided to clone glnA+T7 promoter in a backbone with p15A ori.
Thus, we inoculated part BBa_J04450 with pSB3C5 backbone (p15A ori) and E. coli DH5α containing pET 43.1b with glnA. After miniprep the next day we carried out restriction digestion of BBa_J04450 (pSB3C5 backbone) with NotI and of pET43.1b containing glnA with Psp5II and XhoI to pull out glnA along with the T7 promoter. The digested products were further gel purified and blunted. Blunt products of the vector and the insert were ligated in 1:3 molar ratio.
Meanwhile, we decided to contribute a promoter designed by one of our PIs to the registry.
Week 20: On our toes!
We immediately designed and ordered primers to amplify the ychH promoter from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA. The ychH promoter was inoculated in LB+Kanamycin and miniprepped the next day. We await our primers!
Meanwhile, ligated products (glnA + T7 + lacI with pSB3C5) were transformed in E. coli DH5α. Three colonies were picked up randomly and inoculated in LB+chloramphenicol.

Safety of our project
Figure 1. According to Wikipedia:Biosafety level , E.coli has minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel.
Figure 2. This is the fermentation tank in our laboratory.
This year, we aimed to produce isobutanol with modified E.coli by synthetic biology approach. Our chassis, E.coli, has been generally used in many biological experiments and is classified under biosafety level 1 and most acceptable bacteria strain. Therefore, if we follow the standard procedure during experiment, we will be very safe. As to our final product, isobutanol has already been used in lots of purposes. For example, the ingredient of organic solvent, the reactant of organic mechanism, or antifreeze and so on, are all widely applied to people’s life. So, we may not have to worry about the safety of isobutanol we produced. Moreover, according to many researches, we found that the E.coli used to produce isobutanol always died because of the rising concentration of isobutanol. That is one of the advantages of our modified E.coli that causing Biosafety issue of environment will be prevented. What’s more, if we want to apply our project to industry, we can make use of fermentation tanks to produce large number of isobutanol in a safe and widely used way. Last but not least, everything which has something to do with bacteria after we used will be sterilized and decontaminated before we reuse or dispose them. In conclusion, we have confidence that our project will not raise any Biosafety issue indeed.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," and hence difficut to work with in the lab. We think that the production of ions in such bacteria is likely also to be linked to their anaerobic environment, which means that any bacterial battery would need to be kept in anaerobic conditions; not a convenient arrangement.
Asbestos degradation - asbestos toxicity doesn’t seem to be fully understood, so we couldn’t find any strong goals to target in this area.
Hydrogen production - the sheer amount of hydrogen that we would have to produce makes bacterial production very inefficient. In addition many relevant genes have been patented, limiting our research freedom.
Disruption of biofilms - This idea looked very interesting until we saw that British Columbia 2010 had had exactly the same idea, and were (very nearly) successful. We wished to pursue a project that was more original, ideally.
Vitamin-secreting bacteria - the idea being that they would stay in the gut and secrete exactly the right amount whenever there was a deficiency detected. the complexity of making sure that the bacteria would produce exactly the right amount of vitamins for the body seemed almost insurmountable, and the idea of having bacteria that could permanently live in the gut was not desirable, either.
Sugar substitute creator - we became interested when some proteins were identified that were a lot sweeter than glucose by mass, but we then saw that aspartame is already produced by bacteria commercially; this would render the project unoriginal.
Plastic and crude oil degradation - we didn’t think that we could add much new to this area that hadn’t already been done before; in particular we thought that TU Delft 2010 did an excellent job with alkane degradation last year. We considered expanding their work to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons too, but we thought that squid was more interesting to work with in the end!
Ideas on the shortlist
Pathogen detection - The application we had in mind was detection of pathogenic contamination in food; we wanted to develop a biosensor (which must be highly sensitive) and assay that would allow us to detect the contamination in food before it reached consumers. One idea was to put a sample of the food onto a petri dish containing a GM phage that was specific to a particular pathogen, and which caused its host to produce a specific chemical. Some GM E.coli (also on the dish) would move towards the pathogens by chemotaxis and become pigmented in response to the chemical, reporting the presence of the pathogen. We dropped the idea because we though it would be too ambitious to complete within 10 weeks.

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," several professors in this field, on which basis they tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.
Initially BNU-China did the SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria, and the result was not as expected. The first time of result is not shown here. To put it in detail, they centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4 °C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then protein loading buffer was added. Afterwards they did the SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.
Because the whole cell was too stick, BNU-China couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight was about 46 kDa. Then they tried a normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result is shown in Fig.6
Fig.6 Normal SDS-PAGE of NhaA and NhaB
Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); Lane 2-4, the homogenate of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB; Lane 5, 6 and 8, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB, Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
The bands were clearer this time, but there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, BNU-China reviewed some articles of reliable protocols for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected, they processed the experiment the third time(Fig.7).

""No road of flowers lead to glory.""
From our dedicated work in both wet lab and dry lab we’ve successfully proved that our STEP system can work in human cells and can be tuned to achieve an ideal output.
Figure 1. Basic theory of STEP.
At the beginning, we improved a previous part of ECFP (BBa_E0020) to be BiFC components (BBa_K2886004 & BBa_K2886005), verified their reliability and employed them to test cell membrane localisation and binding ability of STEP (Figure 2). With cyan fluorescence observed in both circumstances, we can confirm that both our developed parts and the first part of STEP system works appropriately.
Figure 2. BiFC tests. The BiFC system we designed was examined and used to test the localisation and extracellular domain of STEP.  (a) Leucine zipper was attached to N- and C-terminal of split ECFP to test the reliability of BiFC.  (b) Both terminals were attached to the transmembrane linker of STEP to see if ligand-inducible dimerization could take place.  (c) Results of BiFC. Fusion proteins are expressed in E. coli BL21 separately. They were then released from the cells and incubated for maturation. The relative fluorescence intensity of split ECFP measured via plate reader is higher than the 10% of whole ECFP we expected, which is the normal result of BiFC.  (d) VEGF-STEP localisation and dimerization test. Plasmids containing both chains of cECFP and nECFP are transfected into HeLa. A few significantly activated cells were observed under microscope, and the total fluorescence intensity of VEGF(+) group is higher than VEGF(-) group, indicating that our receptors are"

Before    we officially entered the lab, the security administrator would personally give us security training, including    explanations of instrument usage, experiment operation and safety precautions and emergency measures.
During    the experiment operation, the security administrator also conducted periodic security checks to ensure the safety of    the entire process.
According to the requirements raised by iGEM policy, in our daily bench work we have never performed any dangerous    experiment or caused any unusual safety issue. The basic regulations our bench work have always abided by are as    follows:
1. Unauthorized personnel are prohibited from entering the laboratory.
2. Hands must be washed    after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
3. Participants need to    understand the experiment they intend to do completely.
4. Protective lab coats, gowns or uniforms must be    dressed to prevent contamination of personal clothing.
5. Gloves must be worn throughout the experiments.
6.    Protective eyewear must be worn when conducting procedures that have the potential to create splashes of    microorganisms or other hazardous materials.
7. Policies for the safe handling of acute items, such as needles,    scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware must be implemented stringently.
8. Steps with any probability of    contamination should be performed in a biosafety cabinet.
9. All liquid and solid waste containing living    organisms must be autoclaved.
10. Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics, and    storing food for human consumption are not permitted in the laboratory.
11. Water, electricity, gas, and air    conditioners must be ensured to be turned off, doors and windows to be locked before the last person's leave.
Safe for Community
We investigated relevant Chinese laws and regulations, finding out no violation, which is detailed as follows:
Regulations on the Safety Management of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms
Article 6 The one engaged in the research and testing of agricultural genetically modified organisms is the    first responsible person for the safety management. The agricultural genetically modified organism safety team in    the charge of the legal representative shall be established to be responsible for the safety management and    evaluation of the agricultural genetically modified organisms.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html," fear this, mostly because they think that researchers approach synthetic biology careful enough already.
The other-answers
Most claim this possibility but believe this is not inherent to synthetic biology. Every scientific field is susceptible to dangerous errors. Moreover, regulating for unforeseen consequences might be hard.
Some have mistaken the the probability of an unintentional error with intentional terror. They believe that regulation cannot overcome the problem of synthetic biology being used for terror purposes.
Risks are low for acknowledged institutes working in the field of synthetic biology, but the advent of DIY (do it yourself) Biotechnology, which can operate outside existing structures, brings a high risks of (possibly serious) errors.
Including the open-answers, 85% acknowledges the possibility of the production of a biological system containing some hazardous error, as a result of applying synthetic biology tools. The majority believes there is regulation needed to prevent this. 34% does not see this possibility as a real thread and think either that there is sufficient regulation already, or just does not fear this at all. One of the reasons why this issue has come up in literature and has been studied on during the SynBio conferences is that these circumstances are not new. Inventions such as asbestos and gunpowder have had hazardous consequences. It is hard to say whether new regulations can overcome the unforeseeable problems that come with synthetic biology. Correctly mentioned is the emergence of DIY biology, which can increase the risk of errors significantly.
Graph 8.
8. Are you afraid that synthetic biology might result in the production of a biological system that can be used for terrorist purposes?
Yes, I acknowledge this possibility, but think it is not significant because there is sufficient regulation
Yes, I recognize that this is a possible outcome and think new regulations/policies should be enforced, to minimize this possibility
Yes, I acknowledge this possibility, but there is nothing we can do about it
No, I think that researchers approach synhethic biology careful enough already and are sufficiently discrete
No, I do not fear this at all
Other:
Although the type of terror possibilities with synthetic biology are not defined, the opportunity of terrorists using genetic engineering as a tool for their actions is a concern that is proposed and discussed elaborately. There is a group of 79% that acknowledges the risk of synthetic biology principles being used for terrorist purposes, of which again most people think that new regulations should minimize this risk. Nevertheless, 25% of the sample believes there is nothing to do about this. A small group of 6% does not fear synbio-terror at all.

The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe our plasmids were not what we believed them to be. Eventually it was discovered that we were using an incorrect amount of Q5 2x master mix which caused the PCR to not work properly.
During the first lab week, we rehydrated our gene blocks from IDT and performed overlap extension (OE) PCR on three of the genes (delta7, ADR, and FDX1). We used touch-down and touch-up thermocycler settings which resulted in many different sized bands on an agarose gel. To reduce the amount of nonspecific primer annealing in these reactions, we decided to only use touch-down thermocycler settings and to put the primers on the side walls of the PCR tubes to limit the Q5 polymerase exposure to the primers. The exonuclease activity of the Q5 polymerase chews back the ends of our primers and causes non specific annealing, so we made sure the primers were added last before putting the reactions into the thermocycler. We also decided to run OE PCR reactions without primers to allow the overlapping regions of the genes to anneal and form the full length genes which could be used as templates for regular PCR reactions.
Since our project would eventually require separate experiments with 5 different inserts, our first goal in lab was the amplification of our experimental base plasmid. We first created a stock of ampicillin selective plates with a concentration of 100ug/mL. We carried out a transformation with NEB DH5α chemicompetent cells and created a glycerol stock of leftover cells after plating. We plated out transformants on 3 plates at original strength, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions using glass beads. Our platings were successful, and we used the 100-fold dilution plate to isolate single colonies and create a monoclonal culture of transformants. We also learned how to plate with a sterile wire loop in order to keep the number of plates used to a minimum. Every protocol--pouring plates, transformations, platings, and creating glycerol stocks--was new to us and required some reading of protocols from NEB and other sources.

The DyeStuff Factory
Ryerson_Toronto iGEM 2016
With the human population continuously increasing, the need for renewable and sustainable sources of energy is also increasing. A study projected that in 2050, we will need 30 trillion watts to accommodate human life on earth. In 2005, we used 13 trillion watts, 85% of which came from fossil fuels.
Let's look to the sun
The sun has been powering the growth of organisms on earth for centuries now, from plants to algae, to even humans! With such a great resource at hand, it only makes sense to avail it. Here at Ryerson, we are trying to tackle our energy consumption problem by looking to organic dyes.
There’s a vast variety of organic dyes, and they serve many purposes. Organic dyes have many real-world applications such as being used for medical probes or serving as pigments for industrial purposes. One of the greatest feature of these dyes is that they can be made by organisms on earth. The only problem? The synthesis of these dyes is very time-consuming and expensive. But the Ryerson iGEM 2016 team is out to tackle this challenge, by creating a DyeStuff factory with cyanobacteria as the home and the sun as its power."

Early Step for Synthetic Biology Development in Indonesia
iGEM is not only a competition which provides a stage for us to perform our work done at the laboratory but also an effort to popularize synthetic biology to the public. Synthetic biology is not popular yet in Indonesia and there are many people who do not know about this field. Therefore we decided to hold a workshop entitled “Potential and applications of synthetic biology in Indonesia” which was held on September, 26th - 27th 2014.
ITB iGEM team and UI iGEM team also took part in our activities and make it more fun. The participants not just come from undergraduate student but also from postgraduate student from various university in Indonesia. We got that audience are so enthusiastic through our lecture. The lecture has five parts, including introduction of synthetic biology and its potential for immunology therapy, potential of biology synthetic for health and medicine field, introduction about iGEM, presentation material from ITB iGEM team, project of syntetic biology community of UGM, and presentation material from iGEM-UB.
Synthetic biology is a newly-developing subject. We hope through our event there will be a better understanding about what synthetic biology is, its potential and encouraged people to develop synthetic biology in Indonesia. Beside, we held a workshop about bioinformatics. Why we choose bioinformatics? Because it is needed for molecule prediction before we do some molecular work at laboratory. It also useful and be a basic for developing synthetic biology. Thanks to Synbio community from Gadjah Mada University and student from University State of Malang who took part on our workshop.
Well, hopefully this small step can be the beginning of a big step in the world of synthetic biology in Indonesia. Such as a cell that will develop into tissues and has a function. Go synthetic biology!

On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy to not being able to get our vectors into bacteriae. It was then when we  realized only we are the ones responsible for the project and that it is on us to reach out for  help. We learned that in the end you always have to do what you have to do, no matter how  hard it may seem. Perhaps the crucial lesson of this summer was about the importance of  collaboration with others or, to put it another way, to stick together through thick and  thin.

In corporation with the iGEM Team UCL we modeled several of their pathways in our expression system:
Serotonin
Although serotonin is well known as a brain neurotransmitter, it is estimated that 90 percent of the body's serotonin is made in the digestive tract. In fact, altered levels of this peripheral serotonin have been linked to diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis [1].  Serotonin is converted in two steps from tryptophan to serotonin (Fig. 1). For simulating the expression of Serotonin in the iGEM Manchester-Graz expression system (see our Model) two enzymes had to be introduced into the expression system: the Tryptophan hydroxylase and the Amino acid decarboxylase.
Figure 1 Serotonin Pathway. Tryptophan is converted to Serotonin in two steps. Starting from Tryptophan over 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) to Serotonine. AADC = Amino acid decarboxylase.
The desired genes were introduced into the Manchester-Graz expression system model by adjusting the transcription and translation rates to proper values and by changing some species (Fig. 2).
Figure 2 : Simbiology overview of the model. The expression of the two enzymes (Tryptophan hydroxylase and AADC) is under control of the two quorum sensing systems. Serotonin gets through the cell membrane by diffusion.
In the simulation the species in the cell reach a relatively low level, whereas the amount of Serotonin in the environment increases constantly.
The simulation of the expression model gives an amount of molecules over time (Fig. 3). This can be recalculated into concentration values using the Avogadro constant and the molar mass of serotonin.
Figure 3 Serotonin in the environment. Serotonin gets exported from the cell via diffusion and increases over time.
In the simulation we see that Serotonin is expressed constantly by the cells and exported to the environment (Fig. 3). The rate of serotonin production is: 415.14 μmol/h/L or 73.16 mg/h/L.
Serotonin  is  unlikely  to  pass  the  blood  brain  barrier,  so  in  collaboration  both  team  developed  the idea of producing 5HTP (5-Hydroxytry"

Parts:
Simplified Model-2
We employed an ODE model. We defined the input to be AHLout the and the output to be the synthesis rate of mature GFP. In this system,we assumed the concentration of the LuxR was constant.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S2-4), (Recation S2-5) and (Recation S2-6) were considered to be able to get balance in a very short time.
From above equations, we can estimate the change of PoPS respond to the AHLin.
For this system, the value of parameter d, 0.00847,  could be estimated based on the measurement of the OD. For instance, when the concentration of AHLout was zero, the value of d was 0.00368 per minute. The values of 4.8E-3 per sec for rmG, 1.8E-3 per sec for a and 0.4 per sec for pG were got from the experiment conducted by Barry Canton and Anna Labno in 2004, click here to the details.
With the help of USTC_Software , we succeeded to estimate the values of k3, rAHLin, C1, C2, C3 and C4, using the data from our measurements. The simulation results as follows.
k3=0.8; rAHL=0.001; C1=1.5*10^(-10); C2=1*10^(10); C3=8*10^(-7); C4=5.8*10^(11)
In above picture, the dots were the measuring poingts in our system and the curves were the corresponding simulations to a particular concentration of AHLout.

WHU-China,2014,Team:WHU-China#_-_-_TEXT.html,". I met iGEM one year ago and I am totally into it. In my mind, iGEM is not a competition merely but a club. In this club, students who have the same interests in genetically engineering work together. We set our goals, and achieve some ridiculous ideas. As for myself, I am an outgoing girl. For me, research in biology is one part of my life. In my mind, the quality of life is equally important to the achievement I make in biology. I play violin in my spare times, and enjoy the peaceful afternoons. In WHU-China, I am the one who mobilize the atmospheres in our laboratory and cheer others up.
I'm Rui Bai, a senior student majored in life science, I'm so lucky to be a part of our awesome WHU-iGEM. Before entering the team, I have participated in a molecular biology lab for a year. Because of curiosity, I joined in our team to broaden knowledge of synthetic biology and share ideas with coworkers, which we called brainstorming. Now I think it has been one of the most correct choices which I have made in my college. What's more, I am good at organizing activities for heading up the Student Union. And I also have an appetite for drawing and basketball.

Project – Approach
The aim of our project was to engineer a Synthetic Microbial Consortium solely based on standard parts available from the 2013 registry. Microbial consortia are used in lots of biotechnological processes for example bioremidation of contaminated soil and waste water treatment. These consortia, however, grow completely uncontrolled. In some cases it would be favorable for the process if the microorganisms would be present in a definded ratio. In fermentation processes defined mixed culutres cannot be employed to carry out synthesis of a product or bioconversion since one strain will usually outgrow the others causing them to vanish from the culture broth. Thus our aim was to implement a system for controlled growth of mixed cultures to overcome this problem by engineering a synergetic system.
In order to create a dependency among the strains present in the culture we decided to base our project upon three different Quorum Sensing systems from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio fischeri (Las, Rhl and Lux system) and three different E. coli strains. The communication among the strains works via different so called autoinducers, often homoserinelactones, produced by the QS-systems synthetase (LasI, RhlI, LuxI) which are secreted into the surrounding media and taken up by other cells. Each strain carries an antibiotic resistance-gene (ampR) which is located downstream of an inducible promotor (Plas, Prhl, Plux) and is only induced in the presence of a specific constitutively expressed transcription activator (LasR, RhlR, LuxR) together with the corresponding autoinducer. Therefore the strains rely on the presence of the others in the culture broth.
In order to analyse the culture composition by flow cytometry the idea of the first cloning strategy was to include different fluorescence markers. However, with the equipment available we were not able detect three different fluorescence markers"
ZJU-China,2010,Team:ZJU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," because synthetic biology may blurs the dividing line of these two. Considering the peculiar character of synthetic biology, we believe the philosophical enquiry of synthetic biology is both necessary and interesting.
    Generally, the theoretical science aims to understand the world, while the practical science aims to change the world. Up till now, most of researchers, policy makers and critics consider the synthetic biology as a practical science or refer to as the synthetic biology technique. Because it quite possibly brings a radical revolution to the pharmaceutical industry, to the energy industry or even to the whole manufacture industry. It is nothing wrong for the synthetic biology to be treated as practical science. As the cheap malaria medicine-artemisinin could save millions of lives in the world and the sustainable energy produced by the bacteria can solve the global warming problem. Synthetic biology, as we hope, will benefit the world a lot. But we, researchers need to be vigilant at one point, the power philosophy inspired by the scientific technique -- that as Bertrand Russell once put it -- tends to regard everything non-human as mere raw material. Ends are no longer considered, only the skillfulness of the process is valued. Synthetic biology won't be the exception. And as the synthetic biology brings the engineering concept to the living organisms, this unique character even aggravates people's worries that synthetic biology technique could be no longer the vulgarity and ugliness that industrialism producing in our environment, it will depreciate the prestige of life. Because creating life is no longer the mere privilege of nature, it could be the manufactured products on stream line. As a result, the mechanistic view of world is strengthened while as the natural beauty of life is lost. That is no doubt a mournful result.
    The prestige of biology was the main weapon to against a mechanistic view of world. Immanuel Kant once said, respect human dignity means regarding persons not just as means, but also as ends themselves. Here I would like to broaden the definition from merely human to all living organisms. To make sure the synthetic biology technique will be used for good purpose, for benefiting the whole world, and to avoid the cold-blooded mechanism dominated world, scientists need to regard living organisms not just as means, but also as ends themselves. Sometimes when scientists are facing the choice, it is not to choose the best means to a given end, it's to choose the end itself for its own sake.
Does Synthetic Biology Draw A line in Darwin's sand?
    There is a well-known argument about synthetic biology that the biotic artifacts created by the synthetic biology departs from a core principle of Darwinian natural selection, leaving"
Nanjing-China,2014,Team:Nanjing-China#modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," simple, we just test whether the cells will die without lactose for this section.
We are convinced by the diagram that the lysozyme will increase with time as long as we remove lactose.             The increase of lysozyme will lead the cells to death after work as we hoped.
A model was chosen from a paper[Beisel CL, Smolke CD. Design principles for riboswitch function. 2009. PLoS Comput Biol.
For more information, please consult reference[28]] to test the function of our riboswitches.                 With the riboswitches, we can detect our aimed toxins, report its concentration and degrade it.
The riboswitch can response to specific ligand, changing the stability of mRNA and in result the concentration                 of AHL[ It is used in detector.] and enzymes.
Our riboswitch worked in the level of RNA stability. This part is composed of a aptamer
and a hammerhead ribozyme. The ribozyme can degrade the mRNA when the aptamer is not combined with toxin.
Using RNAstructure, we get the free energy of different folding state of the RNA,             with which we can work out the important parameter k19, with which we could estimate             the value of k1 and k1’. Here we will only list the two fold structures of MC10             [ The folding structure of other riboswitch will be listed wen the attachment file as CT files.]             [ The unit of energy results in RNAstructure is kcal/mol. Energy results from different software             may be a little different.]. The first can be combined with ligand and is stable,             while the second without ligand is not stable with the activation of hammerhead ribozyme.
Using the formula △Gθ = nRTlnK , we can get K1. What’s more, with help of reference [24],             value of Kd can also be gotten. With some rational assumption we can obtain k1, k1’             , k2, k2’.             Using all the parameters[ All the parameters will be listed in the attachments. The parameter of             riboswitch model will also be listed in the section of Parameter.], we can set up the model             and get some important outputs.
Using the equations[ Important equations of this model will be listed. To know more about riboswitch,             you may refer to the attachments.] paper mentioned, we get some result that can evaluate             the efficiency of our riboswitch.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PS_-_-_TEXT.html,"rene in situ from cell cultures that produced styrene.
The solvent did not impede cell growth and was able to more than double the total styrene produced by cell cultures [5].  To test this strategy we set up a cell growth assay with 48 liquid cell cultures. Half of the cultures were mixed with n-dodecane, while the other half had no solvent.  We than exogenously added pure styrene to the cultures at varying concentrations from 0 mg/L to 4,800 mg/L.  We let all of our cultures grow for 16 hours then measured their optical density.  We found that at high concentrations of styrene, the cultures without solvent had significantly lower absorbance levels than the cultures with solvent.  This result confirmed that in situ removal of styrene using n-dodecane would effectively increase the styrene toxicity threshold for our cells, making in vivo production more effective.
Step three:  In-vivo production
We are currently in the process of verifying the presence of styrene in the cultures of our transformed combo plasmid we used for protein extraction.  We are analyzing these cultures using gas chromatography mass spectrometry to detect and quantify our styrene production in vivo.
Styrene Polymerization: Polymerizing biologically produced styrene into polystyrene
Free Radical Polymerization of Styrene Mechanism
Up until now we have focused on styrene synthesis.  However equally important is the polymerization of styrene into polystyrene, our final product for folding.  We researched many methods for styrene polymerization used both in labs and industry.  We found that a free radical mechanism would be the simplest and easiest to test.
Step one:  Testing viability
Styrene has a conjugated pi-bond system between its alkene and phenyl group. Because of this, the molecule can stabilize an electron radical allowing it to polymerize during the propagation step of radical reactions.
Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) decomposition at 60°C (image source)
In order to initiate the radical reaction we used azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).  AIBN is an unstable molecule that when heated to 60°C will decompose into two radical species.  These radical species can initiate the polymerization of styrene.  We incubated pure styrene with AIBN at 60°C for one hour.   We then precipitated out polystyrene using a methanol wash, confirming that AIBN initiated polymerization of styrene to polystyrene works"

""This product enables the user to produce their own natural pesticide! The parasites will be killed by a fungi growing inside their bodies. This way your garden will be dung naturally without any contamination of the soil.""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
'Sporal Up Ready' is a fungal pesticide that will keep your fruit and vegetables safe from insect attack.
The user can cultivate the fungus to attack specific parasites. All you have to do is catch some of the undesirable critters you want the system to target. Now treat the fungi cells with a special substrate which makes the genetic variation of the mushroom very flexible, and add the parasite to the contamination component of ""Sporal Up Ready"". The fungus then changes its genetic property to specialize its liking to that specific parasite. After 20 days or more one of the parasites will be successfully infected by the fungus and will die a pain-free death as a result of a fungal growth in its head. This provides you with a special fungus for further spore production. One such fungus is enough to protect hundreds of fruits and vegetables and give you a better garden, naturally!
This revolutionary new product combines only the best moss abilities: crush resistance, fast growth, moisture absorption and disinfection. 'kokoromo' is a reliable partner for every occasion in your home, be it as an indicator for fungi, as a dryer for wet walls or a cleaner to reduce allergic illnesses.
In addition, the dying parasitic insects will decompose in your garden, providing a fertile dung and helping your plants to grow stronger.
Technical Description
We engineered a complex parasite recognition genepool we introduced into fungi. Bringing the fungi in contact with any parasites leads to recombination of certain genes in that pool and thereby to evolution of parasite recognition systems directly inside the fungi. Thereby, a specialized detection and defense from any parasite, even very unusual parasites, is enabled.

SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM brought to us, and how we practiced our ability of doing research from students ‘perspective. At last, we talked about the project of SCU_China and the audience were really interested in it. A lot of students exchanged their ideas with us after the teach-in and showed their interests.
The teach-in is a firm success, we not only introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to the freshmen, but also made a solid foundation for the future of SCU_China since many students showed their eagerness of joining us.
Survey
Interview in SCU Campus
To know the students’ knowledge of human microbiome, we surveyed in SCU campus. From the survey we found that most of them knew little about it. Questions regarding tinea pedis and related issues were also included.
The question first asked “How many microorganisms does a healthy adult have, assuming that he or she weighs sixty kilograms? “got various answers. The answer they gave varied from 1 kg to 30 kg, which were far off the correct answer. Such an interesting result showed that though the human microbiome was a hot spot, students still knew little about it. We then asked them that if they or the ones around them were troubled by tinea pedis. Unsurprisingly, many of them admitted that their daily life had been influenced by tinea pedis. They got a very feeling when they were exposed in the foot odor.
When we asked their acceptance to a biological product that can cure tinea pedis by killing bacteria and fungi to make them get rid of the foot odor, a great number of students said that they dared to use it even though it was bacteria-included, only if it really worked and had no side effects.
The Interview at Longquan Mountain
Tinea pedia, as well as the other diseases related to feet is a health problem that really arouses public attention in Sichuan. In order to increase the awareness of the importance of microorganism on our body, especially on the feet, and know more about people’s attitude to our project to improve it, our team went to Longquan Mountain to interview the local farmers and residents.
First, we had a preliminary understanding of the microorganism cognitive situation of local farmers and residents. We found that most people knew that microorganism had a great effect on our health and some of them or their friends were influenced by tinea pedis. Then we asked some questions about our project and it was surprising that most of them didn’t resist to using the insole with the bacteria in it. ""I don't mind that it contains"
CIEI-China,2017,Team:CIEI-China#HP#Our Story_-_-_TEXT.html," family kitchen samples.
The most difficult part is getting the restaurant samples since half of the managers rejected to provide samples, either because the restaurant cannot understand the purpose our research or the managers was afraid that the experiment results would affect them. Sometimes we needed to explain our project in simple language, academic language, and concise language to different managers. The other difficulty is the canteen sample. Some of the school cafeterias don’t have a strict waste sorting. There are chopsticks and some plastic bottles in the trash can. Other cafeterias with a strict sorting have a clean can with a hole for pouring wastes which is impossible to collect samples.
After the collection, we obtained diversified and a big amount of samples, which provides a strong support for us to  build a more realistic and reasonable  database. The salinity of all these different samples are higher than what we thought.
Min An Community Visit
1) Stepping into Green Community
After reading through abundant scientific documents and records, we figured out that high salinity would, to some extent, affect the fermentation of microbes during waste disposal process. Our team decided to learn about the development in contemporary waste disposal for further studies, so we chose Min An community as our first social research target. In order to have a thorough understanding of waste disposal and their difficulties in the Min An community, which was an exemplary experimental site for environmental friendly management of food waste.
2) Learning a New Method
On July 27th, five members of team CIEI-China visited the waste disposal machine, which uses the method of anaerobic composting for food waste treatment, in Min An green community.
The machine consisted of four parts: lifting container, fermentation space, air withdrawal device, and air purification tower. From our observation on the entire procedure and discussion with manager, Mr. Zhang, we learned that combination of these equipment was able to ferment and dispose the food waste into the extremely effective organic fertilizer in twenty-four hours, which could definitely meet the demand of plant growth in farms. Firstly, people put the kitchen waste into the lifting container, which automatically transferred the waste into a large fermentation space. Next, the computer monitored the range of the temperature from 60°C to 80 °C and regulated the moisture to an ideal range from 50% to 60% by adding carbon fiber to 10% of total mass. After the computer created optimum condition for microbes to work, the stirring arms inside the fermentation space helped to make the substance evenly heated; at the same time, the hyper-thermal aerobic microbes, including Lactobacilli, Yeasts, Bacillus n"

The decrease in luciferase activity after 30 minutes is probably due to the harvesting and resuspension. After 2.5 hours, induction of the GAL1 promoter is visible and therefore reflects in the protein level of the nanoluc. Considerably higher expression levels are only achieved after 7.5 hours incubation time. It can be concluded that the GAL1 promoter is integrated correctly and can be induced by galactose.
Microscopy of RFP expressed from different promotors
Additional to the luciferase assays, we also expressed RFP under control of the various promoters and imaged them under the laser scanning microscope.
Figure 4 shows the results for the pENO2-RFP construct. Surprisingly, the RFP is localized only at the membrane, even though RFP without membrane target sequence was used. We therefore sequenced the whole construct and saw that the sequence of the promoter did not correspond to the sequence given in the registry.
Figure 4: Fluorescence pictures of cells expressing pENO2-RFP. The RFP is localising to the plasma membrane on the cells.
pFET3 is usually activated by low-iron medium. We cultured the cells in SC medium with 2% glucose before imaging the cells. It could be observed that cells either expressed RFP strongly and evenly spread throughout the cell, or not at all (see fig. 5).
Figure 5: Fluorescence pictures of cells expressing pFET3-RFP. RFP expressing cells show an even distribution of the protein.
Figure 6A to 6C show cells expressing pSUC-RFP cultured in galactose, glucose or raffinose, respectively. Cells cultured in galactose or raffinose medium show evenly spreaded RFP fluorescence, while the repression of the pSUC promoter with glucose results in diminished fluorescence.

Objectives
To evaluate the evolution of biosafety concerns in iGEM.
To look at the types of containment system that have been designed by previous iGEM teams.
Procedure
We took the list of all iGEM teams since 2006 and looked at their wiki. If they had a containment system, we filled in the table that is below. In a more rapid way, we used Google™ search option to screen occurrence of biosafety terms (safety or bio(-)safety) or the occurrence of biosafety devices terms (semantic containment, kill switch, DNase). To do so, we used the following syntaxe with year '2006' and word 'safety' as an example :
safety site:2006.igem.org
We took into account the number of results, and we divided it by the number of results with the word 'igem' to normalize with the number of page on all the servers. We assume that there is on average a bit more than one ""igem"" occurrence per page (in the name of the page).
Results
We can see that the safety page rule creating in 2008 induced a increasing frequence of the word safety. This phenomenon started the kill switch trend. Deeper research through the manual wiki screen makes us realize that most of the kill switches were inefficient, or not even well characterized. In spite of the hard work of team Paris Bettencourt in 2009 on human practice, that raised many biosafety concerns, few teams made an effort to implement a serious biosafety device. Indeed we were able to put only about 15% of the 32 biosafety project that we selected in the wiki-screen in the biosafety catalog of the registry.

Project Description
Background
Oil Sands
Oil sands are naturally occurring mixtures of sand or clay, water and an extremely dense and viscous form of petroleum called bitumen.
Bitumen is a collection of heavy hydrocarbons, which results from preferential microbial degradation of lighter hydrocarbons in oil reserves over geological time scales. These heavy oil reserves are some of the largest fossil fuel stores in the world with more stored energy than traditional oil reserves.
Oil sands represent approximately 67% of the world’s total petroleum resource, with the two largest deposits being in Canada and Venezuela. Together they contain approximately 3.6 trillion barrels of oil, compared to 1.75 trillion barrels of conventional oil worldwide. The oil sands in the Athabasca Basin in northeastern Alberta, Canada represent the world’s largest resource estimated to contain over 1.7 trillion barrels of bitumen.
Tailings Ponds
Oil sands are developed either through open-pit mining or deep underground (in situ) production. In open-pit mining, hot water is used to separate bitumen from the mixture of sand and clay.
Each cubic meter of mined oil sands requires up to 3 m3 of water and produces about 4 m3 of slurry wastes containing sand, clay, water, unrecovered bitumen and dissolved inorganic and organic compounds. This mixture is then sent to a discontinued mine pit, referred to as a tailings pond. It is a large man-made collection of waste, which has a negative impact on the environment.
Over 70% of the water demand is met by recycling the recovered water.  Even so, these wastewaters are accumulating at a rate of about 0.1-0.2 m3 per ton of oil sands processed.  Recycling of the water back to the extraction process further concentrates contaminants as more waste material is added to the already contaminated water.  It has been estimated that"

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the public knew about in synthetic biology.
One such activity included solving problems using various genetic “building blocks,” each labeled with a specific function. These literal blocks represented genetic parts that could be stacked together to make a full genetic circuit to solve the problem at hand. Kids loved this game, as it was very hands on; much to our surprise, many younger kids were very creative, and very open with new ideas, like creating synthetic blood. Another example of an activity that received great public reception was the “golden rice” table, where we showed museum goers a plate of yeast that expressed the gene for beta-carotene, and “golden bread,” baked with this yeast. We were again surprised by how many members of the public were open to such ideas.
We taught the public about microfluidics as well, making the analogy of scientists doing experiments to bakers trying to find the best cake. If the baker only needed a taste to test how the cake came out, why make a whole cake? We described microfluidics as “mini-ovens” in which scientists could make “mini-cakes,” to check if the “cake” came out good. This would save the baker/scientist lots of time and ingredients.
After these activities, we met with the public for a forum on ethics in synthetic biology. This was an amazing opportunity! We were able to sit side-by-side at a table with members of the public; we got to listen to a talk on gene drives as a solution to malaria, and we got to play out an ethical decision making process. In this roleplay, we acted as members of the local public and government in a Zambian community considering to use a gene drive to rid malaria. We got to discuss our plan of action, and we had to come to a conclusion on whether to release GM mosquitoes.
Summer Pathways | 12 July 2016
In our experiences at Building with Biology, we found that most people in the public had never heard of microfluidics. Our next human practice event was educational outreach to young women in high school interested in STEM program.
In order to reach out to young women interested in STEM fields of study, we teamed up with the BostonU iGEM wetlab team to speak at the Boston University-hosted event Summer Pathways. During this event, we were able to teach high school students from areas around New England about basic synthetic biology and electrical engineering principles through interactive activities hosted with smaller groups. We then engaged all of these students in a discussion about synbio and engineering ethics in a forum on whether or not the proposed solution of terraforming"

Introduction
Since our project is divided into two main categories being binding and treatment, we have decided to create two models. Thanks to iGEM we were able to download and use MATLAB’s simbiology for free in their making. However, our ineptitude in the area caused us a lot of trouble and we ended up using a lot of premade equations and parameters provided by previous years’ iGEM teams whom we are grateful to.
FimH, TetR-LVA and Antiholin Production
Our first model involves the production of FimH and it also has our holin-antiholin kill switch as an addition. We decided not to limit ourselves in the space provided and used two separate schemes for this model.
The scheme below shows what we expect to see happen in the presence of arabinose.
We have assumed here that there is sufficient amounts of arabinose in the cell and started off by showing the transcription of FimH, TetR-LVA and Antiholin mRNAs.  After we were done adding their degradation and translation rates by using the equations and parameters below we got a satisfying graph.
Total mRNA Concentration: [Promoter strength]*[Copy number]-[Degradation rate]*mRNA
The strenght of the promoter was assumed to be the same as the medium-strength promoter J23100(2.80 microPoPs) and the copy number was assumed to be 300.
Antiholin Concentration: [Translation rate of Antiholin]*mRNA-[Degradation rate of Antiholin]*Antiholin
TetR-LVA Concentration: [Translation rate of TetR-LVA]*mRNA-[Degradation rate of TetR-LVA]*Antiholin
The graph below shows the increase in molar concentrations of FimH, TetR-LVA, Antiholin and mRNA in 10 seconds. All of our species were given an initial amount of 0 and showed an increase as time went on. The results supported our goal of producing FimH and showed that the first part of our kill switch is functional.
Our Kill Switch in Action
The scheme below shows what we want to see happen in the absence of arabinose.

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," prepared the DNA     extraction, the gel electrophoresis and a power point presentation about us and the theory of the two experiments, everything being photographed by Alex. Starting the     afternoon Alena told the pupils about iGEM, synthetic biology, our own project and why     we do the workshop. Then Ariane took over to give them the theory behind the soon-to-     be done experiments, covering what a gel electrophoresis is, how it works, why biologists     use it that often, what one has to do to extract DNA and where the difficulties lay.
After these theoretical 20 minutes, we started the practical work, supervised by Hannah,      Bastian, Leonard and Ariane from our team, with preparing the gel run. We poured the      gels before the workshop started, as this would have taken too long to have it done by      the pupils. First the pupils had to be introduced to the microliter pipettes and train their      pipetting skills. Therefore, we gave every student a stripe of parafilm with three drops of      water on it, which they had to pipette up and down until they felt secure enough to take      on the task of loading the gel with our DNA sample. After adding the loading dye to every      sample, each pupil had to fill two gel pockets and the last to do so also had to start the      gel run. While the gel ran, the DNA extraction was to be done. To get good results and as      much visual DNA as possible, we decided to use strawberries, an octoploid organism. The      protocol we used, was given to us by Dr. Hanh Nguyen, an employee at our university,      who has already done this experiments at a school and could share her experiences with      us. For this we want to thank her. In contrary to the gel electrophoresis, which had been      done in groups of three to four, did their own DNA extraction. We proceeded step-by-      step, every step followed by an explanation and depiction of what has been done and      what it has been done for. Right in time to stop the gel run, we finished the DNA      extraction, luckily, or probably more because of great work by the pupils, with good      results, seeing strawberry DNA in almost every experiment. To visualize the results of      the gel electrophoresis, we used an UV-transilluminator. Ending this afternoon of      practical biological work, the pupils analyzed the DNA samples and determined the length      of the plasmid used. After tidying up and cleaning all the"

The database’s search is useful in exploring the global distributions of venomous snake species. The operator can access information on antivenom products and their manufacturers. The operator can search by region, subregion, country, territory or other geographical areas. It is also possible to search for a specific snake, like the Naja nigricollis and go directly to that entry. The database also has Information on antivenoms and their manufacturers [1].

He also spoke about the many properties mycelium has that makes it an excellent building material--fire resistant, insulating, etc. He has also incorporated the remediating process of fungi in his designs to help clean up waste. Aiolova also noted the material’s excellent building properties--highlighting that it has great acoustics and could also could create an invigorating natural microbiome in interior spaces. She also cautioned, however, that when we design with mycelium we should be conscious of the material constraints—highlighting that multi-story building made solely of mycelium are unlikely and that rather it the creation of composite materials with mycelium that will create successful buildings.
With this information in mind, we began by brainstorming a variety of housing needs. At first we considered adapting the design of the house for refugees--a pressing issues, with the United Nations Human Rights Council estimating that in 2016 65.6 million people were forcibly displaced from their homes, with 22.5 million of those people falling under the category of “refugees” [1]. However after reading reports about the crisis and discussions with designers involved with refugee design we concluded that the development of another “pop up” house would not address the route of the problems--which have much more to do with policy [2].
Next we looked inwards, focusing on the local issues of homelessness in San Francisco. California, as a whole, hosts 12% of the population of the United States, but 22% of the homeless population [3]. Again, however, deeper exploration revealed that while a shortage of affordable housing was a component, it was not addressing the core of the problem.
Turning once again to the drawing board, we decided to revisit what Maurer and Aiolova had said, this time focusing of the idea of sustainability and affordability. Construction is a major contributor to global warming and pollution; the construction of buildings alone is responsible for up to 40% of carbon emissions[4]. And in the US alone there are 50 million tons of demolition produced annually[5]. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, there are a myriad of benefits to reducing the protection of demolition--ranging from cutting down on the number of demolition facilities needed to preventing the construction of more landfills.
We propose that our martian habitat, which is grown in an inflatable mold (which on earth, unlike on Mars, could be removed and reused), would be a"

A small extra requirement for us was including restriction      sites in the primers designed for using PCR to get the wbbC gene from the BL21 genome. For some reason, wbbC proved impossible to synthesise. This fortunately gave some insight      into how an iGEM team with insufficient funding to synthesise genes would struggle with BioBrick assembly when using genes not in the Registry - not at all. One argument against     biobrick assembly is the length of time required for making a large construct. We managed to create several complete promoter-RBS-gene-terminator constructs, but our four and      five gene operons were never achieved in the time we had available.
In a Nutshell:
Pros
Flexible
Easy to use
Selection techniques are easy
Easy to share parts with Parts Registry
DNA can be synthesised/from PCR/from Registry
Easy and requires little foreknowledge
When parts are joined they can’t be split with the same enzymes
Cons
Can only accurately combine two parts at a time - long process
Creates ‘scars’
Can have two-plasmid transformation problems
Mistakes are hard to undo
Gibson Assembly
How it Works
Blunt-ended fragments of DNA with overlapping end sequences can be obtained through PCR, or synthesised directly. The 5’ ends are then chewed back by an exonuclease. The      single stranded matching regions anneal, a DNA polymerase copies the sequence from the 3’ ends and finally a DNA ligase joins the fragments permanently (fig. 3). The technique      was developed by Gibson et al and published in 2009.
Fig. 3
Advantages and Disadvantages
Some extra work is required if Gibson assembly is used by iGEM teams - to get parts into the registry they need restriction sites added which can pose difficulties due to      prefix and suffix homology. The Cambridge 2012 iGEM team stated that although Gibson appears to work well from positive controls, its actual results were very dependent on the      initial concentration of DNA fragments, a problem which may have stemmed from gel extraction inefficiency.
Personal findings
I have no idea whether Gibson assembly is as good or bad as I have been told, because we never got to try it. Nine different Gibson fragments were needed to construct the      three operons, and while seven were created using PCR (some immediately, some with more attempts), the remaining two (the promoter and the first gene of the operon) had three      weeks, three different polymerases and multiple changes to reaction"

Welcome to our Human Practices! Now, when it comes to the particulars of our Human Practices, you will find that it has been separated into three main parts. This is all strictly for narrative purposes, as every single aspect of our project and Human Practices, are deeply intertwined through a shared philosophy: If you want change, look to the future!
1. A Philosopher’s Guide to the Future
To ensure an ethically sound iGEM product and experience, we have discussed the ethical considerations that ought to be taken into account. As luck would have it, one of our team members is a philosopher with an interest in bioethics. Thus a guidebook was created, a guide that amongst other things includes an overview of some of the bioethical arguments iGEM participants are likely to encounter, when discussing synthetic biology. You can find these considerations in our section on Bioethics .
2. An Implementation of the Future
We reached out to our local Municipality of Odense along with various experts, for their advice on the development and implementation of our device in an urban environment. You can read more about this in our section on Integrated Human Practice .
3. A Trip to the Future and Beyond!
Considering how our main philosophy was: If you want change, look to the future! It seemed prudent to bring our message on sustainability to the next generation. You can read more about our efforts in the section on Education and Public Engagement .
Bioethics
- A Philosopher’s Guide to the Future
“The facts of life... to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised once it's been established.”
Tyrell, Bladerunner
Synthetic biology and the iGEM competition are aimed to help solve societal issues, issues such as agriculture, medical research, and environmental resource management, the last of which has been our motivation throughout our project. However, while synthetic biology offers many new exciting possibilities, several concerns have to be met when dealing with living organisms. Against, the excitement of the iGEM community, skeptics have pointed to the uncertainty and potentiality for unwanted consequences that might arise from working with synthetic biology. We as a team decided to give these concerns some serious thought! We have had several conversations on topics such as meta ethics, applied ethics, sustainability, GMO, and so on. Furthermore, we established an open and honest mode of discourse to use when engaging with other teams and the public. We held a workshop in bioethics in relation to our Danish Meetup. This workshop consisted of a historical insight into the history of"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#safety_-_-_TEXT.html," protect neurons against oxidation. However, several studies have shown that copper plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. It is also increasingly referred to as an ""environmental illness"". Indeed, when it is accumulated in the body in large quantities, it is supposed to affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, in excess in patients, is a peptide which is mainly aggregates in the case of disease, and is present in soluble form in healthy patients.
2. Curdlan
Not dangerous for Humans Our project aims to use a polysaccharide which is synthetically produced by our genetically modified organisms. This molecule already exists in nature, it is naturally present in the yeast’s wall. No bad impact on the environment has been identified. Compared to copper sulfate which is a toxic compound, this molecule seems to be more environmentally friendly.
In 2013, the “Savoy ADAbio” tested on vine plants the effect of very low doses of different sugars in order to replace the copper treatment in the fight against pests. For example, they tested the effect of fructose against mildew. After different doses were tested, an encouraging result emerged : the weekly fructose application of  100 g / ha had a similar effect than a treatment of 600 g / ha of copper. According to this testimony, we now know that sugar helps fight against mildew.
Also used in many different applications, Curdlan doesn’t seems to have bad effects (see Other Effects Curdlan). However, we also collaborated with the Oxford iGEM team to test the toxicity of this molecule on the bacteria that already live in nature. This experience is useful to know the impact of Curdlan on other organisms. Another experience would have been interesting : a toxicity test on plant cells or animal cells. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the capacity to carry this test out in our laboratory. For now, we are still waiting for the results.
In food industry, the additive E424 (Curdlan) is used as a thickener, stabilizer, gelling and firming agent. This is reassuring because it is a common product in the food chain, and not reported as toxic.
We are not using the entire cell Another important theme is the spread of new organisms in nature. Indeed, this could alter biodiversity. If we want to directly use our synthetic organism on the plant, we must integrate death genes in their genomes to create organisms that are not be able to live in natural conditions. In"

Origin
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

What we have learned about the Deinococcus Genera
Different Phylogenetic Methods Yield Different Clades
We extrapolated the evolutionary relationships between the species using 1) Feature Frequency Profile comparisons, 2) 16S rRNA alignments, and 3) Mauve genome alignment, but each method yielded an alternative result.
By sequencing more species in this family, we hypothesize that Inclusion of a larger set of sequenced species in the genera may elucidate new and more reliable information about their origins and cladistics.
Disparate Trees Resulting From Too Little Genetic Information
Genome Analysis
While waiting for the sequencing data from our libraries, we started working with the 5 already sequenced genomes in the family. Because we are most interested in finding potential radiation-resistant genes to help support the NYC_Wetware Team's data, we wanted to build a pipeline capable of predicting genes in the species, comparing those genes to find the most similar ones and then characterizing their relationships by probing radiation-resistance pathways for unique conservation.
To identify the most related genes, we predicted genes with Glimmer3 and then aligned those reads to the Deinococcus radiodurans genome. For each CDS in the D. rad genome, a number of related genes from the various species is aligned. At the time of the wiki freeze we have alignment files detailing these sequence relationships and are working toward adding biological pathway information.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," heparin. The inhibitor results in a stop of the transcription.
B
We determined the influence of the inhibitor heparin on a T7 RNA polymerase transcription. For this purpose we applied our new fluorescent readout system. Fluorescence emission of ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 and Malachite Green Aptamer is not increasing over time. For the positive controls (w/o heparin) the fluorescence increases as expected over time.
As we were able to establish a highly sensitive fluorescent read out for ATP concentrations as well as for the RNA synthesis, we wanted to combine both methods. We performed in vitro transcription reactions in presence of the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2/DFHBI and Malachite Green Aptamer DNA template/malachite green dye. Fluorescence was measured in regular intervals. During the reaction we were able to sense the decrease of ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 fluorescence and an increase of the fluorescence corresponding to the Malachite Green Aptamer (Fig. 8). The results show that the transcription reaction reaches its maximum after 140 min.
In further studies, we added heparin to the in vitro transcription which is known to be a potent inhibitor of the T7 RNA polymerase
Sastry1997
. Here we expect a stable level of the ATP signal and reduced fluorescence at 650 nm (Malachite green). In Figure 9 we can show that indeed heparin results in low fluorescence signal and ATP concentrations stay at the same level over time. Thus transcription reaction is inhibited by this molecule.

Fig. 10. Application of the Spinach/Malachite Green readout system to improve buffer conditions for the transcription.
As DNA template we applied the Malachite Green Aptamer with T7 promotor. Using our fluorescent read out system we can determine different transcription efficiencies as well as ATP consumption in real time.
A
In presence of the HEPES buffer no increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence signal was monitored. Furthermore the signal of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 stays also at the same level as the blank.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html,": How Lead Affects the body). The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system. It can have acute or chronic health effects. The acute health effects are occurring immediately after contact with lead. This can be irritation of the eyes or can cause headache, irritability, disturbed sleep, and mood as well as personality changes. Exposure to higher lead concentrations over a long-term could cause serious damage to the brain and to the kidneys. And finally the damage can cause death (Golub, M. S., 2005). The poisoning is mostly resulting of ingestion of water or food, which is contaminated with lead or lead compounds (Ferner, D. J., 2001). It is quickly taken up into the bloodstream and spread in the body (Bergeson, L., 2008). The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 10 µg/L in drinking water, concentrations in drinking water are generally below 5 μg/L. Nevertheless, there are much higher concentrations that have been measured if lead fittings are existing (WHO: Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, fourth edition).
Detection
Due to the effects on health, the detection of lead in drinking water is of importance in all parts of the world. Therefore, a simple system for a fast review of the water quality is a worthwhile aim. The method for detection is currently based on the principle of flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) (Abdallah, A. T. and Moustafa, M. A., 2002). This detection method is difficult to implement in developing countries, and time consuming thus there are hardly any quality standards.
Our lead biosensor
For our biosensor we use parts of the chromosomal lead operon of Cupriavidus metallidurans. Naturally the operon for lead resistance contains pbrT, which encodes a Pb(II) uptake protein, pbrA, which encodes a P-type Pb(II) efflux ATPase, pbrB, which encodes a predicted integral membrane protein and pbrC, which encodes a predicted prolipoprotein signal peptidase. The expression of the operon is regulated by the repressor pbrR. As a MerR like regulator, its stimulates the transcription of the operon in the presence of Pb2+ Borremans et al., 2001).  Our sensor system combines pbrRunder the control of a constitutive promoter and the pbrA promoter for the lead depending expression of sfGFP.

NOTE: A picked colony cannot be used again; it is recommended to restreak on a 'back-up'-plate with the same pipet tips and incubate it overnight at 37 °C.
Incubate the resuspended colony at 90 °C for 10 min. Spin the suspension down and use the supernatant as template DNA for the PCR.
NOTE: Instead of separate boiling prior to PCR, this step can be incorporated in the PCR program. The initial denaturation step at 98 °C should then be prolonged to 5 minutes.
Make sure every PCR reaction is composed as follows:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Hi!!! Remember we had one more question to solve today? How are we going to separate our biobrick from the vector (BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation) for cloning it in PSB1C3, considering that it has around 3.000 base pairs and the vector PBSK also has around 3.000 base pairs! We solved it and developed the following strategy:
Super cool, isn’t it?! Beside cloning our linked bio bricks (BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation), we also will clone it separately and send it to Registry on PSB1C3! To clone separated bio bricks, we don’t need to use the previously mentioned strategy, we will purify the fragment from the agarose gel and bind it to PSB1C3 after! So, let’s start! We used the following system:
Electrophoretic profile of digestion:
1 : BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PBSK not digested
2: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PBSK digested with EcoRI + PstI
3: BB_Bioremediation in PBSK not digested
4: BB_Bioremediation in PBSK digested with EcoRI + PstI
5 : BB_Essential in PBSK not digested
6: BB_Essential in PBSK digested with EcoRI + PstI
7: BBa_J04450 in PSB1C3 not digested
8: BBa_J04450 in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI + PstI.
We took 10ul of samples 2 and 8, then let it overnight.
The remaining samples were purified to use in a binding system later.

The third speaker is the team leader of SYSU-China-software, Miao Zong, who told us that biologists really need computer as their closest friend. As it’s known to all that we have already entered the ‘big data’ era. People can save much time and effort with computer dealing with so many data. He also introduced many interesting progress in computer science, which provide much convenient to biologists.

Workshop in BGI in Shenzhen
This year we participate in a workshop held by BGI in Shenzhen. Several iGEM teams in Guangzhou and Shenzhen attended this workshop, including BGI, South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC), South China University of Technology (SCUT) and our university (Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU). Many teams have both software team and wetlab team, so there were actually seven teams who attended this workshop. In this workshop, each team presented their project that they were going to do in 2013 iGEM competition and share the experience and resources together.
After the meeting we had a cheerful dinner beside the beach.
This workshop also gave us a chance to get to know other iGEM teams and subsequently had some interaction with between SCUT team. We helped SCUT team to debug their experiment method. We also gave technical suggestion about the synthesis of T7 promoter, and provided them a plasmid that contains ADH terminator to help them construct their circuit. We provided them hbax, which we have tested as workable part, as positive control in their experiment.

Risk and Assumptions
Synbiologica Ltd has not yet created a functional prototype of BEAR.
Synbiologica Ltd is currently acting under the assumption that BEAR will be functional and produce expected results. The funds from early investment into the company and grants will be directed towards developing a functional prototype and initial laboratory testing.
BEAR is still in early research and development and no technical numbers have been determined. Synbiologica Ltd is currently conferring with potential research partners who are interested in testing the BEAR prototype with the hope of eventually integrating the device into their research. By utilizing university resources we will be able to develop an accurate assessment of our products technical details and capacities.
Synbiologica Ltd does not have a patent on the BEAR product.
Synbiologica Ltd is actively in talks with the University of Lethbridge Technology Transfer Office and Industry Liaison Office regarding patenting and further market assessments of BEAR. Additionally the Technology Transfer office will assist in assessing our freedom-to-operate. The University of Lethbridge has agreed to let Synbiologica Ltd have complete ownership of all generated intellectual property and offered to pay for the patent on a return of cost basis.
Members of Synbiologica Ltd have limited prior experience in the business and financial fields.
When Synbiologica Ltd acquires the financial capacity, the company plans to appoint competent business executives to handle the business administration and management.  Additionally Synbiologica will actively seek to hire certified accountants to assist with financial projections and account management.  For the time being, all members have attended business workshops and professional development courses. They have learned how to do basic financial projections and acquired business management skills. The company is now moving forward in a strong position.
Synbiologica Ltd is acting under the assumption that a larger biotechnology or medical device company is interested in acquiring a licence to manufacture and sell BEAR.

METU_Turkey,2015,Team:METU Turkey project_-_-_TEXT.html," addicted, briefly it works with a kill-switch mechanism with the presence of arabinose.
Why did we choose this project?
The biodegradation of plastic bottles took thousands of years, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. Our project aims to clean enviroment with the degredation of PET to pyruvate by E.coli. With this project,while  the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E.coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new source.
Can our bacteria degrade PET in huge amounts?
For nowadays, yes. Also we can do this biodegradation process with different organisms like algeas in water. For soil, situation is more complicated but actually, we try to obtain this biodegradation genes from a soil organism Pseudomonas putita. E.coli can be worked as easy as P. putida and has a good adaptiton. If we talk about a biodegradation on a collected plastic, our project would work properly.
Why did we associated some of our parts with Pseudomonas putida F1 strain?
P. putida is used for related experiments and it has lots of metabolic similarities with E.coli
Which teams worked on the previous parts of our project?
With the experiments of Darmstadt, London Imperial college and UC_Davis Teams and other iGEM parts, we can obtain catechol from PET. For going further, we ligated  K316003 part with a constitutive promoter. So, we reduced huge amounts of catechol into 2-hydroxymuconate Semialdehyde and obtained green colour as we expected. Then, we designed a new part From https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Parts BBa_K808000,BBa_K808010,BBa_K808011,BBa_K808012,BBa_K808013,BBa_K808014  From http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K316003 and  Bba_K316003 http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K936020 and Bba_K936020 With these parts, we can obtain catechol from PET. Our project starts after catechol and we aim reduce catechol to pyruvate to add cell metabolism!
Our Future Aspect:
In our early rough drafts’ of our project we focused on PET degredation until Catechol but when we obtained  that Catechol can not use in biological pathways as biproduct, we decided to"

Protein Extraction Kit
Background
For selective purification of proteins, affinity chromatography is one of the most efficient methods available. Often they are only suited for analytical purposes and purification of high-value products and are too expensive for large-scale products such as industrial enzymes. Furthermore, the methods are difficult to scale up [1].
Liquid-liquid extraction in an aqueous two-phase system has been applied for primary recovery of industrial bulk proteins. They are formed in mixtures between two incompatible components, e.g. PEG/dextran, polymer/salt or detergent/polymer.
Usually, aqueous two-phase systems' formation could be induced by a shift in temperature above a critical temperature (cloud point) in a detergent/water system. Non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-114, display such temperature-sensitive phase separation, and can form cloud point extraction (CPE) systems [2].
The partitioning of a protein to one of the phases may depend on its surface charge or hydrophobicity, but the driving forces are not well understood. Obviously, the selectivity and overall efficiency of purification depend on how much the target protein differs in relevant properties as compared to the rest of proteins in the mixture. To achieve selective protein purification in aqueous two-phase system, small hydrophobic tags containing tryptophans have been fused to the target protein. However, the production of these fusion molecules is not efficient, possible reasons being problems in secretion of the tagged proteins or proteolytic degradation of the tag [1].
Our Goal
1. Achieve efficient protein extraction using Janus tag.
2. Find the best Janus tag.
3. Testify this system applicative to all kinds of proteins.
4. Develop universal BioBrick Janus tag for all users. 5. Explore the universally good conditions to all kinds of proteins.
6. Propose standard protocols for Janus-based protein extraction.
Our Design
Here comes the Janus, which could perform as a perfect protein extraction tag. The size of inJanus is about 8 kDa, and sJanus is about 7.5 kDa; both of them are not very large to affect the target protein. At the same time, Janus could promote the production of some proteins in various cells, like E4GIcore-sJanus in T. reesei [2] and"

Finally, we wanted to see if the TALE capture assay works (figure 17). In order to do this, we blotted TALEB fused to a K coil ( BBa_K1189030 ) on a nitrocellulose strip. Subsequently the strips were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST buffer. The strips were then washed and soaked in a solution containing [A] and [B] on the same plasmid( BBa_K1189006 ). The strips were then washed again with TALE binding buffer and soaked in a solution containing TALEA+β-lac ( BBa_K1189031 ). Then a dot blot was done on the strips with β-lactamase primary antibody and an hrp conjugated secondary antibody. This assay demonstrated that the TALEs can capture DNA.
Figure 17. Figure on the left: For the dual TALE lanes TALEB fused to a K coil ( BBa_K1189030 ) was blotted on a nitrocellulose strip. Subsequently the strips were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST buffer. The strips were then washed and soaked in a solution containing [A] and [B] on the same plasmid( BBa_K1189006 ). The strips were then washed again with TALE binding buffer and soaked in a solution containing TALEA+β-lac ( BBa_K1189031 ). Then a blot dot was done on the strips with β-lactamase primary antibody and an hrp conjugated secondary antibody. In negative 1 the strip was not soaked in the DNA solution. In Negative 2, the strip was not soaked in TALEA+β-lac solution. For positive controls, TALEA+βlac was blotted on the strip at the beginning instead of TALEB+K coil. The figure on the right shows the result of the densitometery we performed on the dot blot assay.
Conclusion:
We were able to successfully express, purify and characterize all of our constructs. Based on our results, TALEs bind specifically to their target site on a strip of nitrocellulose paper, which is what we are using in our prototype. We also showed that the TALE capture assay is functional and we can"

miRNA binding site features
miRNA are non-coding regulatory RNAs functioning as post-transcriptional gene silencers. After they are processed, they are usually 22 nucleotides long and they usually bind to the 3’UTR region of the mRNA (although they can also bind to the ORF or to the 5'UTR), forcing the mRNA into degradation or just repressing translation [Bartel, 2004].
In vegetal organisms, miRNA usually bind to the mRNA with extensive complementarity. In animals, interactions are more inexact, creating a lot of uncertainty in the in silico prediction of targets[?].
The seed of the miRNA is usually defined as the region centered in the nucleotides 2-7 in the 5’ end of the miRNA. For an efficient binding site extensive pairing is usually required between the seed and the corresponding part of the mRNA. The seed, and the corresponding pairing sequence of the mRNA are located inside the AGO protein.
Common types of miRNA seeds:
- 6mer (abundance 21.5%): only the nucleotides 2-7 of the miRNA match with the mRNA.
- 7merA1 (abundance 15.1%): the nucleotides 2-7 match with the mRNA, and there is an adenine in position 1.
- 7merm8 (abundance 25%): the nucleotides 2-8 match with the mRNA.
- 8mer (abundance 19.8%): the nucleotides 2-8 match with the mRNA and there is an adenine in position 1.
The percentages of abundance are calculated among conserved mammalian sites for a highly conserved miRNA (Friedman et al. 2008)
Figure 1: Interactions between two miRNAs and their binding sites. Notice the different types of seeds.
Outside the seed, the existence of supplemental pairing (at least 3 contiguous nucleotides and at best centered in nucleotides 13-16 of the miRNA) stabilizes the bound complex and increases the efficacy of the binding site.
Binding sites with a high local AU content around the binding site have proven to be more effective (possibly because of the destabilization of the mRNA secondary structure around the site). An arginine at position one of the binding site supposedly"
