    2.Relationship between cell concentration and PLA production.
Figure 12.The relationship between cell concentration and PLA production
    At the time we explored the mechanism of PLA sterilization, we found PLA inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria by break down the cell walls and membrane. It’s necessary to clarify the relationship between cell concentration and PLA production. The graph shows that the thicker engineered bacteria we use, the less PLA expressed instead.     This is also a join point of our model, more details on our model page.
Garbage lid-2-PE
    Goal: Because we use phenylalanine as the substrate to biosynthesis 2-PE, it’s essential to know how much substrate should be put in our lid and how long 2-PE will release into the air.     Reaults: 1. Relationship between substrate depletion and 2-PE production is shown. 2. Further optimization.

     Relationship between substrate depletion and 2-PE production is shown.
Figure 13. 2-PE production and substrates depletion.
    By controlling other variables, the line between substrate depletion and 2-PE production is shown. According to our human practice, the most comfortable concentration sets at 5 mM. More details on our human practice page. We try to control the amount of substrate at 32.5 mM.
    2. Further optimization.
Figure 14.Optimized 2-PE production according to our feedback from our human practice
    However, the substrate of PLA is the same as 2-PE. To produce both of them, we have to add excess substrate. We came up with another idea, as is known in literature， decrease the culture temperature is a effective way to raise the production of 2-PE. After we changed the temperature, the production of 2-PE increased to 5mM, which is suitable to put in the garbage lid
Garbage lid-Suicide
    Goal: Additionally, we got the LightOn switch data during our collaboration with ECUST. We planned to link it with suicide gene mazF. We try to get the result that once engineered bacteria reveal to outer environment, the toxin protein express to inhibit it.     Reaults: 1. LightOn switch with mcherry"
Stony_Brook,2015,Team:Stony Brook#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," much everyone on this team loves science. Sorry to disappoint but, you guessed it, my passion is genetics as well. When I grow up I hope to be a genetic engineer or perhaps a synthetic biologist (iGEM wasn’t able to scare me off). I love taking my ideas and creating something tangible with them; specifically treatments for life-threatening diseases. While I do occupy most of my time with science, I also really enjoy doing yoga, watching horror movies, reading news articles, and being outside.
Favorite Lab Moment:
When we started talking at lunch and not just smiling at each other.

I was born in and lived most of my life on eastern Long Island.  I love the outdoors, including kayaking, swimming and dirtbiking.  I’ve been an ocean lifeguard for 5 years.  My real passion is learning.  As odd as it is, I like spending many hours reading textbooks.  I find the details of life, such as biochemistry and cell biology very interesting and revealing.  I’ll be at Stony Brook for two more years to complete a masters in biomedical engineering, then I’m hoping to go to medical school.

Description:
I have added a lot of different professions to my “What I want to be” list as I grew up. There was a time when I wanted to be an astronaut, there was a time when I wanted to be an architect. But becoming a surgeon was always destined to top that list eventually. I want to go to medical school after my graduation. In terms of research, I am interested in space life sciences, biorobotics, tissue engineering and genetic engineering. In future, I would like to continue doing research in one of my area of interests.
I was born and raised in Bangladesh and came to United States at an age of 17. It was the beginning of a new and challenging chapter of my life. Photography is my hobby and I love to spend time in nature and admire its beauty. Other than that, I also enjoy traveling, playing badminton, sudoku, singing and most importantly, sleeping.
Favorite Lab Moment:
When I make short trips from our lab to the other labs of the building to seek help or meet professors.

These clusters contain genes encoding the bacteriocin, corresponding immunity and also genes that encodes peptides responsible for post translational modification Zacharof, M. P., & Lovitt, R. W. (2012). Bacteriocins Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria A Review Article. APCBEE Procedia, 2(2), 50–56. . The operon can be located either on plasmids, chromosomes or transposons of plasmids or chromosomes, which gives the complexity to the bacteriocins. However most bacteriocin operons are located on plasmids, as it has been suggested to help the phylogenetic dissemination of bacteriocins among lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Zacharof, M. P., & Lovitt, R. W. (2012). Bacteriocins Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria A Review Article. APCBEE Procedia, 2(2), 50–56. .

D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . For the bacteriocins produced by Gram positive LAB there are two types of immunity systems known today.  The first being the Lan I protein, which provides immunity to the producing cell by being attached to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. The localization prevents pore formation by the bacteriocin molecule as the Lan I protein is continuously transporting the bacteriocin molecule, that has been inserted into the membrane, back to the surrounding medium. The second immunity system depends on separate dedicated multicomponent ABC transporter called LAN EFG Zacharof, M. P., & Lovitt, R. W. (2012). Bacteriocins Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria A Review Article. APCBEE Procedia, 2(2), 50–56. . However the mechanism of immunity systems are similar in their way of functioning, as they, in general, work by removing the bacteriocin or by competitive inhibition of the bacteriocin receptor Balciunas, E.

Collaborations
Vilnius
After the Hackathon in Vilnius we decided to work on a collaboration with them, where we did some modeling for them. A molecular dynamics model was setup for the Vilnius 2018 iGEM team to study a part of their system. The system in question consists of a fusion transmembrane protein (OmpA+anti-GFP) in a pure DOPC bilayer in the presence of GFP. The fusion transmembrane protein should bind GFP and should display it on the outer side of the membrane.
To start, the structure of OmpA had to be reconstructed as parts of it are missing in the crystal structure. This was achieved using the “modeller” software, a python module for homology modeling. The same structure was used as the reference structure and so the filled in structure only serves to complete the molecule.
Next, the fusion protein was constructed. The sequences of OmpA and anti-GFP were joined exactly where they will be fused according to the DNA sequence designed by the Vilnius team, using PyMOL.
Then the fusion protein was coarse grained by the martinize script, producing a well calibrated coarse grained bead mapping for the fusion protein in the MARTINI 2 forcefield. The fusion protein was then inserted in a DOPC bilayer constructed by the insane.py script. GFP was also coarse grained using martinize and inserted in the system containing the fusion protein"

Electricity production
The increasing interest in electricity production by microbes is reflected by the conducted research amount and also publications not only in scientific journals, but also in more public ones (1, 2). The organisms that came to the discussion centre were Geobacter and Shewanella bacteria species, because of their unique cytochromes and ability to pump electrons through the membrane, which are generated during the respiration process. Some of the Geobacter species can easily colonize electrodes and start producing electricity, even from complex hydrocarbons containing aromatic rings. They also contain other characteristics required for good conductivity of the biofilm and it was characterized deeply in physiological and cellular level (3). But the most important feature for electron transfer in Geobacter species like G. sulfurreducens is heme group containing c type cytochromes (4).
The problem is that these specific cytochromes are not well characterized and working with them might be problematic. Therefore, we decided to use c type cytochromes known as mtrCAB from S. oneidensis, which are homologous to omc cytochromes from G. sulfurreducens. These proteins were used before by several other teams in the iGEM competition and were shown to be active in E. coli. Additionally, some research groups managed to reconstitute the activity of these proteins in E. coli cells and described the activity by using metal reduction assays (5).
The compartmentalization plays an important role in the electron transfer pathway as it provides location for various proteins. For example NapC protein that is naturally found in E. coli can reduce iron oxide and replace CymA from S. oneidensis (9) thus allowing transfer of electrons from cytosol to MtrA protein through the inner membrane."

The intensity and duration of every response increases along the initial quantity of glucose to be regulated. One important factor to consider is that this simulation integrates a single deviation from the equilibrium while a biological system reunites a series of different pulses that might be analysed as a series of pulses analogues to the ones presented here.
The implementation of our mathematical model could facilitate the configuration of the system according to a biological basis, using experimental data to accomplish the correct regulation of glucose. The system might be modified to regulate the values of the bacteria in order to get optimum results and the model should be modified according to these changes to avoid disparities between experimental results and mathematical framework. This model could be implemented in the area of biosensors while being of utility in other areas of knowledge as some of these equations could be of use for dieticians, predicting the behavior of their patient’s organisms or for endocrinology and other diabetes related fields as it predicts the generation of insulin according to a wide variety of parameters. In order to achieve this goal, we are planning to share the possible implications of this work with written resources comparing different people metabolism and lifestyles

I decided to join INSA Lyon iGEM team in order to have a look at what research is and work in a biotechnology project and it was way better than expected! This experience has shown me the wonders and the possibilities of synthetic bio and has motivated me to be a researcher in the future.
During the summer, I was specifically in charge of the cloning period, characterization tests and the final experiences on nickel chelation. Also, I participated in the iGEM France meet up and had a great time with the other iGEMers!
In my free time, I like traveling, going to concerts, dance and practice sports.

The iGEM seems to be the best way to discover the world of synthetic biology,  and getting involved in a great project with real solutions and a real impact like the project Curly'on. I have been in charge of the Nickel tests, but I was also available to help my mates in the lab for other tasks, for the iGEM you must be MULTI-TASK ! I'm passionate about technologies, open science, DIY, rowing, cinema and Science Fiction (Dr Who!).

Based on my interest for biology as an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, I started putting a lot into the school association “DNA Concept Club”. I was in charge of communication and my goal was to promote synthetic biology. Then I heard about the iGEM competition  and I felt naturally attracted!  Let's talk about this amazing experience... Nicknamed “miss bacteria killer”, I was all the summer especially in charge of degrading biofilms and bacterial DNA before their use in the biofilter. For the human practice part, I organized visits at the purification station and the dialysis center. Liking art in general, I was pleased to write some lyrics for our clip Plasmidoutai as well as to be the photographer of the team ! One last point : I took part in the French iGEM meetup, from which I have a lot of good memories !

Bacterial infections:
Bacteria inhabit all exposed surfaces of our bodies and yet they rarely make us ill. Only pathogenic bacteria can cause infections and only when they are present in sufficient numbers to overcome our immune system's defences. This threshold will be unique to each pathogen in each environment it encounters, and may be influenced by the bacteria's ability to communicate and the strength of the host individual's immune function among other things.
The producing bacteria we designed can inhibit the growth of target bacteria; by slowing down its growth rate, we can make them less harmful to the human body.
Mathematical modelling can help us explain this concept.
Our producing bacteria produces a siRNA that targets a gene in the pathogen, this could be a gene that codes a nutrient uptake protein that would slow down growth when targeted. We have to consider two modifications to the logistic growth to model this effect: the growth rate is affected or the carrying capacity is altered. However, both modifications consider the same type of repression, as described here:
the growth rate is affected, or
the carrying capacity is altered
However, both modifications consider the same type of repression, as described here:
where R is a measure of  the abundance of  siRNA.
We have defined a value at which the level of bacteria can generate an infection. As the immune system has to generate a response in a given time, the goal of our system is to keep the bacteria below that threshold during a fixed period of time. This critical time marks the period in which the immune system is sifficiently prepared to fight the infection.
As expected, two different behaviours are observed. If only growth rate is repressed  by the presence of siRNA, bacteria will grow slowly but reach their maximum level eventually. However, if the inhibition is strong enough, the bacteria will be below the threshold before the critical time, avoiding the infection. The second case case in which the pathogen’s carrying capacity is repressed by siRNA is more reliable, as it can maintain the bacteria below the threshold for a long time.
It is expected this model can help us to understand how our system can"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#HumanPractices#IntegratedHumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,"5. The overall conclusion is that more attention should be paid to educating athletes on the risks above just regulating. Many athletes are not educated well about gene doping in particular and would therefore easily trust coaches etc. at the sports facility to take something of which they themselves are not able to oversee the consequences.
Figure 5. List of the differing factors between gene doping and more conventional doping.
Another topic addressed during the discussion was that we cannot easily say that gene doping could become ‘safe’ at some point. It is possible that it becomes apparent that we have been messing around with certain feedback loops which has broader health implications on longer terms after some years. We cannot know with some initial studies. It is this what makes that we should be keep prohibiting gene doping according to the majority of experts present at the discussion. On top of this, differences in accessibility, which you also already see in training facilities and equipment, were used as arguments against gene doping.
Great presentation and especially loved the debate and various perspectives on the question of gene doping.
— April Henning (@aprildhenning) August 30, 2018
Furthermore, it was brought up that there will always be differences between athletes, due to inherently different responses to gene therapies. Therefore, if everyone would be using gene doping, it is just like taking a step to somewhat higher performance, which will then level out again in time. So what would we achieve with doing it?
Thanks for the event, Delft team and Paul. A wonderfully complex tangle of ethical and pragmatic issues at stake. The debate showed a great meeting of science, systematic method and applied philosophy.
— Steve Chinn (@SteveChinnups) August 30, 2018
As became apparent in the discussion, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) is not very open about gene doping to athletes and scientists. However, according to the experts at the conference, openness and involvement of the community could help a lot with the development of detection methods. This reinforces the community strength approach we take with for example the hackathon .
Engagement in Asia
The way people value sports is just as diverse as the people who love it, all around the globe. That is why it is important to weigh opinions not only in the Netherlands, but in the Peoples’ Republic of China as well. During our time there organizing the iGEM Eurasian Meetup , we spoke with Dr. Li Wei at NIFTY prenatal screening, who works with cell free DNA as well. He confirmed our assumptions on the cfDNA levels in the blood and outlined several possibilities of detecting it, discussing the advantages"

We met with associations, seeking to make citizens aware of new advances in research and to participate in research budget votes and research legislation. We debated with opponents of synthetic biology and iGEM. To access the a part of the debate: click below.
Discussion with J. Testart
We discussed with the EPFL team, Jacques Testart (famous French biologist) and the association Sciences Citoyennes about iGEM competition  and synthetic biology. First completely hermetic to iGEM, Mr Testart then consider that some projects iGEM, like ours and that of Lausanne, could be ethically responsible. Here is his answer to our first debate and starting of email exchange:
Translation of the mail:
“Thank you for your message. First of all, I would like to remind you how much my colleagues from Sciences Citoyennes and I were pleased to meet you and appreciated your questions that demonstrate a rare responsibility.
Why am I ""against"" IGEM? As stated in the book, this event disconnects technical performances from its possible consequences for society. ""Everything is possible !"" they say.  May the best win. It is also a matter of teaching to students, in a fun way, that research is above all a competition, which reinforces the ideal of performance in relation to the meaning of innovations. The difficulties you have in finding an interlocutor (at the IGEM or in your school) who can help you with ethical questions show that these questions are irrelevant and it is not the sponsors who will contradict me ...
I do not think that many students have been brought to a reflection like yours thanks to this experience. With my colleagues from SC, we greatly appreciate your commitments and wish to continue these discussions with you.
Sincerely, JTTT

Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the yellow amilGFP and the pink eforRed chromoprotein by thier fluorescence cause they showed significantly different signals. However, when we measured mixed cultures no differentiation was possible without any obvious reason. A few days later we observed a mixture of cells under the microscope and found out that the expression of the chromoprotein may lead to stickiness of the cells causing them to build big clusters, thus unfortunately no differentiation and sorting of the cells in the FACS is possible in order to determine mixed culture composition. Back at our lab, a PCR of the inducible promoter expression cassette of the las quorum sensing system and RBS-luxI-TT device was performed. The inducible ampicillin resistance cassettes of the las und rhl qourum sensing system were transformed in E. coli Top10 F' cells to get rid of the problem with promoter leakiness.
Tuesday, July 16, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Melanie
After performing PCR and gel electrophoresis of the LasR and RhlR expression cassettes combined with an upstream double terminator no clones showed a right band size on the gel.
Minipreperation of the las expression cassette and RBS-luxI-TT device was carried out and prepared for sequencing.
Wednesday, July 17, 2013
Investigators: Kevin, Laura
Once more a colony PCR of the LasR and RhlR expression cassettes with the combinded upstream double terminator as well as of the three inducible promoter expression cassettes was performed. Furthermore, 2xYT liquid cultures of E. coli XL1 Blue MRF'  mCherry, YFP and eCFP fluorescence expression cassettes and the LasR and RhlR expression cassettes with an upstream double were inoculated.  The ampicillin resistance was extracted from gel.

While the energy and Cas13a coverage development showed slightly different results, we decided to use CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 to dry Cas13a in further experiments , to have TDPs of both families to test in the lab. Additionally, we experimentally determined that these two proteins also had the largest effect on desiccation tolerance of LDH, which further supported our choice. All in all however, we expect that SAHS 33020 performs best in Cas13a drying assays.
Preservation of Cas13a activity at different concentrations
As CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 were chosen to dry Cas13a, we simulated the behaviour of the two proteins at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L. An example on how the difference in concentration affects the number of chains is shown in Figure 13 for SAHS 33020. We again chose a volume fraction of 0.1 and analyzed the development of Cas13a coverage (see Figure 14) as well as the energy over time (see Figure 15).
Figure 13: Initial state of lattice model simulation for SAHS 33020 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L at a volume fraction of 0.1.
In Figure 14 the number of direct neighbours to Cas13a is plotted against the TDP concentration at the same time in each simulation. Boothby et al. 2017 had previously observed a logarithmic behaviour of LDH activity towards TDP concentrations as high as 10 g/L. For this reason, we fitted a logarithmic curve over all points with function (4).
$$ y = m\cdot \ln(x) +b\tag{4} $$
The coefficient of determination of the resulting curve is between 0.7 and 0.8 for both fits, indicating that it complies with the data reasonably well. The system might not have reached its saturation point, but the curve evens out towards higher TDP concentrations as would be expected. This means that, up to a concentration of 1 g/L at least, a higher Cas13a coverage can be achieved by increasing the TDP concentration. Better preservation of Cas13a activity may be possible to obtain with higher TDP concentrations, but our results indicate that the difference in the resulting desiccation tolerance will become less pronounced at higher concentrations. This complies with observations by Boothby et al. "

Members present - James, Matt, Jess, Hanny, Goksel
Advisors present - Morgan, Matt
Bacillus subtilis should always be written as italic. Gene names should start with lowercase whereas protein name should start with uppercase.
Do not use green and red colous on presentations.
When a protein sequence is known, to find similar proteins do a blast search.
To control cadA system directly by ArsR and CzrR, we can insert the binding sites of these proteins into the binding site of CadA.
Cd uptake in bacteria is preferred to other metals like Zinc.
Action Points
Watch out for other team's wikis. Every week give a review for 5 minutes for other wikis
Combine the first two boxes on the presentation.
The diagram shouls also include the system that pumps out Cd
The first stochastic switch should be wired to Cd sensing system directly whereas the second one should be influenced by the system.
We should also model the state when there is no metal
Always use DNa rearrangement upon Cd exposure.
While doing a presentation, create a table and display which genes are ON and OFF for each step
Model Cd uptake using a CellML model
Display the spore timeline while presenting the required actions step by step
Do not use GFP inside biobricks. In this way they are not modular.
List the names of genes that need to be knocked out. E.g mntH.
For each gene, specify whether the gene exits in B. subtilis or it is taken from another organism.
Investigate if arsR has another name in literature.
Investigate the operator site of arsR
Investigate how cadA is regulated. We can use sigma factors to regulate cadA system or we can expres a repressor to deactivate the system.
Model the following sub systems
Cd pumps. we can then decide how many of them we need
AND gate for metal sensing
Stochastic swicthes
DNA rearrangement

     We have collaborated with several iGEM teams, sharing experiences and problems we have faced during the development of our project. In the following, we described each of our partnerships.
Cooperation with UFSCAR Team
     Bioinformatics and modeling seems to always be challenging for most of us. This year, we wanted to create a supplementary material that summarizes useful tools to analyze data, simulate synthetic circuits and give us prediction power. Click here to learn more about this material.
     On July 3rd, we met with UFSCar-Brasil team to talk about modeling of biological systems, and present a supplementary material we developed as a didactic introduction to these topics. Thiago, the physicist of our team, compiled these topics into a 2 hours talk with hands-on activities. We conducted an informal discussion about Python and the main tools in this programming language for Synthetic Biology, reviewing state-of-art numerical methods for bioinformatics and gene expression simulation through deterministic models. We believe this interaction provided us with constructive feedback to improve our material, while hopefully helping UFSCar-Brasil team with modeling.
Participation in a survey from Team CGU_Taiwan
     iGEM projects often address timely and appealing issues that could potentially raise our quality of life. However, the actual impact of an iGEM project depends on how the public opinion will see your project. For instance, we are all constantly struggling for financial support, which strongly depends on how appealing a solution would be perceived by the general population. Thinking of this topic, The CGU Taiwan team wanted to create (created) a survey to assess the feedback to several iGEM project descriptions from populations of differents countries. This could generate significant information on how to propose better projects in the future.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#project_-_-_TEXT.html," model can help us study the behaviors of this system.
Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model has taken spatial effects on relationships between populations and individuals into consideration. In the fluid model, we use Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to describe the behavior of the amount of different characters and molecules. In the solid model, however, we use Cellular Automaton (CA) to mimic effects of spatial factors. (See more at Fluid Model and Solid Model )
As is shown above, fluid model helped us a lot on experimental design. Besides, they can also be used to help us design our game---E.coli War! The game can be used to help us consider effects of some factors on population interactions. Besides, it can even help us realize the educational purpose of our project and make public know more about synthetic biology!
IX E.coli War
Our games are made on structure of html5.The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.  (Fig10: Videos)
See more details on Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War
After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.
See more details at Visiting Perfect World
Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (Fig.11) (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum , Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
(Fig.11 Children are playing E.coli War in CSTM!)
X Summary
In conclusion, we designed a very general system to study many complex relationships and also a useful model to describe this system. In the future, it will be convenient to investigate some interesting questions with regard to relationships between populations and individuals by using this system.
What’s more, we designed two interesting games--- Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War to make the public more interested in synthetic biology. Conversely, their finding of many interesting results and disciplines in the games could also be of great help to our research. By this way, we combine our project to the world perfectly.

In our project, the plac-FixK2 promoter is part of the toggle switch . This switch is intended for regulating Bt toxin expression. The promoter is only activated in darkness, inside the beehive. Furthermore, it stays inactivated through LacI mediated repression until B12 is sensed, which inhibits the formation of LacI (see also our project about detecting Varroa mites )

Comparing the clearance of the skim milk plates, a proteolytic activity could be proven for the cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E. As a result, we concluded that within three days these cells are able to produce the native protease, which will then digest the skim milk in the agar plates, resulting in a clearance. In conclusion, we were able to express subtilisin E in E. coli and to prove its proteolytic activity via skim milk assay. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," issue that many places around the world face, specifically Alberta. While our provincial economy relies heavily on the oil and gas industry, and we are very fortunate to have such natural resources at our disposal, these tailings must be monitored and dealt with cautiously. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of oil, oil sands, natural gas, and coal resources over their entire life cycle. They aim to ensure the reclamation of tailings ponds and speaking with them helped us gain insight on many different aspects of our project. We organized an interview with a Senior Tailings Engineer from Alberta Energy Regulator, and told him about our project and goals. A large concern for our project was using synthetic biology in an environment that is exposed to natural conditions; however, when discussing the issue of biocontainment with the AER representative, he advised us that biocontainment was not an issue whatsoever. This is due to the fact that tailings ponds do not support many living organisms aside from bacteria because they are so toxic (tailings ponds are relatively isolated environments). We also discussed and gained knowledge of the magnitude of tailings ponds, and were informed that they will continue to grow and must be taken care of. This interview helped us to confirm that our system would be very useful due to the fact that there is currently no concrete solution. The representative voiced his concern about the magnitude of tailings ponds, and the impact that our system could have on such a large volume. We aim to resolve this concern using mathematical modelling until further experiments can be conducted. Our interview with the AER representative allowed us to verify that our project would be highly innovative and beneficial to both our economy and environment.
Professor Rood
In order to address our questions of biosecurity and feasibility, we had an interview with a biology professor at the University of Lethbridge, Dr Stewart Rood. We were told that our project required improvement in the applied design; tailings ponds are massive, and it would be very difficult to extract enough metals from them to make a profit. “My biggest problem with the system is scale,” informed Dr. Rood. As a result, in the final few weeks before the giant Jamboree, we researched other potential real-world applications of our system, in order to discover what it could be most effectively used for. We realized that although our system would not be extremely helpful in remediating tailings ponds samples, it would be beneficial to extract metals for profit from them -- but particularly in mining tailings. Moreover, we re-acknowledged the use of our system"

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#References_-_-_TEXT.html," for selection. The second strategy was a primer mutagenesis based approach.
Random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR (EP-PCR)
In order to detect novel substances (e.g. capsaicin) with the VirA receptor, the first step was to create a mutagenised library of virA variants, which could subsequently be screened for new binding characteristics. Plenty of different strategies for mutagenesis of DNA are known, including the use of nucleotide analogues, bacteria containing mutator genes, the mutagenesis with UV light or chemicals and inaccurate PCR ( Cadwell RC and Joyce GF, 1992 ).
When designing our strategy we rejected the use of bacteria strains with high mutation rates, since the changes in base sequence would occur all over the transformed plasmids. Thereby some mutations would also take place in the backbone of the plasmid, or might even been found in the standardized BioBrick prefix and suffix. We also excluded the possibility of using UV light or mutagenic chemicals, due to reasons of safety and minimizing the exposure of toxic substances.
In our experiment we wanted to alter only the part of the plasmid coding for the VirA receptor, while using a not harmful and thereby safe technique. Thus, our method of choice was inaccurate PCR that allows the exclusive variations of a distinct region of a plasmid, which is defined by the location of the upstream and downstream primers. This mutagenic method of PCR, called error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) has been described and improved a lot in scientific community ( McCullum EO et al., 2010 ).
The basic principle of this technique uses the natural high infidelity of the taq DNA polymerase, which can even be increased by special changes in buffer conditions compared to standard PCR. These alterations may include the unequal distribution of dNTPs (5 mM purines, 25 mM pyrimidines) as well as an increased amount of MgCl2 and the addition of MnCl2. The total rate of base exchange can be adjusted by the number of PCR cycles, since mutations will accumulate during the exponential amplification of the sequence ( Wilson DS and Keefe AD, 2000 ). The experimental conditions of the performed error-prone PCR are described in the section “protocols”.
Directed mutagenesis
After the identification of the 100 amino acids linker region responsible for VirA ligand binding ( Compare VirA-Receptor ) we compared this region with well characterized capsaicin receptors derived from animal model organisms (TRPV1). The conserved receptor region is shown in the"

3.Correlation between the knowledge about central dogma and an interest to join in biological activities like iGEM.
p-value = 1.035e-10
[AS EXPECTED] the same as above
Those 3 results clearly show a fact; education is a must to get more grants or interest from general (inc. firms) for development of biological   study.
Correlation between the knowledge about central dogma and the field of biological researches you are the most interested in.
p-value = 0.9101
[CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS]Knowledge gives little effect on interest on people. This is because those who have much knowledge also show interest   to fields                    (a, b) i.e. related to our daily life.
Correlation between the knowledge about central dogma and the number of people who answered the all questions of (5).
p-value = 0.05639
[AS EXPECTED]Those who have less biological knowledge tend to unanswer the whole question above. This is because it’s quite difficult for people who   are not familiar with biology to digest all content of poster session, and activity of iGEM.
Result of survey 2 tells us the same thing as that of survey 1. Without knowledge, it is quite difficult to enhance the interest in general to   biological field and this could cause hardship when scientists study; less money and underestimated.
We found out communication with both other iGEM teams and general is the key to bridge the gap. We, UT-Tokyo will continue taking communication with   inner and outer society!

The 3 plates created are: plain mineral media, and two of the minimal media with 5% polystyrene sprinkled on top. The E. coli is being plated on the plain media as well as one of the polystyrene sprinkled plates.
(11:20 am) With the controls plated up and placed in the warm room, testing on toluene can start to see if it creates a viable media when dissolved polystyrene is mixed with the media.
(12:00 pm) After a huge amount of walking and safety introductions the team could finally start working with toluene under the careful eye of a supervisor.
(12:30 pm) The toluene did not work. It dissolved the polystyrene perfectly, however why trying to mix it into the liquid media it precipitates out into a frog spawn like mixture.
(14:00 pm) Back to the drawing board then for the team, as new ideas need to be made to produce a viable media to grow and select for polystyrene degrading bacteria. One possible solution is to have a liquid media with nutrients in, but this still has to be tested.
    Tuesday 31st July 2012
(10:30 am) As a group we decided to start an hour later today as there wasn't much lab work to be done. To start off, the team had to re-suspend the liquid media as some of the salts had crystallized out of suspension. Once this was done by a combination of vigorous shaking and microwaving, the team could start making 7ml solutions in 50ml corning tubes. This allows the tubes to be spun in the orbital shaker at about 250rpm so the polystyrene doesn't settle at the bottom of the tube but is mixed throughout. The corning tubes were labelled with each strain of P. aeruginosa that are plated up as well as a control for both plain nutrient broth as well as nutrient broth/polystyrene mix where there is 5% of polystyrene in each tube.
(12:30 pm) With all the tubes filled with the correct media they were taken over to the MSB where they could have the bacteria put into the suspension and left to start growing. With this done the work for today is done.

Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"cidentally, we had just finished a similar analysis of our project and all parties collectively agreed that we would attempt to model their system. After a few additional skype-sessions and email correspondence, we were provided a clear understanding of the organization of their genetic circuits and we set out to design the set of differential equations. Upon completion, we provided them with a document that presented the differential equations, an explanation of the derivation, the potential limits of the model and friendly suggestions on how to approach the estimation of the conformational rate change constant between the sequestered SD site and unfolded mRNA chain. The document can be found here .
We are very grateful to the 2017 SVCE Chennai iGEM team for introducing us to the exciting world of mRNA regulation and its applicability in translational control and for allowing us to be a part of their iGEM experience.
Technical University of Denmark
The DTU team generously provided us with transformed DH5-ɑ colonies for the InterLab study due to our initial struggle of successfully transforming the competent DH5-ɑ cells acquired from the Department of Biotechnology at Lund University. However, as no fluorescence was detected after overnight inoculation of the colonies as per DTU’s suggestion, we were unfortunately unable to use their samples to gather the necessary data.
Chalmers University of Technology Gothenburg
After discussing our limited success in transforming the competent DH5-ɑ cells that were provided by the Division of Biotechnology at Lund University, Chalmers Gothenburg courteously offered to supply us with enough cells to make a bacterial glycerol stock.

During the process of creating a cohesive strategy on how best to approach the outreach component of our project, we concluded that a public seminar would be a good medium. This would allow us to both communicate the importance of sustainability as well as discuss the seemingly endless applicability of synthetic biology. This would in addition give us an opportunity to open up a dialogue with our local community. Coincidentally, Lund University is celebrating their 350th anniversary this year and offered an impressive range of public lectures throughout the year and upon request, we were allocated a slot. To ensure depths and flavor, we asked Chalmers Gothenburg to co-host the seminar which they readily accepted, much to our delight. Together, we hosted a two-hour long public seminar discussing various topics of synthetic biology. It was well received and we are beyond pleased with"

Figure 16: Ratio of the percentage area of β-III Tubulin on the number of stained nucleus. (ns: non-significant, * : p<0.05, ** : p<0.01, *** : p<0.001, **** : p<0.0001).
As we can see in figure 16, we have a decreasing amount of β-III Tubulin per nuclei each time the concentration of NGF gets higher. We can see a significant decrease of this ratio when the NGF is at 500 ng/mL and higher, which is not an expected result and an opposite result from the images that we occurred from the platform.
We assumed from the start that all of our cells put in culture were neuronal cells, which might not be the case. We know that the NGF has an effect of the survival of the cells [1], [2] (Figure 15 B). We did not have the suitable marker to differentiate the neuronal cells from the other types of cells, and should have stained the cells with NeuN, a neuronal nuclear antigen used as a biomarker for neurons. Therefore, the standardization we did with the number of cells is not an accurate one. We can still appreciate the qualitative results we had (Figure 14 and 15 A) and are positive on the effect NGF has on axon’s growth as well as cell survival.
After having collected the data on the effect of commercial NGF, we decided to put in culture our cells in the presence of our bacterial lysate to test the effect of our proNGF ( produced with Bba_K2616000 ). We put in culture for 2 days 30 000 cells with or without commercial NGF at 500 ng/mL and 900 ng/mL as well as our bacterial lysate in different dilutions. Since we wanted to inactivate as much bacterial proteins as possible (endotoxins), we checked the denaturation temperature for our proNGF, 70°C, and heat-inactivated the lysate at 60°C for 5 minutes before putting it in culture. Due to lack of time, only one well per condition was analyzed.

Overview
1. Proposed our project to professors from Taiwan and the United States, received useful feedback on setting up the experiments and design principles.
2. Visited water treatment plant in National Science Park for investigation and sampling, and inspired us to develop a smartphone app for our project.
3. Discussed organic culture farmland and fish farming, to discuss the potential to implement our device into these working spaces.
4. Co-organized Taiwan iGEM conference and attended the 5th Asia Pacific Conference, aiming to spread the influence of iGEM.
5. Participated in a competition held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and won the bronze medal, showcasing the potential value of our farmland water protection project.
6. Cooperated with teams from USA, New Zealand, Netherlands, and China on the bio-mechanism problem, hardware design, and public engagement.
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" — Peter Carr, Director of Judging.
According to the definition of Human Practice from iGEM, each team should interact with the whole society, to figure out what the world lacks and to dedicate our ability to the needs. In our team, the concern of environment and health are the ultimate targets. The crisis triggered by Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) has not only be forgotten gradually by us after the Vietnam War since the contaminated regions are narrowed in certain places, few and few people pay attention to these dangerous chemicals.
Visit Experts

This summer, we visited researchers in Institute of Environmental Engineering, NCTU , whose study mainly focus on wastewater treatment. They reviewed our project and provided some suggestion for us.
1. Since enzyme producing technique is not yet mature enough to date, we should reinforce more on detection so that we can increase the efficiency of enzyme usage.
2. Agricultural wastewater has more than an imaginable amount of aerobic particles. Even if the water seems clean, it will still"

July 17, 2008: Testing Sessions (with pictures!)
Alright. So testing is over. And now we are preparing for our Alpha release, perhaps also fated to be a crazy rush for me. Here are the pics from our testing sessions! Obviously, I'm not present in any of them. Who else would be behind the viewfinder? :)
Test Session 1
Doug and Anne waiting for the session to begin. We're all pretty excited it seems. :)
Matt, Doug, and Anne starting up Clotho on Matt's system. I believe this was about when we realized business was about to begin. Hence the game faces. Anne looks as flattering as ever, I'm sure.
Matt helping out Dirk, one of the members from the iGEM 2008 Cal Wetlab Team. Go check them out if you haven't already!
Doug helping out Cici, another member from the iGEM 2008 Cal Wetlab Team.
Here we are, with advisors Doug Densmore and Chris Anderson, getting everyone's final remarks about Clotho and collaborating on our next steps.
Test Session 2
The lack of images in test session 2 were probably due to me being useful most of the time. I wasn't able to get my camera out until near the end of this session. Hope this doesn't bum out anyone!
Doug recording some of the bugs as testers from wetlab threw them out.

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Project#Sensor#GoalandDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," established an essential design to link up with ratio sensor. After discussing with my team member, I proposed that the phosphate sensor should be biobricked with an inverter to modulate the responding curve coupled with nitrate sensor. The reason is that phosphate-sensitive promoter is low-phosphate activated while transcription rate of nitrate-sensitive promoter is in proportion to the extracellular concentration of nitrate. Since the two signal inputs of ratio sensor should be in synchronized, reversal of the behavior of phosphate-sensitive promoter is needed. Here is our preliminary design:

Researchers have demonstrated Strain MV1184 containing ppk and ackA showed the highest rates of Pi removal from the medium. This recombinant strain removed approximately 90% of the Pi from the medium within 4 h. The data of this result is very satisfactory. Although another recombination strain contain ppk and pst cluster has better effect, the data is not available, so we choose to creat the recombination strain containing ppk and ackA that we standardize by ourselves.
To get standardized parts, an entire ackA gene fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers designed by myself from the mutation of E.coli K12 strain ,DH5αand inserted into the PSB1C3 vector. Ppk contains an EcoRI site need to be mutant. So we get it from the E. coli DH5 Chromosome and inserted into pGEM-T-vector, then cut it in XbalI and PstI and inserted the fragment into PSB1C3 cutting by XbalI and PstI sites first.

2. We randomly select a part of the matching sequence through preliminary screening and judge the correctness of the matching by manual verification and add the corresponding label, then select three BLAST parameters: e-value, pident and pqlen. Using the logistic regression algorithm with polynomial features, and cooperate with grid search to train the classifier to classify the BLAST results. Taking the coding sequence as an example, the accuracy of the classifier 3 refolding cross-validation is 98.5%.

A large number of sampling test results show that the matching sequences selected by the above steps have a high consistency in function and usage, which ensures the accuracy of data expansion to a certain extent.
We obtain the abstract of related references in NCBI using the crawler module in python. For interested documents, users can skip to the full text through provided links to get deeper understandings of biobricks.
Interaction
Biobrick interactions often lead to unpredictable consequences, so we provide interactions between biobricks to remind users of biobricks' interactions with certain parts. With this information, users can further avoid unnecessary interactions to gene loops.
Data about the interactions is collected from STRING Database and data about those parts comes from iGEM Registry.
In order to visually represent the interaction between biobricks, we use the interactive graphics pack: Cytoscape.js to draw interactive scatter plots to improve users’ experience.
Fig.4.Interaction of biobricks
Database structure
In order to prevent data redundancy, we build a relational database based on mysql and make a series of standard relational tables. The database structure is as follows:
Fig.5.Database structure
Search
In order to make it more convenient and improve user experience, BioMaster provides a variety of search methods. You can find previous projects and parts and biobricks by keywords. You can also use multiple IDs (such as iGEM_ID, Uniprot_ID, EPD_ID or gene name) to find the corresponding biobrick. In addition, we provide the BLAST method, you can directly find the matching biobricks through the sequence. These variety of searching methods are undoubtedly more humane.
Fig.6.Different search methods
Keywords search
The iGEM official encouraged us to stand on the shoulders of giants, so we provided information about the teams that submitted those biobricks when users use BioMaster. We collected wikis of the teams from 2005-2018 and used the Microsoft Text Analytics Service to extract keywords to make it easier for users to locate previous"

Use a single colony of B. subtilis to inoculate 4 ml of LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Incubate the culture over night at 37°C with agitation.
Next morning inoculate 10 ml LB liquid medium supplemented in a shake flask to an approximate OD600 of 0.05. Incubate the shake flask at 37°C and 200 rpm in the dark and collect the cells at the growth phase of interest.
To harvest the cells, transfer 1 ml into a 1.5 ml lightproof (brown) Eppendorf reaction tube and centrifuge the tube for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Discard the supernatant and Re- suspend the cells in 1x PBS buffer (in a volume (µ{l) = OD600 x (1/10) (µl)). Keep the cell suspension on ice until microscopy.
Preparation of the agarose slide for microscopy: boil the agarose, put some agarose on the slide and place the cover slide on top of the agarose; remove the cover slide from the rigid agarose and pipet your cells on top of the agarose; finally, cover the cells with the cover slide.
Fluorescence images will be obtained with an Axioskop 40 FL fluorescence microscope, equipped with digital camera AxioCam MRm. The AxioVision Rel 4.8.2 software will be used for image processing (Carl Ze"

Chalmers team reached out to our team over Twitter and graciously offered to help build up our team’s past project database. Over the summer their team ended up adding in over 20 entries from the 2015 competition year, summarizing teams’ projects, tracks, numbers of team members, chassis used, research benchmarks, submitted parts and part links and descriptions, medal statuses, and any nominations and awards.
University of Exeter, UK
The Exeter team this year focused on characterizing the efficiency, fidelity, and robustness of common biobrick kill switches to address concerns surrounding the use of kill switches as bio-safety devices. As a side-project, our team sought to create an easily-searchable past-projects database. After several timezone-targeted Skype sessions, Twitter exchanges, and protocol discussions our teams fostered a collaboration to further both of these aims. Purdue would test the reliability our 2015 team’s previously uncharacterized kill switch, and Exeter would help log entries for our 2016 team’s past project database.
To that end, after following Exeter’s protocol for continuous culture with the anaerobically-triggered kill switch BBa_K9188020 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we tested for the kill switch’s fidelity by growing up liquid cultures in anaerobic conditions and measuring optical density at 0, 1, 5, and 24 hours. Across the pond Exeter’s team worked to enter almost 50 iGEM projects into our past project database.

This year, we did a lot work in our lab and beyond the bench concerning our project – a brand-new IGEM BLOOD ALCOOL METER (iMeter). We questioned the reliability of the breathalyzer test in the field sobriety test. We researched the news and found out the factors influencing the breath test such as individual metabolic differences and diabetes diseases, as well as in some situations the police cannot force people to breathe such as suspects’ refusal and people dead or in coma.
In our human practices, we surveyed the alcohol consumers (i.e., the school teachers, the parents, the general public) and the experts (i.e., the police, the judges, the health care workers, the wine tester) by the questionnaire concerning the sobriety issues. Moreover, we visited them in the police station, in the court and in the hospital to discuss the issue of “drinking and driving” and the idea of our project. Furthermore, we hosted a drink “party” assisted by the school’s military instructor and a police officer to let the school’s principal and teachers to experience the breathalyzer used in the field sobriety test. And all of the opinions and encouragements got from the activities did help us design our iGEM product and do a better iGEM project.
In our lab work, we completed 11 new BioBricks including improving an existing part. We did protein analysis and enzyme activity assay to prove our concept. In addition, we performed modeling to test our enzyme’s efficiency in an electrochemical simulator, which was helped by biotech companies working on blood glucose meter innovation, BIONIME Corp. and Zensor R&D Corp. Overall, this is an amazing year for us, MINGDAO iGEM 2016. See you in the Giant Jamboree!
We have registered MINGDAO as an iGEM TEAM 2016, and had a great summer in our biolab and beyond the bench. Furthermore, we’re going to have fun at the Giant Jamboree

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,"'m sure you can imagine, this is very helpful in the lab, but it also has many implications for the outside world.
What do you need?
DNA template: the template is essentially the thing you want to amplify. The reaction can't make new DNA by itself, but it can copy existing DNA to make more of it. You also need to know the base sequence either side of the section you want to copy because you need to design primers.
Primers: In addition to not being able to make new DNA, the reaction needs a small stretch of DNA to latch on to to start the copying process. These small stretches are called primers. They need to be designed so that they have a complementary sequence to the template, so that they can stick, and be extended according to the sequence of the template.
dNTPS: These are the building blocks of DNA. They are the individual nucleotide bases (A, T, C, and G) and are added sequentially onto the end of primer in order to extend it.
Enzyme: The enzyme is the thing which performs the reaction. Without it, the reaction would be unable to proceed at any appreciable rate. During our project, we’ve used two different enzymes for PCR: Q5 and Phusion. Due to the characteristics of each enzyme, you need to use different quantities of the other reaction mixture components. For example, the Q5 mix already contains dNTPs, but Phusion doesn’t. Enzymes may also have different optimum temperatures, so you need to take this into account when performing the reaction.
Water: This ensures that each of the components is in the correct relative concentration, because if you have, for example, too high a concentration of DNA, you will get too much non-specific binding, especially between primers.
How does the reaction work?
The reaction works by cycling through a series of different temperatures to allow the different stages of the reaction to occur. Firstly, the reaction mix is heated to 98oC to split the double stranded DNA into single stranded DNA, giving two strands of template.
After this the temperature of the reaction is lowered to allow the primers to anneal to the template. The precise temperature needed is determined by the enzyme being used, and the primer sequences. Our annealing temperatures ranged from about 65-72 degrees Celsius.
The final temperature in the cycle is the optimum temperature for the enzyme you’re using. This allows primer extension to occur at the faster rate possible.
These temperatures are then cycled, so you get 25-30 cycles of denaturing, annealing and extending. During"

Discovered that the negative control for HB101 overnight culture was contaminated.  Also, the plate that had been made yesterday had no distinct colonies on it.  As such, decided to replate HB101.  Put this into incubator around 8:45 pm.
Also, innoculated a culture of HB101 from a plate that we had in the fridge from 7/28/08.  Placed this in the incubator at 9:55 pm.
Weighing out for making more media:
Need 0.7351 g CaCl2 dihydrate in 100 mL to make 50 mM solution
A - 25.0030 g YPD broth
B - 25.0040 g YPD broth
C - 25.0028 g YPD broth
D - 20.0025g Lennox LB broth
E - 0.7354g CaCl2
PCR:
Double checked the primers for the promoters, seeing as those did not work for either previous PCR reaction.  Discovered that the primers were, in fact, correct.
Note that one guide for PCR (http://www.fermentas.com/profiles/modifyingenzymes/pdf/protocols/protocolhotstart.pdf) recommends a concentration of 2 mM MgCl2 if one uses 0.2 mM dNTP to maximize PCR output.  Since 1 uL of 10 mM dNTP solution in 50 uL gives 0.2 mM dNTP, one should thus consider using 4 uL of 25 mM MgCl2 to yield a 2 mM concentration.
Will do PCR tomorrow using this information.

Regulation for Capsular Synthesis (RCS) Phosphorelay System
RcsB is a transcription factor that forms part of a phosphorelay system. As the name suggests, a phosphorelay system consists of a series of nodes down which a phosphate group is passed. The transfer of this phosphate group down along the Rcs relay system is initiated by membrane stress. Once the phosphate group has been passed to RcsB, it can bind to DNA and act as a transcription factor. Phosphorylated RcsB is thought to regulate ~5% of the E.coli genome 4.
The Rcs phosphorelay is composed of two membrane-anchored proteins, RcsC and RcsD, and a cytoplasmic protein, RcsB. In response to a signal, the sensor kinase RcsC autophosphorylates and the phosphoryl group is transferred to RcsB, via RcsD. RcsB can both homodimerise and heterodimerise with RcsA, these two complexes serve to regulate different operons.
Signal Amplification:
RcsB is able to heterodimerise with the protein RcsA. The RcsB+RcsA complex acts as a transcription factor that induces the expression of a number of genes. One of these genes codes for RcsA, this initiates a positive feedback loop.
Colanic Acid Biosynthesis:
The overexpression of RcsB is akin to fitting a stethoscope to the end of a megaphone. In essence, the sensitivity of the RCS Phosphorelay system becomes such that the smallest of"

Different Phylogenetic Methods Yield Different Clades
We extrapolated the evolutionary relationships between the species using 1) Feature Frequency Profile comparisons, 2) 16S rRNA alignments, and 3) Mauve genome alignment, but each method yielded an alternative result.
By sequencing more species in this family, we hypothesize that Inclusion of a larger set of sequenced species in the genera may elucidate new and more reliable information about their origins and cladistics.

Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html," with the knowledge and ability to thrive in their research and entrepreneurial careers.”
The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the free business training provided by Community Futures across Southern Alberta. Finalists were chosen from 24 groups that submitted business plans for the challenge.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
“Hormones – and hormone imbalances -- play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,” Ward said.
“We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.”
The team’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said.
“iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”
Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly’s father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.
At an event held on Wednesday, June 12 in Lethbridge the Community Futures Lethbridge Region hosted an event that acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.
Lethbridge-based Ladybug Arborists took first place, while Strathmore business Kindred Companions and Lifesavers Designated Driving (Lethbridge) shared the runner-up awards.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

iGEM: As someone with extensive experience using anti-microbial peptides to target industry needs, what are some challenges with bringing an AMP-based solution to market?
CL: First, a lot of work has been done in this area.  This means there are many papers and patents on attaching AmPs to surfaces. Two additional challenges are costs and FDA regulations. Another issue is the stability of your material, both for shipping and application.
We founded SteriCoat (now Semprus BioSciences) to explore the biomedical applications of AMPs. We were thinking we could coat devices covalently with AMPS, and reduce risk for catheter infections. However, we ended up turning to a totally different technological solution. The regulatory path drives a great deal of your timeline, risk, and funding requirements.  Incorporating an agent that the FDA may consider an active agent would raise the burden for the company.  Whether or not this decision is made by the FDA or whether or not this is the correct decision, this raises your risk.  We pursued a totally synthetic chemistry that was less likely to be viewed as ""active"".
We had overcome many challenges with the AMPs themselves along the way. My PhD project was AMP design and application. We initially were looking at creating in vitro translation systems to avoid killing cells. I worked in a metabolic engineering lab, and we did microbial screens too. Early in my PhD years, we had a computational tool for AMP design, and we wanted to screen a bunch of them. The problem is that it kills off your bugs. Can you grow it with an inactive form, or use an excretion tag? Can we use a bug that isn't targeted by the AMP? The cleverest thing we found was designing them to be expressed with an inducer. We used parallel stamps, one with an inducer, one without, and we looked at the zone of inhibition. Basically, we used replica plating to identify the most efficient producers of AMP.
Then, chemical synthesis of AMPs became really inexpensive! You could look into proteins that are difficult to synthesize in-vitro, for example defensins, and there are databases of these.
iGEM: How did you decide to become an entrepreneur?
CL: I came into grad school wanting to do something entrepreneurial in the Langer lab and really make something happen. What really got me going was when we started to get good results, Langer put me in touch with David Lucchino at"

Mechanism of NtrC/B system
Mechanism"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," started forming coacervates following Aumiller et al. 2016 . They use “long” polymers of uracil (polyU) in combination with spermine, a small positively charged polyamine, to form coacervates. PolyU/spermine coacervates were formed with 0.1 wt% polyU and various spermine concentrations. The absorbance of 500 nm light was measured by UV/Vis spectrophotometry. The results are shown in Figure 19. An interesting observation that follows from these measurements is that there is an optimum of spermine in between 0.1 and 1.0 wt%. This is counterintuitive, as it is hard to imagine that addition of more spermine actually decreases the amount of coacervates. However, this is perfectly in line with theoretical considerations as we explain in the coacervate modelling page.
Figure 19: Absorbance of polyU/spermine coacervate solutions. Barplot shows the absorbance (500 nm light) of coacervate solutions containing varying amounts of spermine and a fixed (0.1 wt%) polyU concentrations. The result indicates that there is an optimum and that addition of more spermine after 1 wt% in fact decreases the overall turbidity. This result, although counterintuitive, is predicted by theoretical models of coacervates. Error bars indicate standard deviation from the mean of three measurements.
Proof of the coacervation method with RNase A
With coacervates formed, the next step was to test the coacervation method for an unspecific RNase to give a proof of principle. This RNase would eventually be substituted by Cas13a. Besides the proof of principle, the experiments with non-specific RNase (RNase A) would already give us information on timescales, concentrations and methods of measurement. In Figure 20 two tubes are shown, both containing polyU and spermine. To the left tube, RNase A is added. There is clear difference in turbidity between the two tubes, proving that coacervates do not form in the presence of RNase A.
Now that we were able to prove that RNase can inhibit the formation of coacervates, we did an RNase A titration to determine from which concentration of RNase A the formation of coacervates is inhibited. The results are shown in Figure 21. From these results we can conclude that the formation of coacervates is inhibited above an RNase A concentration of 10-4 wt%"

Part: BBa_F2620
BBa_F2620
Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged ("

We can mutate genes related to pathogenicity and leave the genes we want to use in function. When the pathogenicity of some parts, devices or systems can't be eliminated, we can add more control systems(ex. on/off systems)to control those genes not performed in most conditions or let those genes only performed in less ""special"" circumstances or enviroments.
Maybe if possible, we can also create some kinds of loops to degenerate the proteins associated with the pathogenicity.

Took third fraction at this point (F2)
I did not go to great lengths to get an even  suspension here, but I noticed in retrospect that the protocol emphasized the importance of this in order to get pure inclusion bodies.
Add dry lysozyme to final concentration of 200 ug / ml
For 12.5 ml solution I added around 2.5 mg of lysozyme
I did not add any DNAse because it was not mentioned on the manufacturer's protocol, but in the future I will try adding 1 ul of DNAse at this point because chromosomal DNA might have been a problem in subsequent steps.
Add 6 volumes of 1:10 diluted bugbuster (.1X)
At this point we split the solution up into two 50 ml falcon tubes and added 37.5 ml of .1X bugbuster to each tube
Centrifuge 16000g 15 min. 4 degrees C to collect inclusion bodies.
Remove supernatant w/ pipett, take next fraction (S3)
After spinning this down, there was a pellet, with an opaque and viscous substance. (Im guessing it might be chromosomal DNA)

Clotho mySQL Configuration
The mySQL configuration manager allows the user to:
Connect to mySQL databases.
Manage the connections that they have made (set the connections as the ""active connection"" or deleting connections).
Load and Save the current configurations.
Load and Set the default configuration.
Set the primary identification used by the parts navigator to display and organize parts.
mySQL/PoBoL Configuration Manager
Clotho mySQL/PoBoL Configuration Manager
The mySQL/PoBoL configuration manager allows the user to connect to a mySQL database with the intention of binding tables and fields in that database to the Clotho Internal Data Structure. It has the following features:
Ability to create new connections and manage a collection of connections (e.g. set default connection, connect to a particular connection, and delete connections).
Ability to view the binding file for a particular connection.
Ability to view the currently active connection.
PoBoL Binding Manager
Clotho PoBoL Binding Manager
The PoBoL binding manager creates a binding file for each connection created by the mySQL/PoBoL connection interface. A binding file creates a correspondence between a table in a database and a Clotho Data Structure Object. For example table Parts in a generic database may be bound to the Clotho Data Structure object BioBricks. In addition it creates a correspondence between fields in a table and Clotho Data Structure fields belonging to object. For example table Parts->Data may correspond to BioBrick->Sequence. In order to create this binding the binding managers supports:
The ability to view the host, database, and port associated with a connection.
The user can assign database tables to Clotho Data Objects and database table fields to Clotho Data Fields.
Automatically recognizes database references and prompts the user to their existence. This allows hierarchy in the database.
The user can directly modify the binding file if the automatic methods are not sufficient for their needs.
Save and connect support for the binding file being created.

1 M1 Genetic Circuit
1.1 Initiation
1.2 Polypeptide Production
1.3 Module 1: Enzyme Production
M1 Genetic Circuit
Initiation
The module has been put under the control of an inducible promoter. Under normal circumstances the promoter is repressed by the presence of LacI protein, which stops the RNA polymerase from transcribing [ref]. When IPTG is introduced, it binds to the LacI protein and it changes its conformation, preventing it to bind to the promoter. This lifts the repression [ref here] and allows the downstream genes to be transcribed.
Polypeptide Production
Engineering The E.ncapsulator to produce proteins is quite simple. DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is in turn translated into protein. By knowing the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of interest and working backwards, this can be converted into a DNA sequence coding for production of the protein. In our case this has been developed further by optimising the DNA sequence for Escherichia Coli. By combining this coding sequence the other necessary genetic components, we engineer the chassis to manufacture the protein.
This is the genetic circuit responsible protein drug fabrication (Module 1).
LacI is produced constitutively by the E. coli bacterium, and it represses the pLambda promoter. This inhibits production of the proteins of interest (PAH and cellulase).
To start the drug manufacturing process, IPTG is pipetted into the system. IPTG will repress LacI. As a result, protein production is de-repressed. Then, the enzymes PAH or cellulase will be produced by the E.ncapsulator.

Cyano Promoters and integration vector for Synechocystis from iGEM Utah State received. Promoters/integration vector in pSB1C3 used to transform E. Coli. Cultures streaked and grown overnight. Colonies selected from streaked plates, liquid cultures grown overnight. Liquid cultures miniprepped to isolate plasmids. Digestion using EcoR1 and Pst1 performed on each of isolated plasmids including INV ang GLF, gels run and imaged. LB with 30% glycerol stock prepared for freezing of E. Coli.  An apparatus for growing Synechocystis was prepared using a flask and glass tubing connected to an aquarium pump to aerate the culture. Synechocystis was grown in a photobioreactor for four days, and the OD730 was measured once a day to determine growth. Synechocystis was grown in BG-11 medium with either 0% glucose or 50 mM glucose. Over four days, the OD730 did not change for either type of culture. This indicates that the Synechocystis did not grow, and that modifications to the growth apparatus are necessary. A larger volume of culture is necessary, as well as a humidifying device.
Hexokinase coupled assay used to quantitate amounts of cyanobacteria glucose secretion.  Rxn: 1. glucose + ATP --Hx-> G-6-P + ADP      2. G-6-P + NAD+ --G-6-PDeH-> G-6-P + NADH Reaction used Glucose assay kit (Genzyme) containing 2000U/L Hexokinase reagent and 4000U/L G-6-P DeH and measured  glucose concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm. Results: Final NADH concentrations were determined using the molar extinction coefficient and were proportionate to intial glucose concentrations.

Introduction
With the rapid society development, a large amount of pollutants are full of our daily life. Nowadays, chemical materials are widely used in our surroundings indoor, such as building materials, paint in new apartments, artificial adhesives in numerous household products and etc, which may lead to excess release of formaldehyde in closed space. Exposing to the substantial formaldehyde may cause irritation, allergic asthma and neurasthenia, as well as carcinogenesis. Nowadays, people mainly get rid of the formaldehyde by increasing the rate of ventilating or using air purifier in those polluted spaces. However, these methods show some limitation, and cannot degrade formaldehyde safely and effectively.
To get the inspiration for the design of our project, we did a survey of the knowledge concerning formaldehyde pollution. The results showed that people paid high attention to the indoor formaldehyde pollution, and preferred to adopt a safe and environmental friendly method to decrease the concentration of formaldehyde effectively. A methodology by using green plants got the highest score among all provided approaches. Based on the results of this survey, we decided to use synthetic biology strategy to design a super plant that can remove formaldehyde safely and effectively.
After doing sufficient literature research, we got to know that there is a formaldehyde-fixation pathway in methylotrophs which is called ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway. HPS and PHI are the two key enzymes in this pathway. Besides, there is a formaldehyde folate-independent pathway in some certain plant species. FALDH and FDH play an important role in this pathway. In our 2014 iGEM project, these two pathways were integrated through the methodology of synthetic biology. For this, formaldehyde metabolism related genes from both methylotrophs and plants were transferred into tobacco to rebuild a new formaldehyde metabolism pathway in our super plant.

iGEM rocks so badly, when you do it once, you just wanna do it again :)
But this year, I'm keeping a low profile, just helping out the newbies to settle in and feel comfy in the lab. I'm still enjoying working around bacteria, apart from B. subtilis producing lysostaphin, because it smells so badly you just wanna die when you happen to be working in the same room!
I also like playing volleyball, cooking, baking, eating and above all traveling and meeting new people ^^ See y'all at the Jamboree!
Bastien Doix
I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon and taking part in iGEM for the first time. I am joining the iGEM team to have a first sight of what genetics and bacterial manipulation is and to step into something different from studies. I like sports, skiing and computer graphics and hope to make it to Boston.
Alexandre Duprey
This year, I’m back for another iGEM competition. I’m still at INSA Lyon, fourth-year biochemistry and biotechnology, and still interested in how we can regulate parts to make them work together. However this time I’m rather advising on the project with the intent to improve our weak points (who said modelling ?), and making sure the newcomers don’t make (too many) mistakes. Otherwise I play video games. A lot. Too much...
Patricia Gifu
I am an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA de Lyon. This year, I participate for the first time in iGEM.  I am very confident that INSA Lyon team is going to win because the team members worked very hard on the project and they all are skillful. I am passionate by biosciences. Outside the school I like watching movies and traveling whenever I have time.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Human practices#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"otrophs. The cyanobacteria produce sugars and oxygen from CO2 , water and light; known as photosynthesis. In their prototype consortium the sugars are used as a carbon source for, E.coli, which uses it to create a desired end-product. In their proof-of-concept bio-factory this product will be isobutanol, a potential biofuel. That said, their cyanobacterial carbon fixation module can be coupled to a multitude of biotechnological production processes to make these processes more sustainable. Using TU Delft’s 3D printer could improve both the reproducibility and specificity of a biofilm-based consortium. The 3D printer would, for example, be able to print a layer of cyanobacteria in between two layers of E.coli to create specific patterns that optimize carbon sharing and product formation in Amsterdam’s consortium.
The Bio-composite Leaf,
Besides potentially optimizing the productivity of  Amsterdam’s consortium in a bioreactor, accurately printing biofilms allows for a whole range of novel consortia applications. One of these is the so-called ‘bio-composite leaf’, an approach described by Bernal et al. as ‘[an] approach to improve solar energy harvesting capacity [by] fabricating inexpensive water- based ‘‘cellular biocomposite’’ materials that mimic or exceed the function and stability of natural plant leaves by ordering layers of closely packed living photosynthetic cells on a surface with a non-toxic adhesive polymer binder’ (2014). Such multilayered composites of densely packed cells could significantly improve the low light harvesting capacity of cyanobacteria commonly observed in photobioreactors.
Re-invented
Packing cyanobacterial cells together without losing photosynthetic capacity poses a scientific challenge. The most successful method used to date exploits adhesive colloidal polymer particles that bind the cyanobacteria to a leaf that consists of porous paper, which hydrates the cell coating via the fluid in the paper pores below the coating [figure 1]. Although this approach generates high photosynthetic rates, creating the latex coating is a time-consuming, complex process that has not been optimised for uniformity of the coating. A standardised, relatively simple process for creating such coatings could not only overcome these problems, but could ultimately enable the mass-production of bio-composite leaves for high-yield sustainable bioproduction.
A new approach
That’s where TU Delft’s 3D-printer for biofilms comes in. By using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the"

What is TiMI?
This year we continued our tradition of the Transcontinental iGEM Macquarie Internship (TiMI). This program was introduced in 2015 and has the goal of forming a unique team by integrating students from around the globe. TiMI benefits both the international student and the Macquarie team by broadening our skill base whilst giving practical experience to international students who may not have their own opportunity to experience iGEM. Equipped with their iGEM experience, TiMI interns are able to promote iGEM within their own institutions. Not only does this benefit both our team and the intern, it often results in long lasting international collaborations.
2016 Intern
Clément Pealat
Clément Pealat contacted our team this year, excited by the prospect of working with an iGEM team here in Sydney. Clément is a student from the university École Centrale de Lille, France, where he studies meta-genomics. Upon arrival in Australia it was his first experience with synthetic biology, however, his background in modelling, mathematics and lab experience proved to be a valuable asset to us this year. He played a crucial role in providing the foundations of our ALA to Chlorophyll model. He arrived in May and got straight to work; attending our winter session break bootcamp. Here he learnt the fundamentals of DNA, and was introduced to the basics of synthetic biology. A hard worker, he managed to prepare the model before our team assembled in early August, setting us up for a smooth start, as we were already entering the competition at a late stage.
Whilst here, Clément visited Uluru and explored our coastline and “absolutely loved it”. Heading back to France, Clément will use his iGEM experience as a foundation for his future scientific endeavours, and hopes to apply what he has learned in his future career.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," the input relations     based on promoters and the output products based on the functional genes     and RNAs which are included within the parts. Working condition simply     describes any influencing factor or circumstance which is directly related     with the functional properties of parts.
Third part of our standardization template includes parameters of     contingent input and output elements. These parameters are classified     into two groups for simplicity as presented on Table 3. This final part     of the standardization template includes the upmost important information     about the Biobricks that are required for the BioGuide Software to run     its searching algorithm.
Briefly, BioGuide application is designed to catch the input and     output relations of individual parts to examine possible Biobricks pathways     for specific input and output queries. In other words, at pre-experimental     stage, it helps wet lab biologists to design their unique constructs     by revealing possible alternative options for pre-determined purposes,     along with the primary paths. Our ultimate goal is to improve the algorithm     designed for iGEM 2010 and present a new version of the BioGuide in     iGEM 2011, which will provide optimum design of constructs for predetermined     parameters.
Most of the parts are composed of functional and nonfunctional constructs     which are formed by atomic parts. And every part should carry the information     for all of its atomic parts within itself. The “input” heading actually     stands for promoters. Parts with one or more promoters can be found     at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Along with the information on which and how     many promoters a part might have, the activity level of promoters are     also important to distinguish between a constitutively active promoter     or a promoter activated by specific physiological processes or states     etc. This information was crucial for us to dissect in order to run     our algorithm as it directly affects which inputs can activate the devices     or the systems.
Throughout our investigations on the Parts Registry, we found out     that much of the terminology was being used ambiguously. Although this     might not be vital for synthetic biologists, it is still endeavoring     to understand the function of certain regulatory elements which also     becomes a time consuming task for the researcher. Thus, we recommend     that the explanations of certain regulatory elements should be redefined     and fixed especially for synthetic biology for easy communication, sharing     and searching of information.
Common misuses of the terminology can guide us to figure out how     to construct a standard nomenclature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all,"
