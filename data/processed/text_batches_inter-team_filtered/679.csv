Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". They characterized one of our quorum sensing plasmids and checked the amounts of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) to be added to achieve a certain amount of lysis. Moreover we also supplied them with n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine-lactone, a quorum sensing molecule that they required and were not able to synthesize themselves.
We were really happy to hear, that the AHL has helped them in characterizing their system. It was able to induce at least one of their systems (Figure 1), showing that their iGEM project cannot only be used to test biological, but also chemical cross talk.  Moreover they also tested one of our constructs, which we sent as well with the AHL molecule. They found out, that with concentrations of AHL from
0 mM
to
10-4 mM
of AHL, barely a difference compared to the corresponding control was visible. This data is consistent with our findings, which show that a minimum concentration of
0.05 mM
AHL was necessary to present a visual difference between the uninduced variant.
With this we did not only assist a team to characterize a system, by supplying them with a missing molecule, but they also have supported us a lot, by confirming our achieved findings.
Manchester
iGEM Manchester is working on the characterization of different promoters this year. They are creating an assembly of various promoters and asked us to add our promoter to their library. For this purpose we sent them the sequences of all of our synthesized promoters, mostly quorum sensing promoters, and therefore successfully achieved a further collaboration.  We were really glad to have successfully collaborated with another team as well. Within a few weeks, they have generated an optimized version of our promoter sequences, by designing the promoter once with decreased and once with an increased activity. They did so by running each sequences through an online algorithm which predicted the -10 and -35 region of each promoter. Then they identified regions in our promoters that would benefit from a point substitution and recorded the likely change in activity associated with the sum of these changes via MatLab.  Below you can find an overview with the optimized sequences. The parts that we sent in and are optimized are signalized in yellow. In green are the sequences optimized for increased activity and in red are the sequences optimized for decreased activity.

3D Printing:
Through our collaboration with Cesar Rodriguez, a Senior Research Scientist in the Bio/Nano/Programmable Matter group at Autodesk, we have been able to expand our spatial modelling beyond the computer screen. He and his team have offered us access to the 3D printing services at Autodesk to make a tangible model of our molecules based off our Maya simulations. This has allowed our team to get a feel for the shape of our proteins, aiding the design of our prototype, linkers, and the system as a whole.

( Click here to download an interview draft with a expert from Chuzhou cigarette factory. )
4.Develop a downstream production line for the tobacco industry.
After factory investigation and talks with experts, we learned more about tobacco waste and industrial tobacco waste treatment systems. We firstly find out that we can use nicotine in tobacco waste to produce drugs, instead of using prue nicotine. Secondly, we know that the tobacco industry already had some mature methods for recycling some tobacco waste, except tobacco dusts, which are just treated by burning . With the determinnation to make good use of tobacco dusts, with huge potential use value and high levels of out put, our project is trying to develop a downstream production line for the tobacco industry to produce drugs.
Questionnaire
This year we are devoted to turning tobacco waste into drugs. Because China has the largest group of smokers and the largest industrial scale in the world, tobacco-related issues have always been a hot topic in society. Naturally, we want to collect the community’s views about tobacco. Meanwhile,For the purpose of propagating iGEM synthetic biology, we designed a questionnaire. We have collected 337 samples at all, with absolutely reliable data to analysis and come to conclusions eventually. The final result is very interesting and quite helpful for our topic.
1.Respondents
Because of the huge influence of the tobacco industry in China, we believe that everyone can speak for this topic! Our survey also truly covers people from different occupations, ages and academic backgrounds. The final result shows that the proportion of people of all ages and social backgrounds is normal with no excessive imbalance. Therefore, the data is absolutely valid. For tobacco industry related issues, adults over the age of 30 tend to be more discreet, but young people's ideas also represent emerging ideas, which will produce very interesting results.
2. The Knowledge Of Nicotine
This data makes us feel very surprised, there are happiness and regrets. First of all, almost everyone knows the existence of nicotine in tobacco. More than 58% of adults know that they can use nicotine to produce drugs. This is a great encouragement for us. Our subject can be widely accepted andunderstood by society. Unfortunately, there are very few people who know the potential of nicotine drugs among minors, but that is exactly why we are constantly promoting.

✓ Collaboration
We have helped different iGEM teams during the summer: Uppsala iGEM , UNIK_Copenhagen , SDU-Denmark . For more information please see our collaborations page.
✓ Human Practices
We sure went beyond the lab bench during this project. Our biggest achievement was the launch of the Biosensor project , a platform for allowing over 200 high schools nationwide to work with synthetic biology. We also held a meet-up for other iGEM teams, presented our project at different events and got media coverage. Please see our practices page for elaboration.
Gold
✓ Integrated Human Practices
Throughout our project we have been in close contact and collaboration with the industry. We started out searching for abundant waste streams in Denmark by contacting and visiting local factories, we then presented our idea to biotech manufacturing companies and all together the feedback made us more aware of the challenges our technology is facing. This ultimately led us to a more feasible product. Please see the Integrated practice page for elaboration.
✓ Improve a previous part
We have improved the two BioBricks; BBa_K530001 (crtE) and BBa_K530002 (crtI) created by the John Hopkins iGEM team 2011. We used site directed mutagenesis to successfully remove two illegal restriction sites and we furthermore improved the characterization. Please see the parts page for elaboration.
✓ Proof of concept
We successfully designed a functional plasmid ( pSBB1A8YL ) for transformation and replication in both Escherichia coli and Y. lipolytica. pSBB1A8YL is also compatible with the BioBrick standard by assembly with our own BioBrick device BBa_K2117005 . This was proved by showing that we could utilize the construct in Y. lipolytica to express a heterologous protein, hrGFP. Please see the proof of concept page for elaboration.

The plurality of the group seems to act like professional risk managers. 39% would commission more research to find the right answer to any risks. In the case of virtual risks (culturally constructed risks, when science is inconclusive and people argue from pre-established beliefs and prejudices) this can be very uncomfortable.
The other-answers:
One remarkably statement asks ""Who guarantees that nature is safe?"". Moreover, it is asserted that there is nothing special about humans ""interfering"" with nature. It happens all the time, humans just modify their environment to a much more extreme degree than any other species.
A comparison is made between risks related to research in molecular biology and dangerous that are already occurring. Synthetic biology does not pose as a great threat compared to e.g. plastic waist in the oceans.
The answers on this topic are highly diverse, but the group is generally careful. Only 7% can be described as optimistic and fearless, whereas the plurality (39%) would conduct more research to minimize risks before the actual project starts.
Graph 10.
10. (see previous question) How do you think the public percieves this?
If you cannot prove that these new technologies are safe assume they are dangerous
If you cannot prove that these new technologies are dangerous assume they are safe
If this technology really tends to get out of hand researchers should react, otherwise there is nothing to do about it
Researchers should minimize the risk before doing the actual research
Other:
This is again a double perception question, where the synthetic biology community is asked for their perception on the opinion of general public. When compared to the previous question, there is a big difference. The minority thinks that the public is much more fearful and risk-averse than researchers are. They believe that the public first wants proof that a certain project is safe, before pursuing any goals. 21% thinks that the public has more faith in researchers and assume that minimizing the risks before hand is good enough for doing the actual research.
The other-answers:
Only few took the liberty to give an open-answer, mostly illustrating the influence and importance of communication between researchers and the public on risk assessment.
One answer aims at influencing the public, stating: ""how would you like the public to percieve this?""
Life, beliefs and opinions
The following are a set of questions that should indicate how the synthetic biology community thinks about life, what values they give to it, what it means to them, and to what extend it can be explained (reduced) in terms of physics. To a certain extend, these questions should make the reader aware that they are"

Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR. No contamination is observed in the negative control without template DNA. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Regarding our TALE expression and characterization, we did a mini expression of TALE A , TALE B , β-lactamase, BBa_J04500 , and RFP .  We also did a trial run to determine the optimum time point and IPTG concentration.  We subcultured our overnight cultures of TALE A , TALE B , the positive control RFP and the negative control BBa_J04500 . For each pellet and supernatant, we had 3 time points of 3 hours, 6.5 hours, and 24 hours and 3 IPTG concentrations of 0.1mM, 0.4mM, and 0.8mM for a total of 72 samples on 8 SDS page gels. Our results indicate that the optimum IPTG concentration is 4mM and 8mM IPTG and induction time of 3 hours and 6.5 hours.  A subsequent SDS page gel was run with TALE A , TALE B , β-lactamase, BBa_J04500 , and RFP .

Week 18: August 26 - August 30
We did a colony PCR of construct 9 ( pSBIC3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +Link+K coil), construct 10 ( pSBIC3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +Link+K coil), and the TALE target sequences which were transformed over the weekend. The PCR products were run on a gel, the colonies with the bands of the right size were made into overnight cultures and miniprepped. The gel of the verification digests did not have any bands and the overnight cultures were repeated with good results (Figure 26). Construct 9, construct 10, and the TALE target sequences were sent for sequencing.

The only VEGF-scFv in iGEM parts collection (BBa_K1694003) has no known structure, so we found ourselves another one with experimental structure (PDB ID: 2FJF & 2FJG, Figure 2) (BBa_K2886002). We then add a signal sequence to it as well as a transmembrane linker (BBa_K2886000) to help it appropriately locate on the cell membrane. In addition to that, we want to test another receptor, which is the binding domains of a natural VEGF receptor, the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR). We cloned the two IG-like domains of it (BBa_K2886003) to the extracellular domain to test its efficiency. By making use of fragment from endogenous receptors, we hope to achieve the goal to reduce the possible immunological rejection while keep the orthogonality of STEP system at the same time.
Figure 2. Crystal structure of VEGF Fab in complex with VEGF, PDB ID: 2FJG.
For D-Dimer, we were only able to find a MA-15C5 scFv of it. So we simply attach it to the TC and PC chains and test the whole system.
To see if the STEP system works and to optimise it, we have to fully test it in vivo. Considering the practicability, we decide to use human HEK293T and HeLa cell line as our chassis. These two cell lines have the advantage of handleability and effectiveness and with them we are able to carry out our experiments with ease and reliability.     The first thing we need to confirm is that our extracellular domain works, or more specifically, that the two chains can correctly locate on the cell membrane and that they can bind when target ligand is added. To that end we design a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) test. We remove the intracellular domains of both chains completely and instead attached the N- and C-terminal of a split ECFP (BBa_K2886004 & BBa_K2886005) respectively. It means that if the receptors are expressed on the membrane and can efficiently bind to the ligand, we’ll observe the fluorescent signal after induction. We took the ECFP from a previous part (BBa_E0020) and split it at the A155 site and use the addition of le"

Previous work done by others
Previous work realize the plasmid maintenance                                 through making the plasmid encode essential factors for the host.
Resistance screening and auxotrophic bacteria are depended on the selecting process [1].                                 The plasmid-free bacteria cannot survive under specific selections, such as antibiotics.                                 However, it’s not applicable for industrial fermentation. What’s worse, the unlimited                                 use of antibiotics has raised worldwide concern due to its potential risk which may cause antibiotic resistance,                                 degrade the capacity of the immune system and finally develop to a big social problem.
According to the natural mechanisms for plasmid maintenance, many new strategies are                                 developed, so called plasmid addiction system (PAS) or post-segregational killing                                 system (PSK) [2]. However, these mechanisms are still under exploration and the                                 capacity of plasmid maintenance is not ideal since most of them can only ensure                                  one plasmid remains, can’t truly realize the quantitative control as we hope.
What’s the difference
 Quantitative control
Most existing methods for enhancing biosynthetic performance are stuck                                 at the level of resistance screening or rely on natural mechanisms                                 for plasmid maintenance. These methods have the same problem: there is                                 no clear definition for high- and low-performance variants, or said differently,                                 those methods can’t define a number or a range as the threshold of plasmids’ concentration.
In our project, we can not only set a threshold to control the number of plasmids, but also                                 regulate it as we need by using the different biobricks. That is what we say—quantitative control.
 No human intervention
There is a step called spawn rejuvenation in the existing large-scale                                 industrial production procedure.                                 It’s useful to maintain the microbial population structure, but costs plenty of time and money.
Our design has great potential to simplify the process of spawn rejuvenation                                 as well as increase the profit for companies. We use an intracellular signal                                 correlated with the plasmid numbers, and realize the selection process without                                 any human interference. Through keeping the plasmid numbers above a threshold,                                 we can realize the population quality control and improve the production efficiency.
 No antibiotics
As we know, the employed antibiotics must be removed in pharmaceutical or GMP-based fermentation                                 processes and it’s not an applicable option in industrial fermentation.
As an antibiotics-free project, we can improve the previous approaches by                                 making the process of plasmid-control more environment-friendly.

Here, GFP expression is taken as an example to demonstrate this approach.
We constructed NO Sensing Module to detect the existence of Nitric Oxide (Figure 7). The nitric oxide released by SNP can mimic the pathologically high rectal NO concentration in the inflammatory regions in IBD.
Figure 7. The constructed NO (Nitric Oxide) Sensing Module. The vector is pETduet-1, on which we replaced one of two T7 promoters with the promoter pNorV, and the downstream is GFP. The NorR protein production is under IPTG induction, so we could control the module more accurately.
So, the GFP expression can be induced in the presence of nitric oxide (released by SNP) and IPTG (to control the production of NorR protein as shown in Figure 7). We tested this NO Sensing Module with fluorescence microscope and got a positive result (Figure 8).
Figure 8. The NO Sensing Module pictures of fluorescence microscope. The SNP was added to the final concentration of 100 μM (a), 10 mM (b) and (c), together with IPTG. Neither SNP nor IPTG was not added to the control group (d).
Most E.coli (50.1%) expressed GFP in 100 μM SNP-LB culture (Figure 8a), in which the nitric oxide concentration was close to the rectal nitric oxide concentration (5.5mM) in IBD (Figure 4), 8 hours after SNP is added. In contrast, only 2.5% E.coli expressed GFP without SNP (Figure 8c), which may be leaky IPTG induced expression. We noticed that the growth of E.coli and GFP expression were suppressed in 10 mM SNP-LB culture (Figure 8b), in which SNP showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on the cell and only 5.8% E.coli expressed GFP[6]. In short, GFP expressing NO Sensing Module works.
Our experiment proved the practicability of NO Sensing Module in vitro, where GFP is a demo for EGF expression. This approach can be applied to many diseases like IBD, to detect the inflammatory regions and then express therapeutic peptides (i.e. EGF peptides) that can promote the recovery of the disease.

Reagents:
1. Sorbitol 1M
Steps:
1. Grow bacteria (Escherichia coli) to log phase (OD 0.4-0.6).
2. Aliquot 1mL of culture to a 1.5mL tube. Make as many aliquots as you need for the number of plasmids you need to transform.
3. Centrifuge aliquots at 12,000g for 1 minute.
4. Remove media and wash with 0.33 volumes (330μL) of 1M sorbitol.
5. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 1 minute.
6. Remove wash and resuspend in 0.05 volumes (40μL) 1M sorbitol.
7. Place tubes in ice and use within 15 minutes.
8. Add plasmid DNA to the tube.
9. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
10. Electroporate at 1.900V.
11. Flush cuvette gently with 500ul of LB broth.
12. Allow to recover for 1-2 hrs at 37°C, shake at 200rpm.
13. Spin down cells briefly, pour off most of supernatant, gently resuspend cells and plate.
14. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 12-14 hours.
Freezing these cells for later use is not recommended. Even with storage at -80°C, subsequent transformations often fail.

Colonizing Mars
Report by Frida Kampp, Matthew Romang, Melissa Emilie McGrail
On behalf of iGEM teams PharMARSy, Project Perchlorate, Hyphae Hackers
Abstract
This report examines the reasons for colonising Mars and the potential risk of contamination colonization may cause. It analysis the reasons for colonization from a historical and a rhetorical perspective, and discusses the potential risk of contamination from a bioethical perspective. In the historical analysis it is concluded that the major historical reasons for exploration of space and colonization of land on earth has been demonstration of power and eagerness to explore new land, however support from the public seems to play an important role in motivating such decisions. The main conclusion in the rhetorical analysis of argumentation in the public debate is that there are major arguments against colonizing Mars right now, that the average world citizen is likely to take into consideration. In the discussion of potential risk of contamination, it is concluded that that the risk is rather small due to extensive sterilization procedures and that it is considered unlikely that any bacteria coming from humans would be able to survive in a martian environment and thereby contaminate Mars.
Introduction
This report is a collaboration between the three iGem teams PharMARSy, Hyphae Hackers, and Project Perchlorate representing respectively the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, and University of Exeter.
In this report, we examine the reasons for humanity to colonize Mars and the potential risks it may cause. We are approaching the question historically, rhetorically and ethically in order to look at the subject from different angles and gain insight into the motivation for wanting to colonize Mars. We will do this in three subparts.
Part 1
First, we will investigate the historical reasons behind both exploring space by manned missions and colonization of land on Earth. We find the historical angle relevant in order to get a nuanced view of how the"

How the solenoids are switched between ground and 24 V by the relays. Only shown for four relays; our setup has twelve connected identically.
The EasyDAQ: 24 USB-controlled relays. The relays are connected to the PCB just by wires fixed in the screw-in headers.
Complete parts list
All the parts used for the pneumatics, with approximate cost in Swiss francs, are listed below. The microscope is an additional cost, but most labs would have one already. The Mac Pro is a lone from EPFL's Biomedical Imaging Group, and the Thinkpad is an oldie that was lying around.
Savings could be made on the pressure regulators, on the valves, and on the EasyDAQ - most setups are better off with manual valves anyway.

DESCRIPTION
OUR JOURNEY
Working with water purification has always been our primary goal throughout this season. In light of goal six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, universal access to clean water and sanitation, we began by tackling the most prevalent water-related issue around the world—the lack of fresh potable water. To solve this problem, we developed our system, which we named ""Ctrl-Salt-Del"", with the purpose of desalinating seawater by sequestering sodium ions. However, with some initial calculations, we determined that the concentration of sodium ions in seawater is higher than what our system could possibly handle. The concentration of sodium chloride in seawater is 0.6 M, while the maximum acceptable concentration for human consumption is 3.4 mM, or 0.0034 M. Going from 0.6 M to 3.4 mM is a 95% reduction rate that requires the removal of literally billions upon billions of salt particles per liter of water, which is well beyond the estimated capacity of our system.
Understanding the challenges of large-scale purification, we pivoted and took a less ambitious path — municipal wastewater treatment. We toured the Lethbridge Wastewater Treatment Plant and interviewed the process coordinator, Duane Guzzi, who informed us of the possibility of integrating our system into the secondary clarifiers of the existing plant to take out heavy metals present in the wastewater (for more information on this tour and interview, click here ). By integrating our system into existing treatment plants, we can also take advantage of safety measures that are already put in place, such as ultraviolet radiation treatment, that will eliminate any surviving microorganisms potentially harmful to the environment before the treated water is released.
However, during a second interview we had with Dorothy Lok, an approvals engineer for Alberta Environment and Parks, we learned that the presence of heavy metals is not a major concern in municipal wastewater (for more information on this interview, click here ). Therefore, although the integration of our system with existing treatment plants seems highly compelling, it will not have a significant impact in the community. Ms. Lok suggested that we look into the increasingly alarming problems posed by oil extraction tailings ponds in our province.
“You would really have to have a purpose for doing it [implementing our system"

We also tested if vegetative B. subtilis cells survive the long-term storage conditions (-20°C) for spores and if they can be transformed. They grew on plain agar plates but not spectinomycin plates, which was expected since the cells were not induced with xylose and thus incompetent. In addition, we tested if incompetent B. subtilis spores could be transformed and no colonies grew on the spectinomycin plates. This was expected since the cells were not induced with xylose.

Introduction
For science to be applicable outside the confined area of a laboratory, its procedures and outcomes should be compatible with the rest of society. It is therefore important for any scientist to know what factors (public perception, corporate interests, etc.) may be important to a certain project, and how to investigate or even influence these factors. To get the hang of this, our team has undertaken multiple Human Practices projects over the course of the summer. Throughout these projects, our goals were to jointly reflect on our ideas with both the scientific world and stakeholders and, more generally, create public awareness about Synthetic Biology.
One of the first things we did as a team was trying to get more feedback about our project. Therefore, we invited all Dutch iGEM teams to present their project plans in Wageningen and have a barbecue afterwards. All teams attended, which made this mini symposium a very nice event. Also, the foundation of a national effort concerning the Discovery Festival was laid here. [Online video symposium]
To expand our communication towards the scientific world outside of either Wageningen and iGEM, we presented both our general VLP-PnAS project and The Constructor at the international CAS conference in Munich, where we received useful advice, learned a great deal about current synthetic biology projects and had a great time with other iGEM teams. [Munich CAS Conference]
We were also invited to give a presentation about our project at the international"

Take a deep consideration. What CORRELATIONS do you see from them?
Fig.2 Fantastic quratet, four researches showing interconnected scientific fantasies that contextualizes our project.
To us, they collectively mean that a whole story is currently divided into four parts, with different experts focusing on diverse issues, however laterally interconnected, or to say, interfaced, to weave a complete scientific fantasy.
Systems neuroscientists tried to develop a wireless recording module which also equips itself with multi-channel characteristics.
Neurophysiologists had the same dream on being wireless, but shifting from ""recording"" to ""inducing (stimulating)"".
Microbiologists ran into  discovering ""gut feelings"" with mind-altering bacteria living on mammalian intestinal lumen.
Finally, Cell Biologists linked the whole story in a subtle manner, providing optogenetic systems on manipulating cell signalling.
They interface with each other on concepts of being wireless, stimulative, bacterial, and light-associated. However, they provided no direct link between bacteria and optogenetics. This leaves space for us to fit in the last of the five missing puzzles.
From this point on, an ""optogenetics-facilitated neurostimulting system using wireless-controlled bacterial species as light source"" will make the whole story complete.
(3) Among The Field Of Optogenetics: From 2-D to genuine 3-D matrices
File:2D matrix stimulators.gif
In the graph shown above, neuroscientists along with electronic engineers have developed an 2-dimensional optogenetic stimulation matrix using aligned LED arrays. This has been one of the greatest frontiers in neuroscientific methodologies.
However, The completion of project ""Tailoring Your Avatar"" (i. e., optomagnetic bacteria) will enable 3-dimensional presentation of stimulation-enabling optomagnetic bacteria by use of 2-D injection matrices with deep penetration following inject-and-withdraw cycles.

Overview
The Tongji 2016 iGEM team has been focusing on nowadays treatments of tumor worldwide and how to improve the current photothermal therapy using synthetic biology. IGEM was a fabulous stage and we did a lot of human practices. For us, it was a beginning and we are going to do more in the future.
Public Education and Engagement
Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
On Aug 16, 2016, with 3 other iGEM teams, we made an exhibition at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum. During summer vocation, there are many kids visiting the museum with their parents. We introduced the iGEM competition by playing some both interesting and scientific videos to the people who visited the museum that day.
A grade 9 student even asked us some questions about synthetic biology. It’s a great opportunity to popularize scientific knowledge. More than 5000 people have seen our project, what’s more, we had a good communication with other teams about our projects! All 4 teams introduced their own projects, received some suggestions from others, and our friendship has been improved.
Teams include: NYU Shanghai, Tongji, SJTU, XJTLU
Course with No.2 Middle School Affiliated to Tongji
On Sep 30, 2016, 168 grade 10 students from No.2 Middle School Affiliated to Tongji University spent a day visiting the Tongji University campus.
In school of life science and technology, we made an exhibition of some animal and plant specimen, told the story behind the specimen. They seemed so interested in biology. Then we popularize scientific knowledge"

Although working in different organisms, the constructs were compatible, therefore we could interchange protocols for induction and preliminary results. Furthermore we gazed at their professional light induction box - we can definitely improved ours.
After cooperation with the iGEM Team Freiburg for two years in a row we are hoping to keep Freiburg as a reliable partner in the next years as well.
iGEM Team Marburg
The screensaver of iGEM@home is a great possibility to spread news and information about Synthetic Biology around the world. Lately, even other iGEM team have used this new option and filled our screensaver with slides about their own project. Marburg was able to promote their quiz app about Synthetic Biology.
A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging"

The engineering E.coli which expresses NrtA protein can catch nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) to induce algae undergoing nitrogen starvation. Due to biosafety concern, we also improved a suicide mechanism endolysin-holin and successfully constructed it. Moreover, we even grouped endolysin-holin and NrtA into a powerful part. (see more detail: Nitrogen Starvation - Functional Test)
Modeling
We established 13 models to check and predict the results of the experiments. These models are extremely important to our project! (see more detail: Modeling)
Unique and Detailed Protocols for the Public
We provided unique and detailed protocols of our experiments to the public. Students, teachers, scientists all over the world and future iGEM teams can repeat our experiments or design their own experiments with these protocols. (see more detail: Notebook - Protocols)
Sharing Genetic Engineering Technology
Chung Cheng University – Fusion PCR
In 2016, NYMU-Taipei team helped students from National Chung Cheng University to form their iGEM team. Excitedly, they are going to participate iGEM competition this year as team name “CCU_Taiwan”. In 2017, we showed them how the Photo-Bioreactor functions, taught them how to run Fusion PCR through webcam, and informed them some team operations and matters.
Taipei America School – Site Directed Mutagenesis
TAS Taipei help us by testing our holin-endolysin-NrtA construct, and we teach them how to conduct site-directed mutagenesis as well as assay biofilm production. (See more detail: Collaborations)
Assistance to Establish New iGEM Teams
We helped students in Chung Hsing University and Taipei Wego Senior High School to establish their own iGEM teams. We are looking forward to seeing them at Boston in 2018!
Experimental Technology
In addition to our comprehensive microalgae transformation platform, to achieve our goals, we also applied lots of experimental technologies. Although most of our team members are freshman in college, we tried hard to learn relatively complicated experimental methods. Moreover, we realized that, with more experimental technologies and knowledge, we can be closer to our goals and do more things for the world. Therefore, we strongly encourage future iGEM teams to explore new technologies. Deeper thinking and thrive on challenge that come along with the journey of learning are as important as the technology itself.

Module Logic
We decided to break down our device into 3 sub-devices: Reception, Emission, and Transmission. The rationale is as follows: the machinery that transforms the red input into chemical information is independent from the machinery that transforms chemical information into green output, and both are quite different from what transmits the information. Therefore, we can work with & model these six sub-devices.
Individual Modules
To learn more about the modules, here's a short description on them.
Red Reception
Description
The cyanobacterial phytochrome (Cph1) fused to the EnvZ histidine kinase domain from E.coli, makes up the chimaeric photoreceptor Cph8 constructed by Levskaya and collaborators. This photosensor requires a specific linear tetrapyrrole cofactor, phycocyanobilin (PCB), to detect red light.  This chromophore has two states, and light triggers the passage of state. Thus, under dark conditions Cph8 shows kinase activity; under light conditions it does not.
The light responsive domain (Cph1) has maximal response to light near 660nm. Cph8's substrate is OmpR, a well studied Transcription Factor. When phosphorilated it shows greater affinity for DNA. OmpR regulates two promoters in an antagonistic way: in high concentrations of active OmpR, OmpC is active and OmpF is repressed. In low concentrations of active OmpR, OmpC is repressed and OmpF is active.
We plan on constructing our reporter genes under the OmpF promoter and starting our system in a <Dark> state (where active OmpR concentration is high). Thus we hope to achieve an <IF Light> logic gate by using Cph8 as a sensing mechanism, and OmpF as a response one.
See also, Coliroid .
Signaling Cascade
When our device is struck by red light, the following cascade will ensure:
Photon input
PCB conformation change
EnvZ kinase activity abolished
Phosphorilated OmpR concentration collapse
Pops output

Welcome to the 2009 Bacterial Relay Race
In our project we aim to create a cell-to-cell communication system that allows the propagation of a multi-task message with the capability of being reset. To achieve this, the system will include a reengineered conjugation system, a time-delay genetic circuit and a self-destructive plasmid. This system could be the basis for creating a long distance biosensor and/or be applied in reducing antibiotic resistance of bacteria. Furthermore, we are working on ethical issues in synthetic biology. The survey on reductionism in synthetic biology can be found here: Survey . Your contribution would be very much appreciated.
The Project - Bacterial Relay Race
Project description
Our project is Bacterial Relay Race. As our team logo and the animation below show we want to build an improved cell to cell communication system. We choose cell to cell communication as subject because of its great importance. Cell to cell communication systems are important because most applications or tasks we set to our synthetic biological systems are generally completed by a population of cells, not a single cell. Gaining new insights at cell to cell communication and designing manageable cell to cell communication systems will provide us a scale of new possibilities. Manageable cell to cell communication systems could have applications in different fields like therapeutic application or fermentation technology applications. We want to construct an E.coli strain which is capable of passing a GFP signal through conjugation to other E.coli cells only once. Communication appears population wide. Our work builds on projects of previous iGEM teams from Berkeley UC and Peking University.
Our project is made up of three modules:
1) Conjugation system
We want to build a cell to cell communication system in which communication is based on conjugation. Through conjugation a GFP message is passed to other bacteria in the culture.
2) Self destructive plasmid (SDP)
The plasmid contains a GFP message, inducible endonuclease gene and restriction site of this endonuclease. The plasmid is able to degrade itself after receiving the destructing signal.
3) Delay device
It is important that there is a time delay between the moment of"

The objective of this debate was to achieve a state of art on the ethics questions raised by synthetic biology, and our project. Thus, we were convinced that our different stakeholders could provide pertinent questions on the differents issues related to the subject. We wanted to present to the scientist community this ethics debate.
Unfortunately, a technical failure does not allow us to add english subtitles to the first part of the video! This part will be added as soon as possible on youtube. However, a report has been achieved on the stakeholders talks and can be found after the videos.

Summarization of reflections
« Ethics is the movement of the Liberty which searches a well life, in the solicitude toward others is in just use of social institutions »; Paul Ricoeur quotation, philosopher of the 20th century. In other terms, ethic represents the philosophical field gathering moral values which define the way we have to behave.
Applied to synthetic biology, ethics indicates the way to follow in order to allow this discipline development by avoiding its drifts. Indeed, even if it lets dream to large perspectives as new energy sources, accessible therapies to all or biological remediation methods, to manipulate the living rises regularly to a certain number of ethic questions. François Le Fèvre mentions « it is the first time that human is confronted to the possibility to create new forms of life ».
It seemed  important to us to interest to these points, beside the biologic engineering  technic aspect. In this way, we organized an ethic debate based on the topic of the synthetic biology, in which some different expert key figures of the domain were invited. During this debate, different problematics were raised.  Like emphasized Thierry Magnin, some of them are of metaphysical order, and concern notably what «this gives us as the living representation, as life »; some others concern direct applications and their technical aspects which can push us to imitate them. At the occasion of this debate, we presented our project to our guests in order to take out ethic questions.

Introduction
Comic Book
Surveys
Introducton
Synthetic biology is a relatively new field just recently receiving more and more attention here in Lithuania. For example, in Vilnius University the synthetic biology courses only start in Master degree studies. For that reason, undergraduate students rarely know anything about the basics of Synthetic Biology.
This year we have started to build the Synthetic Biology community here in Lithuania by revamping Synthetic Biology Organisation by setting its direction and goals, starting a synthetic biology education cycle in university and giving popular lectures to students in Life Science Center.
However, we wanted to make the education process more engaging and innovative - as it is not always easy to grab the attention of the youngest students. That is why, for some time, we have actively searched for ways we can engage students in a more fun and attractive way.
Educational tool - Synthetic Biology Comic Book!
That is why we were extremely surprised and happy to receive a collaboration proposal from OUC-China . They have created a 28-page comic book about the principles of Synthetic Biology. The content was explaining in a fun and engaging manner with the help of colourful illustrations. It was called “Spaceship E. Coli”.
Therefore, we have accepted their collaboration proposal right away and translated their comic book into our native Lithuanian language. Also, we have adapted it to be most suitable for the young students here in Lithuania. After translating the book we have created a shareable PDF file. We have then distributed this comic book on various websites and social networks to the Lithuanian students and the general public that, we hope, after reading the comic book have developed an interest in synthetic biology.
As the online sharing was a huge success, together with OUC-China iGEM team we have decided to take our collaboration one step further and a physical version of the Lithuanian “Spaceship E.Coli” comic book. We have hoped"

Week 5: June 2nd - June 6th
Human practices sub-team was formed to focus on the purpose of the project and the positive impact it could have globally.  This week was focussed mainly on brainstorming potential ideas for application of a rapid diagnostic test for infectious tropical diseases.  One of the most prominent ideas was that of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis for malaria and the lack of resources to provide an accurate and rapid diagnosis of these other dangerous diseases.  Throughout this brainstorming we indicated that we wanted to further look into Dengue Fever, Meningococcal Meningitis and pneumonia that are often misdiagnosed as malaria.  In regards to these diseases, we looked into their symptoms and misdiagnosis statistics and existing technologies of diagnosis.  We began to look into potential contacts and experts that would be able to assist us with their expertise on the subject of misdiagnosis.
Week 6: June 9th - June 13th
Throughout this week we continued researching the various diseases, specifically focusing on misdiagnosis of malaria in developing countries and specifically the social and economic effects of this issue. We continued researching diseases that mimic malaria including dengue fever, meningitis, and pneumonia. On June 9th, we met with one of our experts Dr. Abebe Bayih who worked in the hospital setting in Ethiopia  Through our meeting he was able to confirm that misdiagnosis is a major issue in developing countries due to lack of facilities and resources.  We then discovered that typhoid fever has very similar symptoms to malaria such"

Unoptimized Plasmid Assay
We first tested our unoptimized sensor with sfGFP as reporter gene in vitro to confirm that the sensor is functional. A concentration of 100 nM of AHL was used. The results are shown in figure 1. We observed a reaction approximately 300 minutes after addition of AHL. The reaction could clearly be distinguished from the negative control and the fluorescence signal increased up to 90 a.u. Nevertheless, our fold induction was around 5, which could be further increased with optimization. This fluorescence is also visually indistinguishable from the negative control without the use of a plate reader.
Figure 1. - Unoptimized Plasmid Assay
Optimized Plasmid Assays
Next, we performed the same experiment using our optimized plasmid. We used a concentration of 100 nM AHL, just like our first experiment. We also used a positive control for our experiment which was a sfGFP with an upstream T7. Our negative control was a blank extract. The results can be found in figure 2A. Our optimized system outperformed the unoptimized system in two ways: the absolute fluorescence of the ON state increased (Figure 2A), as did the fold-induction (the ratio of ON to OFF states) (Figure 2B).
Figure 2A & 2B. - Optimized Plasmid Assay & Fold Induction Graph
AHL Titration
Subsequently, we tested different AHL concentrations. The kinetics of how our sensors response to different AHL concentrations is shown in figure 3A. Since we had received such a low signal in our previous experiments for an AHL concentration of 100 nM we decided to use higher concentrations for this experiment. The first two hours show a strong increase in fluorescence. After that, the increase in fluorescence became slower. We could also show that the adding different concentrations of AHL has effects on the transcription levels of sfGFP. Compared to the former fluorescence levels our optimized device showed higher levels of fluorescence. This range of AHL that we used was out of the range of linear fluorescence increase predicted by our model. For information about our model visit our Modeling page . The extract that we used for this experiment also seems to be higher, with better fold induction and fluorescence that is visible to the naked"

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," II is a more suitable option ( Sigma-Aldrich )), but with a significantly lower performance ( Vitzthum et al., 1999 ).
When complexed with nucleid acid, SYBR Green I absorbs blue light (maximum excitation wavelength is 497 nm) and emits green light (emission peak at 520 nm) ( Sigma-Aldrich ), which makes it suitable for quantification - by means of a plate reader - of the DNA amplicons (i.e. the reverse complement of the probes) from our Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA).
Indeed, since we verified in all cases the absence of unwanted secondary structures (more details in Detailed Design ), the stems in the probes and in the amplicons are the only double-stranded targets to which SYBR Green I can preferentially bind: this allows to observe the increase over time in the size of the amplicon during RCA.
Figure 7. ""Scheme for miRNA detection by TIRCA in vitro"" [Reproduced from Deng et al., 2014 (Figure 1A)].
Detailed design
This section is more specifically dedicated to the reasonings behind the sequences of our probes.
Analysis of given probes
We started our design from the analysis of one probe from Qiu et al., 2018 , namely ""let-7a probe 1"" (Probe 2 for us). The sequence was the following one:
5’-pACCTCATTGTATAGCCCCCCCCTGAGGTAGTAGGTTGCCCAACTATACAACCTACT-3’
where:
the regions in italic are those belonging to the loops of the hairpin
the regions in orange and green are those belonging to the stem of the hairpin (and which are complementary with each other)
the underlined region is the one complementary to the miRNA (let-7a-5p: UGAGGUAGUAGGUUGUAUAGUU)
Figure 8. Secondary structure of ""let-7a probe 1"" (Probe 2 for us). dG=-10.40.
Such probe consists of a double-stranded stem part, a 10 bases-long loop (which from now on we will refer to as ""small loop"" - on the right in the figure above) and a 16 bases-long loop (""large loop"" - on the left). As we can                             observe, the toehold region of the probe (i.e. the part on the small loop where the miRNA binds) is 7 bases long, in accordance with Deng et al.,"

Last Friday we observed that there is no effect on the leakiness of the inducible promoters by using carbenicillin as a selection marker. We assumed that there was a contamination either in the medium or the glycerol sotck, so we repeated the leakiness tests with tetracycline and ampicillin insteadt in 2xYT liquid cultures overnight.
Tuesday 9, July 17, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Kerstin, Kevin
The results of the leakiness experiment: The growth of cells equipped with the Plas inducible ampicillin resistance cassette, probably a double clone, was firstly limited at ampicillin concentration of 400µg/ml. The Plas inducible ampicillin resistance cassette and the positive control grew at all tested concentrations of ampicillin (100µg/ml-1 mg/ml).  To show that the transformation of our chromoprotein expression cassettes with and without strong constitutive promoters was successful, colony PCR was performed. The constitutive RhlR and LasR transcription factor expression cassettes were digested with   appropriate restriction enzymes and desired fragments were extracted from gel after gelelectrophoresis. Lastly, the DNA was purified. Transformation of the Plas inducible ampicillin resistance cassette was performed. However, after prepping the DNA and sending it for sequencing the sequence revealed that this construct was a double clone. The earlier mentioned transcription factor expression cassettes for RhlR and LasR were then ligated and incubated overnight. Also, 2xYT liquid cultures of all chromoprotein expression cassettes were prepared and incubated overnight.

Today, we transformed the ligated DNA of our transcription factors RhlR and LasR expression cassettes (containing strong constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator) into E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' by heat shock and plated the samples on 2xYT agar containing chloramphenicol. The colony PCR with GoTaq of these ligations did not show fragments of expected size for any of the selected clones. All chromoprotein containing constructs (expression cassettes as well as chromoprotein encoding genes combined with RBS) were minipreped and sent for sequencing."

2. Inducible Promoter
2.1 one operon, positive or negative inducible
   The first level: no transcription factor is added.
  Here, we would introduce the leakage rate in order to estimate the production rate of the inducible promoters when no repressor or activator binds to the operon. Please note that, in negative inducible promoter, the leakage rate (LR) is almost as same as the transcription strength(TS) of the promoter in this situation.

(1) Negative inducible promoter
   In repression of a promoter, n repressor proteins, and nR, bind together to the operator, a DNA site of the promoter, and thus there is a decrease in the rate of transcription of the promoter, so we have the basic kinetic equations
   In steady state,
   where
   Suppose that the whole promoter regions,[PT], consist of active regions and inactive regions while there are two repressors, both active and inactive, can blind with regions, transcription can be only occurred in active regions.

   In our model, the difference between positive and negative regulation is that positive regulated circuits is for the regions that blind with active activators and can perform transcription.

   There are four cases at this level:
(1) Repressors + Inducers: every repressor is inactivated by n inducers;

Abstract
Exploration, both on Earth and beyond, requires putting instrumentation into atmospheres. Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: to track weather patterns, wind patterns, and to monitor atmospheric composition. Our team is working to create a biological balloon that is light, biodegradable, and both continuously and sustainably produced. To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties of strength and elasticitiy. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant. Finally, to functionalize our balloon we are creating biological temperature and small molecule sensors. When combined to form a biological balloon these projects could create a completely novel category of scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful.

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the <a href="" https://2017.igem.org/Competition/Human_Practices "">Human Practices page</a>.

Design
We aim to detect the concentration of copper ion in  the water. According to our goal, we design a circuit    which can improve previous copper detection  system to make it efficient and  intelligent.
 
 
Circuit
The  design of BBa_K2555002
We design two basic parts to form a whole system, sensor  part and regulator part:
 
 
 
Sensor Part
The  design of BBa_K2555000 (optimum BBa_K1555000)
 
 
Previous part BBa_K1555000 in the registry
 
Escherichia  coli has high  tolerance for copper. CopA is the central component of copper homeostasis in E.  coli, which removes Copper ions from the cytosol into  the periplasm (Stoyanov  et al .,2001). CopA is required for intrinsic copper resistance (Outten et al.,2000).  The promoter of cop A is more sensitive to copper than  the other two copper-responsive promoter. So, we use this promoter in our  sensor part. Moreover, we add RiboJ between promoter and RBS of previous Part  BBa_K1555000. RiboJ is an insulator commonly used in genetic circuits to  prevent unexpected interactions between neighboring parts. Insulation with  RiboJ may increase protein abundance. We replace GFP to sfGFP. The  investigation has found that sfGFP increased resistance to denaturation,  improved folding kinetics, increased resistance to aggregation during  refolding(Andrews et al., 2007), and  was very useful for improved protein detection(Cabantous et al., 2006).
 
Regulator Part
The  design of BBa_K2555002
In the absence of metal ,the metalloregulator  CueR bends the DNA so that the RNA polymerase cannot interact with the pCopA  promoter properly, thereby repressing transcription (Outten et al., 1999). Upon  metal coordination, CueR enables the DNA to assume a conformation that can  activate the transcription process. CueR can behave as a net activator or a net  repressor under different copper concentrations through interaction with RNA  polymerase"

Diagnosis
According  to London team the value of [ComE*] will eventually reach a limit concentration of 5x10^-11 M. Considering that the detection/signaling steps reach the equilibrium state rather rapidly, it is possible to consider the response step as the limiting factor, so it is possible to consider [ComE*]eq= 5x10^-11 M.
In our project, the main doubt and assumptions had to be made concerning the interaction of the proteins LasR and QteE, which has a repression mechanism still unknown. The first assumption made was that the LasR/QteE interaction has a 1:1 equivalence, which seems quite unnatural, but is the simplest aproximation to be made. Afterwards, we assumed that the interaction occur with the formation a complex o bonded LasR/QteE.
First Case
The set of equations describing our system for the first case are described bellow:
the constants alphaL, alphaq and alphaG are the kinetic for the production of LasR, qteE and GFP respectively. The constants yL, yq, yG are the degradation constant, which determinate the rate of degrading LasR, QteE and GFP respectively. The term ""teta ([LasR] - [QteE]) is the Heaviside function (step function), being 1 when LasR > QteE and 0 when LasR < QteE, guaranteeing the production of GFP only when the qteE barrier is crossed. The equation describing the production o QteE was taken from the 2010-Kyoto team .
In equilibrium, the equations become:
Note that the equations describing the equilibrium of LasR and QteE can be substituted on the equation for the GFP equilibrium concentration. By this means, it is possible to model de amount of $GFP$ produced taking into account only the promoters [ComE*] and [IPTG], which are controllable in an experimental set-up. So, if all the constants are given, it is possible do infer the strength of the signal generated in terms of the qteE barrier and the efficiency of the cleaving process the occur outside the cell.
Second Case
For the second case, we will consider the formation of a [QteE-LasR] complex. To take this into account it is necessary to"

UK iGEM Meetup
On the 17th and 18th of August,  we attended the UK iGEM meetup hosted by the  Westminster, UCL and Warwick iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for us to present our project to others. We delivered a formal presentation, and explained our project at poster sessions. We were also able to find out more about other teams’ projects and their work.
We were able to set up links with some of the teams there  which led to some of our collaborations. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams with more experience and get advice on things like poster design or presentation skills.

Three types of drying have been tested (see figure 1):
15 µl of plasmid dried overnight in a spectrophotometer cuvette at room temperature under fume hood
15 µl of plasmid dried overnight in an open petri dish under fume hood
15 µl of plasmid dried with a Speed Vac for 40 minutes
The different compartments were kept at 27 to 33°C for 35 days and on the 36th day, in order to verify the functionality of the plasmid, TOP10 transformation was done. The plasmid was suspended in 15μL of sterile water. A positive control bacterial transformation was also made with a plasmid that was conserved at -20°C which is the optimal temperature for DNA conservation.
Figure 1: Different types of drying (Spectrophotometer cuvette, Petri dish, Speed-Vac, Control)
The number of colonies obtained was comparable to the positive control. Some loss was shown, nevertheless the number of colonies was important.
Speed-Vac has been chosen as the main technique because this was the fastest way for DNA drying. As a conclusion, using this method, plasmid can be conserved for many weeks at temperatures close to those in real conditions.
2. Conservation of competent bacteria
Conserving competent bacteria is a big challenge in biology. The aim was to find the best way to conserve these bacteria with the minimal use of energy. As it was not possible to put a -80°C chamber in a detection kit, another solution had to be found. Freeze-drying was chosen as a method for a long time conservation of our competent bacteria. The paper “Process for producing freeze-dried competent cells and use thereof in cloning” written by Efrat Barnea (Jerusalem), Yael Asscher (Mevaseret Zion), Castro Wattad (Jatt Village) and published in June 27th 2002 in United States Patent Application Publication was very helpful for the protocol elaboration.
Escherichia coli JM109 were made competent with CaCl2 100mM, MgCl2 100 mM and a cryoprotector agent added (sucrose at different concentrations, see details below). The samples were freeze-dried during one night"
TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," different affinity tags can still form biofilms despite having a peptidic modification in the CsgA structure. However, the affinity test has been performed for the hydroxyapatite (HA) tag and the polyhistidine (His) tag, meaning that the binding capabilities of the mfp3 and mfp5 tags still have to be proven.
Our initial plan was to, in addition to the His- and Hydroxyapatite-tag, also attach a SpyTag to the CsgA protein. This idea was based on an article of the Joshi Lab on programmable biofilm-based materials (Nguyen, Botyanszki, Tay, & Joshi, 2014). The SpyTag can spontaneously form a covalent isopeptide bond with a protein called SpyCatcher. The SpyCatcher protein can be attached to other proteins to form a fusion protein. This way the fusion protein can be immobilized on the nanowire by means of the SpyTag. By attaching the SpyTag to the CsgA protein, the SpyCatcher can indirectly bind to the nanowires formed by the CsgA. This way fusion proteins can be immobilized on the nanowires and a functionalized biofilm can be created.(Nguyen et al., 2014)
Printing Biofilm Layers Using Fluorescent Cells
Our final goal in the project was the ordered printing of biofilm layers. So, in the following part we describe how we did that and how we achieved 3D printing of biofilms
Introduction
One of the goals of our project is to print biofilms with a defined structure. This could be applied in e.g. industrial processes in which the production pathway is divided over several organisms (Zhou et al. 2015). An example of such a process is given below (Figure 24). The orange substrate is converted by the blue bacterium to the purple intermediate. This purple intermediate is converted by the red bacterium to the green final product. This conversion can be done in two separate reactors, in which case purification steps are required in between the two reactors.
Another option is to do the conversion in one reaction. In this case the outflow will contain not only the end product, but also substrate and intermediates. When you would be able to optimally structure the two bacteria, the produced intermediates would be directly converted by the red bacteria, thereby minimizing the amount of intermediates in your outflow and thereby increasing your yield.
Also in the case that the purple intermediates inhibit their own production (feedback inhibition), structuring the bacteria and thereby minimizing"

Westminster
On 17th August four of our team members (Karolina, Rachel, Sean and Laura) made the trip to London to participate     in the iGEM UK Meet-up 2017 hosted by the Westminster, UCL and Warwick iGEM teams.
It was a great opportunity to meet and discuss the progress of our respective projects with other UK teams. The Friday, organised by     Westminster University, consisted of two lectures. The first covered the topics of Orthogonality, Risk,    Bio-containment whilst the second was based on Bacterial Micro-Compartments. The lectures were then followed by poster     presentation in the afternoon.        UCL organised a series of Synthetic Biology debates for Saturday morning, the debating topics included: Should Biology    and AI technology be merged ? And should humans have the right to create synthetic life on other planets?      After lunch we departed for the Shard, as organised by Warwick, to give our presentations.  When creating our presentation     we had decided early on to be very up-front about the progression of our project and in-particular highlight any problems we    were still yet to solve. By taking this approach we received lots of constructive comments and suggestions about possible     solutions and difficulties which we had not yet identified.
Questions:
From Oxford: Are pili functional when the bacteria are dead?
From Nottingham: Do our proteins fold at low pH?
UCL: What is the bond strength between the pili and the metal ions?
Suggestions:
During the presentation we asked for other teams to test our app (which was, at that point, in its alpha stage) and convey their feedback on what could be improved. Kent iGEM told us that although they had enjoyed the app, they had difficulty finding it in the google play store. As a result we have renamed the app so that it is easier to locate. After the weekend a member of the Oxford team got in touch to suggest that one possible method to reduce escape frequency of GMO's out of the metal binding reactor is to dis-able the flagella on the our bacteria thus limiting their mobility.Secondly a member of the Nottingham team approached us to suggest we use a piece of software called"

The results were once again beyond our best expectations. CFPS worked well on paper after lyophilization even though tap water was used for rehydration. Commercial cell extract showed a signal, too, but our crude cell extract performed better on both paper types.
CFPS on paper after 24 h of lyophilization. Protein synthesis was initiated by rehydration with 15 µL of tap water. Fluorescence signals were normalized to values of freshly added sfGFP lysate applied on the respective paper. M&N: Macherey & Nagel
CFPS on paper after lyophilization and 6 days storage at 8 °C. M&N: Macherey & Nagel
In the preceding experiment, rehydration was performed right after lyophilization. As our aim was the creation of a cell-free biosensor for the detection of variuos substances outside of the lab, the shelf life of the lyophilized paper discs was of outstanding interest. We repeated the reaction und the same conditions, except that after lyophiliztation, the microcentrifuge tubes were stored at 8°C and room temperature. 6 days later, reactions were rehydrated with 15 µL of tap water and fluorescence signals were measured in Tecan plate reader. The reaction worked and fluorescence signals were still reasonable high, although not as high the signals from non-stored paper-based reactions.
Additionally, 6 day storage was performed at room temperature and 60 °C. Reaction started after rehydration when stored at room temperature, which was remarkably. When the tubes containing the paper discs with the reaction components were provisional sealed with adhesive film, a higher fluorescence signal was observed (see nearby graph). Therefore we propose that a professional sealing would be better for storage and prevent the paper from moistening.
CFPS after storage at room temperature for 6 days. Tubes were stored with adhesive film (parafilm) wrapped round.
CFPS on paper after lyophilization and 6 days storage at room temperature. Tubes were not sealed with adhesive film. M&N: Macherey & Nagel
Storage at 60 °C was not beneficial or more precisely fatal for extract activity. No fluorescence signal raised after rehydration. This was not unexpected, and would have been rather incredible though.

We showed that our cell-free expression system based on crude cell extract works very well on paper. Furthermore, it is very amenable to these conditions as well as to other"

Overview
Movement performed by bacteria based on attraction or repulsion of chemicals is known as chemotaxis. In our project we are using this mechanism for translocation to plant roots of our modified microbes. They will be attracted to the root and will actively swim towards it.
Our primary chassis for wet lab experiments is Escherichia coli. Chemotaxis in E. coli is well documented. These bacteria can perform two types of movement, tumbling and smooth swimming. The difference between the two is determined by flagellar movement. During tumbling movement, the flagella move clockwise. This is caused by the formation of a complex between CheY-P and FliM, one of the flagella-associated proteins. During smooth swimming, the flagella move counter-clockwise. CheY is not phosphorylated and therefore cannot associate with flagellar proteins, causing the flagella to rotate in the opposite direction.
Smooth swimming is the movement performed by bacteria towards an attractant or away from a repellent. Smooth swimming is controlled by a number of chemotaxis proteins that make up a signalling pathway, with basic functioning having same as typical prokaryotic two component system. First part of the mechanism is sensory kinase, which consists of input domain and autokinase domain. Second part of the mechanism is the response regulator, with reciever and output domains. In the case of chemotactic system, sensory kinase is chemoreceptor associated with CheA and CheW proteins. This association remains present only in the absence of a ligand. During that period CheA autophosphorylates and is capable of phosphorylating CheY, protein which acts as a response regulator in this mechanism. Phosphorylated CheY has the capability of associating itself with flagellar proteins, thereby controlling the direction which flagellum rotates. However, in the presence of ligand, sensory kinase domain is not"

Our aim is to identify and quantify what genetic modifications make our favorite model, Pyrococcus yanaosii, require 500 times the atmospheric pressure for growth, when everybody else's favorite lab rat, E. coli, cannot even growth at the same hydrostatic pressure. My teaching activities at the University of Lyon deal with petroleum reservoir microbiology and the use of biosignatures for the study of past and present environments.

As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering  and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in  bacterial adaptation to a  metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also  the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.

To evaluate if the chip can provide a platform for our project, we conducted a series of experiments.
Ⅰ. Biological part:
   In our project, the chip is the carrier of biological reactions, its most basic function is to provide a growth environment for engineering bacteria. In order to be used smoothly as a biological carrier in our project, the chip needs to meet the following conditions:   ①:The freeze-drying and recovery of engineering bacteria can be finished in the chip.And the engineering bacteria needs to keep a relatively high activity after recovery process.   ②:The engineering bacteria can survive in the chip for the short period between recovery and finishing a detection.
1.1Experiment about investigating the Growth and Metabolism status’s change of E.coli inside and outside the Microfluidic Chip.
  First, we selected E.coli that was imported into BBa_K876070 plasmid as the strain of the experiment.Second,we cleaned the chip with anhydrous ethanol and PBS as preprocessing, to make the chip environment more conducive to microbial growth.Third,we injected E. coli into chamber II, put the chip in 37 degree incubator, and measured its OD:600 every two hours, and last draw its growth curve.
Results: According to Fig.1.1 and Fig.1.2
  ①:The chip can ensure the normal growth of bacteria in a short time, but its long-term cultivating performance is not so good.According to our analysis,it may be due to the hypoxia environment in the chip.   ②:The hypoxic environment does have a great impact on the growth of bacteria.   ③:Freeze-drying and recovery process of engineering bacteria can be completed.   ④:The bacteria remains relatively high activity after recovery.   In summary, as biological reaction carrier, the chip can be qualified in the short term bacterial culture,so the chip can meet our basic requirements.But the performance of long-term cultivating is poor.According to our analysis,it may be due to the internal hypoxic environment of the chip.Experiments have shown as proof that the hypoxic environment does have a great impact on the growth of bacteria.
1.2 E. coli freeze drying experiment.
From room temperature to low temperature, ice crystals may generate, and then puncture bacteria cells. So we need to find a reagent to protect bacteria. At"

In the analysis process, we tried to find the relationship between the two questions “Do you think it is feasible to use microbes to assist in the extraction of oil” and “Are you interested in understanding the oil microbes and answering their own confusion”. Therefore, we performed the cross-over analysis. The analysis results show that the majority of people who endorse microbial enhanced oil recovery have tried to learn about our project in multiple ways, while people who have not expressed their thoughts mostly once have tried to understand the project but failed.

Bacterial Sunscreen
- Evidence suggests that several components found in most sunscreens are harmful to us and can be carcinogenic, also most sunscreens only protect against UV B (315-280 nm) and not UV A
- These sunscreens use metal oxides (Zinc oxide) to absorb UV radiation, but the effects of absorbing these metals into your skin are not fully understood and are thought to lead to production of reactive oxygen species and could lead to melanomas rather than preventing them.
- Scytonemin is a pigment found in cyanobacteria which protects them from UV radiation, absorbing 325-425nm. Its synthesis requires three enzymes, SycA-C Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are produced by organisms adapted to environments with high levels of sunlight (eg. cyanobacteria and algae), protecting them from UV radiation. There are 20 types and they also serve as anti-oxidants by stabilising free radicals (anti-ageing?). In a bioinformatics study the genes YP_324358 (predicted DHQ synthase) and YP_324357 (O-methyltransferase) were identified in A. variabilis PCC 7937 cyanobacteria.

Project
The aim of our project is to engineer a light-inducible degradation system as a new fundamental component that can be easily used to build more complex biological circuits inside chassis organisms. This new component consists of the bacterial protease ClpXP from Escherichia Coli fused to the photoreceptor protein phytochrome B of Arabidopsis thaliana. The degradation system is universally applicable to any given protein by addition of a specially designed Biobrick containing the phytochrome interacting factor (PIF3/6) and a specific degradation sequence (DAS-tag). This Biobrick can be added to the C-terminal of the target protein by standard assembly methods. Illumination of red light (660nm) induces a conformational change in phytochrome B and activates the system, an impulse of far-red light (730nm) leads to disruption of the degradation. This allows a tight control over the catalytic activity, enabling the modulation of protein function in a general fashion with the combined characteristics of specificity, high temporal precision and rapid reversibility.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," learned from our advisors that sometimes plasmids will not successfully transform or be grown up when in a low copy backbone. So we transitioned into assembling it into the pSB1C3 backbone before we transitioned it into its pSB4A5 backbone for final use. Once again we continued to have no success. Finally, we assembled each of the individual parts into a TOPO vector along with the restriction enzymes sites necessary for golden gate assembly to ensure that our sequences from IDT were correct and that our enzymes were successfully cutting the parts before ligation. Assembling in TOPO confirmed that our sequences were correct and our restriction enzymes were cutting correctly. However, our ligations sill never produced any colonies.
After going through numerous attempts of assembly and seeking the advice from various experts about our issues we were unsuccessful in assembling our Base Editor. However, we still had the opportunity the use the base editor plasmid obtained from Addgene for our experiments, but it would not be able to be submitted to iGEM due to violations of the BioBrick RFC10 compatibility.
Individual gRNA System
All recording plasmids for our MC gRNA system were ordered from IDT as blocks and assembled into pSB1C3 using Gibson assembly. Due to the fact that DNA synthesis is problematic in the production of repeating sequences of DNA, we resorted to designing our gBlocks with only 2 repeats and inserting more repeat sequences using type II restriction enzyme assembly (BsaI) and DNA oligos. The following plasmids were all fully assembled and sequence confirmed.
BBa_K2785000 - Multiple Cell Recording (0 Repeat Control)
BBa_K2785001 - Multiple Cell Recording (0 Repeat)
BBa_K2785002 - Multiple Cell Recording (1 Repeat)

BBa_K2785004 - Multiple Cell Recording (3 Repeat)
BBa_K2785005 - Multiple Cell Recording (4 Repeat)
BBa_K2785006 - Multiple Cell Recording (5 Repeat)
Our two gRNAs for this system were ordered from IDT as separate gBlocks to be annealed using Gibson assembly. Due to the fact that repeating sequences are difficult to synthesize, IDT was not able to create a sample of gRNA 1 which met their quality control standards. They sent us their best effort attempt of producing it which contained an estimated 80% sample of correct sequence. In order to isolate the correct sequence, we cloned the gRNA into pSB1C3. All samples that we sent for sequencing did not contain the correct sequence"

“From Project to Product”
Traditional solutions for the “RAT MENACE” are:
Trapping: With cages, snap traps and glue pads
Traps are placed in locations where there exists  more possibility for the arrival of rats, baits are placed as attractants and it is expected that the rat falls for the bait and gets trapped.
Poisoning:
Several farmer like the ones in Chilla, Raipur Khurd, and Durali make use of Anticoagulants and Metal Phosphides (like Aluminum Phosphide), Upon ingestion (if ingested), rats either suffer a renal failure due to blocking of the Vitmain K cycle leading to the inability to produce essential blood clotting factors (like Prothrombin) or die due to the production of toxic Phosphine gas in the stomach of the rats by the reaction of metal phosphide with the acid in the stomach.
Rat Repellents:
Many households and newspaper storage industries use rat repellents like naphthalene balls, ammonia, and peppermint oil. The smell of them causes irritation to rats, which is supposed to cause them to vacate the region.
High-Pitch Noise Machine:
They produce sound waves in the Ultrasonic frequency range.                                            The sound is supposed to irritate the rats and cause them to vacate the region.
Fumigation:
Large Government Warehouses use fumigation with chemical sprays to protect their grains from rodent infestation.
Silos:
Many high-income farmers use aluminum silos with airtight seals to store their grain. This keeps the grain safe from the attack of rats and also keeps them safe from environmental degradation including rotting.
What They Lack?
Trapping:
It relies on the fact that rats get fooled by bait; but they are smarter than you would think (as with other vertebrate pests). Glue pads are able to capture rats once they step on the pad, but are inhumane. The rat tries to escape and in turn gets entangled even further. In its natural response to flee, it tries to escape until it rips itself apart and slowly dies.
Poisoning:
At least in India, rats are considered holy and"

After refolding, the reaction mixtures are heated from 4 degrees Celsius to 95 degrees Celsius over the course of one hour. N=1.
4. E. coli Expression Test
When we co-expressed the probes and targets in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) provided by [https://2018.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK/Collaborations NUS Singapore-A team], we did not observe the expected ON/OFF ratio as seen in the in vitro experiments. While we initially hypothesized that this might be due to the low expression level of the probes and the target, as the positive control had low fluorescence comparing to blank as well, we performed total RNA extraction and used the RNA amount that is equivalent to the cell number for in-cell assay. To our surprise, we observed a 7-fold recovery of the fluorescence level of the positive control in total RNA, while none of that was observed in the probe + target pairs. Based on the results, we concluded that while aptamer folding without tRNA scaffold is unfavorable in E. coli, probe target hybridization is inhibited by the terminator following the aptamer. Please note that the design of this assay is following Ong et. al. 2017, showing that the data from the paper might not be accurate. However, due to the lack of time, we did not perform further alterations to improve the design (Fig. 4).

5. Improve a previous biobrick and project – RNA Reporter for Promoter Activity Measurement
We have cloned the lpp promoter-conjugated new RNA reporters into pSB1C3 for assay, including tRNALys3-miniSpinach, tRNALys3-iSpinach-D5 and tRNALys3-dBroccoli. The overnight culture was directly used for DFHBI incubation and plate reader measurement. We found out that all 3 probes are brighter than the original biobrick (Fig.6.1).

We can see in lines 3, 4, 9-12 with a band arround 200 bp, these are from the BBa_R0010 promoter, so again, we just obtained clones with one of the two inserts even when the restriction enzymes used are supposed to avoid this result.

We placed the biggest colonies of the plates with Km into the antibiotic for wich they have resistance into the plasmid, Ampiciline. In parallel we performed colony PCR.
The results were negatives :( and the cultures in Amp were succesfull. But the morphology of the colonies don't look like E. coli.  At the same time we observe the original plates with some fungi, so we conclude that the little colonies were contaminated with some mushroom.

All iGEM teams presented their own projects. The projects were discussed by other iGEM teams and some professors. All teams got some new ideas to their process after the presentation. After presentation part, the problems of iGEM teams in Turkey were discussed and we tried to find solutions to these problems. After this meeting we had great time with METU iGEM Team in Ankara.  We made lots of friends at there. It was decided to start collaboration between Turkish iGEM teams and also it was decided to make another meeting in Istanbul by our host.
ITU National iGEM Meeting
        After the National METU Meeting, we had decided to host a similar meeting in August 2013 which is important for iGEM Turkey family to get know and help each other out in Istanbul. The meeting has been organized successfully with the participation of almost all national iGEM teams. METU iGEM Team, Baskent Meds Team and ITU MOBGAM iGEM Team presented their projects in this order at the seminar. Projects have been discussed by instructors and other iGEM team members to solve the problems and find out the insufficient parts. After the seminar, variety problems that the projects teams confronted have been discussed and tried to be solve. In addition to the seminar with the aim to meet and socialize; a dinner and an entertainment have been organized in Taksim Square.
Preperation Of Video Interviews
        To continue our human practice works, we have decided to shoot a series of video interviews. To do so, we met at school with our cameras and microphones and started to ask people about iGEM. The answers were satisfactory. Different people from different fields of interest participated to our interview. After shooting some videos on school, we decided to go to Taksim Sq. to continue. It was hard to do such a thing on Istiklal Avenue because people seem to busy and not willing to answer our little question, ""What is iGEM?"" Walking down the Istıklal Avenue, we reached to Galata Tower which is known for its touristic attraction. We asked some tourists and they responded pleasantly. The interview with tourists attracted other people's attention and they were willing to answer our questions. We gathered enough material for our two video ""What is iGEM?"" and ""What is synthetic biology?""

William_and_Mary,2016,Team:William and Mary#Binding Array_-_-_TEXT.html," of that repressor is related to the production of that gene product. That is to say, for our circuit that you can go from [TetR] -> [GFP] or in a more measurable sense [TetR] -> Fluorescence (Figure 1.5)
Figure 1.5: Example circuit. pTet GFP is repressed by TetR, and this relationship is repressed by the introduction of the small molecule inducer aTC. Diagram made with pidgeon cad.
This makes sense, because the chance of the transcription factor being bound to a given promoter is based on the number of transcription factors as well as the number of unbound promoters. Since the number of promoters is more or less held constant by plasmid number, you can model production of the gene under the control of the promoter off of [Transcription Factor] alone. So you can use molecular titration to shift your transfer function by making any given amount of transcription factor be equivalent to a smaller amount.
Coming back to our example, since TetR is a repressor, as we increase [TetR] we get a corresponding decrease in fluorescence. If we then introduce a decoy binding array encoding a repeated number of tetO (TetR binding sites), say 85 of them, then for some [TetR], we actually have a working [TetR] of some amount less (Figure 2) That means at a given [TetR] in our circuit with the decoy binding array we have the fluorescence of a different lesser [TetR] of our original circuit. This is a shift along the x axis to the right.
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of the effect of molecular titration on a transfer function. You can see in the original circuit that once TetR reaches a high enough concentration, the fluorescence (GFP production) goes down, until it reaches a point of maximal repression. In the circuit with the binding array, each [TetR] actually corresponds to a lower working [TetR], shifting the transfer function to the right.
We can also think about the molecular titration from an induction level. Suppose we use the same reporter circuit pTet GFP and instead of having a variable amount of TetR we instead constitutively express it such that we have a constant amount. Since we only ever have one concentration of TetR, the amount of fluorescence will always be the same. However, when we induce with aTC (which causes TetR to be unable to bind), then there will be functionally less TetR, and"

Plasmid isolation of p123 and p136
Investigator: Roman
Aim: Aim of the experiment was the isolation of p123 out of transformed (see friday) XL-1 blue chemo competent e.coli- cells. Old and newly prepared competent cells were used (see friday). Besides, p136 was isolated out of transformed cells, which is pSB1C3 with CHS- inserted. The whole experiment should provide an adequate amount of pSB1C3 backbone for the caffeine team, because we want to insert our three genes in this vector.
Operational Sequence:
The plasmid preparation was performed as described in the manufacturers protocoll (Quiagen Miniprep Kit). Elution was done with 50 µl Elution Buffer in one step. Due to the incubation of the liquid cultures at room temperature over the weekend instead of 37°C over night, the pellet was a bit smaller than usual, resulting in concentrations of only:
51,9 ng/µl (p123, old competent cells used)
57,8 ng/µl (p123, new competent cells used)
59,2 ng/µl (p136)

With BactWars, we build a biological tool that can target specific genes in multiresistant or pathogenic bacteria, and would kill or deactivate them.
To target specific genes we worked with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. By designing the sgRNA, we can target different genes. At first, we targeted the RFP with Cas9 by electroporating our plasmid.
Figure 1: [left] control producing RFP, [right] Transformed strain
After this experiment we knew our CRISPR-Cas9 system was operational.
For the transfer of genes, we worked with conjugative plasmids (pSW23T and pK18mob).
We tried at first, a conjugation without killing. We transferred our conjugative plasmid pK18mob containing the LacZ gene coding for the beta-galactosidase. So The receiver strain, that produces RFP, will then acquire this gene and will           appear           purple on Xgal media from producing RFP (red) and metabolizing Xgal (blue).
Figure 2: [Red] Receiver strain, [Blue] Donor strain, [purple] Conjugated Receiver strain
We know from now on that our conjugation is working. We can now combine the two tools.
Thus, our next step is to target the RFP gene with our conjugative plasmid containing Cas9.
Cross test 1: [left] overview, [center] close up conjugative donor strain with sgRNA targetting RFP (+), [left] close up conjugative donor strain without sgRNA targetting RFP(-).
We can see that the conjugation line is visible under the microscope and an effective difference between the control, without sgRNA, and the conjugative strain with the sgRNA.
The last step aim at targetting a resistance gene in the receiver strain.

Philip Lam
Major and Year:
4th Year Applied Biology, specializing in Plant and Soil Sciences
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year in order to appreciate the unlimited tamed potentials of anthropogenic biodiversity; it’s my favourite dynamic-and-renewable resource to exploit/domesticate/sustain.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Initially, I had merely hoped to learn how to transform brewer’s yeast to produce terpenes and polyketides of plant origin, just for the power-trip. Eventually, I decided to stay for the annual Albertan roadtrip of friendship.
What inspires you:
Plant chemicals, fungal and bacterial metabolism, and animal consciousness.  People like Paul Stamets, Alexander Shulgin, Francis Crick, Kary Mullis, Aldous Huxley, Paul Kroeger, George Abbas.
Desired Impact on the world:
I wish to honour my ancestors.
Hobbies:
Watching Youtube reruns of Fear Factor, while getting shunned for watching it.

Tudor Lapuste
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I've been fascinated by topics in synthetic biology ever since I saw a TED talk in 2010 where Craig Venter revealed the ""first fully functioning, reproducing cell controlled by synthetic DNA"". I've tried to join various synthetic biology efforts since then, including the DIYbio group here in Vancouver, and when I saw that iGEM was accepting new team members, it was a no-brainer!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get my hands dirty (not literally of course, I'll be wearing gloves) in the lab and figure out the best way to present information on our team wiki.
What inspires you:
My main inspiration is this idea that technology is bootstrapping on itself and accelerating towards what Ray Kurzweil calls The Singularity. I am a positive person, and as such I see this resulting in a world of abundance, rather than a Terminator-esque dystopia where the machines take over. Radical abundance for all!

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"-System by invitrogen. The three compound system consists of HEK-TRex™-293 cells that harbour one chromosomal Flp recombination target (FRT) site, a Flp recombinase expression plasmid and the plasmid encoding the receptor as well as another FRT site for stable integration. [18] The detailed principle of the integration is described in the figure below.
Cells that succesfully integrated the plasmid into their genome will lose their resistance for Zeocin™, but become resistant to hygromycin B (hygB) as the plasmid encodes the hygB-phosphotransferase, a kinase inactivating hygB by phophorylation. [19] Thus, successfully transfected cells can be easily selected via hygromycin B. To ensure that the resistence does not come from non-integrated plasmid, this process takes several weeks and divison cycles.
Fig.8 Stable transfection was performed using the pcDNA5 vectors obtained from invitrogen
The succesful integration of the pcDNA plasmids was verified by genome-PCR (see methods). Therefore, we designed three primers: One that binds to the SV40 promotor and part of the following FRT site, one that binds part the hygromycin restistance gene and another one for the lacZ-Zeocin sequence. In the event of stable integration, the size of the amplicons will be around 550 bp, according to the distance between the SV40 and the hygromycine resistance gene. Wheareas in case of no integration the amplicon size will be around 400 since this corresponds to the distance between the SV40 and the lacZ-Zeocin sequences.
The results are shown in figure on the right. The lower band visible in the samples 2-5 leads us to the conslusion that, despite hygromycine selection, the cells are not yet a monoculture - something we also observed in the flow cytometry analysis further discussed below. On the other hand, a high portion of cells do have the construct integrated into their genome.
Fig.9
Subcellular protein localization using fluorescence microscopy
For better traceabilty we supplied all of our receptor constructs with reporter genes like mRuby and/or Nanoluciferase. mRuby is located on the C-terminus respectively the cytosolic end of our transmembrane receptors right before the Strep-tag. Cells that express and fold the protein properly should give a signal of 605 nm (red)"

UT-Tokyo,2013,Team:UT-Tokyo#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," meeting thankfully held by TMU-Tokyo. Through pointing out eachteam’s problem of project, we developed the quality of our projects.
Skype conference with NTU-Taiwan
In spring, we also did skype conference with NTU-BEST, a team of National Taiwan University. Thetwo teams introduced their projects each other and it was very good opportunity to get a feedbackfrom others. We also shared information about management, and after that we often helped each other.
Others
In addition, we answered some questions from other teams. For example, TU/Eindhoven has an project on “Synthetic Facts”. In this project, they were going to make the database to check whether every question for the synthetic biology made by ordinary people who do not have specialized background is right. We cooperated with them by making the examples   of   some“facts”. Also we helped Purdue University’s human practice.
To simulate the cell-cell communication system, we developed a delayed differential equation model. The equation used in the model are followings. The variables are described in the following table.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," Joseph Stiglitz’s (Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001) and Elinor Ostrom’s (Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009) theoretical work in the economics of innovation and intellectual property to back up our study.
The patent system: an efficient economic model ?
What is a patent, how is it awarded?
A patent grants its owner a monopoly in a country on an invention he was the first to describe and claim. At a firm's scale, this also means being able to shield the potential commercial exploitation of the R&D work which has led to the invention, against the company's competitors. It rewards this work by granting the patent’s owner an economic advantage that will probably make the financial cost of the R&D be worth it. The perspective of this heavy economic asset is the major reason why patents are said to be a driving force that encourage innovation.
Nonetheless, such a profit-making privilege has a cost for both the claimer (patent offices fees, attorney fees, translation expenses if necessary, and so on) and the society, namely the ""monopoly rent"" it generates (see below). Indeed, targeted inventions have to meet tough conditions for a patent to be granted. Consequently, knowing the granting conditions is very important to fully understand the patent system.
A patent is granted:
for a new invention never publicly revealed, which can lead to industrial applications ;
on a precise territory ;
for a maximum of twenty years ;
to the one who revealed the invention and described it with enough precision.
NB : A patent has to be paid annually for its delivery and maintaining.
The 1930 plant patent act marked the beginning of a new economic era for biology as emerged with it the patentability of the living world. Nowadays, even genetically modified bacteria may be patentable (the latter have been patentable in the USA and then in Europe since the beginning of the 1980s even if the precise conditions to be met to make ""living things"" patentable remain quite fuzzy).
The goal of this brief study though, is not to discuss this matter.
Why patents have been created?
In France, patents have been created after the 1789 French Revolution. They were then considered as a human right : their aim was to recognize the inventors’ rights on their ingenuity. And so was born the first legal mean to claim authorship of an invention: a new era for intellectual property began.
Yet, the justification for patents became quickly socio-economic. Patents are now conceived as an incentive for production and knowledge spreading. When a patent is awarded, the description of the invention goes public, in exchange"
