Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," for every Amino acid.
To derive secondary structure labels for our dataset, we employed STRIDE, an algorithm designed for the assignment of protein secondary structure elements given the atomic coordinates of the protein, as defined by X-ray crystallography, protein NMR, or another protein structure determination method [ 4 ].
For the Contact Map Predictor the required label is the native contact map. To obtain the contact map we need the structural information provided in the PDB file of every protein sample, that is the atomic coordinates of every Amino acid. The contact map is constructed by computing the Cb distance for every pair of Amino acids in the chain and ,subsequently, if that distance satisfies a specified threshold [ 5 ] the pair is considered to be in contact.
To extract the native contact map for every PDB file, we implemented a group of helper functions that allow for the generation of contact maps of different distance cutoffs and distance types, namely Ca, Cb and Ca + Cb.
Model Architecture
The Secondary Structure Predictor model consists of an embedding layer that maps the one hot Amino acid representations to 100-dimensional vectors, a bidirectional LSTM layer of 180 cells and a fully connected layer of 140 neurons with linear activation function. Finally, we have the output softmax layer of 8 neurons that points to the most probable class choice. The training loss is calculated according to the formula of categorical cross entropy.
The Contact Map Predictor model has a tensor input that is feeded to 6 2D-convolutional layers. After each convolutional layer we enforce batch normalization to prevent exploding gradients. The output layer that computes the probability of contact has a linear activation function.
Frameworks
The models were developed in Python using the Theano and Keras frameworks.

Sampling
To draw samples, the shake flasks were taken out of the 37°C room and brought onto a nearby bench. 3 ml of sample were taken out next to a Bunsen burner flame and pipetted into three 2 ml cuvettes. As soon as all samples were taken the flasks were taken back onto the shaker in the 37°C room. The whole process of taking samples for all 12 flasks (3 biological replicates for each construct) took 5 minutes and samples were taken every 2 hours.
After 4 hours, we had to dilute the samples with LB medium in a ratio of 1:4, and from the 6th to 18th hour we had to dilute in a ratio of 1:9.
After the measurement of OD in the spectrometer, 100 µl of each sample were taken out and put on a 96-well plate (Thermo microfluor 1, flat-bottom, black) to measure fluorescence.
Each measurement occured in a technical triplicate, resulting in 36 different samples being processed in every sampling step.
Measurement of OD using a spectrophotometer
For OD measurement, the Unico Spectrophotometer 1201 of Fisher Bioblock Scientific was used. The measurement was taken at 600 nm and we used pure LB medium (from the same batch as the medium used for cultivation) as our blank. We only measured OD up to an absorbance of 0.8. At a higher OD, we diluted the sample with LB medium (again from the same batch as our cultivation medium). Dilution was done by first filling the cuvettes with the LB medium, and then adding our cultivation sample. Subsequently, each cuvette was vortexed thoroughly. The solution was allowed to settle before measurement.

Method of our Modeling
We choose the simbiology in matlab to develop our model. SimBiology provides an app and programmatic tools to model, simulate,                                          and analyze dynamic systems which can easily applied on systems biology.
Pathway of our project
Part A：CO2 uptake model
Part B：Xylose – PRK – Rubisco model
Part C：Original metabolism model
Part D：TCA cycle model
Part A : (CO2 uptake model)
CO2 diffuse into cell can use Fick’s law.
$${[CO_2]_{air} \rightarrow [CO_2]_{uptake}}$$
Assume E. coli was a sphere with 10-6 radius while the depth of membrane was 4*10-9
$${J = {-D{dφ \over dx}}}$$
J is the ""diffusion flux,"" of which the dimension is amount of substance per unit area per unit time.                                              D is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity
After CO2 diffused into cell, it will have a reversible reaction.
$${CO_2 + H_2O \underset{k_{-1}}{\stackrel{k_1}{\rightleftharpoons}} H^+ + HCO_3^-}$$
That’s what CA catalyze the reversible interconversion of CO2 and HCO3-. Although some CAs prefer the direction of CO2 hydration,                                                  the carboxysomal CAs in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophic bacteria favor the direction of HCO3- dehydration.                                                  The result of model and our experiments showed that CA improve amount of CO2 uptake and CO2 utilization.

Part B : (Xylose – PRK – Rubisco model)
We clone our genes into E. coli to make it fix the carbon dioxide.                                              The genes include PRK, Rubisco. On the other hand,                                              we also want to produce the higher value product in our project.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU#Medal Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html," June, which concluded with a panel about intellectual property (IP). We were surprised that this module had perhaps twenty percent attendance as other modules in the workshop. When discussing the importance of IP with our mentors - PIs and graduate students - we discovered that there was not much knowledge about the topic, perhaps due to lack of interest and/or accessibility. We teamed up with Team BostonU_HW to create a light-hearted blog called “Who Owns What: A mildly entertaining look into intellectual property in synthetic biology.” We shared our blog with Boston University and the wider iGEM community, and hope that our entertaining discussions on IP clarified key concepts and demonstrated the importance of these topic.
We also participated in the the Boston Museum of Science’s “Building with Biology” series. We led interactive synthetic biology activities for all museum-goers including isolating DNA from wheat germ and simulating the viral engineering process.We were also able to present a simple toy model of our iGEM project. We also participated in a forum discussion on engineering mosquitoes using gene drives with members of the public. We were really inspired by the forum activity as an innovative way of engaging the public in bioethics discussions and developed a new set of forums for the community (see Gold: Integrated Human Practices).
Gold
1. Integrated Human Practices: Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Inspired by a forum that we participated in at the Museum of Science’s “Building with Biology” event, we decided to develop new bioethics forums for high school students focusing on significant applications of foundational advancements in synthetic biology.
We began development of 4 new forums: (1) Martian Colonization, (2) Genetically Engineered Mosquitoes, (3) Genetically Modified Foods, and (4) Editing the Human Germline. These forums provide relevant background about the topic and science, several plans of action, considerations to keep in mind when drawing a conclusion, and questions to aid students to come to a solution.
This summer we had the pleasure of leading forums for a summer high school STEM program and a molecular bioengineering undergraduate course at BU. We have shared these forums with the wider community on our wiki, and will also be leading these at a high school class in a few weeks, and at a “mini-Jamboree” event for high school students and undergraduates in February 2017. You can read about our visits and our forums on our Bioethics Forums page.

Together we have set up CommunityBricks and AlumniGEM !
This is to be a registry of Human Practices activities available to everyone. These would include notes and reflections from human practices activities of all ranges.
The aim was to improve upon a simple 5-minute survey as performed in the past as 'the' human practices work and extending this to a collection of many activities, possibly combined to create the perfect activity for every audience.
In future years of the competition, it is hoped that past activities would be cataloged here to create registry of standardised interchangeable activities...much reflecting the structure of iGEM.
The aim of the AlumniGEM is to create a platform where past (and current!) iGEMers can
re-connect with each other
receive notifications about scholarships, internships and jobs
receive invitations to reunions
From the database of past iGEMers, this would also be a great for new iGEMers wanting to know the ins and outs of what it takes to be an iGEMer before joining. This is reflected in the survey being conducted here with collaboration from the Cambrigde iGEM Team .
Discussions with Meagan Lizarazo from iGEM HQ have led to the integration of AlumniGEM with iGEM to allow access to the platform for all participants.

SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," but in later stage, J04450 can grow more, but K1919500 enter the plateau phase (Figure 5).
Figure 5.
However, fluorescence result shows that fluorescence for K1919500 is much higher compared to J04450 in AnAero Pack, MicroAero Pack and CO2 Pack. It’s opposite to OD600 result: at first, the K1919500 is slower than J04450, but in later stage, K1919500 produce more mRFP and J04450 enter the plateau phase (Figure 6).
Figure 6.
Air condition result is not regular (Figure 7).
Figure 7.
We calculate Fluorescence intensity/OD600, the result shows that FI/single bacteria seems to produce higher mRFP. Air experiment data is irregular due to fluorescence intensity result irregular (Figure 8).
Figure 8.
And we did find that the result is not good as what we think especially in OD600 test. Then we tried to cultivate bacteria in 96 plate to test repeatly. The result is still the same tendency as 20ml/50ml test in OD600, FI, and FI/OD600 (Figure 9).
Figure 9.
To combine the finding mentioned above, we thought maybe in two experiment conditions, all E. coli are processing anaerobic respiration in fact. To verificate this, we give up obtaining exact oxygen concentration data for modeling to test 5ml/50ml culture system in air.
The result strongly shows that in early stage, K1919500 grow much quicker than J04450, especially compared to 20ml/50ml system and K1919500 always produce more mRFP. Though tendency is the same as before, but variation is significant. The result shows strong effect that VHb enhances the bacteria growth before plateau phase. So it shows a fact that VHb only promote the growth in aerobic respiration condition and VHb function is not strong as expected that it can catch oxygen that efficiently (That’s the reason why we started the experiment in 20ml/50ml system). It’s strongly affected by environment oxygen concentration. The reason why K1919500 carrying capacity K is lower than J04450, we think it’s due to that they are different strains and K1919500 carry more gene to express so their ability to utilize nutrition is different, and K is different (Figure 10).
Figure 10.
If we consider the anaerobic respiration, the growth for VHb in low oxygen concentration should be the slowest because VHb only costs energy and"

Induction of RFP by CpxR sensor
08-04-2014
 
1   Material and methods
 
1.1 Material
-768 MITOMI chip
-Lysis buffer (30mM NaOH + 12% w/v SDS)
-LB with chloramphenicol
-Microfluidic material
-Scanner
-Micropscope
-GenePix software for data analysis
 
1.2 Methods
The aim of this experience was to test the expression of RFP (BBa_K339007) induced by the CpxR responsive promoter. The plasmid was transformed in E.Coli bacteria. After an overnight culture of these bacteria in LB medium containing chloramphenicol they were flown in the chip and subsequently scanned after stressing the bacteria.
CpxR is synthetised upon membrane stress (see our Cpx pathway description for more informations). The idea here was to stress bacteria by applying pressure on them in order to make the bacteria produce their Cpxr protein and thus inducing RFP synthesis. In the biobrick we used (BBa_K339007), there is a CpxR protein sensor upstream of the RFP coding sequence. This sensor should trigger the RFP synthesis once a CpxR protein binds the sensor.
Even though The MITOMI chip isn't oprimised for applying mechanical pressure on bacteria, this experience was performed as follows.
Cells were flown into the chip afer an overnight culture in LB + chloramphenicol. Then the buttons of the chip were activated, thus applying pressure on the upper part of the chambers. As most of the bacteria sit in the lower part of the chambers, pressur affected only a small amount of them.
Scans were taken at regular time intervals.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook-content_-_-_TEXT.html,"2% methane in 98% air until the sensor displayed a stable methane concentration which was then set as 2%.The subsequently measured data were considered in relation to this value. Measurements were started after the sensor had adapted to humidity and temperature in the anaerobic jar. After the measurement, the jar was filled with compressed air to define a zero-point.
Entrapment of E. coli
50 mL of an overnight culture was pelletized. The pellet was washed twice in 0,9 % saline solution resuspended and diluted to OD600 4 in 10 mL 0,9 % saline solution. 1,5 g alginate was solved in 40 mL ddH2O and was briefly boiled up. The alginate solution was mixed with all required antibiotics and arabinose (4 mg/mL). The whole solution was cooled and mixed with 10 mL bacterial 0,9 % saline solution. Beads were dropped with a transfer pipette into a 0,05 M CaCl2 solution. The CaCl2 solution was decanted after 10 min.
Counting of cells with Thoma counting plate
Cell culture is placed on the plate and covered with a cover plate.
Sizes of the counting plate: depth: 0.02 mm area: 0.0025 mm². (Volume of a C-field: 0,0005 mm³ ).
The number of cells per mL was calculated accordingly.
Cultivation on rumen fluid agar plates
We prepared agar plates with different concentrations of sterile filtrated rumen fluid, each with and without supplementation of glucose (100 mM). One-half of each of these plates was inoculated with unsterile rumen fluid and the other one with E. coli. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C.

The vectorization
Vectorization principle [1]
The delivery of a therapeutic molecule to an organ, a tissue, or a cell constitutes today a major challenge. From the beginning of the century, the scientist Paul Ehrlich was already dreaming about « magic bullet » able to transport an active principle in a specific way to its action site. Today, Paul Ehrlich’s dream is nearly real thank to pharmaceutical vectorization development.
Several active principles present, indeed, physico-chemical properties (hydrophily, molecular weight etc…) not in favor of the biologic barrier transit. This barrier separates the administration site from the action site. Other active molecules bump into enzymatic barrier which lead to their degradation and their fast metabolism.
In a general way, it is necessary to notice that barriers are very complex systems made of several elements (epithelium, endothelium, cell membrane) and several components (mechanical, physico-chemical and enzymatic barriers). The therapeutic concentration obtained at the action site is only possible to the detriment of an important loss of medicine to other tissues or cells which leads to important toxic effects and sometimes prohibitive.
Moreover, biotechnologies development gives the access to recombinant proteins and cloned genes, in high quantity. In a same way, progress in organic chemistry on support permits oligopeptides and oligonucleotides creation. These molecules are, probably, the base of tomorrow medicines: highly selective in a molecular way, they lead to endogenous metabolites, which mean non-toxic. However, physico-chemical characteristics"

It can reproduce for only a couple generation and will then become sterile, leading to the extinction of this bacteria population.
RNAi Kill Switch
RNAi knockout is a method of gene regulation where double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is introduced to the worm, binding to gene products such as specific RNAs (mRNA), thereby decreasing or eradicating RNA activity by recycling said products. Only a few dsRNA molecules per cell are required to produce effective interference.

MRT-2 mutant Kill Switch
""Given that the germ-line of the mrt-2 mutant has a limited number of generations in which it can reproduce, our created strain is timed for eventual extinction of a span between 2 months and 1 year, with the average being 6.25 months"". However, no experiment is provided, and so we do not know how they obtained these numbers, but we could assume they come from the literature.

The team managed to have the sensor part work (the bacteria can efficiently sense a change in light, temperature and osmolality. However they did not manage to get the lysis module to work. Therefore this system was never completed, so there are no results available in terms of its efficency to prevent bacterial escape from the fermentor.

Figure 1/2: In this screenshot you can see the picture Mark Benecke took with us in our lab. In his post he mentions the three organisms that we are using in our project and wished us good luck for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Even our university's instagram account shared his post and acknowledged our hard work during the entire year.
We would like to thank Dr. Benecke for his support and his thoughtful words. We really appreciate his input and learned a lot from his advice.
We hope that we were able to reach a wider audience with our collaboration with Mark Benecke and were able to show that synthetic biology is not dangerous, but on the contrary, very fun and helpful.
A Survey for Everyone
To assess the public’s opinion regarding a future possibility to utilize our toolbox for the synthesis of probiotics, we created a survey with a couple of questions.
We did not only share this survey on our social media accounts for a short time, but also went to one of Germany’s biggest supermarkets to personally ask customers what they think about genetically engineered probiotics. In total we achieved a participation count of 267 including young community members starting from 14 years and up to older people. Among the participants, male and female people were almost distributed equally.
Most of the participants were relatively young, ranging from 14 to 30 years old, which is why we  considered that the vast majority of the survey was filled out online. Because of the results from question 3, seen in Figure 1, we assume that most participants are students, probably biologists and familiar with synthetic biology and its hazards. In contrast to that, most of the people we addressed at the supermarket were older, between 30 and 50 years old and frequently even older (+60 years old). This observation is further enhanced when looking at the answer of question 3: Here most of the participants admitted to having an academic degree. Most survey attendants at the supermarket did not hold an academic degree, but mostly rather had a lower secondary school level or no degree at all.
Interestingly, independent of age, gender and degree, most of the participants are aware that the intestinal flora has an impact on human health. This conveys that everyone has already heard something about the gut microbiome and the fact that there are indeed living organisms somehow working to improve our health.
However, when looking at the most frequent answer to question five, some of the participants have never"

""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."" - Helen Keller
A hallmark of this year’s iGEM experience has been fostering interest in young scientists and helping grow another generation of iGEMers. We had the opportunity of working with students from Austin ISD’s Liberal Arts and Science Academy (LASA), a team of 15 motivated high school scientists, also competing in this fall’s International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition LASATX Collaboration . The LASA team is working on carbon monoxide-sensing mechanism in bacteria that emits a wintergreen fragrance when carbon monoxide is detected. We believe that promoting STEM education and banding together can foster creativity, commitment, and collaboration. Specifically, the students has weekly meetings with our research educator, Dr. Dennis Mishler, and had open dialogue with our iGEM team on the Registry, BioBrick assembly, and synthetic biology. Through meetings, tours of our lab, and breaking down scientific literature, we were able to communicate our knowledge to the LASA team so they can start building their own iGEM project. In the Spring, they assisted us in creating fluorescent bacteria for our “painting with E. coli” booth at Austin’s premier SXSW Create conference. We worked with them during our SXSW Outreach in which we painted with bacteria that contained genetic devices (biobricks) that we created as part of our Breaking is Bad project and which were submitted to the registry. They also helped us run the booth, engage local participants, and start verbal surveys on public opinions and misconceptions on the benefits and advance in synthetic biology. Additionally, they helped test our newly created plasmids for the caffeine study by growing the different strains we had engineered. We also helped them in creating biobricks to submit to the registry and they helped demonstrate the utility of our redesigned pDCAF plasmids.

Week 4:  25th July to 31st July
Monday, 25th July
We arrived at Norwich for the UK iGEM meet-up. We presented our project to   the other UK teams and gained valuable feedback. The other teams presented their   projects as well and we gained new insights into their projects. Many parts of   their presentations were pretty relevant to our project. For instance, one team   was making a kill switch which we would also need as part of our project. There   was a great exchange of ideas and opinions and it surely was a fruitful day for   us as we gathered advice and learned from others.
In the evening, we mingled with students from the other teams and had loads   of fun activities. After that, we had a great time and team bonding session at   the clubs.
Tuesday, 26th July
This was the second day of the UK iGEM meet-up. We had four interesting talks   on synthetic biology. In particular, we picked up many good points from one of   the talks on human practice. It reminded us of the many ethical issues and   responsibilities that we bear and should take into account into our project as   we dealt with synthetic biology. Another talk by James Brown from Cambridge was   also very relevant and useful to our project. We were very impressed by some of   the great images of plant root growth and the modelling of the individual root   cells. Ming and Rebecca also successfully collected the seeds that we need for   our project. On the train back to London, we went through many of the great   ideas and information that we had"

Outreach and Collaborations
iGEM Outreach 2.0
Outreach 2.0 is an attempt to change the way that we do outreach at iGEM. By creating an open source community of lesson plans and activity protocols, we hope to stimulate deeper, more engaging experiences for both sides of the exchange. Listed on this site, you will find tools to present synthetic biology to those who have never heard of it, plans and presentations to give stimulating recruitment talks at high schools, and thoughtful considerations of bioethics and the roles it should play in our future.
We are tired of giving friends five-minute surveys and calling it “Outreach.” We hope that you are, too. Let's set a new standard for how we do outreach, something that we will be proud of. The caliber of lab work presented at the Jamboree is a source of great pride for advisors and teams; let us seek to match that same quality in every field we do.
Granted, building a lesson plan or organizing an activity is more work than just typing up a survey, but harnessing community support for synthetic biology may actually make our lives easier in the long run. So, as you start thinking about your team's outreach plans, take a few minutes to peruse the growing content on this site to see what you can easily do. Try it out, and tell everyone else how it goes. And if you have ideas of your own, post your stellar outreach plans and share them with everyone!

Introduction
To investigate the degradation of different substrates with laccases several experiments were performed. For the measurements the four produced bacterial laccases (BHAL, ECOL, TTHL and BPUL) were used. The reactions were measured before and after an incubation with the laccases via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The HPLC was used particularly for analysis of degradation rates after defined time points. With these results it is possible to compare the different laccases in respect to their degradation feasibilities. To detect degradation products of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol after laccase treatment different analysis via LC-MS and LC-MS-MS were done. We identified two compounds for both, estradiol and ethinyl estradiol, which are probable degradation products after laccase treatment.

I am a third year Biomedical Science student of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Calgary. My background is in biology, genetics, bio and organic chemistry with a focus in Biomedical Research. My work in iGEM this summer has been a meaningful experience and involved learning  a lot more about what synthetic biology has to offer in medicine, environment, food and technology. As a Biomedical science student, I spend most of my time doing experiments in the lab and analyzing what went wrong and iGEM ethics added a very different touch to my academic background. I was inspired to join this group after taking a course in ethical issues in medical research and practice, where I learned about the vital role ethics plays from the very initiation of the planning/designing of these synthetic biological systems.   Besides school, I love spending time with my family, listen to music, play my guitar, spend time with my friends and volunteer.
I am very excited about going to MIT and present our findings!!!

I am entering my 2nd year as a Health and Society major in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at the University of Calgary. I have a passion for biology and an uninhibited interest in the operation and evolution of society.I joined the iGEM team for 2008 because I believe synthetic biology will drive many major social changes in the future, both locally and globally. The advancements that synthetic biology may offer, especially in medicine and environmental safety, have many ethical, social, legal and economic implications. I want to examine these issues and gain a better understanding of them as they must be considered before any innovation from the field of synthetic biology can be implemented in society.

Anytime before that, and the positive tests will not have had enough time to produce enough hirudin and will produce a false negative. Anytime after that, and the negative tests will start to produce enough hirudin to cause a false positive. The distributions follow a log-normal distribution as shown.
Figure 12 shows that there is a 95.4% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity rate for our kit. This means there is a 4.6% chance of a false negative and a 9.5% of false positive. This is only an estimate based on the measurement errors of the parameters used, and may be an overestimate of actual sensitivity and specificity of our kit.
[Fig 12]
By using a weaker RBS, we see that although there is lower chance of false positive, it takes longer to reach the threshold. So weaker RBS has higher specificity but lower sensitivity than a stronger RBS.
Discussions
These models have shown us that it is possible to use a cell-free DNA system to release hirudin at a rate fast enough to stop blood coagulation. We've shown that the a strong RBS has higher sensitivity (lower false negative) but lower specificity (higher false positive). Since we are developing a screening tool, a higher rate of false positives is tolerable so a stronger RBS is favourable.

Safety
As we are using bacteria to make our biomaterial 3D printer, our work needs to be safe. This is why we considered implementing a cell-lysis system inside of our design. Therefore it would be easy to activate the lysis and kill the cell.
We obtained very positive feedback. We had been afraid that people would be scared or wary towards our project, but it was surprising and gratifying to see that they were actually more intrigued and interested in what our printer could actually do. To even go further with the safety issue, we went to Brussels, to the European Union headquarters and met with Dr. Namorado, a member of the ethical board in the EU’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation. We discussed our project with her and explained our concern about safety. We reviewed together the EU’s Horizon 2020 ethical criteria and we made sure that our work was in compliance with it.
Environmental Impact
When designing our biomaterial 3D printer, we kept in mind the environmental impact, as we believe the era of plastic and other fossil-fuel based products is over. By working with 3 different biomaterials, produced by bacteria, we ensure that the end result will be totally biodegradable, and renewable by compost. We took this essential parameter into account while developing the market research. Biomaterials will be a key elements of the products of the future, and we want to replace polluting materials with eco-friendly, biocompatible ones.
Advice for iGEM Entrepreneurs
Our market research taught us a lot on the key aspects to keep in mind when building a start up. A lot we learnt was from Shazzad Mukit, a former iGEMer turned entrepreneur. We include here his advice and recommendations to future iGEM entrepreneurs!

Toronto,2013,Team:Toronto#elementss_-_-_TEXT.html," Their effects on the biofilm response were then observed and analysed  through a battery of assays looking at the levels of biofilm components.
The stimuli were administered and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 (±3) hours at 23  degrees Celsius, which is the optimum temperature for biofilm growth (insert reference here). As bacteria turn their environment acidic as a result of anaerobic metabolism, buffered LB was  used using the phosphate salts, potassium phosphate monobasic and potassium phosphate  dibasic. pH 7 was adjusted for using 0.1 M concentration in Luria Broth. The E. coli cells were  incubated in buffered LB to maintain pH 7 and eliminate the extraneous variable of acidity. The  stock solutions for the stimuli were also created in buffered LB to prevent uneven nutrient levels; the phosphate salts are a systematic error across all inoculations and can thus be ignored.
In continuation with the project, we are planning to optimize results by combining the treatments which give the best results.
Ethanol
Reasoning: Given the large quantity of literature on the effect of ethanol on biofilm, it is a very important  stimulus. The ethanol concentrations being tested in this experiment are 0.53% and 2%.  Cegelskiet al. (2012) found that the level of some proteins involved in biofilm formation  increases in the presence of ethanol. They also found UT189 strain colonies to be 55% larger  (colony morphology assay). Cell viability is compromised at concentrations exceeding 4%. Materials for Ethanol stimulus: • Overnight cultures of E. coli
•40% EtOH solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight culture of E. coli in phosphate buffered media.
2. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 4%EtOH in  buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final EtOH concentration of 1%.
3. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 15%EtOH  in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final concentration of  2%.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

Observations
It is urgent to develop easy and quick detection method given the significance of risks posed by antibiotic resistant pathogens. Research on the current status of containment strategies in the US and Korea make us reaffirmed that our project is worthwhile efforts to be pursued enthusiastically.  Our team at Elan Vital Korea is drawn by the idea that we may be able to rapidly and efficiently detect infection by antibiotics-resistant bacteria using a synthetic biology methodology, quorum sensing (QS).

It is a very good idea to have a searching engine for different projects, teams, biobricks,                                 etc. from previous years. It is effective – saves a lot of time which is very precious to                                 all of us. I liked design of user interface, especially the Gene Relationship part – quite                                 simple and elegant.
Team : XMU
School : XMU
The first interface is a very simple search box, the color and composition are very comfortable.The                                 diagram in Gene relationship lists the relationship between the relevant biobricks, and directly                                 experiences its related relationship.In general, the function is very comprehensive, but                                 because of its comprehensive function, the function of its project may be too basic and there                                 is room for improvement.

The search engine BioDesigner Dolphin, is very powerful. This function is so great as there                                 have not been any search engine that is serve for iGEM competition especially.

The searching function for wiki is excellent!! It is really a comprehensive system and it                                 was collected into the list of favorite pages as soon as I opened it.
Team : NKU_China
School : NKU
We are happy to try out the search engine made by team HFUT-China, it really gave us a great experience.                         By typing the keyword, selecting track and team categories, we can search the relevant teams’ information,                         including the team name, year, project introduction, awards, HP, part, or even links of related projects.                         It’s very convenient.
However, there are still some small problems about the page. Considering iGEM teams come from all                         over the world, we suggest adding a translate feature, putting some of the basic information out                         of the local dialect with the Google translation interface."

The primary question researched by our team was very broad; How can an iGEM project change the real world? This allowed us to explore a huge range of different areas, from safety to intellectual property right to public opinion, all of which contribute to the success of a synthetic biology project outside of the lab. Our team considered these by consulting with parties affected by these issues, including the Environment Agency, iGEM start-up companies, and members of the public (including full attributions to all experts and stake-holders who assisted us) to gain an insight into the problems which might hold back syn bio solutions from implementation in society. We used this information together with our own experiences to think about how these potential road blocks can be successfully navigated, by the syn bio community and by society as a whole.

Lab Project
Our lab project focused on the enhancement of a mechanosensitive channel called TRPC5. Since TRP channel had been found hair cells in ears [4] , our work may enlighten future hearing impairment therapies. In our project, we are developing a modified TRPC5 by random mutagenesis at specific region of the channel. With the accumulation effects of random mutagenesis (error-prone PCR), we may generate the TRPC5 mutant that has the highest fitness of the protein landscape [5] .
For a more detailed explanation of our project, see our home :)

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," graph in Figure 2, than in LB medium, seen in the left graph in Figure 2. Furthermore, when the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium with double amount of antibiotics compared to the LB medium, they displayed a higher level of fluorescence. Some of these observations could potentially be ascribed to the increased selection, that was strived after in this experiment. Moreover, the difference between the measured fluorescence levels for the two reporter systems was notably lower. This could indicate, that the reason behind the difference in expression levels between the weak and strong constitutive promoters, is due to the fact that bacteria cloned with the weak constitutive promoter are more prone to plasmid loss. However, it was observed that the bacteria expressing RFP under control of the weak promoter, did in fact fluoresce with a lower intensity.
To verify the hypothesis regarding the plasmid loss, the cultures were plated on 50 µg/mL ampicillin LA selection plates as well as LA plates without antibiotic, 12 hours after incubation start. For comparison, cultures containing either chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance cassettes, were likewise plated out after similar treatment. The average plasmid loss measured as non-resistant CFU as a percentage of the total population is seen Figure 3.
Figure 3. The average plasmid loss measured as non-resistant CFU as a percentage counts for the ampicillin resistance of the weak and strong promoter, as well as for chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance controls. Samples were obtained for spread-plating at 12 hours after incubation start.
From this test, it is evident that antibiotic resistance is reduced for the ampicillin-resistance carrying bacteria, compared to chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistant cultures. This consolidates the hypothesis, that the bacteria transformed with the weak and strong promoter controlling RFP expression lose their plasmids throughout growth. However, it was further observed, that the plasmid loss in bacteria carrying the strong constitutive promoter was markedly higher than for bacteria carrying the weak constitutive promoter. This could be due to the fact that RFP in high concentrations is toxic for the cells, resulting in an increased pressure to lose the plasmid.   The photocontrol device genes were, on the basis of the above mentioned promoter experiments, placed under control of the strong promoter BBa_J23102 . However, the observed plasmid loss should be taken into account, and compensated for, e.g. by continuous supply of antibiotic or substitution of the ampicillin resistance cassette. Furthermore, as a result of the irregular expression levels"

1) 3.0mm Ultra-Fine PE Sheet - mean pore size 14µm
2) 6.0mm Fine Grade PE Sheet - mean pore size 30µm
3) 4.5mm Medium Grade PE Sheet - mean pore size 88µm
according to materials sheet, the ultra-fine sheet is a bacterial barrier
Procedure:
1) cut each 100mm x 100mm sample with an exacto-knife into into disks approximately 100mm in diameter and inserted into petri dishes
2) added 10ml of LB and 40µl of chloranphenicol to each plate
3) incubated the plates overnight at 37C
Observations:
- 6.0mm fine grade sheet was to thick to cut with an exacto knife and so was not used
- both sheets did not absorb the LB immediately; the LB beaded on the surface
23-06-10
Observations:
- 7mL LB left from 3.0mm ultra-fine sheet (3mL absorbed)
- 8mL LB left from 4.5mm medium-grade (2mL absorbed)
- 3.0mm ultra-fine PE sheet with mean pore size 14µm is more absorptive
Procedure:
1) transferred both plastic disks into new, separate petri dishes
2) streaked plastic sheets with RFP-containing colonies
3) incubated in 37C overnight
24-06-10
- no growth after incubation
- plastic very dry
- plastic sheets deemed too hydrophobic to retain aqueous LB
Procedure:
1) rubbed small amount of ethanol onto each plastic disk
2) followed by rubbing in milli-Q water to decrease the surface tension
Observations:
- absorbency visibly increased
1) plastic was soaked in 95% ethanol and then put into the dessicator to dry out so that the plates are now reusable and sterile

Zoya Ignatova was our primary Principal Investigator. She is professor for biochemistry at the University of Hamburg and specified in RNA biochemistry,                                         in particular on tRNAs. She not only provided us the laboratories and equipment, but also helped with troubleshooting and through teaching us about translation profiled optimization, which we greatly needed for our experiments. While she advised us on all levels of the project, she also gave us a free hand in developing and executing our ideas. Without Professor Ignatovas great engagement for building up an iGEM team at our university we would never had the chance to realize such an extensive and ambitious project already in the second year of participation.

Frauke was our secondary Principal Investigator. She was always helpful and supported us with her lab experience every time we were confronted with problems and uncertainties. Thanks to her dedicated way to advise us, even members without any laboratory experience were able to adapt quickly.

Am wichtigsten ist uns Engagement - einiges davon (aber auch nicht unmenschlich viel). Es gibt immer irgendetwas zu tun und im Labor kann gar nicht genug gearbeitet werden. Du musst dich also darauf einstellen, dass iGEM im Verlauf des Sommersemesters und spätestens in der vorlesungsfreien Zeit einen größeren Teil deiner Freizeit konsumieren und ein mehrwöchiger Urlaub nicht möglich sein wird. Aus diesem Grund ist es auch wichtig, dass du im Verlauf des Sommersemesters möglichst keine Klausuren bewusst schiebst oder nachschreiben musst. Wenn dann Klausurphase ist, setzen wir die wöchentlichen Treffen aus und lassen die Zentrifugen ruhen, damit du in Ruhe lernen kannst - an iGEM sollen die Klausuren nämlich nicht scheitern.
Im Verlauf des iGEM-Wettbewerbs wird sich häufig die Gelegenheit bieten, etwas Neues zu lernen. Das fängt mit für dich neuen Labormethoden und dem Lesen von Papers an, geht über das Design von Postern, die Organisation von Reisen und endet mit dem Erstellen des Projekt-Wikis noch lange nicht. An solchen Stellen erwarten wir Eigeninitiative und Lernbereitschaft von dir - wobei dich das Team in solchen Situationen nicht im Stich lassen wird.
Was erwarten wir nicht? Laborerfahrung. Wir wissen, dass du bis zu deinem dritten Studiensemester vermutlich erst ein paar Stunden Praktikum in einem Labor hattest und noch nie ganz alleine im Labor gearbeitet hast - und das ist überhaupt kein Problem. Eines der Hauptziele unserer Teilnahme am iGEM-Wettbewerb ist das ungestörte Erlernen von Labormethoden in unserem Tempo. Es gibt keine unmittelbare Abgabefrist und auch keine Note für deinen Versuch, du kannst dir also gerne einen ganzen Vormittag für das Zusammenmischen eines PCR-Ansatzes lassen. Anders als im Uni-Praktikum können wir jedoch einfehlgeschlagenes Experiment nicht einfach so hinnehmen: wir arbeiten rein ergebnisorientiert. Das Experiment muss irgendwie gelingen, sonst bleibt unser Projekt stehen. Dein Notendurchschnitt ist ebenfalls unwichtig - für das Team ist wirklich nur"

Lab Work Strategies
The lab work executed would mainly be to induce sporulation in the presence of IPTG, and this would involve microscopy and testing cultures for sporulation (e.g. by their heat resistance).
Construction
Synthesised by GeneArt, fragment:  2024bp
Cloning
The fragment will be returned from GeneArt cloned into pGFG-rrnB. Once the fragment is received from GeneArt  we need to clone it into a BioBrick compatible vector for submission to MIT. Digesting the fragment with EcoR1 and Pst1 and ligation to EcoR1 and Pst1 cut biobrick vector will do this.
Integration
This is quite a difficult exercise because whilst pGFG-rrnB is designed to integrate at the amyE locus the presence of the native kinA on the 168 chromosome. The construct will preferentially integrate at kinA (disrupting it) rather than amyE.   A large number of transformants will need to be screened using starch plates and pcr to ensure that the correct mutants are selected that contain the construct integrated at only amyE. A backup strategy would be to integrate pMutin into the region immediately upstream of the native kinA ensuring that the native promoter and its control elements are preserved. The pSpac promoter would then be positioned upstream of kinA and therefore provide additional transcription in the presence of IPTG.
Testing and Characterisation
Once obtained, the mutant will need to be tested for the induction of sporulation in the presence of IPTG.  This would involve"

We also hosted two workshops where girls could earn different levels of the badge, based on their age. They got to streak RFP colonies onto agar plates, check out our confocal microscope, extract banana DNA, model the structure of DNA with candy, and learn about plasmids and the parts of a gene.
8. PLUS-S, July 20 -24; Incoming College Freshmen: Every summer, William & Mary holds a week-long program for incoming freshmen interested in scientific research. This summer, four of the participants shadowed us in our lab every day for two hours. They had the opportunity to be exposed to the world of research and help us perform procedures such as inoculations, minipreps, and transformations.
9. Robotics First Lego League, August 1: A student-led robotics team from Northern Virginia drove down to Williamsburg to visit our lab and learn about Synthetic Biology and how the engineering concepts they use in robotics can be applied to biology. They also performed lab protocols with us, saw the confocal microscope, modeled DNA and different types of cells using candy and cookies.

Running the gel for RFP and GFP bioricks
Today we prepared the gel with 0.8% agorose for last week's rescued plasmids which contain RFP and GFP biobricks. The final solution was 500ml using 4 gr of agorose in total.
We mixed 9ul of DNas with 1ul of the buffer and centrifuged shortly. The rest of the DNAs are then put back to the freezer.
Finally we run the gel. We loaded the ladder to the first and fourth wells, GFP to the 2nd and RFP to the 3rd well and set the voltage to 120V which was then reduced to 90V.
Below are the images:
Transformation of new biobricks
We prepared the agar plates and left the tubes including the biobricks for incubation overnight.
We checked the agar plates containing colonies of plasmids with five different biobricks from last week. We will be following Phil’s mini method for Alkaline Lysis for Mini Prep The list of plates and the biobricks are below:

TU-Delft,2012,Team:TU-Delft#receptordesign_-_-_TEXT.html,"What: Final check
Why: check, check, double check!
How: Align your final protein sequence to the original sequence of your receptor and the chimeric receptors (can be done by blasting too). Also look in http://tools.neb.com/NEBcutter2/ for forbidden restriction sites.
Now you can send you sequence to a synthesizing company or work with isolated DNA.
Example
For our example we take ORL2156, found on the olfactory database of the university of Yale.
2. The Elm server had the following output on a the protein sequence of ORL2156:
Globular domains/ TM domains and signal peptide detected by the SMART server
3. When looking at the cDNA code translated by expasy we indicate the yellow as the cut-off region --> Cut out the yellow parts:
5. Now the yellow parts are removed both in the cDNA and protein code, the check is not shown.
6. Here the sequence of I7 is added. For convenience we made it a picture.
7. Codon optimization is performed.
8. A very important aspect: adding features! This is of course totally dependant on the methods you want to integrate the designed receptor... So we will leave it to your own creativity.
9. The checking:
Protein alignment with original receptor:
Protein alignment with Rat receptor:
Region detection by the elm server:
Looks good! All alpha helices have 22 amino acids through the membrane. Now we can synthesize the construct or design primer to perform PCR on the species used. Also we can run the YASARA program to optimize the binding niche for the specific ligand and then synthesize!

Background Design Characterisation Datasheet Reference
Testing and Characterising
In vivo expression of our devices in E.coli MG1655
Our preliminary research indicated that carotenoids production in E.coli TOP10 was very weak. We decided to use another strain, E.coli MG1655, for in vivo expression of our devices. The amount of carotenoids produced became visibly higher. Generally, the colour became visible after incubation for about 12 hours.

E.coli MG1655 transformed with K274110 and grown on agar plate overnight.
Top: single colonies (enlarged). Bottom: Cell pellet of E.coli MG1655 transformed with K274210 (from 200mL LB culture at 37°C for 24 hours).

Top: single colonies (enlarged). Bottom: Cell pellet of E.coli MG1655 transformed with K274220 (from 200mL LB culture at 37°C for 24 hours).
Quantitative measurement of pigment production
In addition to visual inspection of coloured colonies, we hope to quantitatively measure the amount of lycopene or β-carotene produced by our devices. We grew transformed E.coli MG1655 in LB culture at 37°C for 24 hours and collected cell pellet by centrifugation. Acetone was added to the cell pellet and warmed at 50°C for 10 minutes, allowing carotenoids (lycopene or β-carotene) in the cells to dissolve. The acetone extracts were then put into MicroPlate Reader for a full photospectrum scan (wavelengths between 300nm and 800nm). The absorbance curves"

Results
Over the summer Team Magneto worked hard and some of the preset goals were successfully accomplished. Here we show and explain you our main results.
Quick Overview
MamC-eGFP: the functionality of the eGFP part of the fusion was proven, regarding the MamC part only the expected size of the protein could be shown
MamC alone couldn’t be further characterized
eGFP: the functionality and autenticity of the protein could be shown
eFbFP: the submitted BioBrick couldn’t be successfully characterized
MamC-eGFP
MamC (BBa_K1094001) from Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum (MS-1) was tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP, BBa_K1094400). Between the parts a glycine linker (10 glycine residues) is added. The gene product can be used to detect localization of MamC in MS-1.  The two parts were cloned together using classical cloning and the composite part was subsequently cloned into pJAM1786 using the Gateway system. Colony PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed to ensure the insert was in the vector (Fig.1).
Figure 1: Colony PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed to ensure the insert was in the vector. The figure shows clear bands at around the expected size of 1.2 kb
In order to demonstrate that the fusion protein was both expressed and functional, we made an SDS page followed by western blot analysis and we also observed a fluorescence signal by using confocal microscopy. Moreover, fluorescence measurements were made on the ELISA reader.
Figure 2: Western Blot analysis of transformed E.coli cultures with anti-GFP antibody. Shows expected band of MamC-eGFP at around 45 kDa and a band for cleaved off eGFP at around 32 kDa.
The western blot analysis (Fig.2) shows the presence of two bands, one at around 45 kDa and the other one at approximately 32 kDa"
BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#CholeraDetection#Fallexp#Period2#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," purification procedure failed again. Spot tests looking for plaques from lambda did not yield any plaques.
The most important observation of Saturday was E.Coli SdiA-knockout strain with transformed pIG96 plasmid, plated next to cholera, does NOT produce a green GFP response.  The plasmid pIG96 contains GFP behind the YdiV promoter, which is activated by SdiA.  So, we expected NOT to see a colorimetric response; thankfully, there was none.
Today we started overnight cultures of TT9901 and TT9907 with lambda lysogens, to attempt once again to purify the phage.
We also plated SdiA-positive E.Coli with transformed pIG96 next to cholera.  We hope to see a green response tomorrow, indicating that E.Coli is detecting V.cholerae's AHL molecule through SdiA.
We have divvied out assignments for our poster and presentation.  We go to Canada in a week and a half!
9/25/13
Today we isolated lambda from our infected plates. Our previous attempts to isolate lambda have been unsuccessful and we believe that it may be because they are coming in contact with the hydrogen peroxide that we are using to induce lysis. To fix this, we cut out the part of the plate containing the hydrogen peroxide and then we flooded the plate with LB. After isolating the phage, we then infected a top agar plate containing our TT25281 with cro with a sample from our isolated phage to make sure that we did indeed isolate phage.
Today we tried to measure the amount of fluorescence from our SdiA modified construct placed in contact with cholera, but there was something wrong with the plate reader and we will try again on Friday with a different type of plate.
We also streaked cholera onto 3 plates. One patch to be streaked next to SdiA+ plus lambda, one with SdiA- plus lambda, and one with the ydiV strain against cholera.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Calculation_-_-_TEXT.html," Idea
For model design, please refer to Design part . Data of the curve Er-time is obtained from Ec=K∙Er experiments. The function of our model is to work out the proportion factor 'K'.
Basic Assumption
The expression of RFP and GFP are independent.
The expression of the two proteins are determined by the percentage of normal and orthogonal ribosomes rather than the number of the two ribosomes.
The growth curve of bacteria do not change significantly after the transferred into orthogonal protein expression system.
Formula Derivation
We start from Formula 1 and 2. In Formula 1, m stands for the number of mRNA transcript, Rtot is the total number of ribosomes, β is the apparent Boltzmann constant, ∆Gtot is the total change of Gibbs free energy, k is proportion factor.
Because the GFP and RFP coding sequence are on the same mRNA transcript, the values of m of GFP and RFP are always same. In different state and time, the total number of ribosomes varies. We assume that at the same time Rtot of different state remain same. Calculation of DGtot is the main job of this model. The proportion factor 'k' represents all unknown factors. Here we assume that as for the same protein in deferent state 'k' varies little.
The Calculation
Control State (c)
Figure 1. Diagram for control state
The two formulas above serve as denominators in following deduction. We get series of disjointed data of Function 3 and 4 through experiments. The amount of GFP and RFP can't be measured directly so we measured the fluorescence intensity of each protein. And because all the formula in this model are based on a singular cell, we must consider the influence caused by the number and growing condition of bacteria.
Experimental state 1 (E1)
Figure 2. Diagram for experimental state 1
The expression of GFP is composed of two part, the expression of n-RBS::n-16S and of n-RBS::o-16S.
There is no difference for the expression of GFP in Experimental state ONE from the control state, except for the distribution of ribosomes. For this reason, we presume that kc1,G and kr,G are nearly equal and thus Kc1,G equal to 1. The same thought is also shown in following derivation.
We noticed that the proportion factors in equation 6 and 8 are equal, which is not a coincident.  This is because ΔG3,G-ΔG1,G≈ΔG3,R-ΔG1,R."

Overview
We cloned Dre, VCre, SCre, and Vika generators into Biobrick format, removing all illegal sites when necessary.
We assembled T7-LacO-Cre generator and cloned it into Biobrick format.
We successfully assembled 12 out of 15 of measurement constructs to allow users to quantify recombinase activity                     in vivo.
We assembled 10 target sites for Cre and proved their functionality in vitro. We also assembled the target                     sites for Dre, VCre, SCre, and Vika – Rox, VLox, SLox, and Vox respectively. Their functionality is proved                     by the measurement constructs.
We have extensively quantified the recombination efficiency of the five recombinases in E. coli.
We have built software and used it to design assembly methods for six logic gates using tyrosine recombinase.
We have built deterministic and stochastic modeling to simulate the behavior of site-specific recombinase.                     We also devised an algorithm to detect potential recombination sites in a genome.
We have conducted an investigation into interdisciplinarity. This includes a survey to identify challenges                     in interdisciplinary work, and a systematic analysis of past iGEM teams, to test correlation between                     interdisciplinarity and iGEM achievement.
We have integrated the result from the interdisciplinarity study to improve accessibility of SMORE in four                     aspects: readability, hardware, user experience and data.

Cloning Dre, VCre, SCre, Vika
Using PCR mutagenesis, we have successfully removed the illegal XbaI site from all four recombinases.
We then cloned the T7-LacO-regulated recombinases into biobrick format. For SCre, there are two illegal PstI                 sites within the coding sequence (CDS), and for VCre, there is one illegal PstI site within the CDS. We have                 successfully removed all the illegal sites.
We submitted all four recombinases as T7-LacO-regulated generator, in pSB1"

SCUT-China_A,2016,Team:SCUT-China A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"4S pathway has become a major obstacle to BDS. Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway have majot inhibition effect on Dsz enzymes. HBP strongly inhibits the activity of enzyme DszA DszB and DszC; HBPS has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC, but only in the early stages in the BDS. The reason is that, when the concentration of HBP increases, the inhibition of HBP will become the major one. And some researchers have found that enzyme DszC is inhibited by HBP and HBPS noncompetitively, and the substrate DBT also has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC. Due to the limited high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detector resolution, the mechanisms of how the effects are brought by HBP to DszA, DszB are still unable to be determined.
(1) The determination of kinetic parameters:
2.2 Determination of related parameters
1).The catalytic pathway of DszA，DszB，DszD can be described as enzymatic reaction based on traditional Michaelis kinetic theory. The kinetic data can be fitted by Michaelis equation:
In the equation, v is the catalytic rate of enzymes, kcat is conversion number, [E0] is the concentration of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of substrates, Km is Michaelis constant, and Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes.
2)Because DszC is inhibited by substrate DBTs, the Michaellis equation is no longer fit. We could only use substrate inhibition equantion to fit the gained data:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Using the fitting statistics of MATLAB, we obtain many kinetic parameters of different Dsz-enzymes.
Table 1: The major kinetic parameters of Dsz-enzymes:
(2) The determination of related parameters in four major inhibition reactions:
1).The determination of IC50：
The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the expression, vi is the catalytic rate of enzyme when concentration of inhibitor is [I], and v0 is that without enzymes，IC50 is the inhibitor’s concentration which makes the enzyme’s activity reduce to 50%, comparing to the original one.

The later antidiuretic properties of arginine vasopressin are the most biologically important, exerting therapeutic effects in the kidney and the vascular system and therefore being widely used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus.  G- coupled protein receptor (GPCR) agonists such as vasopressin, account for 40% of prescription pharmaceuticals on the market and are the core of medicine as GPCRs are the most investigated target sites in the pharmaceutical industry.  For these reasons and for its simplicity to assay, it has been chosen as a candidate to test the efficacy of the new technology.  Calcium ion assays are used to detect the activation of GCPRs as they are naturally produced upon activation of GPCRs coupled to Gq, the G protein involved in the activation of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1 that causes vasoconstriction. Increased intracellular calcium levels infer that the peptide has been produced and expressed.  Screening for adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger produced when the receptor is activated, indicates the presence of a peptide such as vasopressin that has triggered this activation with the coupling of G proteins. Luminescent tags bind to the cAMP to allow for its detection.

Jiangnan_China,2018,Team:Jiangnan China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," with corporates, we have gained a lot and what we learned played an important guiding role in the follow-up experiments.
（1）On June 20th ------- Yakult   Location: Wuxi, Jiangsu
    At Yakult, we understand the great benefits of probiotics for human health. Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.
（2）On June 29th ------- Meiji   Location: Suzhou, Jiangsu
    First, we watched the propaganda film of Meiji and learned about the company's products, market and corporate culture. Then, we visited the company's workshop under the guidance of the staff. The streamlined production made us feel the advanced technology of the company. After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.
（3）On July 9th ------- Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd   Location: Zibo, Shandong
    Firstly we went to Xinhua pharmaceutical company. At this company, we learned that most of their current drugs are still relatively common drugs, and they are also used in the traditional way of taking drugs. However, some drugs need to be prepared in the form of coating, and need to control the time and dosage, which is not very convenient. Also, the granules are relatively large. We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.
（4）On July 10th  ------- Shandong Vland Biotechnology Co. Ltd
    Later, we went to Vland biotech company to discuss the problem of frozen stress in the process of microbial fermentation and preservation and transportation. Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lactobacillus lactis in anti-acid and anti-freezing are self-evident. And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.

Popular video about phase separation in biology
We made a popular video about phase separation in biology to introduce it to more people studying the subject. We posted it on several websites in China and many undergraduates and graduates were introduced to phase separation through our video. We also found it necessary to communicate more about basic knowledge of different disciplines in the area of systems biology. This is arguably the best way in which people can learn about the system they work on and cooperate better with each other.

Making low-cost experimental instruments
We found that it is an essential problem in synthetic biology to fill the gap between foundational research and practical applications. We hope that our human practice can offer some possible solutions for this problem. Taking our time and energy into consideration, we chose a minor project – the design and usage of low-cost equipment, as the main subject.
Most of the results of iGEM research have been achieved in the laboratory, but there’s a big difference between the laboratory environment and real-life use. For example, it is very common to use a microscope in the laboratory, but people rarely get access to a microscope in production, due to the significant expense it entails. Can differences like this be an impediment for the translation of laboratory achievements to industrial production? What can we do about these problems?
We talked with Professor Xu Luping from Tsinghua University, who designed a low-cost microscope that can be produced using a 3D-printer. The interviews revealed that most of the parts are easy to be obtain, and they are also not difficult to assemble. We talked about the possible applications of this kind of microscope and the probability of expanding this cheap technology to fluorescence microscopes.
Low-cost microscope transformed from a 3D printer made by Prof. Xu Luping
So far, this kind of low-cost microscope is still conceptual, and is mainly used for popular science or education, but it is still helpful to future work. From professor Xu’s point of view, realizing a possibility in engineering is of great significance in itself. This has enlightened us to summarize some abstract and modularized ‘potential properties"
TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," system, where the filter would separate the fresh from salt water. This separation of salt and fresh was not acquired. This was due to the salt water added on one side of the alginate filter, it leaked to the other side, which didn’t allow the possibility of adding fresh water. The voltmeter did measure a voltage of 10 mV, but the Groningen team stated that the this was caused by the carrier material, which produces a voltage of around 10-12 mV by itself. Therefore it could not be concluded that the alginate filter was selective for sodium ions.
Thanks to the help of Gronigen, we are able to state that our Biolinker (3D-printer) is indeed an open-source platform technology, since Groningen was able to print their bacteria, B.subtilis, by themselves. The Groningen team wasn’t able to prove that their filter was selective for ions, due to the fact that the filter made let water molecules pass through.
We would like to thank the iGEM Groningen team for their time, bacteria and for the great dinner we had afterwards.
Dutch iGEM Teams Meeting
Preparatory starting course for all the Dutch iGEM teams of 2015
On the 26th and 27th of March 2015 there were two training days for all the iGEM teams of the Netherlands. The teams invited were Groningen, TU Eindhoven, and TU Delft.  Both days were filled with different lectures, on the 26th at the University of Groningen, and on the 27th at TU Delft.
We left the Delft station early in the morning, prepared for a long train ride. Without any delays we arrived in Groningen by 11am and were warmly welcomed with tea,coffee, and biscuits. Aljoscha Wahl started with a general introduction to iGEM, and we were introduced to the members of the other teams.  It was really nice to meet them all and learn about all the different backgrounds.  The first speaker was  Renske van Raaphorst who gave a lecture about how to be successful in iGEM. She had participated in the iGEM competition in 2012 with the team of Groningen, and  won the grand prize that year.  She summarized what they had done and how their project had proceeded from beginning to end. It was very surprising how many obstacles they encountered and how they solved them. She gave us a few good tips how to approach problems and avoid stress moments. Clement Gallay continued with a general"

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#firsttry#Project#Killing Improvement_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP to the MVN and we did the experiment with two different strains of cyanobacteria.
We used pET-21a(+) as the vector to construct a plasmid for the expression of the His6-tagged version of MVN-eYFP (see Fig. 4) During construction, we retained the promoter, RBS, His&#8901Tag and terminator that were on the original vector. We inserted MVN and eYFP coding sequence into the plasmid via Gibson Assembly. After the construction, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and induced afterwards to initiate the expression. After lysing the cells, the crude extracts were applied to Ni2+-nitriloacetate columns and the fusion protein was purified and later used in our binding assay.
Figure 4. Final construct of the protein-purifying plasmid. The promoter, RBS and terminator are native ones on the pET-21a(+) vector. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein domain linker added to avoid protein interference between MVN and eYFP.
The purified protein was later used in binding assay with two different strains of cyanobacteria, M. aeruginosa PCC7806 and M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cyanobacteria colony were broken up by mild sonication at first. The protein was added to aliquots of cyanobacteria culture and later observed under fluorescence microscope. (Results here)
rTEV protease digestion assay
INP can help display our protein on the outer membrane, but the orientation is unsure. So we designed this rTEV protease digestion assay to verify that MVN is oriented outwards into the medium. Also we can roughly estimate the amount of outward-displayed MVN that can be digested each E. coli from the result too.
We constructed the functioning plasmid by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The plasmid uses pSB1C3 as the vector and expresses the fusion protein INPNC-MVN-mRFP. We designed a 7aa protein linker named Linker2 between INPNC and MVN which can be specifically recognized and digested by rTEV protease. Also, there is a Linker1 between MVN and mRFP to ensure that the fluorescence is not affected. The coding sequence is regulated by the promoter J23105, the RBS B0034 and the terminator B0015. We transformed the plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) after the construction work.

HAFS,2018,Team:HAFS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," PLOS is a journal affiliated with iGEM foundation, that allows free access to all published materials. As an aspiring scientist who always had difficult times dealing with journals that costs over $100, we were definitely impressed by the goal of PLOS. Furthermore,This collaboration project was a great opportunity that allowed us to encounter numerous researches that we had never seen before.
    To participate in this collaboration, we started to search a fitting research from Public Library of Science (PLOS).  After much consideration, we selected a research about “Why Treatment Fails in Type 2 Diabetes,” which was written by Anders Rosengren, Xingjun Jing, Lena Eliasson, and Erik Renström. This article was containing several specific parts with Type 2 Diabetes: Failing Insulin Secretion in Type 2 Diabetes, Secondary Failure of Sulfonylurea Treatment, Using Slow-Release Sulfonylurea Pellets in a New In Vivo Model, Pros and Cons of the Present Study, and Clinical Implications. Summarizing this article had several difficulties. Although this experiment was tangentially related to our team’s topic, our Team had to learn this experiment with more depth to interpret. In addition, because we had to create our summarize without hard scientific jargons, swapping this complicated article with plain language was another barrier in this collaboration. Nevertheless, we successfully completed a posting in a title of “ Down but not out: insulin-producing cells can bounce back after drug treatment.” Through this collaboration, we are glad to assist in blog activity which can play a role of spreading valuable scientific articles in intelligible terms.
    The following is the short blog post that we have submitted to the collaboration project! You can read the research article that we discussed here and the original study here.
Title: Down but not out: insulin-producing cells can bounce back after drug treatment
    Insulin is a hormone produced by cells in the pancreas called beta-cells. Insulin keeps blood sugar levels from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia). Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body either doesn’t produce enough insulin (Type 1) or cannot use the insulin it does produce (Type 2). Managing blood sugar levels is important as high blood sugar can cause complications such as kidney disease, eye disease, heart attack, or nerve damage. Diabetes management includes monitoring physical activity, nutrition, weight, stress, and blood pressure. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin, and Type 2 may require insulin and/or other medications. One such group of"

Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#market overview_-_-_TEXT.html," cattle produced, 45% were exported to other countries. Alberta produces 39.3% of beef cattle in Canada. Beef Production contributed $25.96 billion to the Canadian economy and beef exports were valued at $1.33 billion.
Cattle in Canada are subject to quality and health testing, which includes the monitoring of disease and meat quality. BEAR modular design gives us the opportunity to integrate into the livestock agriculture industry because we can alter BEAR to detect hormones relevant to the livestock industry, such as pregnancy and growth hormones. The company interviewed researchers and commercialization specialists at the Lethbridge Research Centre for agriculture, who saw the devise as a useful tool and identified areas of application in both livestock agriculture research and industry. We predict that use in the livestock industry will be our highest revenue source.
Total annual costs to establish and operate a medical device manufacturing facility in Canada are the lowest in the G-7. Canada holds a 4.8% cost advantage over the United States in medical device manufacturing. 11 12
The Canadian medical equipment and supplies market analyzes manufacturers of these supplies. 13 Equipment and supplies monitored in this market range from prosthetics and eyeglasses to dialysis tubing and syringes. Our product would fit into this market as a disposable testing tool.
Figure 2: Canada health care equipment and supplies market value forecast: $ million, 2011-2016
The performance of the market is forecast to accelerate, with an anticipated CAGR of 5.3% for the five-year period 2011 - 2016, which is expected to drive the market to a value of $13.2 billion by the end of 2016.
The manufacturing of medical devices involves the application of diverse biomedical and engineering disciplines. 14 In addition, the industry is able to draw on world-class innovative research being conducted in Canadian universities, research institutes and hospitals, some of which is spun-off into Canadian medical device companies. 15 16
This statement speaks strongly to who Synbiologica is and the direction in which the company intends to move.

Below are two examples of structures that were found to match regions in the coding sequence of the SYFP2. It is apparent that false positives will appear when using a reporter system that itself can be repressed, but by modelling interactions with the target mRNA, we save much time knowing which sRNAs are not of direct interest for downregulation of the actual target gene.
sRNA UU52
sRNA basepairing to reporter gene SYFP2
∆G =  -28.3kcal/mol
Length in base pairs =82
Number of hybridizing base pairs =10
Maximum number of hybridizing bases in a row = 6
∆G = -5.6 kcal/mol
sRNA UU53
sRNA basepairing to reporter gene SYFP2
∆G =  -34.5 kcal/mol
Length in base pairs =85
Number of hybridizing base pairs =21
Maximum number of hybridizing bases in a row =9
∆G = -10.9kcal/mol
Although a randomized library was used to find an optimized sRNA for the downregulation of sRNA, we asked ourselves how an sRNA with perfect complementarity to the RBS and UTR region would work. This complementary sRNA was synthesized and we tested its function.  The results were not simple to decipher, because it seems that this sRNA targets more than the AAC(6’) UTR. The construct confered a large fitness cost on the bacteria, with very slow growth and all sorts of different colony morphologies and measurements of SYFP2 activity on the reporter strain. Some results showed a significant decrease in SYFP2 activity, while measurements of a different clone showed only moderate to non existing downregulation of SYFP2.
In addition to this, the sRNA selected from the random library seemed to have secondary structure on the hybridizing part, while the optimal secondary structure of our perfectly matching sRNA is without any base pairing within the antisense region. This makes us speculate that this sRNA might have unspecific base pair matching with many different bacterial mRNAs.
The approach to construct a perfect complementary is maybe not the best way to make a working sRNA, because there are so many other mechanisms involved that are difficult to predict.

Human Practices (Gold)
To get advice to develop CascAID, we contacted several experts in different areas of diagnostics and synthetic biology.
Interview with Dr. Keith Pardee
Dr. Keith Pardee is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto who works at the interface of synthetic biology and human health. His research focuses on moving synthetic biology outside of the cell.  Rather than using cells to host engineered genetic programs, his group is creating programmable materials with the transcription and translation properties of a cell.
In the early phases of our project, we found a study from Dr. Keith Pardee about a diagnostic platform that used biomolecular sensors and a CRISPR/Cas9-based technology for rapid, specific, and low-cost detection of the Zika virus (Pardee, 2016). We took inspiration from this study together with others to develop CascAID. That is why we decided to reach him and he accepted to do a Skype-interview with us. He was impressed with our ambitious project and we received very useful feedback. One of his suggestions, was that we should make our device as simple as possible in the beginning and then gradually increase level of complexity. For that reason, he suggested us to first use purified RNA that mimicked our target at high concentrations, instead of using human samples. At the beginning we intended to use human saliva samples spiked with known concentrations of viral and bacterial RNA. However, after Dr. Pardee´s recommendation, we opted to first detect the 16S ribosomal subunit from Escherichia coli from purified total RNA and in vitro RNA.
When we presented him our readout ideas (fluorescence and colorimetric), he told us that the fluorescent readout would be enough to prove that our device worked. Also, he recommended us to implement trehalose as a cryoprotectant in our method to lyophilize Cas13a onto paperstrip. Since this carbohydrate is present in tardigrades, we contacted Team TU Delft , who is working on a project similar to ours and uses tardigrade proteins, for"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"
