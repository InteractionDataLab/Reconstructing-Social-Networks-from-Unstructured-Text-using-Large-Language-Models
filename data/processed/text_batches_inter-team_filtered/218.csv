Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," the cytosolic and the mitochondrial form, encoded by two different genes. The reaction catalyzed by the cytosolic enzyme is a part of the biosynthesis of cholesterol. In mitochondria the same reaction is responsible for keton body formation. Sterol regulatory elements in the promoter region of the gene are responsible for transcriptional regulation [41] .
PUMA
P53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is protein belonging to the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic proteins. P53 plays an important role both in p53 dependent and p53 independent apoptosis. The activation of PUMA leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation [1]. PUMA is regulated by many transcription factors (TF), these TFs in turn are regulated by extra and intra cellular stimuli like genotoxic stress, toxins, oncogene expression, redox status and growth factors [42] .
Hsp70
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is an enzyme helping other proteins to fold. Hsp70 proteins are found not only in the cytosol but also in mitochondria and in the endoplasmatic reticulum. The protein binds, together with the cochaperone Hsp40, to newly synthesised (hydrophobic) amino acid residues and prevents the aggregation of those. During cellular stress e.g. oxidative or thermal stress proteins may unfold, Hsp70 binds to the hydrophobic regions of the proteins and prevents further unfolding, aggregation and apoptosis [43] .
Apo A-IV
Apolipoprotein A-IV (Apo A-IV) is a glycoprotein secreted by the small intestine in humans. The production of Apo A-IV is activated through lipid absorption (Chylomicrons). Several studies indicate that Apo A-IV protects against atherosclerosis. It is also thought to be involved in regulation of food intake [44] .
CYP1A1
Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is an enzyme which is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling pathway.  The transcription is also influenced by metal ions and oxidative stress. CYP1A1 catalyzes two of three critical steps in transformation of benz[a]pyren to the carcinogen BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide.  Furthermore CYP1A1 is involved in processes like xenobiotic metabolism and drug degradation [45] .

Response to Bio-luminescence：
A Quick Proof of Concept
As shown in Figure 1, GFP expression was repressed by the Luminesensor expressed in light sensing cells under either bio-luminescence (1) or dim LED (3) (as the positive control), indicating that the light-sensing cell can sense bio-luminescence quite well. The cells in our set-up with no light emitting cells (2), or just inoculated test tubes wrapped with aluminum foil (4) have expressed GFP, indicating that our device wrapped with aluminum foil effectively excludes the influence of other sources of light.
Figure 1. The treatment to each group(upper) and the result(lower).   1 and 2 contain cells grown in the communication set-up, but for group 2 there is no light emitting cell in the conical flask but only wild-type DH5α. 3 and 4 contain the same light sensing cells grown in test tubes under dim LED (3) or in pure darkness (4).
To obtain more quantitative data, we measured the GFP expression level using a Tecan infinite 200 reader. As is shown in the graph below (Figure 2), the expression level of GFP in darkness (in our device with no glowing cells) is about 200-fold higher than that of the cells under bio-luminescence.

However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a problem: after some hours the LB-agar/agarose started to shrink and dried out. Thus, the agar-design cannot be used without modifications for experiments of longer duration.
In an attempt we only left a small agar fragment in each channel and filled the rest with liquid medium, so as to decrease chance of it drying out, while avoiding at the same time that bacteria from one chamber reach the other chamber.
The bead-design consists of an alginate bead for each chamber and liquid medium in between. The beads either contained regulator/sensor-bacteria or AHL.

Week 14 : Diffusion experiments started, simulated with Comsol, and fitting of quorum sensing dynamics
Monday, August 25th
We carried diffusion experiment with different designs : punched PDMS, liquid, beads. For every design we added high concentrations of pure AHL in the sender well, so cells are glowing a lot. However because of this high concentration, diffusion is very high and at a given AHL concentration, receiving cells are glowing at the same time for all 4 channel lengths. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We have a Comsol simulation for these experiments that explains why at this concentration of AHL (1mM), all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. Check this article for more details.
We could fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP thanks to quorum sensing dynamic curves.

Fitting quorum sensing dynamic curves
Monday, August 24th
We could use quorum sensing dynamic curves to fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP. We fitted the experimental results for lux with riboregulator and thus didn't consider leakiness (we showed leakiness was low enough in that case when fitting quorum sensing Hill function parameters ). By writing GFP production rate and replacing AHL in this equation by $$[AHL]=[AHL_i]-[AHL_{bound}]$$ we find  $$\frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}]\Big(-1+\sqrt{1+8\frac{AHL_i}{K_{d3}}}\Big)^2}{16\frac"

Is it appropriate to refer to them as amilCP variants, when amilCP is by definition blue? Or does a single mutation make them their own entity? If so, is it incorrect to class these mutants as “improvements” of the wild type? Read more discussion on the Theory of Knowledge page!
Business & Applied Design
We took the biocircuitry of our biosensor that we made in the lab, and turned to engineering to design and assess the viability of a final biosensor product. This involved considering optimisation, immobilisation techniques, potential designs, initial sketches and prototyping. We also pitched our idea to a range of potential consumers, and worked with them to evolve our design. From there, a full plant sizing and costing was done to assess if the investment would provide a worthwhile return.  For more about the business side of things, see the Business Plan page under Keep Fresh, or visit Applied Design for more biosensor design.
Outreach & Public Engagement
We engaged with people from as young as 4 years of age, up to 65+ years of age, and many between! Through numerous social events and workshops, we successfully taught thousands of people about synthetic biology, the importance of not squeezing fruit to see if it’s ripe, and introduced them to our project. To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Outreach page.
Survey
We conducted a survey on fresh produce consumption habits to gain an insight into the context of our project firsthand. We engaged with over 260 people from over 16 countries – at least one from every continent (except Antarctica)!
It was a great way to directly engage with other iGEM participants too, and generate global interest in our project.
Government
As our project involves the use of biological materials in the context of the food industry, we investigated the government legislation behind microorganisms, especially genetically modified organisms (GMOS).The Australian government regulates GMOs in food through Standard 1.5.2 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. Certain permitted GMOs are described in the subsection 1.5.2-3, which states:
A food for sale may consist of, or have as an ingredient, a food produced using gene technology if the food produced using gene technology:
• (a) is listed in Schedule 26 and complies with any corresponding conditions listed in that Schedule;
• or (b) is a substance that is permitted for use as a food additive by Standard 1.3.1 or as a processing aid by Standard 1."

Yi WU
Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.

Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Tomorcolumn is another day.
Yuqing is a sophomore majoring in biology at UCAS.
The year just passed witnessed the vigorous gcolumnth of her, which was due to the learning and working experience with iGEM team members.
While she used to be quiet and nervous, experience in iGEM really changed her a lot. Now, she has been more outgoing and warm-hearted, and never afraid to face challenges and difficulties.
She still enjoys reading and traveling alone, but becomes more open to new friends and new ideas.

I will go to bed before "
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Symposia_-_-_TEXT.html," we talked about in class theoretically. Because to see it and do it myself put it into a state of reality that made much more sense than a thing that you just talk about. It was very nice and interesting to do experiments in a real laboratory and to imagine being a biologist who wants to find the biological origin of an unknown sample. And generally to know that something like this is possible is fascinating. I would like to do something like this again and I would suggest to do it with my friends.

9th - 11th May 2012 4th Annual Meeting of Senior Experts of Chemistry (GDCh)
After the project of the iGEM team of TU Darmstadt stood firm and the beginning of lab work came up, the team had the opportunity to present their project to the elder people. The Society for German Chemists (GDCh) organizes every year a meeting of senior experts in chemistry. At this congress, the team could occur with three posters and convince the elderly from their project ""Next Generation Recycling"". The project met with great interest, and there were long discussions about costs and feasibility of it. It was not unusual that present chemists themselves were involved in the production of plastics or on the other hand developed new chemical-based recycling processes on it. Many did not know the way of seeing things with the view of biology yet and were surprised what opportunities this new view offered. The iGEM team quickly realized that it is not easy to convince a chemist from biology. It was easy to explain the degradation of the polymer with its chemical structure, but it is more difficult to explain genetics and even more the BioBrick system. Nonetheless was the presentation a huge success and they were able to convince the elder people of the idea. It was not only convincing the people for the project, but also the discussion about the new topic of Synthetic Biology, which is a contrary topic in Germany. It was important for the team to achieve not only one group of residents in Germany but as many as possible. For the team it was necessary to inform the people about new scientific technologies in a true and open way. Chemists, who are still working and dealing with the recycling of waste, came to the team and wanted to know, if the project could be extended to other substances. It turns out that the method of bioremediation is not used in its maximum manner and there are a lot more tasks outside to deal with. So the project of the iGEM team of Darmstadt is a hint into to the future and could soon find its application"

Experiments:
See Proof of concept experiment.
Message sequence in pDR111
The message sequence was ordered as a gBlock from IDT to construct the message B.   subtilis strain. In a first approach this was done with the pDR111 B.   subtilis integration plasmid, which can also be amplified by E. coli.   Therefore the first step was to clone the message sequence into the pDR111 in E. coli. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome.   By double cross-over it replaces amyE gene, which is necessary for production of alpha-amylase   (see Subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de )       with desired insert which is located between amyE front flanking region and amyE back flanking region. See the plasmid map below. We used this plasmid for integration of our message sequence into the B. subtilis 168 sub+. The other approach made use of the BioBrick integration plasmid BBa_K823023 (Message sequence in BBa_K823023) .

Experiment:
25/07/16: The message sequence was amplified from gBlock ordered from IDT (Integrated DNA technologies).Primers used for the amplification were F-message sequence and R-message sequence (primer sequences can be found here ).

Safety
Safety has always been an important concern in our laboratory, both in project design and operations during experiment process. This year we used two kinds of Escherichia coli (DH5α in part construction and MG1655 in project). According to the official iGEM guidelines of Risk Groups , E. coli is categorized as a Risk Group 1 organism that ""do not cause disease in healthy adult humans"" when used properly. Also, The risk group level of E. coli is correspondent with our laboratory safety level (Safety Level 1). To make sure that everything is safe enough, we have seriously managed Individual Safety, Environmental Safety, Biological Safety based on project as well as Safe Shipping.
Individual Safety
All members participating in the iGEM project this year have taken safety training courses given by the department experiment center that we acknowledged general safety managements such as fire-fighting strategies, disposition of biochemical materials, proper usages of microwave oven, laminar flow bench and other apparatus.
All members have carefully read Safe Project Design , Safe Lab Work , Safe Shipment and other requirements proposed by iGEM Safety Committee . We filled up the Final Safety Form according to the real situation in our laboratory.
Nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes were strictly required in laboratory to prevent potential threats of personal health.
Resting area and Experiment area were clearly separated to confine eating and drinking strictly in resting area.
Environmental Safety
Biological materials were not allowed to be taken outside the laboratory without sterilization. All of the used materials (bacterial samples, plasmids, reagents, agar, etc.) after experiments were sterilized before leaving the laboratory and collected altogether for further management.
Regular cleaning of the laboratory trash was arranged every day to maintain a clean and tidy laboratory environment.
Biological Safety Concerns based on project
With the advent of synthetic biology, genetically modified microorganisms are being increasingly used for biomedical, industrial and environmental applications. Deployment of these engineered microbes in large scales and open environments calls for the development of safe and secure means to restrain their proliferation.
This summer, we added mf-lon ssrA tag into 5 essential genes using CRIPSR/Cas9 method. By applying gene circuits to control mf-lon protease expression under the assigned"
Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#beta-carotene_-_-_TEXT.html," 2), which optimized production from the biosynthetic pathway and ensured that there would be little to no effect on growth [11] .
Overexpression of this pathway has been reported in the past to be toxic to E. coli. potentially due to the hijacking of intermediates in this essential metabolic pathway. [12] . We thus decided against using solely the strongest promoters we had available to us and instead used several promoters of differing strengths. We decided to use native S. thermophilus promoters, specifically p25 , p32 and pHLBA , which retain function in E. coli .  This allows for transformation of E. coli and S. thermophilus using the same assembled biobrick and potentially comparing promoter activity between the 2 bacteria.  While assemblying and quantifying β-carotene in E. coli we also decided to make use one of the well characterised anderson promoters J23106 and so assembled this upstream of K2151200.  We did this to provide a reference point to see how effective our chosen promoters were.
Quantification
Once we had successfully transformed E. coli with our putative β-carotene constructs (Figure 3), we wanted to quantify the levels of β-carotene production from each of the promoter variants to determine whether:
A – transformation with our biobrick results in the production of β-carotene B - the promoters of varying strength cause any notable increase in this production
We extracted β-carotene using Acetone Extraction .  The absorbance of this extraction fragment was subsequently measured at 454nm (figure 4A), the peak of β-carotene absorbance (Figure 4B).
Figure 4.  β-carotene quantification in gene constructs. A - Once extracted, β-carotene levels were quantified by measuring the absorbance of the acetone fragment at 454nm using a spectrophotometer (Y-axis).  The bars represent an average taken from 3 extraction replicates of each gene construct (X-axis).  The error bars represent the standard deviation. B - Once extracted, the acetone fragment was run through an absorbance spectrum (334-550nm) using a spectrophotometer.  Points on the figure, joined by a line, represent a reading from the spectrophotometer (Y-axis) at the appropriate wavelength (X-axis). The arrow indicates the peak specific to β-carotene [13]
This confirmed that K2151200 results in production β-carotene (Figure 4B) as the absorbance spectrum shows high similarity to the established"

. These 5 ligation samples were also transformed, but nothing grew after incubating them overnight at 37 degrees Celsius.
A new ligation protocol was attempted for two new samples. The ligation samples are Bba_R2000 + Bba_E0430 with one sample being a 3:1 insert to backbone and the other 6:1. The samples will be held at 16 degrees Celsius for 12 hours and holding it at 4 degrees Celsius for 4 hours.
Week 5: 7/2-7/8
The new ligation samples were transformed over the weekend on plates. On Tuesday morning, there was growth on the plates; however, there weren't any colonies growing, just a lawn of bacteria. It was concluded that the plates may have not had the antibiotic to be able to grow the specific parts that were ligated. Another attempt was made, but as plasmid preps were made it was discovered the LB broth had some contamination. This added to the transformation problem because the same LB broth was used to plate the samples. Because of contamination, new LB broth was made as well as new plates with the appropriate antibiotics.
Another attempt to transform last week's ligation samples, but unfortunately again no growth.
While the ligation issues are being figured out, stocks of parts that are needed for future ligations are being made.

This week, we began to think about our thesis again. Whew. A few of us began reorganizing the information we needed to write about to make the paper more clear. We also had a meeting at the end of the week about expectations for writing during the coming week.
After finding out about the IRB, we applied for exemption. We then found out that we would have to revise our questionnaires. Appropriate changes were made and the application was submitted again (this happens several more times in the next week or so).
Some of us considered different design and selectable marker options to test integration of genes into the yeast genome. We learned that one of our steps lacks a reliable selectable marker test, but that replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty.
Our several lab groups worked tirelessly to make more media, to check for deletions in plasmids, and to design primers that actually work.
Now that we have lox-URA3-lox, linearized pUC19, and amplified homologous arms, we are able to begin Gibson Assembly. We did two gibsons this week. The first Gibson includes the parts mentioned above and the second is our linearized pXRL2 along with several gene fragments: ADR, FDX, Delta7H, p450SCC, and 3BH. After combining the neccessary components with the Gibson Master Mix, we put it in the PCR machine for an hour and then stored it on ice. The following day we inoculated the gibson products on high copy LB-AMP plates. The pUC19 plate grew normally but the pXRL2 plate lawned.
We then picked colonies from the pUC19 plate and transformed it in liquid cultures. We then performed colony PCR to check if our Gibson assembly was successful. It likely did not work. The gel showed very bright bands in the wrong areas but a faint band where our desired product would be. With this information, we made streak plates of the potential successful colonies in hopes to isolate what we believe to be our desired gibson product and"

All the plasmid backbone used for the competition are provided with a default insert: the ccdb gene. This gene can be used as a marker to establish whether the plasmid backbone have been successfully digested. If not, the cell death gene will remain in the plasmid backbone and kill the kill the transformed bacteria. The ccdb gene ensures to not keep cells transformed with the uncut plasmid during the assembly of two BioBrick parts.
As already specified, the presence of the antibiotic resistance marker in the backbone allows the selection of clones that incorporated the plasmid.
This plasmid is also the designated plasmid backbone required for the registry shipping during the IGEM competition.

Constitutive Pr promoter
The Pr promoter is found in the toluene recognition system and is composed of 410 bp. This promoter is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_I723018.
We chose to use this promoter because it is the specific promoter for the XylR gene. This promoter is naturally constitutive. It leads to the permanent production of the XylR protein. Indeed, the induced luminescence has to be proportional to the pollutant rate. Therefore, when pollutant molecules enter in the bacteria, the XylR protein should be present in sufficient amount.
XylR gene
The 1704 bp XylR gene, encodes for the XylR protein and is regulated by the Pr promoter in its native context. This gene is available on the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts ( BBa_K1834844 ). The XylR that we designed for our biosensor is a bit different because it is optimized for E.Coli DH5-Alpha and for IDT synthesis. .
The XylR protein, mined from Pseudomonas putida, is involved in the transcriptional activation of the toluene recognition system. This regulatory protein allows the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons that carry a methyl group, i.e. xylene, toluene and 1-chloro"

Let us tell you a fabulous TALE...
Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a brand-new technology that currently revolutionizes the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity. Originally derived from ''Xanthomonas spp.'', this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. According to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs. With our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.

There need to be more comments in the code
Try to make the code as modular as possible. If you can pull the lexer and parser pieces apart that would be a good first step.
Declaring properties takes a string as a type. It might be better from a type safety standpoint to use enums.
I would strongly recommend moving all the token definitions in the beginning into the lexer rules. Not only does it seem more natural to me, but it also will help folks find things and make the code more modular.
It is confusing how you have defined LETTER. It is really a string of letters. You might want to call what you call a string a QUOTEDSTRING or something else.

Today (I guess yesterday technically) we meet with Cesar and Akshay to discuss Eugene/BOL. After a brief introduction we did the following:
Demo of Spectacles
Demo/Explanation of Eugene
Update on what is going on at Stanford (BioBrick Studio Mobile, Google base parts cloud, BioBrick Studio mock up and plans).
Explanation of how to get Eugene executables from Sourceforge
Discussion of ANTLR and Eugene.g code
Here are some issues that came up during our meetings:
Currently we have properties, components, and devices. Should we insert ""object"" between properties and components? An example of this would be ""sequence"" which both has a text value as well as a size. I personally do not have strong feelings about this since you can workaround this. I don't know what this gains us semantically.
We need to make sure to keep a balance between expressiveness (what CS folks want) and encapsulation and ease of use (what biologists want). We should leverage the language (promoter, RBS, etc) that bio folks understand along with the language that CS folks understand (Object, int, instance, etc).
Here are what our current tasks are:
Spectacles
Agree on a standard for vBOL files. Size, line length, line position, etc
Add the ability to put a label below an image
Proof of concept of Spectacles->Eugene
Eugene
Integrate an editor into Spectacles. This does not need syntax highlighting. This could effectively replace the behavior of the eugene executable jar file.

None of our team members had previous experience with HTML or CSS, making this Wiki quite the challenge to code. Luckily, the code for all iGEM Wiki sites is open-source unless specified otherwise. We thank the 2017 Manchester iGEM team for their open-source CSS style sheets. This included a Bootstrap page, among others. We wouldn't have been able to design this site without their CSS and HTML wizardry.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our universities debating club Streitkultur e.V. about the topic of gene editing on embryos also turned out to be a huge success due to a very lively and interactive audience that received new insights and perspectives on this highly controversial topic. Because of previous Human Practises projects with schools and their pupils it was dear to our hearts to keep up this tradition, and so we organised a special laboratory day for this next generation of young scientists that was filled with experiments around the detection of Bt corn in corn products.
Last but not least it was very important for us this year to put an emphasis on collaborating and meeting up with other iGEM teams on a national and international level. Whether it was through helping and mentoring the iGEM team Würzburg with the establishment of their team, collaborating with the iGEM team Paris on a very successful bioinformatic prediction tool (“BERT”), meeting up with iGEM team Oslo to present our project and exchange thoughts, advice and ideas, or attending big meet ups like the European or German Meet Up to get in contact with other teams, we are proud to have achieved and exceeded this goal.

Project description
Overall Project Summary
E. coli, along with many other gram-negative bacteria, produce beta-amyloid proteins called curli which form the basis of their biofilms. These amyloid structures are highly resistant to degradation and can survive extreme pH and temperature changes. Such robust features of curli proteins make them a great medium for the stable encoding of information. Additionally, curli fibers are assembled extracellularly throughout the lifetime of the cells, so information stored in curli can be read well after cells have died.
            We designed a sensing system in E. coli to store information about the cells’ environment by linking curli proteins to half of a strong affinity tag pairing. The two peptides that compose an affinity tag pair bind only to each other, allowing information to be stored until both peptides are present. Using a variety of affinity tags, we placed each one under the control of a different inducible promoter. The ratio of different affinity-tagged curli produced by the cells is determined by the relative concentrations of the inducers present in the environment. Next, we created fusion chromoproteins with the orthogonal affinity tags. By applying a standard mixture of affinity-tagged chromoproteins, we identify the ratio of bound chromoproteins via an RYB color system. This ratio corresponds to the information encoded by the E. coli. This work has potential applications in the fields of cryptography, information storage, as well as the formation of a new reporting toolbox for synthetic biology.
Project Details
Our system is composed of the following components:
CsgA variants - We have engineered four versions of the CsgA protein with four different affinity domains: three coiled coil SynZip domains, and one covalent bond-based SpyTag domain. The affinity domains are fused to the endogenous CsgA with a 24-amino acid linker sequence, to ensure that the domains are available for binding as the CsgA polymerizes into a curli fiber.
Chromoprotein constructs - to demonstrate the feasibility of our concept, we used chromoproteins fused to binding domains reciprocal to those fused to the CsgA variants. These are three SynZip domains, and one SpyCatcher domain, which spontaneously forms a covalent bond with the SpyTag domain when the two come close enough to one another in solution.
Sensing promoters – thus far"
BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#roGFP2-Orp1MichaelisEquationModel_-_-_TEXT.html,"+I405_{ox}\cdot I488-I405_{red}\cdot I488}$$
After the above relationship is completed, since the absolute protein concentration determination                     is difficult, we define the relative reaction rate as
$$V^{'}=\frac{V}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
$$OxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{[roGFP2_{ox}]}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
$$V^{'}=\frac{OxD^{'}-OxD}{t^{'}-t}$$
At the same time, according to Hypothesis 2, roGFP2total is constant, but the protein                     concentration could not be measured by us. So we thought that under the same promoter conditions,                     the protein concentration was basically the same and according to the data provided in the previous                     literature, it is known that in yeast cells, the Eno2 protein concentration is around 0.5                     mM.[2]
So we could get:
$$[roGFP2_{total}]=0.5\ mM$$
In order to obtain the two constants in the Michealis equation, we measured the reaction rate of the                     reaction in yeast cells by applying different concentrations of H2O2 and                     using the simulation                     results of the H2O2 Decomposition Model in combination with the function of                     roGFP2. The results                     were as follows:
Fig.1 Fluorescence ratio measurement data from wet experiment
Fig.2 Reaction rate measurement data from wet experiment
Calculate two constants by double reciprocal mapping.
Fig.3 vmax⁡ and Km⁡ calculation using double reciprocal mapping
$$v_{max}=0.015207$$
$$K_{m}=0.451642$$
The relationship between the change in fluorescence intensity of roGFP2 and the concentration of                     intracellular H2O2 is set up successfully.
Summary
Our model has been successfully implemented. Different concentrations of intracellular H2O2 can change                 the spectral properties of our system's roGFP2, and successfully convert our selected ROS signal                 (Intracellular H2O2 concentration) into a visualized fluorescent signal that                 means we can evaluate the                 intracellular H2O2 concentration easily through calculate the OxD value.                 However, due to time and experimental limitation, our model is only a preliminary establishment, and                 its subsequent calibration work is limited by experiment and time, there is"

MFC Efficiency
Figure 16 MFC efficiency comparing estimated current and measured current. The average efficiency of our MFC design is around 0.2-0.3
Assuming the decrease of cell population in the growth curve was because of using up the 20mM lactate after 24 hours in the M9 anaerobic medium, we estimated the average lactate uptake flux from the wet mass of cell, then we search for the theoretical electron generating flux through the FBA model described in figure 4 of modelling pages.
The wet mass was converted to dry mass by a factor of 0.3, assuming 70% water content in the mass. As described in modelling, the corresponding maximum DET flux was evaluated based on the assumption of 5% of biomass growth flux. The efficiency was evaluated by comparing the measured current with the maximum theoretical current.
Transformation
We first made the chemically competent cells and attempted to transform the Shewanella by chemical method. After several unsuccessful attempts by increasing both cell and DNA concentration, we turned to use electroporation for higher transformation efficiency. Instead of RFP in the competency kit plate, GFP is chosen as reporter for competency check to avoid confusion with pink Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. However, we cannot get any transformed colony yet. Literature also showed low transformation efficiency of pSB1C3-GFP in Shewanella, 4 colonies were observed on the transformed plate after electroporation[3]. We hypothesized that the competent cell concentration is not high enough to achieve observable transformed colonies on plate.

During photorespiration, we used FBA to optimize and analyze both palmitic acid exchange, and photons uptake.  Figure 4C and 4D show an imperceptible loss (2%) in the palmitic acid exchange flux.   The new flux is 5.24 [arbitrary   units], similar to the one obtained in the photosynthesis scenario.
At Figures 5 and 6 two objectives have been used: one biological objective (biomass production) and one design objective (palmitic acid production). As can be seen at Figure 5 production of palmitic acid decreases when growth increases   and both are greater when photon uptake raises. Greater photon input implies more energy available for both biomass and palmitic acid production resulting in greater maximum fluxes at these reactions. The inverse behaviour observed   between both objectives is caused by competition for the energy from photons.
Figure 5.  Growth rate (biological objective) and and palmitic acid production (design objective) versus photon uptake   (energy source). Arbitrary flux units are used.
Figure 6 illustrates coupled productivity of biomass and palmitic acid at different photon input rates. Although biomass and palmitic acid production are competitive objectives the trade-off between them can result in maximum coupled   yield. As total palmitic acid production depends on the number of cells able of producing it (total biomass) maximum coupled production can be achieved by combining them. Moreover, the maximum increases exponentially when photon uptake   grows.
Figure 6.  Coupled productivity yield for both growth and palmitic acid production at different photon uptakes.   Arbitrary flux units are used.
We also performed a supplementary analysis produced using gene knockout. COBRA toolbox was used to knock out  genes of the AraGEM model on a one by one basis to optimize the palmitic acid exchange flux.  The Figure 7 shows the   maximum palmitic acid exchange flux obtained after gene knockout of each gene.  Out of 1404 knocked out genes, both at  photosynthesis and photorespiration, the optimal palmitic acid exchange flux decreases in 33 cases, and does not   present improvement in the remaining ones.
Figure 5.  Palmitic acid exchange flux after gene knockout.  Out of 1404 genes in the AraGEM model, 33 (pink lines)   genes show an influence on the optimal palmitic acid exchange flux.

Summary
Relevance
Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt gave insights on the political agenda concerning antibiotic resistance. This way, we were able to make an overview of the most important European and Dutch institutes and agencies. Besides new vaccines and new prevention strategies to tackle the infectious diseases, and besides the need for new antibiotics and new therapeutics, the increased use (including overuse and misuse) of the available antibiotics (ref. The Netherlands Center for One Health (NCOH)) should be stopped. The detection method could be used as frontline diagnostics and could be the key for new treatment strategies.
Safety and public acceptance
Besides designing in a relevant for the field, the acceptance of our detection method was considered. We aimed to design a detection method that could be broadly implemented to detect resistance on the spot. The public should be comfortable to use our method. Our idea was based on detection with GMOs with a kill-switch on a paper-chip. However, considering safety and public acceptance, we have chosen not to use GMOs in the environment, but only the products of the GMO. Taking into account the public opinion on GMOs and bacterial resistance, we aimed to design a product that looks as safe as possible to make the public comfortable when using our detection method.
Value Sensitive Design with modules

In an extended report, we considered stakeholders values (including the values of iGEM) and translated these values to design requirements (figure hierarchical structure). We adapted our design and"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#XY Plane_-_-_TEXT.html," however, that the timing belts were difficult to maintain the correct amount of tension without a proper tensioner, which would not be possible to integrate to our system. Also, it would be difficult to standardize if the user were to cut their own timing belts according to how well they put together their XY-plane.
When designing the XY-plane, we decided that we would like the default, starting position of the plate holder to be in the bottom right of the plane. During the first iteration, we brought the holder to position by traveling the span of the plane fully every time, which caused it to jam into the sides and also stall the motors. From there, we realized that we needed a method for the plane to communicate to the Arduinos in order to stop the motors when it has reached the correct position.
Below are clips of a Creo assembly demonstrating how the XY-plane should be and the first physical iteration of the XY-plane.
Design 2
For the final design of the XY-plane, our team decided to 3D-print all of our supports in order to increase accessibility and decrease to cost of the hardware components of TERRA. All parts were printed using the UPrint SE with ivory ABS stock material. Previously, the holes of the 3D-printed parts were too small, mostly due to the relative inaccuracy of this fabrication method, so the new iteration of the supports include clearance holes rather than tight fit holes.
We also chose to choose standard, close-loop timing belts in order to minimize the problems we were encountering with ensuring the tension in the timing belts were correct and that the belt would not slip over the pulleys. Using closed timing belts also eliminates the problems with gluing together ends of the timing belt.
In order to send our plate holder to the correct position, or its ""home"", we needed a technical and reliable solution. Our team decided to integrate contact switches to the plane, allowing us to consistently and accurately home our system every time we run a new protocol, ensuring that the output from the microfluidic device dispenses to the correct wells of a microtiter plate. This also allows us to further remove human error from our system. This was done by creating negative features on some of the 3D-printed supports to hold the sensors in place.
The CAD and STL files are available on our GitHub in order to allow users to easily recreate our system."

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-HP G_-_-_TEXT.html," that while farmers are trying to reduce antibiotic usage, on the other hand, if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in reduced animal health.
We asked Gerbrich if there are possibilities to fight multi-resistant bacteria like the salmonella bacterium with antibiotics. She told us that there are still some antibiotics which are used only human. If the veterinarian decides it is necessary to use these, there can be an exception. It is however under strict supervision and noted down which veterinarian prescribes these antibiotics. If antibiotics can no longer be used because of stricter regulations, breeders should focus on health and robustness of the cow. Lower production of milk could also result in a healthier cow because the cow can put more energy in its own immune system. In order to bring the disease burden down, the environment and food for the cow should be adjusted accordingly. The stress on the animal should be minimized as stress has negative effects on the immune system of the cows. According to Gerbrich the solution to the antibiotic resistance problem is further reducing the use of antibiotics in all sectors of livestock farming. Besides this she thinks reducing the transport of animals can improve the situation as then the spreading of the resistant bacteria becomes less. When transport is necessary hygiene is of utter importance!

Insights
There are plenty of different diseases that play a role in the dairy industry.
Fast diagnosis is essential to minimize loss of cattle and productivity, since most illnesses cannot be prevented.
While only sick cows are treated with antibiotics, more antibiotics are potentially used in the chicken and pig industry.
Para-infectious diseases (spread through manure) are especially tricky.
The tool should neither be too complicated, nor take a lot of time.
Changes

Summary
As a farmer, Machiel aims to deliver qualitatively good cow milk as inexpensive as possible. In 2014 his company started to buy embryos to enhance the animal’s properties through breeding. These are strong races with health certificates.
Machiel informed us about different diseases that play a role in the dairy industry, such as Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR; viral) and pneumonia. For some (like IBR), animals can be vaccinated. However, often this is not the case. So, the only thing that can be done to minimize the loss of cattle and productivity, is quick diagnosis of illnesses. Currently"

When the estimated cost of biodiesel made by our         production process is compared to tradition fuels,         a significant decrease in price is observed. With the         exception of E85, which is not considered to have the same         efficiency, a 32% price reduction is seen.
The method of analysis used was to estimate the reduction         in the total cost by separating current fuel prices into         separate cost components that make up the current market         price.
*The market for biodiesel in Canada, in contrast to the         United States, is still very much in its infancy. Therefore,         the costs of biodiesel production and retail costs are not         readily available if at all in some provinces.
The Impact on the Average American Family and Canadian Family
The impact of biodiesel on food prices throughout the         world remains controversial. The most popular opinion         on this issue appears to be that there is a direct         correlation between the use of food crops as inputs in         biodiesel production processes and an increase in food         prices. The biofuel industry, however, refutes this claim,         citing multiple reasons of why biofuel production is not         the primary reason for this observed increase in price. As         our approach to biodiesel production do not make use of any         essential food crop, our analysis is able to avoid this         controversy. Nonetheless, without conclusive evidence on         the impact of biofuels (and its future replacement with         our biodiesel) on world food"

For cloning of I746907 into pSB6A1
We want to use I746907 as a reporter part for our optogenetical AND-gate in e. coli CP919. Therefore the part must be transformed into a low copy vector, since the AND-gate is in pSB1C3 which is a high copy vector. Because CP919 already has a Kan-Resistance, the low copy vector used for this needs to carry Amp-Resistance. That's why we chose pSB6A1, a low copy vector with Amp-Resistance. The DNA was gained from 2011 Kit Plate 1 well 1K by resuspension in 10 µl ddH2O. This was then used for electroporation into DH5alpha which were plated onto LB Amp plates after transformation.

For Testing of I746907
To be able to characterize part I746907, we used a chemical transformation into BL21 DE3 (see methods). 1.5 µl of the DNA were used (c = 63 ng/µl). The transformed cells were plated onto a LB Amp plate.

Later in the afternoon came the first opportunity for the UK and Irish teams to get to know each other, initially by chatting over sandwiches before moving out of the department to the less formal setting of the pub. To facilitate this discussion the teams had been invited to provide a simple poster to display their main project themes and ideas.
Our thanks to SynOx and to all those who attended! We would like to thank Randy Rettberg, Dr. Richard Kelwick and Dr. Jarek Bryk for their insightful and entertaining talks.
Can you give our cells new instructions? Drop-in Activity
Venue:
A table in the centre of the University Museum of Natural History in Oxford, on a Saturday afternoon. Entrance to the museum is free and members of the public were could approach us and our activities on a drop-in basis.
Audience:
Anyone of any age (babies to pensioners) with a whole range of previous biology experience from none to Biochemistry post docs!
How did we draw them in?
Colourful table display, museum specimens of coral and insects that could be handled by the public, smells people were invited to smell. We also had our table under the T-rex which has a high footfall in the museum.
Activities:
- Can you give our cell new instructions?
Activity inviting people to put ‘when’ and ‘what’ cards together to make ‘new instructions’ for a cell – e.g. putting together ‘LIGHT’ and ‘PINK’ cards to tell a cell express a pink chromoprotein when it senses light. The cards could then be turned over to reveal that this simple genetic circuit was made up of genes/parts of genes from very different kinds of living things e.g.  Synechocystis (cyanobacterium), E.coli and Smooth cauliflower coral.
- Handling specimens and objects
Strong smells such as Wintergreen essential oil and vanilla essence invited discussion about using synthetic biology to produce naturally occurring odorants. Coral, firefly and meal worm specimens from the musuem’s collection started discussion about the possible applications of making colourful cells, electricity-free light and antifreeze proteins respectively.
- Bacteria Combat card game
A Top Trumps style card game developed and generously donated by Carla Brown (Glasgow University). The simple game involves cards with information about many different kinds of pathogenic and beneficial bacteria.
Challenge:
A lot of concepts in synthetic biology rely on an understanding of other concepts i.e. DNA, genes and cells. As we had to cater for a range of levels"
TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Project#Microbial-History#Van Leeuwenhoek_-_-_TEXT.html," this means that he was an office with salary but he has no fundamental obligations. In 1671 van Leeuwenhoek remarried with Cornelia Swalmius, progeny of a pastor family. In 1679 he became an inspector of wine measures, which required a certain amount of mathematical knowledge. In 1694 his wife Cornelia died, whereupon he remained with his daughter Maria – his other children already died.
Van Leeuwenhoek was a rich man. This became obvious from the capital he left for his daughter when he died: ninety thousand guilders. On 26 August 1723 Van Leeuwenhoek died in his hometown Delft, he was almost 91 years old. There are stories which claim that on his death bed he dictated a letter to the Royal Society in London. In this letter he explained the condition of his diaphragm so thoroughly, that this disease is now known as the Van Leeuwenhoek’s disease. Van Leeuwenhoek was buried in the “Oude Kerk” (The Old Church) in Delft.
In his spare time, van Leeuwenhoek became interested in lens making, and had also become familiar with Robert Hooke’s Micrographia (1665) which probably encouraged him to try his lenses on materials other than fabric. In 1673, a friend of van Leeuwenhoek, the famous Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf wrote to Henry Oldenburg. Henry Oldenburg was the secretary of the Royal Society in London at that time. Reinier de Graaf introduced him to the Society as a maker of microscopes better than any other and enclosing the first letter from van Leeuwenhoek to the Society. This was the beginning of a series or around 560 letters that continued throughout van Leeuwenhoek’s life, to the bitter end.  Despite the fact that van Leeuwenhoek – by the use of his handmade microscopes – observed cell structures and later little animals (bacteria, yeast) and thus “inventing” microbiology, he was not a teacher and had no followers in the city. Luckily for history he made a lot of drawings of what he saw and there was the letter correspondence with The Royal Society.
The microscope & The Royal Society
Van Leeuwenhoek’s interest in glass processing and his interest in microscopes has led to one of the most significant and simultaneously well-hidden, technical insight in the history of science. He placed the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, he could"

Figure 1a: SDS-PAGE of fructose transformed DH5α cells. Culture was induced with (1,5) 0 mM IPTG (2,6) 0.2 mM IPTG (3,7) 0.1 mM IPTG and (4,8) 0.05 mM IPTG. Lanes 1-4 are the supernatant from cell lysate, and lanes 5-8 are the pallet from the cell lysate, diluted 1:20.
Figure 1b: SDS-PAGE of fructose transformed BL21 DE3 cells. Culture was induced with (1) 0 mM IPTG and (2) 0.5 mM IPTG at OD600~0.65. Lanes 1 and 2 are the supernate fractions of the sonicated cell lysate.
We did not see any overexpression of the desired proteins in DH5Alpha cells. For the BL21 cells, we did see the appearance of a ~45kDa band upon induction with IPTG. The MDH2 enzyme, the first protein in the fructose construct, has a size of 44.5 kDa. At also see the emergence of a ~100kDa band in lane 2. We predict that this is the T7 polymerase encoded by the DE3 strain of BL21. Although our construct has no use for the T7 polymerase for protein production, we used this cell line as it was made readily available to us from a collaborating lab. As an advantage, the expression of T7 polymerase, which depends on IPTG induction, also serves as an integrated positive control for induced expression.
We predict that the other two enzymes, HPS and PHI, were not seen in the expression assay because their relative expression levels were much lower than that of MDH2. As MDH2 was the first protein encoded in the polycistronic mRNA, it may be more likely that ribosomes bind to and translate the enzyme. The rbs that was used was also relatively weak. Future experiments would include swapping out ribosome binding sites, putting promoters in between each gene to have separate mRNA transcripts, all to determine the validity of our construct in terms of expression.

Malicious misuse of the rDNA or organisms used in the lab would be minimal because the DNA biosensors contain sequences that target a benign target, green fluorescent protein, and the cell surface biosensor contains a protein with antimicrobial, rather than pathogenic, properties.
Environmental Safety
The safety of the environment was considered for real-world use of all biosensor designs. The designs for each biosensor was developed so that bacteria containing recombinant DNA would not be exposed to public water supplies in application. The end goal of the biosensor would be application in rural areas with public water supplies in danger of bacterial contamination. After the fusion protein biosensors are isolated in a lab setting, the fusion proteins used as each biosensor would test water samples in a cell-free environment and could subsequently be denatured via heat, reducing any potential contamination of the water or safety concerns by the biosensor protein itself.
Biosafety Regulations and Provisions
The local biosafety group at Arizona State University is the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Environmental Health and Safety Biosafety Program. The Institutional Biosafety Committee sees no foreseeable public health threat associated with the organisms and recombinant DNA project utilized by our team.

With our project we aim to print a well-defined biofilm in 3 dimensions. Since the biofilm can be created at a certain rate and pattern, it is possible to create a well-defined structure. In order to show the existing problems, we have used               pictures of dental plaque and biofilm formation within pipes to show them.

Bio3Dimensions – Business Case
Educating people is not only about giving lectures, it is also about offering the opportunity to feel and think the subject. We wanted to give this opportunity to students of the TU Delft in the form of a business case. The assignment made students think   about how they would use a 3D biofilm printer for a practical, marketable use, and present their idea. Since the participants had different expertise, we started with a general introduction to iGEM, synthetic biology and our project. After that, groups   of three persons were formed,each group having one of the iGEM team members as a tutor.
Based on the information about our project, the different groups could use one of our applications or come up with one on their own. They also had to choose their market of interest, think about the drawbacks of their technology and sketch a market plan.   In the end, every group presented their idea with a poster pitch. We closed the meeting with a free barbeque to thank the participants, and continued discussions in a more informal setting.
Group Ideas
Smell Eaters
The first group presented a shoe sole on which a biofilm with the smell eaters (good bacteria) was printed and attached. The group knew about some “good bacteria” as being used for treating bodily odour. The “good” bacteria would produce substances that   inhibit the odour compounds made by “bad bacteria”. Based on this, the group wanted to apply the idea to the shoe industry. Since the feet shape and size differ from person to person, the printer is useful because it can be adapted to every type of   feet. The project’s poster is shown in Figure 1.
According to this group, the technology could be useful for everyone with smelly feet. Since you want"

Notebook – Protocol – 6. Plasmid purification
Spin column based purification was used. The kit is Plasmid mini kit (Nippon Genetics). Standard protocols from the kit were followed by adaptation because we have no high speed microcentrifuge, but only a 6,000 rpm small microcentrifuge.
1. Add 2 ml of E. coli overnight culture into 2 ml polypropylene tube. Centrifuge for 6,000 rpm; 5 minutes. Remove the supernatant.
2. Add 200 ul of mP1; vortexing. Add 200 ul of mP2; invert the tube 10 times. Incubate at 2 minutes at room temperature. Add 300 ul of mP3; invert the tube.
3. Immediately centrifuge for 6,000 rpm; 5 minutes.
4. Load the supernatant onto spin column. Centrifuge 6,000 rpm; 1 minute. Discard the flowthrough.
5. Add 400 ul of mP4. Centrifuge 6,000 rpm; 1 minute. Discard the flowthrough.
6. Add 600 ul of mP5. Centrifuge 6,000 rpm; 1 minute. Discard the flowthrough.
7. Centrifuge 6,000 rpm; 5 minute to dry the column.
8. Replace collecting tube with clean, sterlized 1,5 ml size polypropylene tube.

The meet-up was             not only all work though. It also provided a much-needed fun break from the monotonous             everyday life in college and lab.
Aided with Mathematical Modelling
We collaborated with IISER Mohali when we had difficulty figuring out the various                 simulations for the synthetic modelling of circuits for our project. The team helped us with                 the mathematical codes for MATLAB software and we were able to successfully finished the                 mathematical modelling of our genetic circuit with their generous help.
Trying out BBrickIt!
iGEM VIT collaborated with the iGEM team from ICT-Mumbai. The collab consisted mainly                 of us trying out their debutant software BBrickIt! which eases the process of Biobricking                 gene sequences among other things, and providing feedback on problems faced by us, and the                 flaws and highlights of the software as observed by us.
According to our team, the software could also include certain features like the 3A assembly simulation, have the facility to explain what RFC [10] standards are and maybe even add a                 function that can be used for Directional cloning. All these suggestions were conveyed to the                 team."

Analytical Methods
To determine certain properties of proteins or contructed DNA fragments such as BioBricks, we have used different analytical methods. All used methods are listed below.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
The Agarose Gel Electrophoresis is used for separation of DNA or RNA fragments (e.g. after a PCR).
take 5 µl of the PCR product
mix with 1 µl loading dye
apply onto agarose gel together with a marker
run at 100 V for 35 minutes for a full gel
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
The SDS-PAGE is used to determine certain features of the cells' proteome such as the strength of expression of a desired protein.
Cell Preparation
lysis of cell pellet in lysis buffer
centrifuge for 15 min at 13.000 rpm
mix the supernatant with 2x lammli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol
denatured for 5 min at 95°C

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html," The comDE operon expression was induced with 0 %, 0,02 % and 0,2 % xylose. Adding 0 mg/ml CSP, 100 mg/ml CSP and 1000 mg/ml CSP luxABCDE expression is only activated if B. subtilis was able to sense CSP due to the comDE operon. For PmreA, no significant luminescence output could be measured concerning differing CSP concentrations. Nevertheless, at a xylose concentration of 0,02 % and induction of 1000 mg/ml CSP PcomC and PcomAB showed a 3 fold increased luminescence output compared with an induction of 0 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml CSP.
These results were obtained with cultures growing in MCSE medium two hours after induction with CSP. A concentration of 0.02 % xylose was optimal to measure CSP dependent luminescence.
Adhesion
As part of the BaKillus strategy, we want to reduce the selective pressure on non-pathogenic bacteria to prevent resistance development. Towards this end, BaKillus is equipped with pathogen-binding peptides on its surface, thereby adhering specifically to the targeted bacteria. This approach ensures high local concentration of killing factors while minimizing harmful effects on untargeted species.
Surface display of the pathogen-binding peptides is achieved by translational fusions to naturally occurring surface proteins of B. subtilis. Cell wall-binding modules of autolysins are used for non-covalent interaction with the B. subtilis cell wall, whereas a sortase-based system functions via covalent attachment to the cell wall. In both cases, a linker between cell wall anchor and peptide allows flexibility of the fusion protein and increases its range. Peptides binding to different receptors on the surface of pathogens mediate specific binding.
Background
Surface display
Bacterial cell surfaces are covered with a wide range of proteins functioning as transporters, interacting with molecules and cells or fulfilling a variety of other functions. As they are naturally displayed on the cell’s surface, they can also be used for presenting heterologous proteins or peptides.
One class of proteins that have been used for surface display are B. subtilis autolysins, in particular LytC and LytE [1, 2]. Autolysins hydrolase peptidoglycan and thus play a role in cell wall turnover, vegetative growth and cell division. They consist of an N-terminal cell wall binding (CWB) domain with a signal peptide directing export via the Sec pathway and of a C-terminal"

Thus began his interest in iGEM. Surrounded in a shroud of mystery, Kyle tries to protect his secret identity through seemingly innocuous activities like coding and eating lots of organic produce. Hailing from a long line of iGEM Risley-ites, he keeps himself in physical shape by casually biking 40+ miles around lakes and mentally fit by perfoming wet lab voodoo and concocting business plans on the sponsorship subteam.

Xiling’s postdoctoral work focused on synthetic biology with Dr. Adam Arkin in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley prior to joining the faculty at Cornell University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Dr. B. Gillian Turgeon - Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology
Gillian Turgeon is a fungal geneticist studying molecular mechanisms by which fungi cause disease on plants and the evolution of diverse reproductive strategies.  Both are recognition questions.  For pathogenicity the issue is how cells from different organisms, i.e., the fungus and the plant host, communicate with each other to cause or prevent disease.  For sexual reproductive development, fungi either require a partner of opposite mating type to mate or can self-mate, thus the issue is how fungal cells recognize self from non-self.

Difficult technique support
Our main references for all the techniques were the instructions from the kits suppliers and OpenWetWare.org. When facing a problem in our work we turned to OpenWetWare and users' comments on there and tried to solve everything by trying out different things. This was best exemplified when we spent three weeks working out why our minipreps weren't working. When everything else failed, we turned to Imperial College Team for their help and advice. In this particular instance they tested our samples and worked out that our gel stain was not sensitive enough and pointed us in the direction of the one they were using.
Project advisor support
We discussed all our cloning strategies with our PI and he advised us on the changes we needed to make. Much of our work was informed from Anthony, C. et al. Our PI also taught us all the experimental techniques we used and safety procedures.
Wiki support
This was solely the domain of our Student Leader, Clemens, who did most of the work and guided us through the rest. Thanks to Elias for his amazing charcoal drawings, which Clemens then digitised and implemented on to the wiki. Clemens even managed to get Mr Zivanic (our PI) to do lots of copying and pasting of code throughout different parts of our Wiki. He reliably informs us that his favourite task was italicising Latin names.
Presentation coaching
We are grateful to Imperial College for allowing us to practice our presentation with them. We are also grateful to Tom Kelly from our school for helping us print our poster.
Human Practices support
James was completely responsible for researching human practices aspects of the projects. We are thankful for the members of the public who were willing to talk to us during our open event and who agreed to pose for some photos with us, as well as the younger pupils who helped to test our board game. We also give our thanks to the City of London School Citizen Team for editing our articles for their newspaper.
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Our sincere thanks go to the Biology Department at our school who sustained our hectic working schedules. As most of our work had to be done from September onwards due to summer works in the building, we had to fit all the lab work around our free time during school day, which meant random access to labs and the prep room."
USTC-Software,2014,Team:USTC-Software#develop.php_-_-_TEXT.html," Float layer
b) Compressed partitioned layer
2. Link Layer
a) Fast redraw layer
b) Float layer
c) Compressed layer
For float layer, objects exist independently, which means they have their own RAM and Graphic. These independent objects have many event listeners that can interact with users easily. Specifically, users can simply move, double-click and edit them. Though a few dozens of objects working in this way together will be quite well, more (thousands of) objects exist in the float layer at the same time will consume a great amount of resources with an unacceptable low speed.
A biological network can be huge and highly convoluted. To meet the requirement of higher efficiency, we use compressed layer, on which objects are drawn together as one or several (partitioned) bitmaps, to solve this problem. These bitmaps draw fast with GPU acceleration and cost much fewer resources, but they are not interactive. So a significant task we have done is to translate an operation towards an object drawn in compressed layer to the real object by calculating its geometry characteristic. Once a focus intension is traced, the object will emerge to the float layer to interact with the user, and when it loses focus, it will submerge into the compressed layer again and the RAM space will be cleared.
In most of time, objects stay in compressed layers. But there is still another problem: the graph may be too large to draw at one time while most part of the graph is out of screen. So we use partitioned bitmap blocks (for nodes) and fast drawing layer (for links) in place of one huge bitmap, and redrawing only happens to the blocks (for nodes) or the range (for lines) shown on the screen.
With all these methods, we could save over 90% costs of system resources while providing an enjoyable user experience.
Project System
Project is the basic unit to manage a biological network. Three kinds of information are saved in a project:
1. Node information
2. Link information
3. Project information
You can import nodes and links to the project from cloud database or add yours; both can be saved into one project. Meanwhile, two ways are provided to store a project, storing locally and on cloud.
For a local project, information saved as an XML file, so you can open, save or copy it like any other kind of document.
Building projects on cloud is strongly recommended, for not only these projects can be open and edit on any computer with your account, but the existence of the nodes and links in the project are recorded in the global biological network database,"

Starter culture creation
Looked at plates streaked from [ tubes Tokyo gBlock 3/4/5 ]
Each plate had a good amount of isolated colonies, well streaked.
Observation of the streaked colonies under gel box UV yielded several colonies with high fluorescence, enough to verify proper insert presence.
Colony morphology was also identical, which indicates lack of satellite colonies.
Picked an individual colony and in separate tubes prepared starter and inoculated 10mL LB supplemented with 1x Amp.  Placed in 37 deg shaking at 1600.  Will check cell growth at 0900 tomorrow ]
Zymo Mix N' Go Competency tested
Yesterday's 50mL culture of BL21(DE3) streaked from Mark Arbing and starter cultures made were grown to OD600 of 1.2 -- way above the 0.4-0.6 range recommend by Zymogen.
Competency was conducted regardless, resuspending cell pellets in competency buffer wafter wash buffering the cells from each culture.
David aliquotted the resulting DH5alpha and BL21(DE3) cells into 50uL samples, and froze in -80.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#proof3_-_-_TEXT.html,", the ratio and relationship of the signals from 4 circuits become relatively stable at the early stationary phase, which hints that the expression level may reach the dynamic steady state at the time point 22 hours. And the results from 22 hours point also match the strength relationship of the two promoters in previous research, although we used another yeast strain here. [2, 5] Therefore, comparing with the mid-log phase data, we tend to believe that this results can reflect the true dynamic characteristics of the genetic regulatory devices, although we will research this phenomenon in our future work.(Fig. D)
So, in order to better reflect the dynamic behaviors of the circuits we tend to use data from mid-log phase during the growth process.
Fig. B The growth curve of the four strains with different promoter- terminator pairs. Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Fig. C The fluorescence/Abs600 in different time. Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Fig.D The fluorescence/Abs600 of strains with different promoter-terminator pairs, after being cultivating for 22 hours. Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates.
Function Verification of promoters and terminators
Through comparing “CC” with “CM”, we can learn that the Fluorescence/Abs600 of “CM”is nearly three times of “CC”, proving that the strength of MINI terminator is higher than that of CYC1 terminator. (Fig. D)(At first we think of measuring this characteristic by comparing yECitrine fluorescence /mStrawberry fluorescence. However, considering that the fluorescence of mStrawberry is too low, we cannot expect an accurate result due to the high error rate. ) We assume that both MINI terminators and CYC1 terminators can effectively stop the transcription, so the mRNA of mStrawberry generated behind these terminators can hardly be detected, neither does the fluorescence of mStrawberry.
What’s more, the Fluorescence/Abs600 of “MM”is also nearly 3-fold compared with “MC”, proving that the strength of MINI promoter is higher than CYC1 promoter.
In addition, when we compared “MM” with “CC” which is the commonly used promoter-terminator pair, we found that the difference is nearly 6-fold. (Fig. D)
From our results, we confirmed that the MINI promoter and MINI terminator do be superior to CYC1 promoter and CYC1 terminator, not only in length but also in strength. (Fig. E)

Bacterial Population Growth
The oxygen diffusion model confirms the intuition we could have: while oxygen can't easily move into the medium, the growth on the surface is sufficiently more important than the growth inside the medium for neglecting the latter. We will tackle here the process of bacterial growth in different aspects.
We are here considering a bacterial population uniformly spread on a surface in the Euclidean space, in crowd-free conditions and with unlimited food resources.
In order to be as instructive as possible, we will process in two times : first we will consider that bacteria never die, then - and because the previous assumption is obviously not realistic - we will consider that bacteria can breed and die.
Each time, we will expose both a deterministic model and a stochastic one. The major advantage of the deterministic model is its simplicity. But this simplicity has"

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html," decision, the EU did not appeal, as it already had regulations that were in harmony with its international obligations. The most important sources of community law ruling these issues are Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed  (hereinafter Reg. 1829/2003) and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003.  Latter contains the detailed rules of traceability and labeling, while the foregoing gives us the general rules and objectives. In the following paragraphs this paper will demonstrate these rules to give a preview of how difficult job a new GMO producer shall face in order to have its product authorized.
3.2.1. Objectives and scope
Reg. 1829/2003 has three objectives as follows: (1) ensuring a high level of protection of human and animal life and health, environment and consumer interests in relation to GM food and feed, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market; (2) provide the procedure of authorization; (3) give provisions on labeling.  The scope of the regulation applies to GMOs for food use, food containing or consisting of GMOs, and food produced from or containing ingredients produced from GMOs. To put it more simply, if the food has any tiny thing to do with GMOs, it is subject of the regulation.
3.2.2. Authorization
The procedure for authorization is relatively slow. First, the application shall be sent to the national authority of a Member State, which on one hand acknowledges receiving the documents in 14 days, on the other hand forwards the case to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The latter is responsible for risk assessment and shall send his report of opinion to the Commission within 6 month. The Commission then submits the case to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health within 3 months after receiving the opinion of EFSA. This step is one of the most important ones since in the best case scenario this can be the last one: if the Committee accepts the proposal, the Commission adopts it. In case it does not accept it, the proposal will be discussed by the Council of Ministers. This of course delays the licensing, however, there is a time limit at this level as well: if the Council cannot reach a position with qualified majority within 3 months, the Commission adopts its proposal. Authorization, as seen above, can take up to a year from publishing the application. This ensures safety, but hardly promotes innovation. Once the authorization is granted, it is valid"

Almost every country and region would try their best to fight against plagiarism and promote the intellectual property rights among themselves. Being a renowned worldwide competition, iGEM also emphasises the significance of the intellectual property rights. After some"

BIT-China,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," ). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of gene ipgC, mxiE, sicA*, invF, pipaH* and psicA is shown in Fig.1-4.
Secondly, we assembled three Sensors and the agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of Sensor A,Sensor B,Sensor C is shown in Fig.1-5.
We verified Sensor A, Sensor B and Sensor C through Fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence photos are shown in Fig.1-6.
We also implant the sRNA regulation system in each AND gate to repress the former one, ensuring that the signal molecule must be added in a set order, keeping the system from activated by random or total testing. Another system, cell division inhibiting system will go into effect. As a result, only with the input signals (various molecules) in correct order can permit E. coli live as expected.
1.3 RESULTS
We use two circuits to carry three Sensors, circuit one is made up of Sensor A and Sensor B, circuit two is made up of Sensor C. We have constructed two circuits and verified the function of the first circuit. Two circuits are shown in Fig.1-7 and the agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the two circuits is shown in Fig.1-8.We verified circuit one after 6h induction through fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and fluorescence microscope. The results are shown in Fig.1-9 and Fig.1-10.
We verified circuit one after 6h induction through fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and fluorescence microscope. The results are shown in Fig.1-9 and Fig.1-10.
Unfortunately, the FACS result show that although lower than the sample which add Ara and IPTG, the control also have very high fluorescence intensity，we asked Tae Seok Moon, an assistant professor in Washington University, he told us that pipaH* has a very high basal level, so it should be connected to engineered RBS to fine-tune expression from it. So we changed the RBS from B0034 to J61100 because the latter have the lower bound strength，the results are verifying.
