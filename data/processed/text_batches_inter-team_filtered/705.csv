UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and grow the yeast in there. Because there will be a specific amount of lactose in each section, and our promoters are sensitive to galactose, our yeast will stop producing progesterone after it consumes all of the lactose.
We have found multiple ways to insert our genes into Y.lipolytica and we made pros and cons lists for each method to decide which one would be the most effective and time-efficient. The methods are regular homologous recombination using homologous arms on our plasmid, EasyCloneYALI: CRISPR/Cas9‐based technique for engineering Y.lipolytica specifically, and Drag and Drop cloning.
Week of July 9th
Overview
We confirmed that using a constitutive promoter would be better than an inducible one, at least initially, because it will use up energy to keep producing progesterone after the growth media has been consumed. Our website has gone through several prototype designs, but it seems like we may be getting close to a final design we would like to use to represent our work. One fun feature that is a work in progress is an interactive map that will, when moused over, provide information about different countries and our outreach there. We have also been working on finalizing our logo, which will include the name of our project: PoPPY. PoPPY stands for Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast, an accurate description of the goal of our project. A low this week for the team was realizing that most of the survey responses received from one of the groups we reached out to about contraceptive accessibility were unreliable, since many answers between supposedly different women were the exact same, word for word. However, we hope that this was a problem specific to the group, and not the norm. We have some more legitimate groups who are willing to send us photos of the women filling out the surveys, and we hope to see good results. A high for the team this week was finally understanding how Cre-Lox recombination, a method that we will use in one of our experiments to integrate our gene cassette into the yeast genome, works. We now expect to run three parallel experiments to get to our end goal: a control using Gibson and homologous arms to create our gene cassette and integrate it into our Y. lipolytica genome; assembly of the plasmid inside S. cerevisiae using yeast-mediated cloning,  isolation and insertion of the plasm"

Dissolving gel slices and extracting DNA for 10, 11 and 12. After extraction, the following weights for the three types of constructs were obtained.
10: 370 ng;
11: 550 ng;
12: 740 ng.
Membrane binding solution was added in 1:1 and the slice was dissolved at 55°C.
Thus, the samples were loaded on a 2% agarose gel to achieve higher concentrations. For the transformations CsgA_GFP and RFP (I135521) a colony PCR was done, to see if the plasmids contained an insert. We did this by using a sterile tip to pick off a piece of a colony into the PCR reaction mixture. The PCR reaction mixture contained:

At the same time we   were informed that if the tailings was handled properly, there would be chances to   create a huge wealth by re-extract the heavy metal here. We gave them the suggestion   that they were supposed to consider withdrawing the water from the tailings   reservoir and using our Saccharomyces cerevisiae to handle the heavy metals   remaining in the tailings reservoir. At the same time, we consulted the Beijing,   Shanxi, Henan Environmental Protection Bureau and their counterparts in the   outsourcing company, Zhongke Dingshi Non-ferrous Metal Company. This company had a   nice response on our results and they were willing to be our first experimental units if   our experiment reached the point of maturity.
Multi - party communication and self – examination
We also participated in the Fourth CCiC conference. At the meeting, we exchanged   our ideas and shared our experiment with other teams, and received questions raised   by them: 1. Whether the synthetic yeast would mate with natural yeast after   delivered in nature, which resulted in gene integration. 2. It would be better if we   could make the original copper detection switching device switch on and off   automatically according to the concentration of copper ions.

How we affect the world
Human practice is about how the world affects us, but also about how our project affects the world, so it is quite important that we expand the scope of our influence and make a real difference. So we put major effort in responding the society. We aim to make some economic benefits through our project to prove that our project has potential to invest. We also aim to promote our project ideas in the places that need our ideas. Although our ideas haven’t been able to be applied to real processing system right away, we hope to promote our ideas and influence the world as much as we can.
Get an investment of nearly 100,000 RMB
we talked with the leaders of these companies about our project, we contacted some influential biological companies. At first, we aimed to solve the heavy metal pollution problems in our planet. And then they showed extremely high interests to our project and decided to help us by donating some money and biological reagents so that we could carry out our project more smoothly. In the end, we had raised 80 thousand RMB in all and biological reagents cost ten thousand RMB.

She is actively involved in both wetlab and human practice division. At wetlab division: her work is in bioinformatics, she examines the sequencing result, align 16S sequence and make a phylogenetics tree for confirmation. She also studies the rhlAB genes in many bacteria (Pseudomonas, Bulkhorderia, and Bacillus) from database to understand the differences. On the other hand, at human practice: her worked is to promote Indonesian iGEM Team in Bandung Indonesia especially ITB_Indonesia Team and made a Meet Up event to gather all Indonesian iGEM Team.
Her hobby is drinking coffee, listening to music, and hanging with friends.
She likes studying biology. Her field is molecular ecology and conservation. She learned that she could apply synthetic biology to cope with ecological problem so she want to learn about synthetic biology and gain some experience to participate in international competition.
She thought that, “Synthetic biology is very diverse and it consist of many fields. We need to work together to solve a problem. I gain many information and I learn new fields. It was some experience for me.”
You could call her “Ida”. “A double agent” is undoubtedly needed in iGEM team. Just like the other members, she also works for human practice activities besides wetlab division. Sharing our project to people is one of her favorites.
For her wetlab activities, working with primer and synthetic gene is her main focus. She designs the primers and analyzes our synthetic genes. She also works with PCR and gel electrophoresis as her daily routine in our laboratory.
“Just give her tons of novels and she will nail it. Indeed, she loves to read books especially novels.
To learn, not to ask.
To think, not to judge.
To contemplate, not to disregard.
Those are her motivations.
She said that, ""Happiness is when you are lovable in a lovely team, and now I am happy because I have my team.""

Achievements
Paris Bettencourt
We helped iGEM team Paris Bettencourt procure untreated unbleached cotton fabric (khadi cloth from some local suppliers) for their project.
HKUST
We discussed our projects with team Hong Kong HKUST over a Skype chat and helped them with the modelling aspect of their project. We performed a mathematical analysis of the tri-stable system model, and revealed an unfamiliar behavior of the tri-stable switch. The tri-stable switch undergoes oscillations in specific conditions. We first developed a Boolean model and proved the existence of oscillation performed by the tri-stable system. A more detailed model based on ordinary differential equations was formulated to further characterize the oscillatory behavior of the system. This further confines the conditions at which oscillation occurs as well as identifying the parameters controlling the magnitude of the oscillation. A report of our contribution to their project can be found here . We thank HKUST HongKong team for playing our game and giving us feedback.
iGEM Meetups
We participated in two Indian iGEM meetups. One of them was conducted by SVCE Chennai team. Nitish and Venkat went to attend the meetup, held at their college. This meetup was attended by IISc Banglore team as well. All three teams presented their project to the audience, which was followed by audience questions. This event gave us a very good opportunity to share our ideas and experience regarding lab work, human practices and collaborations. We had a lot of fun presenting our respective projects and interacting with the other teams who attended( IISC Bangalore and SVCE Chennai ). After this meet up, we agreed to send some important biobrick parts to each other to help validate our projects.
We sent our [parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1956016 K1956016] part, which is to be used for efficient characterization with internal control to IISC Bangalore and SVCE Chennai for characterization. We are thankful to both the teams for characterizing our parts.

The transcription is also influenced by metal ions and oxidative stress. CYP1A1 catalyzes two of three critical steps in transformation of benz[a]pyren to the carcinogen BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide.  Furthermore CYP1A1 is involved in processes like xenobiotic metabolism and drug degradation [45] .

EGF
Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a 6045 Da protein discovered by Stanley Cohen in 1986, which won him a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. EGF regulates cell proliferation by binding to the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) which are located on the cell surface. Upon binding of EGF to its receptor intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity is stimulated inducing a signaling cascade inside the cell which leads to increased calcium levels, glycolyisis and protein synthesis in the cell. This process ultimately leads to the proliferation of the cell. It was recently shown that c-Jun is one of the targets of EGF action [46] , [46] .

TNF-alpha
Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine involved the cells inflammatory response. TNF-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to one of its to receptors (TNF-R1/ TNF-R2) which then form a trimer themselves. Trimerization of the receptor induces a conformational change and the dissociation of the inhibitory protein SODD (Silencer of Death Domain protein) from the intracellular death domain of the receptor. The adaptor protein TRADD (TNF Receptor-associated Death Domain protein) can bind now to the death domain and allow other protein factors to bind aswell. The three main signaling pathways initiated in this way are: the NF-kB pathway, the MAPK opathway and the death signaling cascade [60] .

Pifithrin-α
Pifithrin-α (PFTα) is proposed to be a specific inhibitor of p53 signaling. It is not yet clear how exactly PFTα inhibits p53, but it seems to act at a stage after p53 translocation to the nucleus. Temporary suppression in vitro of p53 inhibits apoptosis induced by the damage to DNA and thus increases the fraction of cells surviving the stress [61] , [61] .

It is worth noting that People have a great prejudice against synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms. So it is important for us to include in our project topics such as ethics, culture, society, and accessibility of information to the general public in an unusual way.
Public engagement
Culture and investigation
Education and public outreach
Media and public platform
Our Human Practices project focused on spreading a basic understanding of synthetic biology to the general public. Our group worked and cooperated with another research team from Peking University in order to develop, communicate, and create a diverse and creative project. We try to realize the science popularization and promotion of synthetic biology from many aspects. We investigated the understanding and perception of the majority of people to synthetic biology on the Internet, contacted with numerous organizations to host educational Synthetic Biology workshops for the public and to implement our educational booklet into societies in Beijing. What’s more, we establish an educational Synthetic Biology public platform, to further sustain our efforts for years to come.
Culture and investigation
We launch a discussion about Synthetic Biology on micro-blog on August this year and we found some very interesting results. To our surprise, compared to young people or students, many adults have a large bias in synthetic biology. Because many middle-aged or elderly people did not accept the education of synthesize biological, they know nothing about this knowledge. However, some untrue reports excessively emphasis the hazards of genetically modified product, so many middle-aged people regard transgenic technique as monster. We realized that it was very important to enhance public understanding of synthetic biology.
Education and public outreach
Since September 2016，we picked some places where people are more concentrated, such as the National Library and many residential neighborhood, and got their permissions of giving publicity to the IGEM competition and the knowledge of synthetic biology. At the same time, we produced some brochures about synthetic biology and banners of our IGEM project.
During 12-28th, September, members of our IGEM team came to three Residential quarters and introduced our project to those residents. We sent a lot of brochures and our banners attracted many residents’ attentions. Then we introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to them and demonstrated how Synthetic Biology can make our world better. Meanwhile, we told them what our IG"
TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Project#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of dual aptamers is that these are in general not available for small molecules and viruses, significantly reducing the available targets for the aptamers. The main target for dual aptamers are proteins.
Figure 2: A) Some ligands have multiple apitopes, such that a dual approach can be taken. B) Thrombin (yellow) is one of the protein ligands which has two apitopes, allowing different aptamers to bind at different spots.
Split Aptamers
Alternatively, aptamers can be split into two parts. These parts can form heterodimers and thereby self-assemble into the three-dimensional structure required for binding the apitope. A crucial choice in engineering split aptamers is the choice of splitting site [11] . This choice is often not straightforward and the aptamer often suffers from a significantly decreased affinity. Obtaining split aptamers is, however, still in its infancy: of the approximately 100 small-molecule-binding aptamers, only six have been successfully engineered into split aptamers [11] .
Figure 3: A) Small molecules generally have only a single apitope. An alternative to the dual approach is the construction of split aptamers. B) Engineering of split aptamers is complicated, but split-aptamers for three-way junction aptamers could be obtained. The image under B is adapted from Kent et al. [11] .
The Scaffold - OmpX
To realize conduction of a signal over the cell membrane, the aptamers have to be attached to a membrane protein. A procedure to attach oligonucleotides to membrane proteins has succesfully been tested by iGEM TU Eindhoven 2014. They presented this procedure as a part of their Click Coli project to the iGEM community. The procedure exploits the SPAAC reaction, which is one of the most well-described click chemistry reactions available (see Figure 4).
Figure 4: Strain-promoted Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (SPAAC) is a well known click chemistry reaction. The reaction features two molecules, one functionalized with an azide group (A) and one functionalized with a cyclooctyne group (B). SPAAC is very efficient and selective, no further reagents have to be added to the reaction method and the reaction is completely bio-orthogonal. This image was adapted from last year’s iGEM team’s wiki.
As a proof of concept, iGEM TU Eindhoven employed two membrane proteins as anchors, to which they anchored DNA."
Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". To define the electric response of droplet coalescence system, we used the concepts of electrokinetic model described by Tan et al. This model determines the voltage at the tip of electrode:
(13)
Here i2= -1. CE and Cl are the electric capacitances in the chip which acts as an electric circuit. Next, we we have mathematically removed the imaginary unit from the equation (13).
The cross-sectional view of the droplet coalescence chip is shown in fig.3.
We can rewrite the eq. (13) as
(14)
Then we do a complex-conjugation to get rid of complex number
(15)
After this we can return to the previously-used ratio of voltages:
(16)
From this relation we might find the tip-voltage expressed without an imaginary unit.
From eq. (13) we find the voltage:
(17)
The electrical capacitances are expressed in terms of coalescence chip dimensions:
(18)
The energy density created by an electric field is released into the wider channel (chamber). Multiplying the energy density by a volume of chamber leads to the electric energy supplied by voltage:
(19)
4. Kinetic and dissipated energies
In this section we derive the kinetic energy for the two droplets reaching the coalescence site. We apply the kinetic energy expression, assuming the droplets move in channel with the same velocity as carrier oil. The energy is written as a sum of energies of two different-sized droplets. We write the kinetic energy terms for the energy-balance equation for droplets in a straight channel (HW1) and in the coalescence channel (HWch):
(20)
(21)
Droplets moving through a fluid are exposed to drag forces the same way as solid bodies. The drag force acts against the droplet movement direction. The drag force acting on droplets is expressed by using the Stokes law \(F_{drag} = -6 \pi \eta R v\). Here R is the droplet radius, η and v the viscosity and velocity of the carrier oil. With these arguments the drag-created energy loss is written for two sections analogically to the kinetic energy:
(22)
(23)
It was argued previously that the systems of multiple fluids are dissipative systems . This argument is strengthened for the systems of similar viscosities of two liquids. The coupling between the inner and outer flows around droplets arises and its impact can no longer be neglected [6-7]. The energy dissipated in a coalescence (merging) of droplets will be"

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ocystis to secrete hexose sugar to the medium
Engineer Synechocystis to overproduce hexose sugars
Cyanobacteria use photosynthesis to provide energy and carbon skeletons for anabolic processes. During the day excess fixed carbon can be converted to the polysaccharide, glycogen and stored for later use.  To engineer Synechocystis to overproduce hexose sugars, we will divert carbon away from the glycogen biosynthetic pathway and towards hexose sugar production. To achieve this goal we will create a null mutation in the gene encoding ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP). AGP specifically converts glucose to ADP-glucose which is the monomeric precursor to glycogen. Synechocystis AGP knockout mutants have been reported to no longer produce glycogen, but instead accumulate high levels of sucrose (Miao et al (2003) FEMS Letters 218: 71-77). Fortunately, sucrose can easily be converted to the hexose sugars, glucose and fructose, in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme invertase (INV). Therefore, we will introduce and overexpress the INV gene in the AGP mutant background.
AGP K.O./INV Construct Design
We will simultaneously create the AGP mutant and the INV overexpressing line by inserting the INV expression construct into the coding region of the Synechocystis AGP gene. This will be accomplished by creating an AGP gene replacement construct in which the INV overexpression gene cassette and a kanamycin resistance gene cassette are inserted into the coding region of a subcloned AGP gene. This dysfunctional AGP construct will then be transformed into Synechocystis and through homologous recombination, replace the native AGP gene.
AGP K.O./INV Construct Components
ADP Glucose Pyrophosphorylase (AGP) Gene: The slr1176 open reading frame was PCR amplified from total Synechocystis PCC6803 genomic DNA and subcloned into pSB1a3. Forward and reverse primers were designed with 5’ extensions containing iGEM prefix and suffix sequences.
Invertase (INV) Gene+double terminator: The INV gene was synthesized based on the sequence of a Zymonomas mobilis invertase gene described by Neiderholtmeyer et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology (2010) 76: 3462) which was codon optimized for expression in cyanobacteria. The gene was also"

PSB1C3-TlpB CLONING
First of all we planned to cloning our gene that we ordered from IDT as a G-blocks to the PSB1C3 plasmid for multiply our genes and also for submitting to the iGEM as a biobrick in PSB1C3, for this purpose we cut both our PSB1C3 vector and G-Block of TIpB with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we inserted these G-Blocks to the plasmid with used T4 DNA ligase enzyme and we transformed our plasmid to the BL21 competent bacteria.
For verifying our cloning process we did colony PCR with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If we got the cloning results wrongly we should see 314 bp band but if we achieved the cloning we should see  band.
After Colony PCR, for the clonings that we thought positive we put our bacteria to the 16 hours liquid culture and we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep isolation method. We cutchecked our plasmid DNAs that we got from our isolation for controlling of cloning second time with using EcoRI restriction enzyme.
pET45-TlpB CLONING
After we cloned our genes to PSB1C3 plasmid successfully then we planned to cloning our genes to an expression vector pET45-b for high amount of protein synthesizing. For cloning our gene to this vector, we extracted our genes from PSB1C3-TIpB plasmid with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. We performed ligation with pET45-b vector which is cutted with the same enzymes, then we transformed our plasmid to the BL21 competent bacteria which has a T7 RNA polymerase.
For verifying our cloning process we did colony PCR with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If we got the cloning results wrongly we should see 360 bp band but if we achieved the cloning we should see 2007 band.

Thanks to the help from the team leader of team SYSU-CHINA, we successfully finished our judging form.
Collaboration with team BGIC_China
Team BGIC_China is one of the high school iGEM team in Shenzhen. Their project of this year required them to condense and desiccate their biological samples on filter papers, which they lacked in laboratory. Thus, we helped team BGIC_China by lending out our lyophilizer to them. They came to our laboratory to operate the last step of their experiments before lyophilizing and used our lyophilizer to condense and desiccate their biological samples, finally finishing their project.
The Next day we did a questionnaire on what they think about our project and some other questions. Including what they think about GMO, how well do they know about energies.  The details of the result will be shown in the engagement part. We also spent some time to design a fun booklet that holds simple knowledge of synthetic biology and other science knowledge to handout to them. Since most of them stopped their education at primary school, we want to teach them some simple and interesting science knowledge in this way and encourage the children to get more education.
At night we called the whole village together and had a public presentation on science. The knowledge we taught are useful so they listened very carefully. We told the children why they look like their parents. Most of the people in the village first heard about DNA. And they don’t believe giving birth to a boy is entirely depend on the father before we told them. And to make the knowledge simpler, we even draw a lot of cartoon figures before we went to the village to help them understand.
From the experience to the countryside we finally knew about the actual difficulties they are facing in their daily life， and that is exactly what we should try to solve for them.

The car was fully loaded with necessary equipment and chemicals, including a MacNichol integrating photometer of gigantic size (a two-foot cube), and four travelers (my wife and Yo Saiga, an assistant, came along) with all of their baggage on the roof. It took us seven days to the West Coast, through Chicago and Glacier National Park. Dr. Johnson was the only driver throughout the trip, driving 12 hours a day with an admirable toughness.
Upon arrival at the Friday Harbor Laboratories, we were welcomed by Dr. Robert Fernald, Director of the Lab. We set up our work space in Lab 1, a small building consisting of two rooms, and we started to work. There were three other scientists in the room, and one of them Received 23 March 1995; accepted 5 June 1995. was Dr. Dixy Lee Ray, future governor of Washington State, who was always accompanied by a dog, her wellknown trademark. The laboratory area was a sanctuary prohibited to common dogs, but she declared that the animal was her assistant, not a dog.
The jellyfish were abundant. A constant stream of floating jellyfish passed along the side of the lab dock every morning and evening, riding with the current caused by the tide. We carefully scooped up the jellyfish into buckets, one by one, using a shallow dip-net. The specimens of Aequorea are shaped like hemispherical umbrellas and are nearly transparent. An average specimen measures 3- 4 inches in diameter and weighs about 50 g. The light organs-about 100 granules-are distributed evenly along the edge of the umbrella. Thus, the margin of the umbrella containing light organs could be easily cut off with a pair of scissors, yielding a thin strip called a “ring.” When the rings obtained from 20-30 jellyfish were squeezed through a rayon gauze, a liquid called “squeezate” was obtained. The squeezate was only dimly luminescent, but when it was diluted with water, the luminescence increased significantly for a period of 5- 10 minutes, as the granular light organs were cytolyzed.
We tried to extract luminescent substance from the squeezate by every thinkable method, but all failed; and we ran out of ideas after only a few days of work. Convinced that the cause of our failure was the luciferin-luciferase hypothesis that dominated our thinking, I suggested to Dr. Johnson that we should forget the idea of extracting luciferin and luciferase and,"

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#solution_-_-_TEXT.html," can be activated by the LuxR-HSL complex when the autoinducer reaches a critical concentration.
When a cell population expresses luxI, the concentration of HSL is an increasing function of cell culture density and so the induction of the lux pR promoter occurs only when the cells reach a threshold density.
Taking inspiration from this natural regulation mechanism, a library of self-inducible devices was built by engineering quorum sensing circuits in E. coli. The critical cell density was modulated by changing the autoinducer molecule synthesis rate. In this way, the library members can initiate the lux pR gene expression at different cell densities of the host strain. In V. fischeri, the lux pR regulates a set of genes involved in the bioluminescence of the bacteria, but in synthetic circuits based on this regulatory mechanism users can regulate the expression of the desired genes (Fig.1).

Parts and system overview
Two BioBrick parts already present in the Registry were used in this module. The RBS-luxI part (<partinfo>BBa_K081008</partinfo>) was assembled upstream of the double terminator <partinfo>BBa_B0015</partinfo>, thus obtaining the fundamental part to build self-inducible circuits, <partinfo>BBa_K300009</partinfo> (Fig.2).
Figure 2: <partinfo>BBa_K300009</partinfo> PoPS->HSL sender device.
This part was used as signal generator, while the signal receiver part is <partinfo>BBa_F2620</partinfo> and is shown in Fig.3.
Figure 3: <partinfo>BBa_F2620</partinfo> receiver device.
In order to build a library of self-inducible devices, another foundamental device was obtained by assembling <partinfo>BBa_K300009</partinfo> upstream of <partinfo>BBa_F2620</partinfo>, thus obtaining the part <partinfo>BBa_K300010</partinfo> (Fig.4).

These systems have the behaviour shown in Fig.5: luxR is constitutively produced under the control of the tetR promoter, while luxI is produced under the control of a different constitutive promoter.
The HSL synthesis rate was modulated by assembling constitutive promoters of different strength upstream of luxI"

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Overview#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html,"st Modified Spinach2 sequence, Original Spinach2 sequence and 2nd Modified Spinach2 Sequence.
The original Spinach2 is shown in the center of Figure 2. The red area indicates the location of the SpeI restriction site in the DNA sequence. The goal of the mutations was to remove the SpeI site while conserving the structure, folding efficiency and DFHBI-binding of the resulting RNA. The first and most promising suggestion was to swap two bases that are predicted to bind. The second strategy was to change one base into another chemically similar base, i.e. changing a uracil (U) predicted not to bind any other bases, to cytosine (C), another pyrimidine base.
RNA is usually quite unstable in vivo, which directly influences the concentrations we would be able to measure. Therefore we decided to stabilise the Spinach RNA by flanking it with a tRNA scaffold, a method that has also been employed by the inventors of Spinach.
Measuring Anderson Library Promoters
Previous work with Spinach and Spinach2 in E. coli has been done using only very strong promoters (e.g. T7 promoters and rRNA promoters) to express the aptamer. We wanted to develop a method that can also be used to measure the activity of promoters of more modest strength. We decided to use promoters from the Anderson library as representatives of E. coli housekeeping promoters of varying strength.
Using An In Vitro Standard
Since there is no well-established standard unit for measuring fluorescence, we decided to make an in vitro Spinach standard series that can be used to correlate fluorescence to RNA concentration, by adding known concentrations of DFHBI-1T to excess Spinach RNA. The advantage of using such a standard compared to a universally agreed upon, but arbitrarily chosen fluorescence unit, is that it allows calculation of RNA concentration (and hence RNA formation rate) in chemically meaningful units, that can be readily compared with concentrations obtained from other assays.

Evry,2014,Team:Evry#Biology#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," solution (35ng/µL). After the standard heat shock protocol for E.coli, cells were spread on 1X MB medium plates. We did not obtain any transformant from this protocol.
By studying transformation of bacteria phylogenetically close of our strain Pseudovibrio denitrificans, we noticed that marines bacteria are often resistant to common chemical transformation approaches (Piekarski T, Buchholz I, 2009) .
We considered testing protocols of conjugation and electroporation to transform our bacteria. Unfortunately, due to the lack of time we just tested the electroporation approach.
Two important parameters had to be finalized though; the type and the number of cell washes and also the voltage.
Washing test
Marine bacteria live in a salty environment. Thus, a classic water wash may to lead to an osmotic shock. Therefore, we tested washes with glycerol 10% and sorbitol 2% to try to limit the shock.
Figure6: Protocol of washing tests
Pre-cultures of Pseudovibrio denitrificans and E.coli cells were prepared and grew in an shaking incubator overnight at 30°C and 37°C respectively. After performing the protocol (see section Protocols ) of electrocompetents cells, 20µL of pre-cultures were spread when the DO(600nm) reached 1.5 for Pseudovibrio and 0.5 for E.coli, on plates corresponding to the media used for pre-cultures. CFU were then counted for all plates (Table5).
Table5: Results of washing test, number of CFU for the different washes.
Washes tests reveal that sorbitol is the best way to wash cells in MB pre-culture. Gycerol can also be used. For pre-cultures in M9, the better way to wash cells is by using glycerol.
Voltage test
For this part, we had to find the voltage which allows the best efficiency, by not killing the cells but by being important enough to transform our bacteria.
To achieve this goal, we developed a similar protocol as the standard protocol described previously, by testing different voltages on our cells, without plasmids (Figure7).

Pre-cultures of Pseudovibrio denitrificans and E.coli were prepared and grew overnight in a shaking incubator, at 30°C and 37°C respectively. After performing the protocol (see section Protocols ) of electro"

This supports our second hypothesis                 that there should be an increase in expression after induction by AHL.
Antisense type I (PFB+asRNA1)
Antisense type II (PFB+asRNA2)
Fig. 5 Error bar presents SD from 6 biological replicates.
Fig. 6 Error bar presents SD from 6 biological replicates.
Conclusions
Our antisense RNAs construct can verify the following hypotheses:
There is a significant decrease in basal expression level when antisense RNA type I and II are used.
Antisense RNA type II reduces basal level expression more efficiently.
Positive feedback loop remains function after activation by 1.00E-05 M of AHL after 3 hours.
Suggestions
Antisense RNA sequences can be further fine-tuned to investigate higher efficiency of basal level reduction. Insertion of a stabilizer element would increase antisense RNA’s half-life (Engdahl, 2001).
Higher concentration of AHL can be tested with PFB+asRNA1 and PFB+asRNA2 to investigate their effects on expression level in positive feedback loop.
The effect of AHL positive feedback loop can be tested in population dynamics
Additional comments/Notes
W/ PFB sample increases the expression by only 4,316.5 gfp/OD600 when induced by 1.00E-05 M AHL after 3                     hours, at the same time which fluorescence of w/o PFB increases by 10 folds.
Fig. 1 and 3 show that w/o PFB produces the highest fluorescence/OD600, while W/ PFB is significantly lower.                     This has been experienced by brown iGEM team 2007, where their hypotheses have been proven false due                     to an inverse relationship of GFP expression between the control (no feedback loop) and the one with                     LuxI (Positive feedback loop). Given that the concentration of SAM is constant, the unpredictable lower level of fluorescence may be due to high concentration of AHL and low concentration of luxI that cause the shift in equilibrium to the reactant (SAM) rather than to the product side. However, in our course of experiment, we were interested in the efficiency of two types                     of antisense RNA in reducing basal expression level, so we took W/ PFB construct for the comparison.
We have considered tuning pLuxR promoter instead of adding ABR and antisense RNA. However, we predicted                     that there will"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,"Bio-photography is the application of genetically engineered bacteria to act as the light sensor of a camera, akin to current [ CCD/CMOS ] digital sensors and photographic film. One huge advantage of using bacteria is their micrometer scale surface area. This gives them the property of being much smaller than a digital sensor, giving bio-cameras the potential to produce images with far greater resolution and pixel density than current digital photography offers.
We aim to produce the world's first colour bio-photograph by producing cyan, magenta and yellow pigments in response to red, green and blue light. We plan to combine this system with a lens to focus the image onto plated bacteria to form the world's first colour bio-camera.
Colour system
To produce the full colour spectrum requires all three primary colours . This is because any colour can be produced by mixing the primary colours but primary colours cannot be produced by mixing any colours.
In our system we are using two sets of primary colours. red, green and blue for light and cyan, magenta and yellow for pigments. This is because light and pigment mix differently; light is additive and pigment is subtractive:
Light and pigment produce colour in different ways. While coloured light has a peak wavelength corresponding to its colour, coloured pigment absorbs all wavelengths that do not correspond to its colour and so reflect the corresponding coloured light:
Using Boolean Algebra , various different colour pairing systems can be tested. If red, blue and yellow pigments were to be used, the closest pairing of inputs would require the following logic for the expression of yellow pigment:
which simplifies to
Where Y is the yellow pigment expression, R red light input; G green light input, B blue light input. But this pigment system is unable to produce cyan and magenta accurately.
The most common pigment selection for printing is CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). The boolean expression for the yellow pigment expression in this system,
which simplifies to
The full logic gate system required for accurate expression is seen below. As can be seen, this system requires 3 NOT gates; 2 OR gates; and 4 AND gates. This would be difficult to successfully implement in a biological system.
To simplify this system, if we remove the black pigment K, the boolean expression for yellow expression becomes
which simplifies very nicely to
In fact the boolean expressions for all the pigment expression in the CMY system simplify. The full logic gate system for the CMY pigment system can be seen below.
This system shows red, green, and blue light repressing the production of cyan, magenta and yellow pigment"

Human Practices
The UCLA iGEM Team is committed to being an advocate for the universal advancement and acceptance of synthetic biology, and we believe that progress through the field can only be achieved by informing and teaching the youth of our society. As such, our Human Practices project centers around education of Los Angeles youth to show them the potential of synthetic biology, and furthermore think of the implications and ethics behind scientific progress and research.
This year, we worked with Nava College Prep Academy, a school community founded and run school in East Los Angeles to inspire high school students and help them explore the world of synthetic biology. Our project consisted of a two day workshop, the first of which took place at UCLA and the latter in East Los Angeles.
The first workshop was centered around providing an introduction to synthetic biology, as the high school students were about to embark on a month long synthetic biology unit in their science class. We shared our previous work with our 2015 iGEM project-the customization and functionalization of synthetic silk fibers, as well as the foundation the 2016 project. Following a short presentation about the Central Dogma of Biology, genetic circuitry, and gene expression, we then asked the students to apply what the learned to manipulate genetic circuits and create bi-stable switches using parts we provided for them. Many of the students were very eager and engaged with the activity, almost viewing it like a puzzle-in a very similar way that we as researchers approach our own projects! We concluded the workshop with a tour of our lab space and a Q&A panel, giving the students a chance to ask any questions they had about research or synthetic biology.
Our second workshop occurred at the conclusion of the students' synthetic biology unit, and as such we chose to focus on inspiring their creativity and innovation. After a short presentation about cool technologies and projects that have arisen out of synthetic biology today, we had the students think about what the world would like look in the frame of synthetic biological and biotechnological advances. The students, armed with new knowledge about the power of synthetic biology, were able to harness into its potential and come up with many cool ideas-from GMOs that could withstand any kind of weather and terrain, to making new wacky species of animals that are crosses of other species. It was really awe-inspiring to see the young people of our society thinking creatively about"

BBa_K1060001 contains EBF synthase from Streptomyces coelicolor. In this organism the enzyme albaflavenone synthase (GenBank: AL939123.1) also has a second, completely distinct catalytic activity corresponding to the synthesis of farnesene isomers from farnesyl diphosphate (Zhao et al., 2009). It results in the production of (E)-beta-farnesene (61%).

(A) The anti-Cm phage system effectively killed 99.1% of the population at 1 mg/mL of Chloramphenicol. (B) Of the surviving cells, 70% still carried the GFP phage marker. This suggests that 70% of system failure originates from resistance to the siRNA, and 30 originates from resistance to the phage.

Structural analysis of SirA
Using Swiss pdb we demonstrated the superimposed 3D structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis SirA and Escherichia coli CysI highlighting their similarities and differences. Both proteins are important in their respective sulphite reduction pathways. We then predicted the effect of a small drug target based on SirA's structure.
Flux Balance Analysis
We used an E. coli model iJR904 obtained from BiGG database as a starting model and obtained a growth rate represented by the f value of 0.9129. We then deleted the reaction ‘SULR’ which encodes for the sulphite reduction pathway involving cysI and obtained a f value of -8.63596783409936e-13 indicating that the sulphite reduction pathway is required for growth.

Since we needed to use this part in fusion proteins we improved the part by submitting it as a basic part in RFC(25) (link) Freiberg fusion format ( K1321009 ).
We successfully cloned the following CBD fusion constructs with NiBP:
However we discovered late on in the project that the DNA sequence of the NiBP protein in the registry is out of frame, leading to an incorrect protein translation and read-through of the stop codon (figure 2).

Figure 3. Single nucleotide deletion in BBa_K1151001 compared to native H.pylori sequence ( GenBank CP000012.1 (link ) bp1391851-1392033, reverse complement) resulting in any downstream nucleotides being out of frame.
Further investigation into the error let us to identify a single nucleotide deletion in BBa_K1151001 compared to the native H.pylori DNA sequence ( GenBank CP000012.1 bp1391851-1392033, reverse complement strand).  As seen in Figure 3 the deletion is a ‘C’ at bp 53 of the native sequence. This error was propagated through all our NiBP constructs and means that any subsequent C-terminal fusions are also out of frame and we were unable to express and characterise these constructs. We have noted this on the description pages for each of the parts and hope that in the future they will still be useful, since the error could be corrected relatively easily by a team who wishes to use them by site-directed-mutagenesis PCR to insert the missing nucleotide.

India Meetup
We, the iGEM IISER Pune Team, with the help of our Head of Biology Department and our PI and mentors, hosted a meetup for the iGEM teams of India on 16th and 17th October 2015. Members from the IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur teams came to IISER Pune for a two-day program that turned out to not only be great fun, but also very helpful with all our projects!
Together with the PhD student mentors Manasi Gangan and Neha Khetan, three sessions were held, one for each of the attending teams. The first day began with an introductory session by Dr. Chaitanya Athale, the PI for our team followed by us presenting our project idea “Mycobacterium revelio”. After a question and answer round from all the participants of the meetup (including IIT Delhi and IIT kharagpur teams, students of IISER Pune and faculty members of IISER Pune) the first day came to an end.
IIT Kharagpur started Day 2 with their presentation “Detection of Food Spoilage Using  Quorum Sensing Systems in E. coli ”. After another question and answer round and the much needed lunch break, IIT Delhi presented their project “Eco.coli- A novel pollution crusader      system ”.
These presentations gave us a new perspective of our project and helped us prepare for the Giant Jamboree. The discussions with everyone helped us discuss problems we all were facing in the laboratories and possible solutions. Overall, the meetup gave us inputs on our project and enhanced our presentation skills. We also got an opportunity to interact with other iGEM teams and have a great time!

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html," supplemented media (ODAT) was divided by the optical density of the reference E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 in ATP supplemented media (ODAR). The same was done for the cultures in K2HPO4 supplemented media(ODKT and ODKR). The value for ATP was then divided by the value for K2HPO4. The sum of the quotient for all measurement points n was then divided by n to obtain the final value for the relative beneficial effect of PtNTT2 shown in Figure 14. The final error was calculated through error propagation of the standard error of each measured optical density.
Figure 14: Relative beneficial effect of the different PtNTT2 variants.
As expected, the native transporter variant shows the highest positive effect since it most likely also exhibits the highest activity. Surprisingly, the two truncated versions show a higher effect than the versions with a pelB and TAT signal peptide.
Of all transporter variants, the native PtNTT2 showed the highest beneficial effect with a value of 1.360 ± 0.161. The second highest value was reached by PtNTT2(31-575) with 1.294 ± 0.107. PtNTT2(66-575) reached a value of 1.166 ± 0.105, pelB-SP-PtNTT2 one of 1.073 ± 0.114 and TAT-SP-PtNTT2 one of 0.732 ± 0.116.
This data suggests that the expression of different PtNTT2 variants, especially of the native PtNTT2, is beneficial for the cell when cultivated in MOPS minimal media supplemented with ATP as the sole phosphate source. Given that the reference strain does not express PtNTT2, the expression of PtNTT2 must have a beneficial effect for the cells since they grow better compared to the reference in ATP when compared to the reference in K2HPO4. Therefore, the beneficial effect is larger than the metabolic burden associated with recombinant protein expression. Consequently, the transporter exhibits a function beneficial to the cell in ATP supplemented media, meaning it can facilitate the direct uptake of ATP from the media. Therefore, the proposed activity of PtNTT2 in media supplemented with low concentrations of ATP could be verified.
Consequently, the same experiment was conducted with MOPS minimal media supplemented with 10 mM ATP. The relative beneficial effects of the experiment are summarized in Figure 15.

The Diffusible Signalling Factor (DSF) Sensing System
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Building the DSF Sensor
Characterisation
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Diffusible Signalling Factor (DSF) is a long chain cis-unsaturated fatty acid produced by bacteria of the Xanthomonas genus and the CF lung pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia1,2.  To build our synthetic DSF detector, we chose to reconstitute the well-characterised DSF signal perception system from Xanthomonas campestris in our E. coli chassis. As can be seen in Fig 1, the RpfC/RpfG system, which perceives and responds to DSF, is more complex than the average two component system. DSF is detected at the periplasmic side of the inner membrane by the RpfC sensor protein, which autophosphorylates and then transfers its phospho group to the  cytoplasmic response regulator RpfG . However, instead of acting as a direct transcriptional regulator, phosphorylated RpfG acts as a phosphodiesterase cleaving the second-messenger molecule cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) into two GMP molecules3,4. This reduction in cellular c-di-GMP relieves inhibition of the transcriptional activator Clp , which is then free to bind to the manA promoter and allow"

Instead (for the last 3 resuspensions)) I just tapped the side of the 50mL tube repeatedly until it resuspended. This was after reading several forum posts outline the importance of being gentle. Therefore, for both reasons of density and ""gentleness,"" I believe that the tubes marked with an orange ""5"" will be the preferrable ones. TBD

PR when amplified from K773002 at a range of temperatures. All seem to work... The range of different sizes are likely the result of too much template plasmid. The whole range of DNA pieces, from the full length of the plasmid down to the expected size were likely generated after each cycle, resulting in that perfect smear. For that reason, it's probably smart to do another round of PCR with the excized DNA as a template, to ensure that the resulting PR doesn't have any of the incorrectly amplified DNA. The line between the brighest band and the rest of the smear above is from the cut I put into the gel with a razor, i.e. it's not real and not useful.
The pSB1C3 was gel purified and nanodropped. It had a concentration of 15 ng/uL. I diluted the DNA and used it as a template for another round of pSB1C3 PCR. Given the high annealing temp of the lower temp primer (69 degrees) I did a two-step PCR, where it hangs at 72 degrees for 1:30 for both annealing and elongation, then goes back to 98 for 10 seconds for denaturation. Will do a diagnostic gel tomorrow.

Within the week, we gave the same class a tour of two labs belonging to our advisors. Kelly Schwarz, our team’s graduate student advisor, exhibited projects investigating exosomes in Josh Leonard’s lab. She then led a “painting” activity employing fluorescent bacteria of various colors. Ben Des Soye, a grad student in Michael Jewett’s lab, talked to the students about research in cell-free protein synthesis. The students asked insightful questions on both tours, such as “How do you avoid contaminating mammalian cells?” and “Why would you want to make proteins outside of cells rather than inside?” In addition to answering these questions, we explained the concept of CRISPR Capsules.

Perspectives Charter School
At the summer’s end, we were given the opportunity to teach a high school biotechnology class for a day at the Perspectives Charter School campus in Auburn Gresham, a high-risk neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. Teach for America member Emma Nechamkin helped us prepare our presentation material, which took almost a full month to plan. Emma emphasized that her students were a “challenging group.” Aiming to provide an engaging lecture, we filled the slides of our presentation with images and GIFs.
We brought with us two bags of GMO-free fruit juice pouches and conventional honeycrisp apples from Whole Foods. The class had 25 students ranging between the ages of thirteen and nineteen. None of them had any prior exposure to research science. We handed out juice pouches. Initially, we discussed GMO foods, using the “non-GMO” juice pouches as a segway for our discussion on “What is genetic engineering?”
We explained the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, CRISPR-Cas9, our iGEM project, and grant proposals. Students asked questions such as “If I cut off a lion’s tail, can I use CRISPR to give myself a tail?” and “If I were to modify the DNA of an animal, would that animal change completely?” At the conclusion of our presentation, we asked the students to write grant proposal outlines explaining how they would use CRISPR to solve a problem. We encouraged crazy ideas and walked around the classroom to interact with the students. One group of students said they’d use CRISPR to “give a person a twin if they wanted one.” Another group said they would “change other people’s mindset” and “end racism.” After the students completed their grants, we gave everyone apples,"

Glucose Toggle Switch
Introduction
In the laboratory, IPTG serves as one of the most effective molecular inducers of transcriptional activity and therefore genetic elements responsive to this inducer are common. Commercialized pET vectors used a bacteriophage T7 late promoter upstream of the gene or genes of interest. This promoter is only recognized by the T7 polymerase which is under control of the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter. This system creates large amounts of mRNA and, often the desired protein in high concentrations (40 to 50% of the total cell protein). However, has drawbacks such as high level of mRNA can cause cell death or possibly results in plasmid or expression instability. The pET plasmids also are toxic to E. coli in the presence of IPTG(Miroux and Walker, 1996).
Additionally, IPTG is moderately expensive; this makes many approaches that utilizes this inducer financially impractical at an industrial scale with specific biotechnological products(Briand et al., 2016). To make the production of PHA plastics competitive with petroleum-based plastics, as many costs as possible will have to be reduced.  Therefore, developing an alternate strategy for the induction of transcription of the genes that code for the enzymes in the pathway of production of the product represents a hurdle to be overcome.
Figure 1 The glucose sensing toggle switch architecture showing individual parts. Toggle switch contains the LacI responsive promoter (trcp), which expresses TetR and mCherry, and the TetR responsive promoter (tetOp) which expresses lacI and gfp. The two transcription are under the control of the opposite’s promoter. The (cAMP) receptor promoter (crpp) activates transcription of lacI when glucose levels become low, turning the switch (ON). Reporter proteins (GFP and RFP) show whether the toggle switch is on or off. Image modified from Bothfeld et al.(Bothfeld et al., 2017)

Tri-stable switch is a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while signal interference is prevented. In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s tri-stable switch model in 2006"
UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," our co-spun fiber.
We took images along three points on the fiber and used ImageJ to measure the diameter of the fiber at each point. We then averaged the measurements and found the fiber's radius to be 13.9 +/- 0.3 um.
Fiber fluorescence
We used an EVOS FL digital microscope to take microscopic images of our fibers. Natural silk showed some background fluorescence, but the co-spun fiber with GFP co-spinning module had considerably stronger fluorescence, as determined by visual assessment. Unfortunately, we were unable to quantify the difference in fluorescence.
Fluorescence microscopy of the same fiber. 470 nm wavelength excitation light was used at 100% intensity in the EVOS FL digital microscope.
For comparison, this is fluorescence microscopy of native Bombyx mori silk. 470 nm wavelength excitation light was used at 100% intensity in the EVOS FL digital microscope.
Fiber Strength
Stress Strain curve for the co-spun silk with GFP co-spinning module.
Our fiber had a Young's modulus of 5.39 GPa. The Young's modulus is a measure of the fiber's elasticity. The fiber's ultimate strength, or stress at which failure occurs, was 103.4 +/- 6.6 MPa. The toughness of the fiber, which is the total energy that the fiber absorbed before breaking, was 1.47 megaJoules. The maximum strain, or deformation, that the fiber tolerated before breaking was 2.2% of the original unstressed length (10mm).
Overall, this fiber that we co-spun was extremely stiff and brittle and did not match the properties of natural silk. However, this could be largely attributed to the fact that we did not stretch the fiber after spinning, which is known to be a crucial process that confers silk with much of its natural strength and elasticity.[3] It has been determined in the literature that silk reconstituted from silk dopes and stretched to several times its length can have properties matching or even exceeding those of natural silk fibers.[6] Stretching is known to cause further formation of beta sheet crystals in the fiber, as well as align them in the same axis which allows them to form more hydrogen bonds with each other, thereby increasing the fiber's overall strength.[6] We still need to stretch our co-spun silk after spinning in order to determine if the GFP co-spinning module actually interferes with the structure and strength of the reconstituted silk.

I am a rising senior majoring in Chemistry in University of Science and Technology. I decided to participate in iGEM not only to do some interesting research, but also to learn how to turn a simple idea to a successful work. In the 2012 USTC iGEM team, I learned much knowledge about synthetic biology and had a good time with the team members. Previous to iGEM, I worked in the lab of analytical chemistry at USTC, trying to use a fluorescent material as novel molecular probe to find the cancer cell using imaging technology. In my leisure time, I like to play table-tennis and badminton.

Hi, everyone. I am Jinxin Wang, a sophomore student majoring in biology at University of Science and Technology of China. With tremendous interest in iGEM, I am delighted to share two-month time with my teammates. At the period of my time in laboratory, I have learnt a lot of valuable spirits, such as teamwork, patience and insistence.
As a sophomore student, I am not familiar with scientific research. In retrospect, I find myself standing on a solid basis in both theory and experience. But things turn better after I join iGEM. It is not only a interesting competition, but also a useful method making me realize the secret of synthetic biology. I like it very much~

Hi! I am a junior student majoring in Biology at University of science and technology of China. Being a member of the USTC iGEM2012, I have learned a lot during this summer. It attracts me into the world of synthetic biology. Besides, I pick up some html&css language and construct my first website--our wiki! That is a process where I make every efforts to rise to the challenge. What's more, iGEM has taught me how to cooperate with others. Without those discussions with my partners, I can hardly achieve what I have done. I feel so lucky here and would like to say that IGEM is the coolest game"

He also felt that the biggest problems were with regard to ‘consumables, educators and training, logistic support,      electricity, dust, protocol, and bio-safety’.
One of the laboratory assistants felt that ‘since we don’t have any idea or knowledge how it works, doctors might not      be able to accept the results unless they are oriented on how it works. We also need to be trained on the working principle’.      She felt that the biggest problems that she could foresee were the ‘lack of educators, inadequate logistic support and      insufficient monitoring of test quality’.
Despite the barriers that must be overcome, they felt that ‘this is a good development to our hospital and country since      the test will require few reagents’ and that ‘the project is good’ and that there is ‘no need of big storage facilities’.

Including the Community
Donnchadh went to several out-reach clinics and schools to increase awareness of synthetic biology among the Malawian people.      Donnchadh used a translator to communicate with the locals and gave a brief presentation to the mothers who used to come to      the out-reach clinics for vaccinating their children. He explained to the iGEM team when he came back that ‘the outreach was      a great chance to meet the locals and talk to them about the potential benefits of synthetic biology. I told them that we were      hoping to use bacteria to detect viruses and the things that make people sick. They all seemed very positive about the project      and about synthetic biology as a whole.
Donnchadh also went to the local primary and secondary schools. He gave a presentation to each of the classes. The teachers were      happy to learn from the presentation too and informed Donnchadh after he left the school that he had augmented interest in science      among the kids and that the presentation had ‘inspired the teachers to get more involved in the world of science and synthetic biology too’.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Light system_-_-_TEXT.html,". Our results       indicate that five hours of illumination lead to the highest level of SEAP expression (Fig. 2).
Another important finding was the specificity of the blue light system.        In the dark controls, we found almost no activation of the SEAP reporter,       leading to a very low background level in our system.
SEAP as a Reporter
In order to test the capability of the blue light system for pattern generation, we transfected HEK-293T cells with the appropriate plasmids (PKM292 and PKM297) using seap as a reporter gene (PKM084). Cells were transfected in suspension and seeded on 96 well plates afterwards. Single wells of these plates were covered with a photo mask that prevents exposure to light. All other wells on the plate were illuminated to induce SEAP expression. SEAP that was secreted into the culture medium leads to a colour change from red to yellow after addition of pNPP (chromogenic substrate) by its phosphorylation.
First we generated a coarse pattern realizing that scattered light also reached wells that were close to the illuminated ones, leading to an unclear pattern. However, the rough shape of the desired pattern is discernible (Fig. 3A, B).
Since it was essential to completely prevent light exposure on covered plates, we tested 96 well plates with optically separated wells. We could generate patterns with sharp contours (Fig. 3C, D).
The colour change of pNPP in cell culture medium could be measured at 405 nm in a plate reader. Setting a distinct threshold made pattern recognition easier.

HEK-293T cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292, PKM297) and       light induced SEAP as reporter (PKM084). Single wells were covered with a photo       mask to prevent cell from light exposure. 24 hours after illumination with blue       light, a SEAP assay was performed, leading to a colour change of wells containing SEAP.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

Although the most optimistic iGEMers may believe that their project will succeed in the                         first attempt, truth is that it may take several attempts before even getting the first                         expected results. However, the best way to acquire experience and improve one's performance                         at a given activity is “resilience”. Embracing our mistakes and learning from them allowed                         us to overcome obstacles throughout the development of our project. Even though people may                         consider mistakes as a failure, for iGEM Nebraska, it’s all the other way around, or at                         least that is the impression we got from the collaboration they organized: A scrapbook that                         contained and displayed with pride the worst electrophoresis gels of the participating                         teams. Thanks to the scrapbook, teams like ours presented some of the mistakes made during                         the competition. This collaboration inspired us to do our best and changed our minds to                         understand mistakes as opportunities to improve.

Public recognition
We designed a questionnaire to get to know about the public recognition of energy crisis as well as clean energy. From the current data, we drew some conclusions as follows:
Ways to understand the current energy situation: Internet 83.33%, and 8.73% from newspapers, magazines, books, etc.
Confidence in the development of new energy: large development potential 68.25%, slow development 20.63%
For the ""new energy"" category of judgment: over 80% have a clearer understanding
Among them, biological energy and solar energy bear the highest expectations
More than half of respondents expressed willingness to try new energy drivers / related products, and 30% took a wait-and-see attitude
The application of new energy in society: more than 90% of respondents believe that the most useful way is to use electricity and provide transportation power
The price is too high, the quality of products is unstable and the use is inconvenient. It has become the first three reasons that prevent respondents from buying new energy products
Our vision
Green technology is the future, especially the biotechnology.
Our practice carried out practical investigation with multi-dimension, deeply explored current energy situation, the prospects for the development of a new focus on renewable energy. 
The team members actively interacted with professional expertise and conducted investigations of the energy enterprise learning its culture. Think about how to use synthetic biology methods to synthesize efficient and clean green energy.
Conclusion
What we have got through this part of human practice helps us have a better understanding of
1. The current energy policy in China
2. Investigations of energy enterprise operation mode and enterprise culture
3. Ideas on selecting the next experimental design to energy

Our basic Human Practices include the questionnaire, interview and policy survey. We expanded our Human Practices to many other aspects, during which we heard the voice from professors, veteran experts, entrepreneur managers as well as other teams. They represented some different views from the public and authorities, helping us to understand the project from different perspectives so that we could collect the feedback to interpret those results into our experimental design. Secondly, we set up our iGEM club to provide a platform for students to exchange academic knowledge.
Lastly, to improve public engagement of iGEM in China, we designed our own Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.

4.8 Bacteria Determining Titer
I) Purpose
Choose a bacterium to grow phage in.
II) Expected Outcome
Larger plaques in the bacteria where the phage were able to travel and infect the best.
III) Reagants Used
BL21
W3110
LB
1 X LB Top Agar (TA)
Phage:
1L
10L
40T4
T4DOS
T4 Infected
IV) Actual Procedure
We placed 100 µL of LB broth into 6 tubes, labeled 0 to -5. We repeated this for all 5 strains of phage. Next, 10 µL phage was transferred to the tube labeled '0'. The tube was vortexed and 10µL was transferred to the next tube. this was repeated to the concentration of -5.
While performing this procedure, we had innoculated .5 mL LB broth with W3110, and another .5 mL culture with BL21. This was done six times for each bacterium, so each phage type would have it's own plate split into 6 concentrations of phage.
Next we plated the bacteria using 4.5 mL TA and .5 Bacterial cultures. The plates were segmented, and we spotted 5µL of the different concentrations of phage onto the various segments of the plates.
To finish, the plates were incubated overnight at 37°C.
V) Results
Phage 10L w/ w3110 had large scale infection every concentration
Phage 10L w/ BL21 had infection"

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," DW/L], k is the maximum growth rate [1/h], K is the substrate affinity [mol/L], and c is the concentration of cross-fed metabolite [mol/L]. In the last equation, we look at the change in the extracellular concentration of the respective limiting nutrients. Here, α represents the export rate of a nutrient [mol/(g DW*h)] in the organism that produces it. β is the required amount of the same nutrient for growth, for the organism that is limited by its availability [mol/g DW].
MATLAB Simulation
We used MATLAB to solve the differential equations above for two organisms simultaneously, with a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. While the coding itself did not present any problems, finding the correct values for all parameters turned out to be trickier. For that reason, we have only looked at parameters for Synechocystis and Y. lipolytica, the latter being the production organism to have shown the most promise in the lab.
Parameter Estimation
Making a parameter estimation for the maximum growth rate was not very difficult for either organism, as we had data from our growth trials . The remaining parameters proved more difficult, since there are of course no papers published on the effects of changes we have made ourselves during the project. The ideal solution would be to perform experiments ourselves to measure export rates and growth requirements of the essential nutrients, as well as substrate affinities. Lacking enough time in the lab for this, however, we have elected to make some rough estimations of what these parameters might be, in order to be able to show the model at work. See table 1 for a list of all parameter values.

UCSF_UCB,2014,Team:UCSF UCB#project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"Conceptual Framework
All multicellular systems, and many examples of collectives of unicellular organisms, communicate in order to respond and adapt to their environment. However, biological systems are pervaded by noise, and surprisingly in the face of that, many biological responses are robust and withstand cell-to-cell variation [ 1 ].
Using endogenous signaling pathways found in yeast, communicating “sense-and-secrete” circuits can be designed to interrogate cell-to-cell signaling, and collective response, in these organisms. Depending on the communication parameters — signal strength, receptor abundance, and signal degradation — researchers were able to tune the strength and output of these communicating cells [ 2 ].
We expand on this previous work by investigating further the relationship between cell-to-cell variation and the collective community response of cells. We have engineered yeast strains to report two responses by fluorescence: 1) a cell autonomous response triggered by an experimental induction and 2) a collective community response driven by cell-cell signaling. We are thus able to read simultaneously the relationship between the individual cell response and the post-cellular signal processing that occurs through extracellular signaling.
Please click ""next"" in the upper right corner of this box for an explanation of each component of this theoretical circuit and our implementation of this circuit.
Next Prev
Conceptual Framework: Stimulus
In our generalized circuit design, we would like to be able to stimulate the cell response reproducibly, and will therefore use a cell-permeable small molecule inducer to drive gene expression. Cells should have a range of responses given different amounts of stimuli.
An analoguous native stimulus includes antigen that stimulate immune response.
Next Prev
Conceptual Framework: Autonomous Response
To read an output that allows us to measure the natural variation in genetically identical cells, we need to engineer an output signal or response. This external stimulus will directly induce a fluorescence output, allowing us to read the natural variation in a population.
Often, there is no analogy to this in natural systems as this variation is suppressed for a coordinated community response.
Next Prev
Conceptual Framework: Communication Response
The stimulus will also trigger a communication circuit, driven by the same induction system as the cell autonomous fluorescence response.
In T regulatory and T killer cells, this communication response pathway corresponds to the IL-2 downstream pathway that includes upregulation of IL-2R alpha and IL-2 secretion.
Next Prev
Conceptual Framework: Secondary Signal
The communication circuit will incorporate a secreted signal produced by the induced cell.
This communication signal is IL-2 in T cells and autoinducer molecules in V. fischeri.

We carefully tested every combination (the strength of constitutive promoter controlling MerR expression and the backbone copy number) under induction with a Hg (II) concentration gradient ranging from 10^-9M to 10^-5M. The concentration gradient of Hg (II) is: 0, 1E-9, 3E-9, 5E-9, 8E-9, 1E-8, 3E-8, 5E-8, 8E-8, 1E-7, 3E-7, 5E-7, 8E-7, 1E-6, 3E-6, 5E-6, 8E-6, 1E-5, 3E-5, and 5E-5. Cell culture was cultivated for 8 hours and then dilute with fresh LB in a ratio of 1:100 and continue to incubate until the OD600 reached 0.4~0.6.
Fig 4. Dose response behavior of each constitutive-promoter-controlling MerR. A: Pc-MerR was cloned into pSB1A2 backbone and PmerT-BBa_E0840 into pSB3K3 backbone. It can be observed that GFP expression level drop dramatically at high Hg (II) concentration levels. From the top to the bottom, they are J23101, J23103, J23108, J23109, J23112, J23114, J23116, and J23117. B: Pc-MerR was cloned into pSB3K3 backbone and PmerT-GFP into pSB1A2 backbone. Data were processed as the same with Fig.4-A.
As was mentioned above, MerR dimers act as a repressor of PmerT or an activator in the presence of Hg (II). A weaker constitutive promoter leads to the less production of MerR, raising the proportion of Hg-bound MerR dimer, resulting in a higher threshold (Fig 4, Fig 5). On the other side, data of characterization demonstrated that GFP intensity, which is measured by microplate-reader, needed higher Hg (II) concentration to rise to a considerable level when the constitutive promoter is strong (Fig 4, Fig 5).
When the Hg (II) concentration became as high as 10^-5M"

Optimisation of Vibrio harveyi JMH626 bioluminescent assay
2nd  diacetyl production assay by NMR detection with E. coli BL21.
Success of the conjugation assay of pBBR1MCS-4.
This time, we tested the production of DNY15 in YPD with 40g/L of glucose instead of 30g/L because publications which use pGAP as a promotor to produce AMP sometimes have a higher production with more glucose.
Cytotoxicity tests using the supernatant from the 40g/L glucose culture media was made. Supernatants were filtered beforehand and half was freeze-dried.  We got a weak halo for the DNY15 production in glucose 40 and supernatant freeze-dried!

SCUT-China_B,2016,Team:SCUT-China B#HP#HP2_-_-_TEXT.html," some basic understanding about it. We have learnt that hospice care doesn’t provide cure to the illness itself but relief from symptoms and anxiety.
Secondly we did a research to know people’s idea and understanding about hospice care.
We found that hospice care was firstly introduced in 1967. But in China there wasn’t hospice care until 1988 when Tianjin Medical University set up the first institution for hospice care in China. It wasn’t a long time since hospice care appeared in China but it has developed well. There is more and more need of it as our economy growing and society getting aged. Unfortunately, it seems that hospice care hasn’t gained enough attention from Chinese government and companies. So we did a questionnaire in order to find out that how much do Chinese people know about hospice care and what do they think about it. Here is what we found through the questionnaire.
Here is what we found through the questionnaire.
Thirdly we visited a hospital which did well with hospice care and interviewed one of the founders of the hospice department of the hospital.
Though we have some basic knowledge of hospice care,more knowledge is needed if we want to push the development of hospice care. So we searched on the internet for organizations which are working on hospice care and we learnt that Hospital of Panyu Shiqiao has done it well. The hospital has set up a new clinic department called Kangning which means peace in Chinese for hospice care. We also learnt that Dr Xie Zhuoxi was one of the founders of the department. So we wanted to interview him for more understanding of hospice care.It was very nice of Dr Xie to accept our interview.
So we visited Hospital of Panyu Shiqiao for Dr Xie. We had a nice talk with Dr Xie and he told us a lot about hospice care. Firstly, he told us about present situation of the hospice department of Panyu Shiqiao hospital. The department had 107 beds. At the beginning, few people came for the service but now these 107 beds could hardly cater the growing need of patients. In the hospital, doctors and nurses specialised in hospice service and they were all well trained. Dr Xie told us their job was reliefing the symptoms of patients as well as providing psychological service to both patients and their families. He said most of the hospitals overlooked the psychological help for patients’ families but in hospice care, patients and their families were considered as a whole that facing illness and death together. The families were deeply in grief when the patient passed away and"
Tec-Monterrey,2016,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," on a virtual discussion panel aimed to exchange information about the normatives and laws that are strictly applied nowadays in France and Mexico respectively. The laws we discussed focused on dumping costs of polluted waste, metals pollution, roads pollution and methods of treatment.
We mainly discussed issues about how efficient are the laws, how well are they implemented, how can we help to carry out the concern about how hazardous are they. However, we wanted to focus on how each project impacts the environment and the society, and how we can help to make real impact in both Europe and Latin America.
iGEM Tec CEM
We helped the Tec CEM team by answering their survey about self medication and public health for their Human Practice. All of the team answered the survey and we shared it amongst our community so they could have enough data.
iGEM Guanajuato Mx
Meetup
We attended the meetup organized by the Guanajuato Mx team. The meetup was attended by the following Mexican teams: Guanajuato Mx, Pumas México, Tec-Chihuahua, TecCEM, and us Tec-Monterrey. In the meetup, we exchanged points of view regarding the biobricks designed by the other teams, the uses and applications of each of the parts and we even helped debug some of them.
Moreover, we gave and received advice for our project and we also had the opportunity to practise the presentation, present a draft of the poster and, in addition, we gave and received feedback concerning all of these issues.
Also, one of the most interesting part of the meeting was the discussion about the current situation of synthetic biology in Mexico. Here, we talked about the ethical issues of having synthetic biology within reach of everyone and the impact it has in our society, and especially in our country, nowadays.

Guining Lu
    Professor of School of Environment and Energy, South China University of                         Technology
        ""There are more metal mineral resources in the southwestern and southern                     China, in which the heavy metal pollution is also more serious. What we should pay attention to is that                     Cd, As, Pb, Hg, Cr are very common heavy metals pollution ions."" Professor Lu said, ""the most common                     heavy metal detection methods are Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Atomic Emission Spectrometry                     (AES). Both of these methods can detect ppm (parts per million) levels of heavy metal ions. Though the                     detection accuracy is high, both of these two methods require quite expansive equipment which is unaffordable                     for individuals and some small factories. The detection price of heavy meatal in a single sample given                     by the third party is about 250 RMB and the results usually need to wait for a week to come out which                     costs too much time for a daily operation factory.""
Xiongwen Yang
    Professor, Advanced Engineer, Lawyer, at Law School of South China University                         of Technology & Research Center Director of Intellectual Property and Enterprise Development
        Professor Yang said,” Chinese law lacks the specific regulation about how                     to standardize the genetic engineering products and currently there is a regulation of genetic engineering                     safety playing a certain guiding role on the biological genetic engineering research, industrial production.”
        Genetic engineering safety regulation defines the scope                     of genetic engineering, including the recombinant DNA technology using carrier systems, and the use of                     physical or chemical methods to directly import heterologous DNA into organisms. However, cell fusion,                     protoplast fusion, traditional hybridization, mutagenesis, vitro fertilization, cell culture and embryo                     culture are not included. The regulation divides gene engineering work into four security levels according                     to the potential risk. Industrial production of genetic engineering and the release of genetic engineering                     recipient belong to level Ⅰ~Ⅲ and should be verified and approved by the relevant administrative departments                     and then submitted to the safety committee of the national genetic engineering for the record."

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
