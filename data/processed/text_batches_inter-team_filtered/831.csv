    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria"

1.Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC) are a promising technology for electricity production from a variety of materials, such as natural organic matter, complex organic waste or renewable biomass, and can be advantageously combined with applications in waste water treatment[1]. However, MFC have not achieved commercialization yet on account of low power output, which is mainly due to the low efficiency of extracellular electron transfer without the help of redox mediators added manually into the reactor, such as neutral red, thionin[2].
The E. coli K12 was cultivated and then inoculated, and the E.coli thus obtained is referred to as ‘original bacteria’ which was subjected to a fuel cell discharge process until the cell voltage was below 0.05 V.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," treat water. According to Alama Keita (UNICEF), the quantity of water to purify for one week for a whole village is about 11,000 liters.
F. Strength
The device has to be built with robust materials (refer to paragraph “Spreading of the GMMs”).
G. Water taste
Water treatment must not modify its taste so that the product can be easily accepted.
4. Economical
The retail price of our device must be adapted to similar options offered on the market.
Chloramine tablets are often used to treat water. In order to be competitive on the market, it is necessary to bring our price in line with our competitors. Therefore, to give us a general idea, the cost of chloramine tablets to treat the same volume of water as our device can be calculated.
The product “Chloramine 60 Tablets from SANOFI AVENTIS BELGIUM”6 contains 60 tablets of chloramine and costs 3.69€. According to the instructions, 1 to 4 tablets must be dissolved in 25L of water, depending on the water pollution degree. One tablet costs 3.69/60=0.0615€. Thus, treating 25 L of water costs up to 24.6cts (4 tablets) and up to 0.98cts for 1 L.
To conclude, treating water with our system should not cost more than 1ct per L.
Note: our system uses a more advanced technology than chloramine tablets. It allows not only to treat but also to detect the presence of V. cholerae. It appears justifiable to take into account a higher water treatment price with our device.
Conclusion about the scope statement
To conclude, the system must be able to detect V. cholerae and release AMPs from a threshold concentration in water. The water treatment aspect using AMPs is essential.
The device that we have to create must respond to technical criteria from environmental, safety, material and economic points of view that we have listed in the scope statement. These specifications were defined taking into account the advice we received from the people we met throughout our project.
The design of the device will have to best fit these constraints to be accepted by our future customers.

NRP-UEA-Norwich
In collaboration with the iGEM Team NRP-UEA-Norwich we modeled the Butyrate pathway expressed by our expression system:
Butyrate
Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon lumen which severely affects the proliferation of colon cancer cells in in vitro experiments. Butyrate is able to interfere with numerous cellular targets including cell cycle regulator expression [1].
Figure 1 Schematic representation of pathways for carbohydrate fermentation in the large intestine. 1 = Methanogenesis, 2 = reductive acetogenesis, 3 = butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase, 4 = phosphotransbutyrylase/butyrate kinase, 5 = phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase, 6 = lactate dehydrogenase, 7 = acrylate pathway, 8 = succinate decarboxylation [2].
Butyrate is central in the cell metabolism (Fig. 1). It is converted starting from two Acetyl CoAs over several steps to Butyryl CoA. In the last step the Coenzyme A is transferred on a Acetate, producing Acetyl CoA and Butyrate.
For easier modeling the pathway was reduced to some essential parts and steps. Acetate is converted to Acetyl CoA. The steps to Butyryl CoA are reduced to one step. Coenzyme A is recycled in the last step to Butyrate and can be reused to produce Acetyl CoA (Fig 4).
Figure 2 Overview of the reduced pathway. Coenzyme A (Co A) is recycled in the pathway by the butyryl CoA-acetyl CoA-tranferase.
To simulate the butyryl pathway controlled by the iGEM Manchester-Graz expression system (https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Modeling ) the system had to be adjusted and several new species and parameters had to be introduced to the model (Fig. 3).
Figure 3 Overview of the Simbiology model. For simplification the model was reduced to essential compnents.
The pathway is controlled by three enzymes (and not 7) whose expression is controlled by the two quorum sensing systems.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

In Figure 2, it is showed that medium from 4 tubes showed similar color, although tube no. 3 has more green. Tube no. 1 and 2 are negative controls because they contain E. coli BL21(DE3) only, and E. coli BL21(DE3) / BBa_I13522 without expression reagent to induce GFP production, respectively. Tube no. 3 contains E. coli BL21(DE3) / BBa_I13522 with GFP was over expressed due to addition of auto induction reagent. On the other hand, glucose was added to tube no. 4 to repress possible leaky expression of GFP through the mechanism of catabolite repression.

ColorMeter program installed in mobile phone, detected RGB values, we then converted the values to luminance value to obtain only the brightness of color (http://www.scantips.com/lumin.html; accessed on Sep. 24th, 2014). The formula used is:
Luminance value = (R x 0.30) + (G x 0.59) + (B x 0.11)
Two measurements of RGB values of the tubes from different angles to correct possible lighting differences, and the calculation of luminance values are given in Table 1 and Figure 3 below.

Since the induction culture does not receive antibiotics, aseptic techniques are crucial for the following steps. 100 μL of each culture was pipetted into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and spun at 400 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μL of 1X SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer + 5% B-ME. The tubes were then heated at 95°C for 5 minutes to help with the resuspension. To the induction culture, between 0.2-1 mM of IPTG was added and incubated at the optimized temperature for 2-10 hours. To determine the optimized conditions for induction, 100 μL of culture was collected every hour and then analyzed using an SDS-PAGE.
Results and Discussion: In this experiment we optimized the conditions for the induction of the  CR2 Gag-Prot-RT Construct. The full size CR2 Gag-Prot-RT will appear on a gel at ~90 kDa. Putative degradation products occur at ~75 kDa and ~50 kDa. We predict that these bands correspond with the full-size Gag (~52-54 kDa) and Gag-Protease (54-75 kDa). Since the protease appears to be active at these temperatures, we will perform additional inductions at other temperatures (20°C - 28°C). To see if the number or intensity of putative degradation products changes. Under these induction parameters at 35°C a significant quantity of the full-sized construct is expressed. We then used these parameters to induce and purify this CR2 Gag-Prot-RT fragment.

Vivian Wong
Vivian studies Pharmacology and is from Hong Kong. She’s a dedicated member of the team, often working late into the evening. As well as her competence with practical lab work, she is quietly confident in many aspects of the project such as navigating the wiki and having design input. Although first seen as a little shy, Vivian quickly came out of her shell, giving excellent advice and listening and responding to problems or concerns. In her spare time she enjoys playing the piano, eating out and enjoying a good cup of tea.
Christopher Wall
Studying in the first Synthetic Biology Masters in the country (alongside Rob), Chris completed a BSc in Biology at the University of Sheffield before moving to Newcastle.  As one of the more experienced members of the team, Chris' extensive lab skills and resourcefulness have made him the first person other members turn to when an experiment goes wrong or a protocol needs adjusting. Found in the lab at weekends and late into the night, Chris' enthusiasm and maturity have enabled him to successfully juggle iGEM with the end of his Masters project. When not in the lab, Chris can be found playing or watching football, and is also something of a movie aficionado.
Justas Miknys
Justas is one of our computer scientists in the team and provides a lot of help with the computing and modelling parts of our project. Even though he doesn’t have much background in biology, he contributed a lot in biological modelling. Justas has a signature laugh which cheers everyone up after a long day. Throughout the day, he also likes to share haribos and cookies with everyone on the team to keep everyone full. Justas suggested that our iGEM team be called Newcastle Mafia. This name was luckily voted out but he was devastated.
Alina Tamciuc
Alina is our only architect in the team but has thrown herself into the lab work with lots of enthusiasm. Her strengths are in her strong eye for design (as seen in the team logo), her straight talking attitude and supportive and friendly nature. She also enjoys hikes, cheese, wine, watching Miss Marple, cherry tea, trips to the cinema and photography.

SCUT-China_A,2016,Team:SCUT-China A#Model#Water-oil ratio_-_-_TEXT.html," conclusions, we decided to multiple the proportion of enzymes, then we have:
The graghs above show that when multiple enzyme B and enzyme C respectively, the productive rate of HBP and the consumption rate of DBT almost stay the same. But regarding the quantity of the intermediate, with more expression of enzyme DszB, the reaction becomes more stable.
We can get a linear inequality equation based on the level of importance of three enzymes: DszB>DszC>DszA.
Under real conditions, we could regulate the intensity of the promoters in order to regulate the enzymes’ proportion.
3. Water-Oil Ratio Model
The process of fermentation is shown as below:
3.1 Theories
Recently, the studies found that the number of DBP and HBP stored in the cytoplasm is determined by the cytoplasm and the distribution coefficient of oil phase and water phase. We managed to derive the best proportion of water and oil in the reactor to optimize our system.
We collected information and listed the distribution coefficient of DBT and HBP in different phrases by searching the literature:
3.2 Related parameters
Distribution coefficient refers to the proportion of the components in two phrases, in the condition of equilibrium and certain temperature.
3.3 Modeling
Hypotheses:
1).The volume percentage of the cell constantly maintains at 3%.
2).The stirring rate is fast enough to approach the chemical equilibrium and materials transfer balance at a fairly quick speed.
Construction:
In order to meet the actual need of making the remaining DBT least while maximizing the product HBP in oil phase, we establish the following models in order to eliminate the remaining DBT in the oil and preserve the HBP as much as possible:
In the initial state, the amount of DBT is a constant:
In the final state, the amount of HBP becomes a constant:
Assume that the volume is 1, then:
Substitute the known quantity into the equation, we get:
Which are equal to:
According to the actual demands, we define:
Which are:
Substitute the known quantity:
We can derive: xH2O≤0.08818349 or xH2O≥0.470590405
Because we can not calculate a result to satisfy both two optimal solutions, we take aonther new evaluation method.
Definition:
M1 represents the level of importance of DBP: 
M2 represents the level of importance of HBP: 
Because the toxicity of organic solvent has direct impact on the living of bacteria, then:
M is a parameter that has a positive correlation with the optimization of"

Virginia,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Internal#Papers_-_-_TEXT.html," can adapt to change, show robust homeostasis, and can self-repair.""  The author makes these points in a different context, but what other ways are biological molecules and systems unique from chemical systems and how can we take advantage of these and other unique qualities of biological molecules (e.g. self-assembly, robustness, excellent specificity)?  Put another way, what can biologicals do that chemicals can't?  Also, this . - chris 04:18, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
Biological molecules are unique in that once they are built and viable they never need to be repaired.  Once a biofactory is synthesized to produce a metabolite all that needs to be done is to grow it, feed it, and harvest the product.  This is very cheap compared to producing a chemical via traditional methods.  In a chemical plant, if one link in the chain fails than the process must be halted and repaired.  In a biological production system, since all cells are for the most part independent from each other, if one cell fails there is no damage to the overall system.  Also, biological molecules reproduce very fast and cheaply as oppose to chemical factories which are built very slowly and expensively. - Bussingkm 14:54, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
I think that these passages put things into a nice perspective. In this Commentary, we consider the historical role of synthetic approaches in the development of modern organic chemistry in order to extract some lessons that might help guide the development of synthetic biology. A critical lesson here is that a complete understanding of chemical principles was not a prerequisite for the emergence of synthetic chemistry. The history of organic chemistry suggests that synthesis will be a necessary complement to analysis in order for biologists to truly understand the mechanisms of complex living systems. - Bussingkm 14:54, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
Systems biology as a foundation for genome-scale synthetic biology
We've talked a lot about how we'll use synthetic biology concepts to design and build our projects, but in what ways can we use the methodologies developed by systems biology? - GMcArthurIV 21:18, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
I like the point made that systems biology can help synthetic biologists design systems that will have to function in the context of biological variability (aka evolution).  I view this as similar to the way a chemical engineer uses thermodynamic models to design for process equilibria that are stable in the presence of input perturbations. - chris 04:18, 9 June"
DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Table 2: The absorbance of amilCP with His-tag isolated from the different steps in the His-tag purification. The absorbance was measured at 588 nm.
The difference between the purification of amilCP with and without His-tag is illustrated by figure 16. It is clear that amilCP without His-tag just runs directly through the column, whereas the His-tagged amilCP actually binds to the column and elutes as expected.
Figure 16: Comparison of how amilCP with or without His-tag is purified. The data used graph is from the samples with the highest amount of sample loading (5 times). The absorbance was measured at 588 nm.
From these results we can conclude that our his-tag purification of amilCP has worked.
AmilCP degradation by venom
The amilCP without His-tag (BBa_K592009) was obtained from Biosensor. Apparently the cells had produced an excessive amount of amilCP and exported it out of the cells. This means that it was not necessary to lyse the cells. A simple spin down of the cells left the amilCP in the supernatant and it was used for the amilCP degradation experiment.
AmilCP were incubated with the three different snake venoms: Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica and Naja nigricollis.
After 70 min of incubation time at 37°C, a spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance at 588 nm. There was no loss of amilCP during the incubation with snake venom.   The reason for the slight fluctuation could be small pipetting errors, or that the spectrophotometer did not have an optimal readout at 588 nm. The results of the experiment is shown in table 3.
Table 3: The table shows the measurements for amilCP (BBa_K592009) at 588 nm.  The dilution factor of the lysate was 10.  The dilution factor for lysate with venom was 15.

Design of our Patch
The patch we designed is an innovative composite detection nanomaterial composed of three layers : a bottom cellulose-based layer (support), an intermediate protein-based layer (linker), and a top antibody-based layer (detection) (Fig.1). To implement our project, we had to design and create each layer of our innovative patch.
Figure 1. An innovative and composite multi-layered patch for detection of mosquito-borne pathogens.
We first characterized each layer separately before testing the combined patch at the end of the project.
1) Biodegradable cellulose layer
Our patch is the solid support of immunological reactions to detect viral proteins. We chose cellulose as the main component of the patch since it does not interfere with immunological reactions. We needed to use commercial crystalline cellulose to ensure the binding of the protein layer. We compressed our modified cellulose powder with a press and we shaped the patches by using a steel mold that we machined with circular slots (of various diameter)[1].
2) Protein layer
Since the cellulose-based patch alone could not detect mosquito-borne pathogens, we used a multifunctional fusion protein to make it stronger. This protein is bonded to the cellulose-based patch and made it stronger by bio-condensing silicic acid into silica and fixing specific antibodies. Therefore, we took advantage of the silica-binding peptide (designated by Si4), the B domain of staphylococcal protein A (designated by BpA), and the cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (designated by CBPa). Since it was important that Si4 and BpA were not close in order to avoid steric hindrance of the paratope by condensated silica, we designed the fusion protein Si4-CBPa-BpA as protein C (Fig 2).
Figure 2. Fusion protein Si4-CBPa-BpA.
To produce the protein, we had to assemble the corresponding genes of each part of the fusion protein by using preexisting iGEM BioBricks. In fact, we assembled BBa_K102800"

Summary Background and Rationale Objectives Research Design and Methods Significance and Future Directions
Research Design and Methods
1) Carbon fixation for fueling cell growth will be achieved through the incorporation of three genes into the genome of S. elongatus PCC7942 (Fig. 2). The E. coli galU gene, shown to increase sucrose production in S. elongatus by more than 30%7, will be incorporated to allow for high levels of sugar production. The Zymomonas mobilis invA and glf gene products will be used to cleave sucrose produced by S. elongatus into glucose and fructose and to export the sugars out of the cell. The 2011 Nevada iGEM team began characterizing the invA and glf genes for increased hexose sugar production in Synechocystis PCC680318 and submitted BioBricks for invA (BBa_K558006) and glf (BBa_K558005) to the parts registry. Glucose production by S. elongatus will be measured using established assays7, and the number of glucose-producing S. elongatus cells needed to sustain E. coli growth will be tested by spectrophotometry and cell viability assays. In parallel, the H. neapolitanus carboxysome operon, which has been successfully cloned into E. coli9, will be optimized and converted into BioBrick format. These BioBricks will be characterized for expression in E. coli by determining the ideal stoichiometry of each carboxysome protein and examining the carboxysome’s morphology and carbon fixation capabilities. Electron microscopy will be used to determine the structure of empty and cargo-loaded carboxysomes. Carbon fixation will be assessed in vitro and in vivo through established carbon fixation assays9. The sugars produced from carbon fixation will fuel E. coli cells engineered to produce (2) acetic acid and (3) rhamnolipid.
Figure 2. Glucose production by S. elongatus. Through carbon fixation, S. elongatus produces sucrose, which can be cleaved into fructose and glucose. The glucose transporter GLF will be used to export glucose out of the cell for use as an energy source for E. coli"

They do not have the time... Then we  asked ourselves, if we were to share my thoughts on GMOs   with someone who has the time and it is not bias then that should it be? Children, of course.
Children are  blessed with an unpolluted mind and a wonderful ability to ask the most obvious questions in   ways that require not so obvious answers.  But for these questions to come into existence   and be verbalized by children, they must be introduced in a form that is understandable and in   some lengths entertaining.  If we can introduce  children to GMOs and at the same time tell   them a story with existential implications it just might do the   job.  Ripples of enlightenment   have been set in motion.  An introductory children's book about   GMOs with an undertone   of existentialism.  For Kids. Why make it easy?
A story for adults and children on the subjects of GMOs and Existentialism.  Some illustrations are  uncolored so that you can color them yourself.  There are both a digital version and a printable version.

Concordia,2013,Team:Concordia#Interface_-_-_TEXT.html," this pattern of expression, we needed to alter the promoter strengths of the Ompc promoter controlling AHL Synthase genes. This will be verified in future work through site directed mutagenesis of the promoter regions.
Future Considerations
Although AHL’s appear to be an effective system for synthetic cell-to-cell communication they are not without problems.  One issue, that poses a critical problem for Comput-E. coli, is the AHL half-life. Even in conditions that favor degradation the most, AHL half-life is around four hours, and at that, these conditions do not favor cell viability. This lengthy half-life forces the gas clock to greater than 4 hours so as to contain all AHL from one generation in their respective generations. Ideally, a cellular automaton would have the shortest possible generation time, limited only by cellular processes (i.e. transcription and translation). Therefore, AHL’s produced must be degraded before every new generation and must also be done in a temporally coherent manner.
This problem could be solved using generalized AHL quenchers (degrading enzymes), of which there are two kinds; AHL lactonases and AHL acylases (Boyer 2009). AHL lactonases hydrolyze the ester bond of lactone ring effectively deactivating the AHL; an example of an AHL lactonase is AiiA found in many Bacillus species (Boyer 2009). On the other hand, AHL acylases hydrolyze the amide bond of the AHL releasing the acyl side group from the lactone ring; an example of an AHL acylases is AiiD found in V.paradoxus. Introducing one of these enzymes in the confines of the gas clock at a reasonable time could allow for timely degradation of AHL signals and reduce the generation time by several hours

Law
We are curious about laws that about the rights of people with hearing loss and the investigation process in case of surdomute criminal suspects. We consulted a Justice Liu and a legal practitioner, Miss Zhao.
It is said that in China, the Criminal Law and the Law of Criminal Procedure Law aim to embody the humanitarian. Deaf and mute are given appropriate preferential treatment and Summary Proceeding cannot be applied in these cases:
Cases of crime by deaf-mutes can be dealt with leniently.
A deaf and dumb or blind criminal is expected to receive a lighter or mitigated punishment or even be exempted from punishment as the case may be.
A deaf and dumb should be provided for with people familiar deaf and dumb gestures;
A deaf and dumb with no defender should be provided with legal aid;
Forcing disabled people to beg constitutes a crime;
Utilizing and abetting the crime of persons with disabilities should be cracked down according to law, etc.
Advanced Technology
The most efficient way to improve hearing so far is using hearing auxiliary equipment. There are two main types of hearing auxiliary equipment: hearing aids and cochlear implants.
Hearing aids: for conductive hearing loss;
Cochlear implants (CI): for sensorineural hearing loss.
We consulted Prof. Chen Fei who studies hearing aids and speech recognition technology for cochlear implants. He stressed the importance of attention to hearing-impaired people, because this big problem has not been concerned enough as it deserved.
Beyond hearing loss, pathologically caused hearing loss may also cause complications. The lowered hearing nerve activity for long is potential to cause inactivation of these neurons and lead to impermanent hearing loss. More significantly, due to communication difficulties or discrimination, hearing loss may cause psychological problems.
CI, together with hearing aids, bring sound to those who have never heard anything. However, the cost of a CIs is higher than 10,000 dollars and requires high medical operation expenses. There are only 20,000 people can enjoy the ease brought by CI due to the high price. As a result, we need people to focus on this issue. We hope people can devote to take part in research, charity or simple spread this idea, to make more people able to enjoy the sound.
At the same time, he believes that though hearing aids and CIs are the most direct and efficient way currently, they cannot solve the problem of hearing loss thoroughly. Protect our ears to prevent more hearing impairment cases, together with elaborate studies on hearing using biological methods, tend to be the profound and lasting resolution. He mentioned that"

These categories will be relevant in different circumstances to different iGEM projects. You only need to fit one category from this section to receive exemption determination if the rest of your project meets the other listed standards.
Category 1 would be applicable if you were handing out surveys in a college classroom. I can personally recall other students, with the professor’s allowance, handing out short surveys to fill out at the beginning of class.
Category 2 is for the generation of new material (in our instance survey procedures and interview procedures). Here is when our policy of not collecting any personally identifiable information applies (see consent disclosures “We will never collect any information about you, as a person-- just your perspective on these issues.” and “The only information collected is what you fill out here.” on a page with only questions about synthetic biology opinions). And being careful when asking questions with regard to possible risks apply (see discussion of minimal risk above).
Category 3 is for when you formally survey public officials and is related to concerns about confidentiality.
Category 4 is when exploring pre-existing data that maybe have been collected with personally identifiable information. This may apply to an iGEM project going through pubmed data, and refers to necessary anonymization protocol.
Our project was exempt under category 2, and yours likely will be as well, as long as it is a traditional survey.
Though there are seven enumerated sections, it is unlikely that any after three will be relevant to an early stage iGEM public opinion survey, and therefore including them in this guide will not be particularly useful. In the interests of complete information, if your research is on children, then it may not be exempt even if everything else is in order, and the prior specifications with prisoners and food and drug research that happen to be survey like may or may not be protected. Additionally, the following activities are considered to surpass “minimal risk” and therefore may or may not be subject to exemption: reading/writing/drawing tasks, physical activities such as walking, sitting, or manipulating an object, computer tasks and/or internet searches, talking and/or listening to words, then making selections, or “think-aloud” exercises, viewing media, role-playing, completing a specific physical or mental action (“imagining”), passive monitoring of space (environment) with sensors, playing a game, height/weight measurements. [17]
This concludes the discussion of what an exemption requires. Now the steps required to submit the review vary by university. At UC Davis, we went through IRBnet. I made an account, and completed HRB 211 through an interactive page,"

Machines Rocks - Arnold
In the quest of finding a top cell sorter machine to carry out high-throughput screening in our directed evolution experiment, we met Arnold Richard Pizzey. He is an electronic, mechanic and cell sorter expert in UCL Cancer Institute. We are deeply impressed by his works, especially by his latest innovation, an advanced cell sorter prototype which can potentially sort thousands and thousands of mutants every few hours. We decided to collaborate, and will be testing out his prototype with our iGEM project!
Further conversation with Arnold had opened up our mind of the detailed mechanistic of charge powered sorting machines. His feedback and insights laid down the foundation of the evolution protocol we are trying to establish.

A: A man from Hefei was inexplicably refused a visa for the first time, and is passed                                 the second time. What a miracle!
Q: That's awesome! Do you have any comments on those scientific mysteries hidden in the                                 deep darkness?
A: Everything in the world has a property called inertia, learning from previous                                 research is exactly one kind of inertia. Mankind also has a property named self-willed,                                 completely out of the current study, full play to our imagination that is capricious.                                 When the combination of inertia and capricious happened, nothing unknown will be                                 missing!

Despite the advance in emergency therapy, antivenom is often only the effective treatment. In treatment antivenom is injected into patient intravenously which could neutralize the toxin. Collecting of antivenom is done by milking the venom and injected into the cattle. The subject will undergo immune response where its antibody produced can be collected. This common method of obtaining antivenom can tackle many toxins in the venom but however is considered unproductive since only small amount of antivenom is produced from the animal blood which is due to complicated serum purification process from the animal's serum. Waiting of animal recovery from venom also make its production quite slow and in several cases the animals die after injection.
Therefore bacteria should be introduced as a substituted platform utilizing synthetic biology to deal with the problems mentioned above. Apart from existing characterised antivenom, other antivenoms could be more easily discovered using the various mutagenesis of variable region of antivenom antibody. To develop this platform, well known venom could be produced to test this platform. Indian cobra snake is therefore chosen as the first target due to its generality, high toxicity and it is also one of the highest profile antivenom discovered which could potentially save many victims from this fatal snakebite.
The way to engineer the bacteria is to mutagenise the shark antibody gene to allow different variable regions of the antibody to be expressed on the surface of the bacteria in different libraries. The venom is screened onto each plate of different bacteria libraries. The venom will bind to the right antibody and trigger the signal cascade which results in the expression of the fluorescence proteins which can be detected by FACs. machine. The bacteria that produces the antibody for the venom will be subjected to DNA sequencing which could be the platform for producing bacteria expressing antibody specific to the venom in the future. (Text by Ming)
So the method for the anti-venom generation begins as follows:
1: Take the venom proteins and bind biotin to either the C or N terminus so that it is able to be fixed to a large ferro-magnetic beads that are coated in streptavidin. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin and the beads can be picked up with a neodynium magnet - so the bacteria with the 'antibody' on their surface that is able to bind to the venom proteins will be attached to the bead.
2: The bacteria will have a plasmid that encodes a gene for a single-chain variable fragment, a fusion protein"
Columbia_NYC,2015,Team:Columbia NYC#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," children need to be more exposed to and educated on the possibilities of synthetic biology.
Furthermore, interactions with the public have shown that as they learn more about synthetic biology, their interest in the subject increases. This is also due to the trend of apprehension and anxiety regarding synthetic biology stemming from uncertainties.  All in all, our team concludes that education is the key to get the public excited and interested enough to support synthetic biology for all that it can be.

Creating the TAL Mammobrick vector
Introduction:
In nature, TALEs are injected into the host cells by plant pathogenic bacteria in order to modulate their gene expression. From the synthetic biologist’s point of view, this is very convenient because it implies that TALEs can be expressed in bacteria but also function in a eukaryotic system. We therefore provide plasmids for expression in either human cell lines or in bacteria.
Eukaryotic expression vector:
Since we wanted to express our TAL effectors in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells, we needed a eukaryotic expression vector.  Unfortunately, the registry does not offer such a vector, so we decided to build one our own. In order to avoid intellectual property rights violations, we ordered the vector pTALEN (v2) NG    (along with the Zhang Lab TALE Toolbox) from the open source plasmid repository Addgene . The Zhang Lab at MIT has constructed this plasmid for TAL effector expression, so we decided that it would be a good template for our own vector. Converting pTALEN (v2) NG into a RFC10 compatible vector would have taken more mutagenesis PCRs than we would have been able to perform over the summer, so we chose the following two-step vector assembly strategy:
Step 1: Mammobrick
In the first step, we wanted to built a universal mammalian expression vector (called MammoBrick), which would allows future iGEM students to express any gene in human cell lines simply by cloning the open reading frame into the MammoBrick using the BioBrick assembly protocol. We assembled the MammoBrick from the following four parts, essentially, using the protocol described here :
Part 1: BACKBONE
We have cut the backbone out of pTALEN (v2) NG with Ngo M"

Attending lecture in Peking
This year we communicated with Peking team. Because most of TUST-CHINA's team members were freshmen for iGEM , some of us went to their school to learn some basic knowledge of synthetic biology on the end of January 2017. We also shared our experiences concerning biology and our love for sciences and practical lab work. We all cherish the opportunity to collaborate and we do have a brand new understanding of synthetic biology ,a lot of gains.
Seminar with Tianjin University
In early March 2017, our project was in the initial design stage. We went to Tianjin university and communicated with team iGEM-Tianjin. We introduced our projects and give suggestions to each other. Everyone  was involved, and this allowed members to discuss and ask questions.
We all got new inspiration for the project. We are also had a meeting with SynBioBeta founder John Cumbers, Vice President of Tianjin University Yuan Yingjin, John Hugh snyder, Director of the Beijing Institute of Life Sciences, Wu Feng, Associate Professor of Beijing Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ma Rui, Investor of FreesVC, etc. We asked questions about synthetic biology and iGEM, and John Cumbers responded patiently to the questions.
Seminar with Peking
This May, we organized a meeting and invited Yihao Zhang ,the instructor of team Peking and Haoqian Zhang who have got a lot of medals in iGEM game. We introduced our project to them. The entire team was involved, and this allowed members to chat and ask questions. The level of enthusiasm from Peking team members was extremely encouraging, and we have a lot of gains again.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Biocontainment_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Bottom: MazF is kept repressed by pDawn, which is inactive in the dark. Leaky expression is countered by weakly expressed MazE, forming equilibrium. In light, toxin expression greatly increases, causing cell death.
Construction of The Kill Switch Genetic Circuit
During the design and creation process, two different configurations for the kill switch were considered. One such configuration was the aforementioned pDawn-MazF combination. Another had MazF constitutively expressed, countered by MazE expressed under pDusk, the inverse of pDawn, active in the dark and deactivated by light. We tested the degree of expression by both systems using fluorescent protein mCherry as a reporter, both in light and in the dark. We observed that, while the fluorescence of the pDawn reporter is greatly increased when exposed to light, the differences between ligth and dark under pDusk are much smaller (Figure 2). This agrees with the modeling results, proving the suitability of the pDawn system as a promoter for MazF expression.
Figure 2: Response of pDawn- and pDusk-expressing E. coli to intense blue light (equivalent to the component in direct sunlight) and total darkness. Left: cell pellets. Right: fluorescence over OD600. Fluorescent protein mCherry is used as a reporter.
Although we had some troubles creating the complete version of the optogenetic kill switch, the prospect of such a switch remains a promising possibility in the field of biocontainment. It is possible that a different cell suicide mechanism than MazEF should be considered.  For more information on the creation process, see the Optogenetic Kill Switch notebook entry.
Cas9 Kill Switch
To bulletproof our biocontainment strategy, we aimed to include a self-killing mechanism based on Cas9. To begin with, we wanted to use a bacterial strain developed by Mandell et al (2014) 1 . This “biocontainment strain” is auxotrophic for a synthetic amino acid, para-L-biphenylalanine (BipA). Several essential proteins of this bacterial strain were engineered to function only when BipA is incorporated in the active site, leading to death of the bacterium when the synthetic amino acid is not available. In case of BeeT, BipA should be applied to the beehive by adding it to the sugar water used to feed the colony. This makes the beehive the only place BeeT is capable of surviving in.
Even though the biocontainment of this organism is assured, heterologous DNA may remain"

<contacts> <dist> <distName>Lebanon</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Lebanon is contaminated with mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), particularly (cluster) submunitions and other unexploded ordnance (UXO). Mines and explosive ordnance were used extensively from the beginning of the civil war in 1975 until the end of the Israeli occupation in 2000. When Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000, some 400,000 mines remained to be cleared. The 2003 Landmine Impact Survey (LIS) found 306 impacted communities affected by 933 suspected hazardous areas (SHAs) covering an estimated 137km2.
By the end of 2007, there were still mines in the south along the UN-delineated Blue Line between Lebanon and Israel, and in areas north of the Litani river, in the Bekaa valley, and across Mount Lebanon. The Mine Action Coordination Centre Southern Lebanon (MACC SL) estimates there are about 375,000 landmines along the Blue Line and up to about 3km inside Lebanese territory, covering an area of more than 7km2, but it has not been given a mandate by the Lebanese government to clear them (apart from a specific area along the Blue Line in al-Adaysseh village).
The 2006 conflict with Israel resulted in heavy new contamination of southern Lebanon with an estimated 500,000 submunitions and other types of UXO. As of 21 July 2008, MACC SL had identified 1,056 cluster bomb strike locations covering a total of 40.7km2. By the end of 2007, MACC SL reported that 32.6km2 of this area had been released,[16] and by June 2008 the figure had risen to 37.5km2.
A study of the economic impact of submunition contamination in Lebanon found that two-thirds of the land originally affected was agricultural, representing close to 5% of all agricultural land in southern Lebanon. It estimated current and projected losses of agricultural production would total between US$22.6 million and $26.8 million.
In 2007, Landmine Monitor identified at least 130 new mine/ERW casualties in Lebanon, of whom 37 were killed and 93 injured"

The colonies in the 96 well plate did grow overnight, but they were not saturated, implying that they were very unhealthy. We will PCR a few of them (1,2,3,6) just to see if they actually have the plasmid still
Transformation plates look great--we will PCR 12 colonies to verify the plasmid is present
PCR: colonies/culture diluted 1:20 as template (and colonies grown up simultaneously); M13_F and M13_R primers; 50˚C annealing and 3min elongation; 25 cycles
Results: bands are similar to the ones seen the last time we did this PCR (and those samples had also been sequence-verified). These colonies should be good to go!

pSB4K5_F+ZFBhl and pSB4K5_R+URA3hl primers
58˚C anneal, 3 min elongation, 25 cycles
Results: the product was really really really faint--primer dimers were by far the bulk of the product.  We realized this is probably because one of the primers includes a Not1 restriction site, which is palindromic, 8 bases long, and all Cs and Gs.
pSB4K5 PCR to add homology 7/29/11
In order to counteract the primer dimers, we will try a gradient PCR with a range of higher annealing temperatures:
same protocol as before except the annealing temp went from 58-65 with 8 samples (1=58, 8=65"
Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Growth Assays_-_-_TEXT.html,"OVA analysis shows that there is no significant difference between any of the constructs (F 4,10 = 0.1875, p < 0.9396). Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Bdh2 with no pelB secretion tag growth. Bdh2 MG1655 cells were grown in M9S media to gauge growth, the growth does not differ from the control as p = 0.5543. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Bdh2 with no pelB secretion tag fluorescence. MG1655 cells with bdh2 were grown in M9S and then tested for fluorescence by measuring their GFP output. There is significant fluorescence as p < 0.0001. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion: We can conclude that there is a slight increase in the growth rate of bdh2 containing cells at 10,000 uM 3HB. This suggests that bdh2 is able to function as expected and produces acetoacetate which is used by the cell's central metabolic pathways for growth. At 100uM or 100,000 uM, we did not observe any differences in growth. This could be be because the rate limiting step at low concentrations could be the uptake of 3HB rather than it's conversion to acetoacetate. We hope that we can observe an increase in growth if we add the putative permease we designed into the system. At elevated bdh2 concentration, there is a drop in the growth rate in both bdh2 and control cells, probably because of toxicity issues. In addition, fluorescence is highly elevated in bdh2 compared to empty vector control.
3HB permease enhance cell growth in 3HB
In module 2, we make P3HB bioplastic from 3HB monomers. It is essential for the cells to take up a relatively high concentration of 3HB. Here we test the effect of having 3HB permease"

Art Project: Circadia Synthetica
This painted triptych is an exploration of circadian rhythms in organisms. The first half of the project takes place on Earth with naturally occurring organisms fit to the 24 hour day. The second half of the project takes place on Mars with synthetically modified organisms who have had their circadian rhythms optimized to a Martian 25 hour day. We aim to display this project in areas of Boston where various groups of people with different ideas and knowledge of synthetic biology can view and respond to it. Below is a description of each panel of the triptych, followed by an image of the painting.
/ 3
 
Panel 1: Bacteria
Earth (left): Naturally bioluminescent aquatic cyanobacteria produce light at night, but not during the day.
Mars (right): Mars has a sparse atmosphere unsuitable for human life, when compared to that of Earth's.
Scenario: Genetically-modified bacteria will ingest elements from the surface of Mars during the day. The bacteria will convert the materials that have been taken up into gases. These gases will be released at night to modify the Martian atmosphere, such that it will be able to provide a suitable environment for future human inhabitants.
 
Panel 2: Plants
Earth (left): In 2014, scientists at UC Davis modified a species of flower, Petunia circadia, to change color over the course of the day.
Mars (right): The surface of Mars is a dry, inhospitable desert punctuated by ice caps at its poles. Water is known to exist underground, but is currently inaccessible.
Scenario: A genetically-modified prickly pear cactus will pull water from the ground on Mars during the day. This water will be stored in sacs that are enclosed within its flower petals. At night, the flower will open up, providing access to the water that previously was trapped underground.
 
Panel 3: Humans
Earth (left): Humans have a built-in biological clock, which drives our sleep patterns and metabolic functions. This circadian clock is based on the 24-hour day-night cycle on Earth.
Mars (right): Mars has a 25-hour day-night cycle. Future human inhabitants on Mars may face metabolic and other health problems in this new environment, a change analogous"

Mathematics, Undergraduate
She is a member of the wetlab team. Her main job is doing experiments resulting with the standard curve and growth curve of bacteria used in our project. She thought that in the experiments we must measure amount of bacteria/mL, concentration of specific substrat (D-glucose and lactose), concentration of rhamnolipid produced by bacteria etc... Unique challenges in this job are risk of contamination, inoculate bacteria with spread technique which need full of patience otherwise the medium will rupture and can't be used, and also we must work near fire and alcohol.
Her hobbies are handycrafting, writing, cooking
She wants to learn more about molecular laboratory activity, especially how to engineered gene of bacteria and also to learn teamwork, hear others opinions and learn to discuss to solve problems.
Many lesson she got joining to  the iGEM ITB 2015. She learns how to work in team. She got many friends from other study programs. She hopes the crowdedness of laboratory schedule will improve her skills with the laboratory situations and challenges in there..
He does wetlab kind of stuff that is related to microbiology field with less influence from genetic based method.
Rio loves doing multiple kind of sports and playing with cats.
Joining the team is one of the way for him to try to push himself to the utmost limit of his ability to allow proliferation of his ability in this field.
His testimony after involving in the team  is that “Pretty tire some and actually not much can be helped considering most of the problem were financial or lack of equipment.”
Kinanti helps a lot at the human practice and wet lab division.
At her sparetime, she likes to read, write, doodle, learn to cook, swim and listening to music. Tough, most of the time she spends her time to observing and listening to the surroundings.
Her ultimate motivation is to learn and to contribute in the development of Synthetic Biology in her college and her country.
For the iGEM ITB 2015 team, she thinks that it's really exciting because she really has to learn a lot, and learned a lot during participating in the team. The team members are diverse and yet very open to share their minds.
Satria is the member of the wetlab division.
He provides competent E. coli cells for cloning and expression, assembling reporter module, provide standard and growth curve of E. coli BL21
This guy love to sleep in his free time.
He’d just want to contribute in his own way by joining this team.

2. Information about Part(s):d-limonene synthase enzyme gene in citrus unshiu
What is the natural function of this part in its parent organism?
Synthesis of beta-pinene in Citrus unshiu.
Does the part, by itself, present any safety risks? If so, what are the risks? If not, why not?
Beta-pinene is contained in Japanese orange we eat and there is no risk in general. However, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, pinene is a chemical substance which can cause mucosal irritation. Therefore, it might to be harmful for our health to take it in in an excessive amount.
3.
What will you use the part/organism for?
To change the smell of E.coli and S.cerevisiae.
4.
How do you plan to acquire the part/organism?
Dr. Shimada at NARO(National Agriculture and Food Reseach Organization,Japan)gave us the plasmids containing these genes.(www.naro.affrc.go.jp)
5.
Does this part/organism require any additional safety precautions, beyond the precautions you will take for ordinary lab work? How will you handle the part/organism safely and protect members of your team, other people in your lab, and members of the public?
The committee of gene recombination experiment and safety in our institute(Kyoto Institute of Technology,KIT)gave us the permission and we are conducting experiments in compliance with the KIT's safety guideline. We are doing experiments according to the guideline. Moreover the supervisors are always checking our experiments.
6.
Further comments (If you have already begun using this organism/part, briefly describe what you have done with it.)
We used PCR to amplify genes which encode beta-pinene synthase. After that we inserted the part into expression vectors of E.coli and S.cerevisiae.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#DougNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"YouTube video). I thought it was really cool. I figured if we could get a great HCI project combined with the Clotho project it could address many of the concerns folks had about the learning curve associated with software tools for synthetic biology. I don't think we have this completely settled yet by any means but at least this project was able to get that collaboration started and we have established a way to interact. Orit and her team have been super and I couldn't have asked for a better set of teammates. Plus Wellesley is still my favorite college campus of all time (sorry University of Michigan and UC Berkeley).
2. We really revamped the Clotho core and main dashboard. Clotho has a completely new look and feel in 2011. Not only that, but we have cleaned up much of the internal code and migrated the core to a new repository. Thanks to Jenhan Tao, Cesar Rodriguez, and J.Christopher Anderson for their efforts. Jenhan worked wonders for us and I can't thank him enough for all his hard work. He continues to work on Clotho now at UC Berkeley and this is going to be a great bridge between the East and West coasts. Ok, now that you have read this Jenhan, get back to work:)
3. This project has a COMPLETE WET LAB COMPONENT. This was a great way to bootstrap my new lab at BU as well as get real wetlab experimentalists to start using Clotho. Not only did this show that my lab could assemble new BioBrick parts (a big step for a lab PI with a EE PhD) but we also were able to get our entire software flow (specification, design, and assembly) fully working. Great work team! A big shout out to Traci Haddock for herding all the cats and putting her hard earned PhD to good use teaching basic cloning protocols:) I owe you one!
4.Cool application. By partnering with Suma Jaini and the Galagan Lab here at BU, we were able to find a great application for our research by studying Tuberculosis. This helps give our lab a sense of purpose and a way we can really tackle some cool challenges. I can't wait to see what comes out of this! This is just the beginning.
5.Recombinase based circuit design computational tools. Craig and Swapnil really came up with some great stuff. This is cool for so many Comp Sci. reasons. We now have a completely new set of problems to work on with real nice formalisms. Thanks to Josh Gilmore for all the support.
6.Overall great time. We had"

KK, KP
We showed, finally, a positive result for our PCR! We amplified CRO! We had limited time today, but we performed a PCR clean-up with a kit from Dr. Grose's lab, and then we set the restriction digest of CRO and of pIG12 with PST-1 and EcoR-1. I made a low-melt gel to use tomorrow, after which we'll perform the ligation.
6/17/13
KK, KP, When we ran CRO and our plasmid on the low melt gel, we saw a beautiful band where CRO should be, but no distinct band of the plasmid. So, we set up another digest reaction of the plasmid and we saved part of our low-melt gel to run the plasmid tomorrow. TUESDAY 6/18/ We cut out the plasmid from the low melt gel, ligated it with the insert, waited an hour and a half, and then did a transformation of the plasmid into E.Coli to grow a lot of it. The E.Coli plates should be ready tomorrow.
6/19/13
KK, KP Clarice returned today! The transformation of the ligated plasmid (pIG12 + CRO gene insert) was ready today. Our plates showed good results - there were few colonies and NO colonies on our control plate. We set up 8 colony PCR reactions and a control. We'll have the results by Friday.

Mix each sample by vortexing or vigorously shaking until homogeneous. Immediately pour the mixture into the assembled PureYield™ Clearing Column/collection tube. If you are using a flat-top tube, you can seal the assembled column with the cap if desired. Process each sample individually. [!]The flowthrough from the blue PureYield™ Clearing Column must be collected in a collection tube by centrifugation. Vacuum cannot be used.
Centrifuge the PureYield™ Clearing Column assembly in a swinging bucket rotor at 2,000 × g at 22–25°C for 10 minutes to clear the lysate. Note: The Clearing Agent and sample debris will form a solid cake on the surface of the Clearing Membrane. The color may vary, depending on the sample type. If liquid remains on the surface of the debris cake, centrifuge for an additional 5–10 minutes at a higher g force (e.g., 2,500–3,000 × g). A blue-green cleared lysate will collect in the 50ml collection tube. [!]Do not discard the cleared lysate in the collection tube. RNA is present in the blue-green cleared lysate.
Discard the blue Clearing Column, and save the cleared lysate in the collection tube. If a debris pellet is found in the bottom of the collection tube, transfer the cleared lysate to a fresh 50ml tube.

By the management of an event, a “science concourse for undergraduates students”, MIT and the BioBricks™ Foundation are able to influence practices of young and motivated students from universities all around the world.
I didn't had the occasion to search in-depth other initiatives of standardization, but, they are totally conceivable. The internationalization of the norm does not rly on centralization. We can say that the development of the 19th century technical standards was at the image of the mode of government and exchange of the time, relying on centralization, bureaucracy, top-down decision and industrial capitalism. Differently, biological standards relied on liberal dynamics : free competition, local, intellectual and academic initiatives, referring to economy of knowledge, and relying on canons of liberalism. This possibility of free divergence, opening to debate, to compeition, but also to a culture of open science : concourse of young student and opensource models to support the establishment of norms.
As already mentioned about standardization, the missing of any center of decision permits divergent and competing initiatives. The “scientific public” can make its choice and “may the best win”. The pragmatic marker and the liberal culture is particularly visible. As in the opensource communities, the idea that the community is best able to choose the good standard seems to be working. The work of Janet Hope is mostly focused on promoting opensource business models applied to biotechnologies, relying on all kinds of strategies and innovative models permitted by opensource. Thus, thinking of the Richard Stallman slogan, the main idea is close to ""free software is a matter of liberty, not price”. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer'. The opensource models are not anymore opposed to a merchandise logic.
B. Self or Exploded governance?
Relationship with market has also to be through the positioning of actors, in particular regarding “out of science” matters, such as social and ethical implications.
From that perspective and in a ethical and activist approach, the ETC group, a non-profit civil organization of expertise on « the socioeconomic and ecological issues surrounding new technologies that could have an impact on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable » criticises the Report on Synthetic Biology Governance from the J. Craig Venter Institute and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in their report Syns of Omission (ETC 2007). The ETC group authors critique the pseudo impartiality of the report’s proposal of regulation"

Introducing the Iron Home Testing Kit
About Our School
The Judd School is a state school situated in the south east of England in West Kent. It has over 1,000 students with around 250 in the senior school. It’s from the senior school or sixth form that the team of 15 pupils was selected. This year is the first year Judd have ever entered a team into the IGEM competition. In addition to this, we are the first state school from Britain to complete what is required for the competition and one of only two British high schools to enter in 2017. As much as this is daunting, the team and two supporting staff, were extremely excited by the opportunities that IGEM provides and have gained valuable experience from participating.
Our Goal
The goal of our iGEM project is to create a home testing kit for detecting iron levels, to warn people with abnormal concentrations of this essential mineral. Over 2 billion people worldwide in both MEDCs and LEDCs are affected by anaemia; mainly infants and pregnant women. Iron deficiency symptoms include lethargy, heart conditions, pale skill and even reduced cognitive ability, so an easy way to test whether one has abnormal amounts of it would be greatly beneficial."

Scaffoldin Purification
Scaffoldin purification
After induction according to the methods collection, the targeted ScaA scaffoldin was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose columns in a Äkta prime system (Fig. 1A). Following the addition of Imidazol two peaks were obtained. The fractions of interest were visualized in a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1B). The gel showed that only the second fraction presents the expected size of 111kDa. However some other bands appeared along this fraction, therefore in order to obtain even more pure protein a Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) was done.
The SEC was done with a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) (Fig. 2A). SDS gel shows that a high concentration of the desired protein was     obtained and most of the previous contaminating bands were eliminated. Nevertheless there was an unknown band of low weight present in every fraction,     apparently it could be a second protein from E. coli with some affinity to the Scaffoldin than is then is co-purified with it (Fig. 2B).
Future plans include to incubate the Scafoldin with the purified enzyme-dockerin construct in order to prove that the Flexosome can assembly by itself.

The main peaks after gelfiltration from the scaffoldin CTHE (see results scaffoldin) and CellulaseCCEL (Fig.1) were pooled and concentrated.
B1-B3 were pooled for copurification.
They were then mixed and incubated together at 37°C for 15 min with agitation.
The solution was then used in another gelfiltration (Fig.2). The resulting peaks were run on a SDS-gel (Fig.3) and checked for cellulase activity.

Nina: This article is very good and we will also need the melA gene coding for tyrosinase to have in a plasmid inserted into our bacteria.
Johan: This is good to hear. They just added extra tyrosine as powder and got a lot of melanin (under good conditions - 30° C pH 7).  I can have missed, but I also didnt read that cells died, which is good, as the previous article mentions that “melanogenesis is hazard for melanin-producing cells” and that that is a reason why it is made in melanosomes.
“Furthermore, the disulfide linkage could be cleaved by the elevated level of glutathione and reductase activity in the cytosol,[12] which allowed release of OVA from LMWP and thus retention of a full intrinsic immunogenicity” - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization pp.2725-2726
Johan: Dont fully understand the paragraph in the article, but it seems that the cargo could release from the CPP. This sounds very good as melanin exists in polymers and melanin+CPP would probably not be able to polymerize
Nina: Size of melanin: ~400 g/mol
MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor)
""MITF is a transcription factor that normal melanocytes secrete which acts beneficially  towards the melanocyts, as mentioned below in the citations from an article. Vitiligo skin  has unfortunately a disorder in producing MIFTs from their melanocytes. Our aim is to  have our bacteria on the skin to produce MIFT as a fusion protein with a cell penetrating peptide, thus going thorugh the skin and protecting the melanocytes even if they naturally cannot produce MITF themselves.  Although the biochemical pathway from tyrosine to the melanin polymer has been known for decades (1,2), the findings of the last fifteen years have led to unveiling the transcriptional regulation of genes which are necessary for the synthesis and deposition of melanin. Remarkably, only one transcription activator emerged as a universal regulator of expression of several proteins accomplishing the assembly of the melanosome and its decoration with melanin."" (This protein --> MITF) - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 2

To introduce the lower school to synthetic biology and the ethics involved in this exciting field of science we created a weekly club within our school. We chose to make the club specifically for year 7s because by teaching them the basic principles of genetic engineering they can research further throughout their time in high school and form their own opinions about genetic engineering and potentially become the future iGEM team. The club provided the iGEM team with the opportunity to engage with the younger members of the school community and explore their opinions about the complex ideas we were introducing them to.
Each weekly 1-hour session in the BioBlast club built upon their knowledge about DNA and genetic engineering starting from the basics and gradually working up. We started by looking at cells and using microscopes to identify the nucleus, then in following sessions, we studied DNA and its structure. All our sessions had a practical element to keep students engaged since they were 11-12 years old. For example, when we were looking at the structure of DNA we used sweets to create 3D models - this was very successful as by the end of the session they could identify elements of the DNA structure. In following sessions, we transitioned onto Darwin and Mendel and the effect of genes on phenotypes (demonstrated by a practical involving Gelli-baff which mimicked natural selection) and then moved onto genetic engineering. It was in these sessions that big ethical debates were raised naturally by the students and lead onto organic discussions such as “Should we genetically engineer a ‘perfect’ human?” and “Is it ethical to genetically modify farm animals for agriculture?”.
It was very encouraging to see these debates developing without prompting from us and to see these issues discussed with a solid scientific background. In the final session, we played a board game created by the Exeter IGEM team in 2016 which taught the students about plasmid construction and illuminated the vast potential of genetic engineering- this was very successful as at this point the students had a solid scientific foundation and could follow along very well to a game created for slightly older students. It was important to us that the club was interactive and can be delivered by other schools in the"
Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#Biobricks_-_-_TEXT.html,"qI is a Type II restriction enzyme that recognises the sequence TCGA. Its activity can be blocked by dam methylation.
Coding
This Lamda cI repressor has a cI857 mutation that results in denaturation of the repressor when the temperature is raised from 30 to 42°C, thereby allowing lambda promoter expression.
When the temperature is raised, typically to 42°C, the functionality of the protein is lost and the cI repressor is no longer able to bind to the operators on its promoter. Therefore, lambda promoter expression increases.
Regulatory
Lambda promoter (cIts responsive) is different from the common lambda promoter in that it is able to be repressed by the temperature sensitive cI protein (BBa_K200011). When it is not being repressed after 42°C induction, it acts as a strong promoter.

Equations a and b are utilized to determine which formula would provide a better approximation for fluid resistance based on the height and width of the channel. After determining an approximate value of fluid resistance, PSI can be calculated using equation c. Equation c is analogous to Ohm’s law but is used for fluid dynamics. The PSI value is directly proportional to both the fluid resistance and the flow rate (Q). These calculations were written as a C++ file which can be compiled and executed.

Mixing Efficiency
The mixing of two fluids is something that can often be qualitatively observed, however in order to properly perform an experiment certain amounts of mixing must be achieved. In order to evaluate the degree of which fluids are being mixed in a mixer primitive a mixer efficiency test is needed to be performed.  This quantitative test is broken down into a two-part process:
Image Processing
After running fluid through your mixer, pictures need to be taken at the regions prior to entering the primitive and after it exits the primitive. In order to obtain RGB data from these images, image processing software such as ImageJ need to be implemented. Using ImageJ a 1-pixel wide box is created that spans the length of the channel.  The two important pieces of data that need to be obtained using this box are the average RGB value over that area, and all RGB values over the length of the 1-pixel wide box. After collecting this data, you can move on to calculate the mixing efficiency.
Using the RGB Profile Plot plugin on ImageJ we can acquire the RGB values for each pixel in our box. In a well-mixed output the plot will reflect similar RGB values and the opposing ends of the output channel.
Using the RGB Measure plugin on ImageJ we can acquire the average RGB values over the total area of the box.
Efficiency Calculation
The efficiency of the mixing itself can be measured using the following equation[2]:

Human Practices
• We have looked at an entirely new ethical area for iGEM that has also essentially not been covered in academia; the neuroethics of genetic engineering. We have dubbed this 'Neuro-genethics' .
• We have produced an extensive 20 page report that looks into neuro-genethics and what synthetic biology could achieve in neuroscience.
• We have engaged the public on this topic by getting their opinions at the Arts Catalyst , running a speed debate and a TED debate , conducting an online survey and producing a documentary on synthetic neurobiology.
• We ran one of iGEM's first creative writing competitions , to gauge public opinion on brain modification and highlight the impact of fiction on society's views.
• Petcha Kutcha style presentation to enguage prospective students of the UCL Engineering Department about iGEM.
• We created an original memory bank, Eternal Sunshine , which highlights how precious memories are, indicating the desperate need to cure Alzheimer's disease.
• We created a feasibility report on implementing our treatment.
• Attended and aided in the running of  YSB 1.0 (held at UCL) along with other UK iGEM teams to discuss projects and potential collaborations.
• Through Eternal Sunshine and the creative writing competition we have successfully reached out to a diverse range of people from every corner of the globe, from the USA , to China, to Saudi Arabia and so on.
Modelling
• We are the first iGEM team to use a protein network analysis approach . Network based bioinformatics can feedback into synthetic biology by informing the choice of parts in therapeutic genetic circuits.
• We have developed an advanced piece of software in C# with both numerical and graphical output. The model takes into account all major elements of the proposed mechanism.
• We have used the model to qualitatively demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed mechanism – setting all variables with their real values, microglia cells effectively clear plaques from a region of the brain.
• We have also used our model to investigate the effect of altering various parameters . Although the model is artificial, since it accurately represents the real world, the results of these investigations could be used to better design our plaque clearing mechanism. Additionally, we used the model to produce an accelerated-time animation of microglia cells clearing plaques, and 3D images of signal distribution once simulation is complete.
• We have made the entire source code available via GitHub .
• Furthermore, we have developed an entirely separate model for the Westminster iGEM team . The entire source code for this has been sent to them for"

How we presented Synthetic Biology to the media
In the initial step of our project, the team wrote a communication document that was sent to the media in order to explain both the concept of synthetic Biology and the goal of the iGEM competition.
You can download our brochure here if you need more inspiration that you already have !
We also hosted here our press release, in french of course.
You can find on this page an article about the French iGEM Teams.
Following this, we got an interview with a journalist of the daily newspaper “La Provence” that was published on august 22, 2014.
“Following this article, we found that communicating on science can be difficult, especially as we are in the very first part of our project. Our goal concerns basic research, and no obvious or specific application can be given as an example of outcome. Yet, we were happy with how the journalist presented our work in the context of Synthetic Biology.”
How we presented the iGEM competition to our sponsors
Aimeric did an oral presentation of Synthetic Biology to the board of the FSDIE on October 2, 2014. The FSDIE is a fund for Aix-Marseille University destined to support students.
Student projects funded by the FSDIE must be described with clear objectives, actions, the evaluation method and presenting a balanced budget. Projects are evaluated competitively and the best are funded. The board constitutes a broad audience as it includes students, social workers, University teachers and administratives.
“I wasn’t sure about how the discussion would go, as the board of the FSDIE commission is composed of all kind of profiles, from scientist to non-scientist background. Most of the questions I had were about the iGEM competition itself, and how the participating students get involved and are trained. Safety in the lab and proper work supervision were also central points of the discussion.”
How we presented Synthetic Biology to “Fête de la Science”, October 10-12, 2014
The aim of the annual “Fête de la Science” in France (=French Science Festival) is to inform the public about developments in science and theirs implications for society.
Alexia presented a poster about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition during the festival, keeping in mind the guidelines we established for an optimal scientific presentation to a broader audience.
Here is Alexia's feedback about how she handled public questions and concerns during the discussion:

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#HumanPractices#OutreachCollaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Modelling#SpatialModelling_-_-_TEXT.html," step was to use Maya to show how the interaction of DNA with the TALE is influenced by association of the TALE with a surface such as nitrocellulose. See Figure 3 below.
Figure 3. The scaffolding of capture TALEs with a linker to surface representative of nitrocellulose alleviates geometric constraints to potentially improve TALE-DNA interactions. This image influenced the selection of proteins to be integrated into the capture component of the strip prototype.
In Figure 3A, the TALE is associated directly with a surface representing nitrocellulose, whereas in 3B, it is separated by linker sequence separating the TALE from the surface. Given the geometric constraints of the TALE-DNA interaction shown in Figure 2, the modelling team concluded that capture TALEs in the system should be bound to a protein to separate detector from nitrocellulose. From this data, the wetlab will be focussing prototype development where capture TALEs are fused to ferritin to separate them from nitrocellulose (see Figures 1B and 3B).
Figure 4. Shows the completed FerriTALE system combined together with twelve TALE subunits and a ferritin nanosphere as built in Maya.
Animation of complete system
From the basic protein components imported into Maya from spatial modelling, we repurposed these elements to create a compelling animation to explain our completed system to tell our story. We wanted to show the complete system in a cohesive video to efficiently explain how the molecular interactions of the FerriTALE output a signal on the final prototype. Please see the video below:
As seen in the video above our goal is to develop a strip based assay that can alert us upon detection of pathogenic DNA sequence, namely stx2. We will treat our sample collected from the supershedders with a TALE-Ferritin complex  (a FerriTALE!). Then this DNA-TALE-Ferritin complex would be flown over our strip which contains the second TALE that recognizes yet another 18-20 bp region on the stx2 gene. This second TALE will immobilize our DNA-TALE-ferritin complex on the strip. Following immobilization we will add substrate to our strip. Only in the presence of both the EHEC sequences we get a colour change on the strip. If there is only one of the sequences present, the colour change does not occur either due to lack of immobilization or due to lack of presence of a reporter.

Studies: Ph.D. Biomolecular Engineering
Hello! As you can see I'm doing my PhD. I'm an oldtimer and therefore can't participate as a normal team member like I did before. So this year I work as an advisor for the team. My job is to be the mediator for frictions inside between team members. As I'm residing in the field of computational biology I'm also an advisor for the modelling group of our team.I hope I can help the team with my experience and inspire the younger students for the field of bioinformatics.

Modelling: Rational protein design
The Idea
First there was the idea to replace the chemically produced Ni-NTA columns by some biological, reproducible material. It seemed unreasonable to produce an ion precipitating substance in a complicated, energy consuming way – completely artificial, while so many proteins in nature are capable of the same task – and much more complicated things. But how to harness that?  The second milestone in the generation of the idea came up in a lecture of Prof. Martin, about Nickel allergy. He found a mutation in the TLR-4 receptor that introduces Histidines in the LRR motif of the protein, which are capable of binding nickel and thus forming complexes of receptors on the cell surface of immune cells, triggering the inflammatory reaction.
Schmidt 2010 a) Two sequences of a TLR-4 from mice, one with mutations, a phenotype showing Nickel allergy(Histidines marked red), one wild-type without a Nickel allergy. b) assumed superimposition of Nickel ions binding on the LeucineRichRepeat structure of the TLR-4
The core structure
This was the necessary clue that gave answer to the question. In the following work, a lot of investigation about the perfect Nickel precipitating protein was done. It seemed that there is no optimal natural protein which would serves our needs.  Furthermore, many of the natural LRR proteins – of course – have their own biological function, we we were afraid could interfere in the cellular system we wanted to express them in. Luckily there are over a thousand already known structures of LRR proteins, what gave us a broad choice of motifs to choose and compare. The Construction of a"

Restriction digest tests
Our previous transformations did not work well. We tested if we had the right pmutin4 and cotC biobricks.
We run them on the gel.
pmutin4:
4ul DNA 5ul Water 1ul loading buffer
CotC:
3ul of DNA 6ul DNA 1ul loading buffer
The bands were right. However some BamHI and HindIII sites on pMUTIN4 are too close, the backbone may not have been cut properly.
Preparation of competent cells
We prepared fresh DH5 alpha cells by plating them into two new LB plates
We also prepared a set of new E.coli DH5 alpha competent cells. we measured the ODs of E. coli cells during transformation. We waited 2 hours before measrung the ODs and we get the absorbance result as 0.146.  To measure the ODs
Set the device to 600nM Place a tube with LB only and take a reference measurement Place the culture and press the green box.
We then tested our competent cells for transformation. We used 40ul of cells + 3ul DNA for the tests. We used pmutin4 and pSB1AT3 for the tests
Ligations
We prepared ligations for Cot +  pmutin4. Used two different versions of pMUTIN4 and prepared the ligations below
cotC + pMUTIN4 cut1
cotC + pPMUTIN4 cut2
psc + pMUTIN4 cut 2
We also prepared controls as below

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Outreach DB#database csv_-_-_TEXT.html," game provides the opportunity for kinetic, strategic, cognitive learning, and prior knowledge application (Boyan & Sherry 2011).
The gameplay was designed for a high school aged audience, to provide a fun introduction to synthetic biology. We also designed an additional function where the player could access an encyclopaedia, targeted for undergraduate university students, where they could learn more advanced concepts, for example restriction enzymes and transformation, in an interactive manner.  Players navigate their E. coli via controlling its flagella to collect nutrients to remain healthy and undergo cell division, thus increasing the swarm. The swarm survives hazards through force of numbers. A single survivor can complete the level, but the player will be rewarded with more nutrients if they can keep a higher number of the swarm alive. The idea of controlling a swarm and the difficulty to keep them all alive, often ending a level with a few or even just one, was designed to reflect low transformation efficiency levels seen commonly in molecular biology experiments.
Throughout the levels players would collect BioBricks, and at the conclusion of the level, enter a mini-game where they would use the collected BioBricks in a drag and drop manner in the correct sequence to undergo transformation. The character would then enter the new level with added functions gained from the BioBricks.  Due to time constraints we were unable to complete and release the game for use before the iGEM Jamboree. However, with the substantial progress we did achieve, we hope to see it implemented in the future.

Since the existing phosphate sensor part (OUC-China 2012, BBa_K737024 ) does not have sufficient data, we improved the part by using a different promoter.  We also learned methods for quantitative analysis for cytokinin through bioassay of cucumber seed sprouts (Fig. 2-3-3) and through using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC).
Fig. 2-3-3. Cucumber seed sprouts respond to cytokinin samples
In addition, to achieve the natural plants' temporal pattern for producing plant hormones in E. coli, we introduced an incoherent feed forward loop to our circuit, including a new hybrid promoter part ( BBa_K1139150 ).  Our mathematical model for this system predicted that we can create temporal patterns for the plant hormone production.
2. Phosphate sensor
Fig. 2-3-4. Our phosphate sensor part including the phoA promoter
We improved a phosphate sensor part by using the inducible promoter of the alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA) from E. coli (Dollard et al., 2003).  This promoter is repressed by high phosphate concentrations (Fig. 2-3-4).  To know more about the regulation of this promoter, please click here . We amplified the phoA promoter from E. coli (MG1655) and ligated this promoter into GFP part to construct the new part ( BBa_K1139201 ).   We then introduced this new part into E. coli (MG1655).  Fig. 2-3-5 shows the result of our induction assay.  It shows that the increase in phosphate concentration repressed the phoA promoter.  Especially, we see that the phoA promoter is drastically repressed at phosphate concentrations of 100 to 200 µM.   Though we also assayed OUC-China's phosphate sensor part including the phoB promoter ( BBa_K737024 ) by the same method as that for our phoA promoter assay, their part did not respond to the increase in phosphate concentration (Fig. 2-3-6). Thus, we concluded that we improved the phosphate sensor part. (Note that the scales of the"

Standard BioBrick Assembly
The Standard Assembly of BioBricks was first developed by Tom Knight, and has subsequently been modified by other scientist to overcome some of the hurdles of the Standard Assembly. Only two parts larger than 200 bp can be assembled by the Standard assembly in each cycle. Furthermore, the parts should preferably be either 500 bp smaller or larger from each other as well as the backbone. The system is based on one of the parts to be assembled in the destination vector from the beginning. The assembly can be performed with either suffix insertion (insertion of the added part behind the existing part), or a prefix insertion (insertion of the added part in front of the existing part).
The way it's done
The Standard assembly makes use of the restriction recognition sites of four restriction enzymes; EcoRI and XbaI should be located upstream of the BioBrick and SpeI and Pst"
