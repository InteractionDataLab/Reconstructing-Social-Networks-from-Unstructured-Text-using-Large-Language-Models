Latest updates
We implemented an in-game tutorial for the Gene Network Game.
During the Asia jamboree, we demonstrated our software to participants from other teams, and we noticed:
the meanings of symbols on constructs are not commonly known,
some of participants were not familiar with the dynamics of protein concentration.
So we made guides to provide background knowledge and made it easier to use for beginners. Additionaly, we documented some instructions in the in-game tutorial in addition to the tutorial videos.
You can get the PDF version of the tutorial here.
We improved the stage editor.
The GUI is refined. Now you can see the graph of regulation relationships.   Also we documented instructions for the editor, the principles and backgrounds of the model in the in-game tutorial described above.
Overview
Gene Network Game is an educational puzzle game.  Players aim to create proper gene networks from given promoters and genes.  Through this game, the player can learn basic knowledge of gene networks and can be helpful when trying to understand other team's constructs and eventually to create their own construct.  This game is also usable as a tutorial for modeling & simulation.
At the beginning of the stage, the player has some promoters and genes in his inventory. Using this inventory, he/she aims at creating a network capable of reaching a certain output protein concentration (Left). A stage is completed when the player aligns genes in the correct order and the outputs level is achieved (Right). Completing successive stages, the player will learn ideas from ""What are promoters and genes?"" to ""Genetic oscillators and toggle switches"".
The game is also implemented with a stage editor.  In the editor, you can assign promoters and genes, adjust parameters (copy rate, degradiation rate etc.) and create your own stage.  The editor is designed so that you not only to enjoy your own stage but it can also be used as a simple modeling tool which enables you to obtain preliminary knowledge about conducting modeling and creating simulations.  It will be a first step towards using more technical modelig software such as Matlab.

PHB degrade through metabolic pathways as a carbon source in various natural occuring bacteria. Considering the environment, the replacement of traditional plastics with biodegradable versions reduces the negative impact we are currently employing on various ecosystems.
Risk assessment
There are several studies on bacteriocins that shows that they do not affect human cells; i.e. the skin- and blood cells. We also know that the bacteriocin Nisin has been used for around 50 years in the dairy production and this has not yet shown negative consequences.
PHB is also already beginning to be used as a replacement for conventional plastic products, e.g. in water bottles and lunch boxes. The synthetic spider silk is both immune neutral, biocompatible and biodegradable and ongoing research shows great potential in different uses of spider silk TOKAREVA, Olena, et al. Recombinant DNA production of spider silk proteins. Microbial biotechnology, 2013, 6.6: 651-663 .
The most significant risk we take is to face the general uncertainty that is present when working with genetically modified organisms. They are still ‘new’ in the world, and some people fear the long term consequences. Other possible damages are that there is no proof of that the use of bacteriocins as a therapeutic treatment will decrease antibiotic resistance. This hypothesis is based on predictions formed by knowledge about bacterial evolution. The use of bacteriocins in therapeutics is new and therefore does not exhibit any conclusive data on how - or if -  they will have a detrimental effects on the health of an individual. If bacteriocins become commercially applied, we are left with only speculations of their large-scale impact on various ecosystems.

Fig. 2 MTB has magnets inside their cell
In M. magneticum or M. gryphiswaldense, the hypothetical formation process of magnetosome can be roughly divided into three steps ( Fig. 3 ). The first step is vesicle formation. The inner membrane of MTB swells out and makes a vesicle. The second step is iron uptake. Transporters in the magnetosome membrane pump in Fe2+/Fe3+, creating high iron ion concentration in the vesicle. The third step is bio-mineralization. Providing high iron ion concentration, magnetosome proteins crystalize iron ion, making magnetite crystal (Fe3O4) [4] .
Fig. 3 How a magnetosome is formed in MTB
Gene cluster involved in magnetosome formation
A gene cluster called Magnetosome Island (MAI) is a group of genes related to magnetosome formation [5] .
MAI is highly conserved among MTB and contains 4 operons — mamAB operon, mamGFDC operon, mamXY operon, mms6 operon. In a previous research published early this year, Kolinko et al. introduced these 4 operons from M. gryphiswaldense into photosynthetic bacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum, which is phylogenetically close to Magnetospirillum sp., yet does not make magnetosomes. They observed small vesicles formed in R. rubrum after these genes were introduced [6] ( Fig. 4 ). They also demonstrated that the R. rubrum strain carrying these vesicles can be collected by a permanent magnet, showing that the small vesicles indeed function as magnetosomes.
Fig. 4 MAI plays a critical role in magnetosome formation
To unravel the function of genes in MAI, researches had been conducted by Dirk Schüler et al. through knocking out each one of them. In MTB, magnetosome    membrane cannot be formed if either one of mamL, mamQ or mamB, which belongs to mamAB operon, is knocked out. Proteins of the three genes, though their function mechanisms are not so clear, are considered to be integrated with the inner membrane and triggers vesicle formation [4] .

DESIGNING CONSTRUCTS FOR MATURE VLP FORMATION
I. Designing CR2 Gag Amplicons
Purpose: To design amplicons that will create the proteins necessary for VLP formation. Within the Gag region of this CR2 construct lies a capsid region (CA) and nucleocapsid region (NC). As we are unsure of the role of the CA and NC regions in VLP formation we created amplicons depending on where the protease cut sites are.
Attributions: These amplicons were designed by Gina Watanabe and finalized by the entire team, including Dr. Gernot Presting and Ryan Shontell.
Materials and Methods: To design amplicons that will create proteins necessary for VLP formation we began by using the original CR2 Gag-Prot-RT sequence. Figure 1 portrays the relationship between the Gag domain and the protease along with the N-terminus and C-terminus TEV/His-tag regions. We amplified off of this sequence to obtain the amplicons described in Table 1.

Unlike NhaA, the activity of NhaB shows no dependence on pH in the range 6.4~8.3. The affinity of NhaB to Na+ (Km = 40-70μM) is higher than that of NhaA[9].
○ Design
The gene circuits of the alkali-resistance device is shown in Fig.3. This device consists of two genes and two promoters. The strong constitutive promoter J23119 is used in our gene circuits. In order to resist alkaline stress, we chose two of Nha sodium ion-proton antiporter proteins referred before to construct device one. NhaA could make sure E.coli’s survival under alkaline pH. NhaB regulates intracellular pH when NhaA is limited. But NhaB is weakly pH-dependent, so a alkali-induced promoter J23119 is necessary. The construction has been finished .
Fig.3 The gene circuits of alkali resistence device.
○ Results
Firstly, we cloned the genes NhaA and NhaB from the genome of Escherichia coli str. K-12. Then, the standard part NhaA (BBa_K1675000) and NhaB (BBa_K1675001) were assembled together. The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of NhaA and NhaB is shown in Fig.4. The construction results of JBA(J23119+B0034+NhaA) and JBB(J23119+B0034+NhaB) are shown in Fig.5 and Fig.6.
Finally, the standard part JBA+JBB was successfully constructed through 3A assembly. The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis is shown in Fig.7.
After finishing the construction of the standard parts, we measured the OD600 and the intensity of proteins expressed to test the efficacy of our functional genes. The genes NhaA and NhaB encode membrane proteins, we inserted these two genes into plasmid pET28a separately and transformed them into BL21(DE3). The results weren’t satisfying. To solve this, we transformed the recombinant plasmid into E.coli C41 and C43 [10]. Luckily, the overexpression was successful this time. The result of SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig.8.

After the activity, we explained the phenomena of quorum sensing and showed them a portion of the TED Talk by Bonnie Bassler, a professor at Princeton University and a driving force within the quorum sensing field, which can be found below.
Experiment
To give the students a real example of quorum sensing and give them experience with culturing techniques, we led them through an experiment with Vibrio harveyi, a marine bacterium that creates light at high cell density. In order to demonstrate quorum sensing in V. harveyi, we used one wild type and two mutant strains of bacteria.
The wild type strain has the ability to make the signal and receive the signal. One mutant strain will not be able to make the signal, but it will be able to receive the signal. The other mutant strain will not be able to receive the autoinducer, but will be able to make it. We had the students plate these strains side by side in different combinations to see if they luminesced. On the wild type plate, the whole plate luminesced. On the two control plates of sender/sender and receiver/receiver, there was no luminescence. However, on the sender/receiver plate, the receiver strain luminesced strongly in the center and faded toward the edges of the plate.
You can see the full experiment write-up here: <p> We had prepared plates the day before in order to show them how their plates should look in a few days. In small groups, one group member would take them into a very dark room and have the students explain what they were seeing. Some of the questions we asked were the following: Why is only the receiver luminescing? How does the autoinducer move across the plate? Why does the luminescence fade? What should the plate look like tomorrow?
Synthetic Biology Presentation
After their experiment, we had the students watch a short, fun video on the basics of synthetic biology, which can be found below. Then, we further explained the field and its potential applications for the future. The students were greatly interested in the ethics of synthetic biology, especially issues of intellectual property and bio-security leading to discussions about issues of ownership of biological parts and processes as well as techniques for improving security of the parts.
Having explained the importance of synthetic biology and its potential problems, we next introduced the students to iGEM. We went through the aims of"

Alkane Biofuel Production
The gene tesA is naturally found in E. coli but was mutated for our project to change the 109th amino acid from leucine to proline. The function of ‘tesA is to convert fatty acyl-ACPs, derived from the glucose energy source, into free fatty acids. The mutation serves to increase the output of shorter chain free fatty acids, which are more optimal for gasoline-like short chain alkanes, and reduce the output of longer chain free fatty acids.
The gene fadK naturally occurs in E. coli and was extracted from the genome for overexpression. It functions to convert free fatty acids to fatty acyl-CoA, which can then be used by FadE, endogenous to E. coli, to create 2-trans-enoyl-CoA or by Acr, originally from C. acetobutylicum, to continue the alkane pathway and produce fatty-aldehyde. Finally, Pmt1231, which comes from P. marinus, finishes the pathway by converting fatty-aldehyde into short chain alkanes.
Microbial Electrosynthesis
The microbial electrosynthesis module of our project consists of the genes mtrCAB, phzA-H, cymA, and ccmA-H, which will collectively create a system to transport electrons.
The phzA-H genes, otherwise known as the phenazine pathway, will create shuttles to carry electrons between the electrodes and bacteria to be used in the reductive pathway. The MtrCAB complex will be used to take electrons into the cell with the MtrB and MtrC proteins implanted in the outer membranes of cells and the MtrA protein carrying the electrons into the cells. The electrons then diffuse across the periplasmic space where they are taken up by CymA on the inner membrane. The ccmA-H genes are a set of cytochromes that serve to help mature c-type cytochromes such as the MtrCAB complex and CymA.
These genes have previously been used in microbial fuel cell (MFC) systems, in the bacterial organism, residing in a bottle with an electrode, supplies electrons at the anode side. Electrons are shuttled by the phenazines to the anode and flow through a circuit, creating a current that powers a load and ultimately brings the electrons to the cathode bottle.
Conversely, this pathway can be reversed so that, instead of the bacteria, an external power source provides electrons in place of a load using the current."

Human Practices
Intoduction
Our project focused on the bioremediation of wastewater which is an issue present            in the industrial sector and throughout the environment. Clean freshwater is a            finite resource and bioremediation of contaminated water bodies is becoming            increasingly important. Emerging innovative technologies for effective and low            energy treatment of wastewater exists. It was important for us to discover what            impact our project could have among existing wastewater treatment technologies.            We also believed it was important to obtain insight from relevant stakeholders            which would help our project evolve into a valuable and useful method. In other            words, we felt integrated Human Practices was paramount in the construction of our            project. Our starting point was a paper which we discovered in Nature titled: Acoustic            Reporter Genes for Noninvasive Imaging of Microorganisms in Mammalian Hosts,            published by the lab of Mikhail Shapiro, at Caltech. This paper used an established            biological process -- the formation of simple gas-filled vesicles in known bacteria            and archaea -- in an innovative way: as an imaging platform, using specific            resonances to selectively collapse the vesicles and mapping their locations in            mammalian deep tissue. Through this paper, our Wet Lab team knew that viable parameters for manipulating            the gas vesicle size, shape, and location did exist. These parameters exist in the            form of the different genes that produce the gas vesicles; from here, we would use            these parameters and combine them with the unique aspects of our project --            coupling the expression of gas vesicles with the bacteria in question binding to            our molecule of interest. Now, theoretically, we could use the bacteria to separate            our molecule of interest from water and then make the bacteria float using vesicles.            By creating a physically separate layer where the bacteria had taken up the            contaminant in question, this makes the water treatment process dramatically            easier, and produces a viable bioremediation platform! We contacted the Shapiro lab and they agreed to send us key bacterial strains needed            to produce our vesicular construct. Correspondence with the Shapiro lab and"

Greenhardtii Projekt
Die Erde steht ständig im Gleichgewicht und erhält es durch verschiedenste Stoffkreisläufe. Der Kohlenstoffkreislauf, welcher hauptsächlich aus der Interaktion von phototrophen- und heterotrophen Organismen resultiert, ist besonders wichtig. Phototrophe Organismen verzehren dabei Kohlenstoffdioxid, während heterotrophe Organismen ihn wieder freisetzen. Dieses Gleichgewicht ins Wanken geraten, da fossile Brennstoffe verbrannt und Grünflächen reduziert werden und sich somit immer mehr CO2 in der Atmosphäre ansammelt. Steigende CO2 – Konzentrationen erzeugen einen globalen Treibhauseffekt der in steigenden Temperaturen resultiert und die Erde um einige Grad erwärmt. Ein paar Grad scheinen nicht besonders ins Gewicht zu fallen, jedoch bedeuten diese gravierende Veränderungen im Ökosystem und hydrogeologischen Mitteln und können Gletscherschmelze, steigende Meeresspiegel, Dürren, Überflutungen, tödliche Hitzewellen, Feuer, Austrocknung and andere furchtbare Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen.
Als iGEM Team UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB diesem Notstand entgegentretend, haben wir eine Strategie entwickelt, um CO2 einzufangen und am selben Platz unterschiedliche Biomaterialien von ökonomischem und wissenschaftlichem Interesse zu produzieren. Um unser Projekt zu vervollständigen, haben wir zwei Etappen etabliert. Die erste Etappe besteht aus zwei Transformationen in die Grünalge Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, welche auf der einen Seite ein cyanobakterielles Enzym Fructose-1,6 / Sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphatase, für die Verbesserung des Calvin Cyclus (eine der wichtigsten Etappen in der Photos"

He discussed the several steps to implement a project like ours, and instead, encouraged us to pursue creating a bioreactor that directly connects to the oil processing pipeline producing the BTX we convert.  This way, we can quickly implement our project in a real-world setting, and avoid repercussions from releasing our cells into the environment.
Taking his advice, we sought modifications to our bioremediation organism that would help its function in a bioreactor setting, as opposed to modifications that would allow it to survive in the environment, and are now making moves to design a bioreactor next year that would expand our results from previous years and allow us to implement our project in a real-world setting. This will in turn be more realistic than releasing our bacteria into the environment like we had planned to pursue. We are thankful for the applicable advice that we received while interviewing an expert in the field of bioremediation, and we hope to continue discussion of our project’s future with Dr. Hazen in the future.
Improve a Previous Part:
Our problems with 2013 IGEM Peking’s Pu promoter (BBa_K1031803) were twofold. First, it had to be coupled with a separate plasmid to accommodate xylR, the regulatory activator. Second, our team was unable to reproduce m-xylene induction using their circuit. Our team improved on this part by establishing a single plasmid for Pu regulation (coupled xylR and Pu onto the same vector). Additionally, we improved translation rates by adding untranslated regions (UTRs) between ribosome binding sites and start codons. Future teams may now BioBrick our Pu-GFP biosensor (BBa_K2451013), or Gibson another structural gene in the place of GFP.
Demonstrate your Work:
With 0.1 mM IPTG and 1 mM m-xylenes added to our BBa_K2451013 construct, our Pu promoter showed ~4x GFP expression than our solely 0.1 mM IPTG construct.  Thus, our regulatory sequence including xylR regulatory protein and Pu promoter was able to significantly change expression levels based on the presence of aromatic compounds. These results are reflected on Figures 2 and 3 on the Project page.
1 mM m-xylene induction of BBa_K2451015 (UTK05) revealed conversion of m-xylene to 3-methyl benzyl alcohol and m-tolualdehyde while blank plasmid, BL21(DE3), and the construct without m-xylenes"

The aim of the experience was to test the expression of sfGFP (BBa_I746908) induced by arabinose (pBAD promoter) and constitutive GFP (BBa_K584001). Each plasmid was transformed individualy in E.Coli bacteria. After an overnight culture of these bacteria in LB medium containing chloramphenicol and arabinose, they were flown in the chip and subsequently scanned.
2      Results
2.1     Data
The picture shows the chambers of the chip containing the bacteria. Fluorescence is only visible in the chambers because lysis buffer was flown in the channels, thus removing all signal comming from the bacteria outisde the closed chambers. First line contains the sfGFP, second line the const. GFP and this is repeated over the whole chip by pair of lines.
2.2     Interpretation
Great signal of both superfolded GFP and constitutive GFP was obtained. In theory superfolded GFP should be more intense than conventional GFP. A slight difference can be seen on the scan, however as the cell density could not be checked precisely this could be due to different concentrations of bacteria in the chambers.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," dark room with a 30s exposure, showing cosegregation of luminescence with orange colour.
Given that IPTG induction seemed unnecessary for production of mOrange, we reasoned that any spectral shift in the emission of the luciferase should be visible without induction. Our next move was to see if we could detect a difference with the filters we used for the instrumentation.
30 second exposure, K325909 on the left, our construct on the right.
As above, but with the filters shifted so that the previously filtered areas are visible for comparison.
This was done at quite a late stage and in a slightly impromptu fashion. The photographs above directly compare the normal lux biobrick (BBa_K325909) on the left, and our construct on the right, with the same filter. There does seem to be a difference in the quantity of light coming through the filter. However it could be due to colony density (although they seem to be of similar intensities without the filter). Interesting though these results are, they are not quantitative or well-controlled enough to constitute confirmation that the luxA-mOr fusion is behaving as expected, rather they are an indication that it may be.
To categorically confirm that the spectrum is as we expected we would want to fully characterise the emission spectrum with a scanning luminometer.  We do not currently have access to a scanning luminometer in time to submit the data here before the wiki freeze, however we hope to obtain this data in the next week, and to be able to present it at the jamboree.
Instrumentation (Biologger)
Having our instrumentation completed, as can be seen in our Instrumentation (Biologger) page, the sensitivity of the sensor placed in the right position was tested using a dilution series of luciferase-producing E.coli. 20ml Cultures were grown overnight from single colonies. The cultures were induced with 40ul of 1.5M arabinose (for a final concentration of 3mM). Cultures were left for 2 1/2 hours for full induction. Subsequently, a culture was pelleted and resuspended in 4ml LB. Doubling dilutions, of volume 2ml, were made from this concentrate, down to 1/8th concentration. 1ml of each 2ml dilution was analysed in each cuvette, which was placed in the cuvette holder we made ourselves. The result was very good. An almost linear relationship was obtained when data were normalised with the sensor value taken in the dark room (the latter set at zero)"

Human Practices
The process of genetically enhancing organisms to perform a designated task can have myriad applications in a variety of different fields (Ferry, 2012). For instance, advances in synthetic biology can lead to technologies such as bacterial photography, tumor-targeting bacteria, and biofuels (Sleight, 2010). However, in order for a genetically enhanced organism to perform its desired function reliably, the installed genes must persist through numerous generations. Since all engineered organisms will continue to evolve as they reproduce, designing an organism to maintain a function nonessential for survival for a sustained period of time can be challenging. By learning more about genetic stability, we can develop ways to increase it in the devices we design in the future. This will facilitate the development of novel technologies, which can eventually benefit any aspect of life that synthetic biology influences, such as medicine, quality of patient care, and society as a whole
Our project was designed to test and improve the genetic stability of genetically engineered fluorescence proteins as a model for other systems such as therapeutic proteins and metabolic pathways. We believe that our work will impact the medical industry by creating DNA sequences that have the ability to maintain gene expression in probiotic bacteria without experiencing significant rates of failure mutations that make these organisms perform less predictably or into a malicious construct.   Bacteria are often used in treatments as gut repopulation, the recolonizing of unpopulated intestines with the bacteria necessary for digestive health (Ruder 2011).  By ensuring that genetically modified bacteria are as stable as possible, the risks of synthetic biology therapies can be minimized and society’s ability to treat and cure ailments can be increased.
For instance, the continued depletion of nonrenewable energy sources has created a demand for novel energy sources. While synthetic biology offers one possible solution, its viability is hindered as a result of genetic instability. Since the evolutionary process continues even after an organism is genetically engineered to produce biofuel precursors, the genetic device is at risk. Producing the necessary molecules requires energy and carbon from the cells, which can diminish a cell’s fitness, breaking the genetic circuit. However, the development of a more stable genetic device could lead to a robust method of biofuel production that"

Aim
We designed and ordered the gBlocks for 5 genes, which encode for proteins involved in the hydrogen production (hyd1, ferredoxin, hydG, hydEF).
We attempted to incorporate the gBlocks into BioBricks, which were then transformed into E.coli. Once all the genes can be expressed in E.coli, this will facilitate the production of hydrogen gas.
Experimental Design
Analyse and optimise the genes that are needed to be synthesised.
Digest and ligate gblocks into Biobricks, , digest check and sequence confirm.
Digest and ligate Biobricks together via 3A assembly.
Summarised Results
Due to the size of hydEF, the gene was synthesized as 2 gBlocks, incorporated into Biobricks, and brought together by 3A assembly.
We successfully inserted and confirmed 3 Biobricks (hyd1, hydEF and ferredoxin).

Our Project
Kombucha is a beverage made when a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast ferments sugared tea. Although kombucha has been consumed for thousands of years in the East, the drink has enjoyed a recent surge in popularity. 1 Several kombucha breweries operate in Austin, Texas, our team’s hometown. The role microbes play in the production of the beverage has led our team to wonder if synthetic biology could allow us to create “designer kombucha” with enhanced properties, such as more appealing flavors or additional nutrients. In order to do so, our team attempted to isolate the strains responsible for the fermentation of kombucha, identify them, genetically modify them, and add the individual strains into tea media to recreate the drink. We additionally considered potential applications of the ability to genetically modify the microbial population of kombucha, such as reducing the ethanol content of the beverage and improving taste with brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein. In consideration of Human Practices, we reached out to the Austin kombucha community to learn more about what kombucha brewers and consumers would want in a customizable kombucha. Through this interaction, we learned that many kombucha consumers and manufacturers value the traditional, all-natural process of producing the beverage, and that many in the industry would be apprehensive of kombucha made with genetically modified organisms. Though we hope increased public awareness of synthetic biology may someday make a genetically modified kombucha marketable, the current attitudes of kombucha consumers have led us to consider methods of creating designer kombucha that rely only on natural genetic variation.

The solution is cooled down to 50-55°C. A trick is to swirl the flask lightly to cool evenly.
20 µl of cybrsafe is added in 4-5 drops on the casting tray. The agarose gel is added and mixed evenly. The gel is left to cure, which takes 30-45 min.
The gel is placed in a electrophoresis chamber. Make sure the TAE buffer in the chamber is 2-3mm above the agarose gel.
The gel is loaded with the samples, a negative sample, and the DNA ladder.
The gel is run at 70V. The time depends on the bp length, but 30-60 min are usually good for 1000-3000bp.
The gel is visualized in a -GEL EXPOSER!-.
USER cloning
Materials
Procedures
The USER mix components are mixed (Table in materials). The PCR product must be purified before used in USER cloning
2 µl of the USER mix is transferred to PCR tubes.
The PCR products is added in equal amounts of each to a total volume of 8 µl and incubated for 40 minutes at 37°C and for 30 min at 25"

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

2.  Communicating with other teams
    We participated in the 2018 6th Asian-Pacific iGEM Conference and CCIC, where we communicated a lot with many teams. We also had a small meeting with ZJUT, DLUT, and LZU in Jiangsu Normal University. What’s more, we cooperated with some universities abroad, such as Unesp Brazil, Kyoto University Japan. In short, these communications are positive, meaningful, and very helpful to the improvement of our projects.
（1）2018 6th Asian-Pacific iGEM Conference
    From July 30th to August 2nd, we attended the 2018 6th Asian-Pacific iGEM Conference held in National Chung Hsing University.
    At this conference, we discussed our project with iGEMers from Asia-Pacific and mentors from NCHU, gaining some suggestions to improve our project. We also got tons of new ideas from other participants by communicating with them and listening to their presentations. In addition, we learned a lot from the speech of Ambassador of the iGEM HQ and top scientists from the field of Synthetic Biology.
    All in all, we had a productive and enjoyable experience and gained lots of inspiration at the 2018 6th Asian-Pacific iGEM Conference!

1. Production of hirudin
For this simulation, we wanted to know how fast a cell-free system can produce hirudin. This is very important for us to determine if our system will be able to prevent blood coagulation . Blood clots in 5-10 minutes when taken out of the body, so our system will need to produce enough hirudin in less than that time.
To determine the production rate, we measured the time it takes to produce a threshold level of hirudin. We decided to use 1.3 μM of hirudin as the amount needed to prevent blood coagulation.
By running our model with the following initial conditions:
50 nM of repressed DNA
50 nM of excess TetR dimer

I have screend 6 colonies, only one was correct and its overnight culture was fluorescent too! Anyway the screening seemed ok , we had just to wait for the sequencing results.
During this week I also started to characterize my construct K731450, or better, I should have started to characterize this construct: as I said at the beginning I was very tired, and I forgot to add the antibiotic to the medium; so I threw away the culture, I will start again next week. After the Biochemistry exam of course, and after my first weekend of relax and freedom.
I've confirmed by screening the construct I created the previous week. Also, sequencing results of K731500 are OK.
I’ve tried to create K731520 and K731530, but the screening is a total disaster.
I tried to characterize anyway those constructs, by choosing and amplifying the most promising colonies. While I was able to measure IPTG-dependent levels of fluorescence for K731530, the other one did not seem to contain GFP gene. Just half a success.
I’ve been told that the chosen approach doesn’t work. Others tried it even before I started my job and failed… if only I knew.
We’ve also been in Trieste to meet the only other italian team. It has been fun, but I had to stay in the lab until 3AM after that.
I will amplify K731530 by PCR and try to insert it into pSB1C3 to obtain K731520 – a safe approach…
This week we mutated again RL** with the new primer using a three steps Phusion program, ligated and transformed it. The screening digestion was good       and sent for sequencing some samples.
Wednesday and Thursday I stayed at home to study for an exam and Giaco had a lot of fun without me: he screened the effective presence of the terminators B0010–14–15–17 in the parts extracted from registry. He found out that there was nothing in the parts B0010 and B0015 but the vector pSB1C3. He tried also to amplify them by PCR but the gel showed nothing once again. On the other hand, he confirmed B0014 and 17.
He got through some difficulties but finally he made t7terminator in pSB1C3 . Last time, when I tried, seemed all positive but the sequencing revealed just empty plasmids, so we were quite concerned about"

1.2 Procedures of Experiments
     1.2.1 PCR Proliferation
        Due to high content of G-C base-pairs in target gene segments, GC Buffer is required in PCR proliferation. Refer to Takara's protocols to prepare 200μL of system: 100μL of GC Buffer, 16μL of dntp mixture, 4μL of sense primer, 4μL of anti-sense primer, 4μL of DNA templet, 2μL of Taq, and 70μL of H2O. 60°C-70°C is used for Gradient PCR, the sixth bad is the brightest (Figure 9) thus the temperature of such is best for annealing. In new system, PCR is proceeded in that temperature; finally we get the gene segments with gene linkers.

Kyoto,2014,Team:Kyoto#Project#Magnetosome Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," also tried to magnetosome membrane formation in E. coli. They introduced mamL, mamQ, mamB, mamI and mamK to E. coli and indicated that introducing these genes affected the localization of MamC: GFP fusion protein in the cells. However, their constructs lack RBS in proper position, that is, they did not insert RBS 6 bases upstream of start codon. In addition, they did not have a mean to detect vesicles at high resolution. These difficulties hinder their experiments from the observation of the vesicle formation. Moreover, in 2014, new paper was published and mamL, mamQ and mamB were considered to be essential, and mamI and mamK were suggested to be inessential for the first step of magnetosome membrane formation.
Generally, E. coli do not have any internal structures enclosed by lipid membranes. Therefore, it is impossible for E. coli to make magnetosomes without forming lipid vesicles first. As we described above, in magnetosome formation of MTB, three proteins – MamL, MamQ and MamB, are considered to be integrated with the inner membrane and triggers vesicle formation. Here we started from magnetosome vesicle formation in E. coli by expressing these three proteins ( Fig. 5 ). In the result below, we show successful reconstitution of the magnetosome-like vesicles in E. coli. The characterization of the induced vesicles and roles for MamL, MamQ and MamB are also discussed.
Fig. 5 mamL, Q and B are considered to relate to vesicle formation.
Experiments & Results
Cloning and Expression of mamL, mamQ and mamB.
We purchased M. magneticum AMB-1 genome DNA was purchased from ATCC. Using the genome, mamL, mamQ, and mamB genes were amplified and cloned. During the construction of the plasmids, the RBS sequence BB_B0034 RBS was inserted to the 6 nucleotide upstream of the start codon of each gene, following the instruction of iGEM standard parts. As shown in Fig. 6 , histidine tag was fused to the C-terrminus of mamL and mamQ, respectively, for the purpose of the examination of the expression. These genes were fused and placed under the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100.

4 - 10 August
Because the PCR products of NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were lost during the purification and restriction in the week of 28 Juli - 3 August, the PCR was repeated for this genes, together with the genes that could not be amplified yet. This time a PCR was used that did not lower in  temperature, like the touchdown PCR, but that increased in temperature  with each step. This way it was hoped to get over the huge gap between the annealing temperature of the primer in the first cycle and the annealing temperature of the primer when the flap of the primer can also  anneal to the first PCR products. The temperature was set to increase from 40 &degC to 60 &degC in 20 cycles. Then, an additional 20 cycles were done at 65 &degC. The PCR was performed under standard conditions as was done before, together with a series of PCR that contained GC buffer (supplied with the Phusion DNA polymerase by Thermo Scientific), and a series of PCR with GC buffer and 1.5% DMSO. This time, with the help of Lisa, the PCR was finally successful for all genes.
11 - 17 August
The PCR on the BioBrick of the combined genes NisR and NisK was repeated because the yield of this product was very low after the PCR in the week of 4 - 10 August. The mixture of the previous PCR reaction was used as the template. The PCR was performed under standard conditions, with an annealing temperature of 64 &degC and 1 &mul, 2&mul and 3 &mul template. No product was obtained with this PCR. So the PCR was once again repeated, this time using diluted template. The mixture was diluted 50x, 300x, 1500x and 15000x. The PCR was repeated using 1 &mul and 2 &mul of each of the dilutions. This way, product was obtained for all reactions.
The PCR products of the genes NisA, NisB, NisC, NisRK, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were purified using the GeneJET purification kit. Then 1 &mug of each purified product was restricted with EcoRI"

Single Cell ODE Model for the Time Control Module
1 Overview
The second module in our construct is the Time Control module. The purpose of this module is to produce a time delay in responding to the AHL signal inside the cell and to control the translation of two repressors downstream the sensing promoter in order to turn on the expression of Cre recombinase, which is necessary for the recombination reactions in the Recombination module. In transducing the signal through the Time Control module instead of directly passing it to the Recombination module, we seek to allow the Sensing module sufficient time to amplify the AHL signal with its positive feedback loop which would allow for more effective quorum sensing when the AHL diffuses into surrounding cells. Here, we will model the delay produced by the module.
In this module, the most important species considered are AHL, cI, PhlF, and Cre. To recap, AHL and LuxR are integral to the function of the module, both being required to induce the promoter pLuxR. Specifically, a (LuxR_AHL)2 molecule induces pLuxR by binding to a region in front of it on the plasmid. Because we are simulating only the Time Control module in this simulation, we will assume AHL has a constant concentration, being constitutively produced by the Sensing module. Thus, we can treat pLuxR as operating at the full transcription rate.
The promoter pLuxR is involved in the transcription of mRNA, which in turn is needed for the translation of cI.
The promoter pcI is the next promoter in the stream and it is repressed by cI2 and is needed for the translation of PhlF molecules. On pcI, there are two binding sites for cI2 with cooperativity. This means that a cI2 already bound to one site will increase the rate at which cI2 binds to the other site. It will only produce PhlF when both sites are not bound"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," consultant radiologist, said that the results of a blood test using our sensor could help to relieve a patient’s anxiety far sooner than is currently possible. Our test, which can be carried out at a GP surgery, would comprise sending off the sample and processing the results with our sensor. This could be achieved in a few days rather than the 3 weeks required for a CT scan. In a hospital, this process could be even faster.
Portability
Through using the flourometer, and miRNA extraction kits, our sensor could be highly portable - unlike a CT scanner. This would be highly important for use in developing countries - bringing the test to individuals, when transport infrastructure for them to get to an urban hospital may not be in place.
In developed countries, blood tests could be carried out locally and the samples would be sent to a national lab for processing and testing. For example, nurses could be sent to higher-risk population groups e.g. nursing homes, allowing more people to be screened as there would be fewer barriers to screening (e.g. mobility issues).
Dr Desai, a respiratory consultant, stressed that another benefit of our test would be in reducing the number of CT scans required to rule out NSCLC. Given the shortage of radiologists, this could prove extremely beneficial to the NHS. This shortage would also make screening with CT impractical.
It is important to note that our project would not replace current diagnostic methods; CT and PET scans, along with biopsy would still be crucial for staging tumors and informing a therapeutic decision. Our sensor would be used to:
Screen high risk population groups for cancer and other diseases, and refer people with positive test results to further testing.
Rule out cancer or other diseases in certain high risk individuals - by setting cut-offs appropriately, and using several miRNA signatures in tandem - preventing unnecessary further testing could be prevented (this is further explained in gold human practices )
Be used in tandem with a CT scan to reduce false positives
Mass-population screening. For example, testing for a variety of diseases every year for those over a certain age
Provide point of care information to doctors. With a multiplexing assay of toehold switches, a myriad of diseases could be screened for, and ruled out, simultaneously assisting doctors in making a diagnosis.
We believe our tool could save millions of lives through early detection of various diseases. Non-small cell lung cancer was chosen as a proof of concept as NSCLC is often treatable when detected early (as cited by doctors), and had 2 well characterized miRNA biomarkers. However, due to the programmable nature of toehold switches,"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," and catalyzed the conversion of substrate nucleotides. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results. Based on this fact, it can be concluded that CAT-Seq activity sequencing method can be utilized as a precise and accurate way to screen and assign the activity and orthogonality of regulatory sequences in a high throughput manner.
Using CAT-Seq
We truly believe that Catalytic Activity Sequencing will be a valuable and frequently used tool by future iGEM teams, Scientists and Engineers. That is why we have created a detailed “Using Cat-Seq” protocol guide that allows users of range of background and skill level to start exploring the vast space of sequence and activity relationships right away!"

- Increased number and decreased strictness of FDA approvals in previous years. (Song, 2014)
- Synthetic biology markets are estimated to grow by an average of 33.8% yearly until 2018. (DALLAS, 2014)
Industries of operation: Synthetic biology, Pharmaceutics, Industrial biofilm removal, 3D printing. Each of these industries are either growing or stable, with no apparent threat of disappearing or drastically decreasing in size.
Barriers and Disadvantages of the industrial ecosystem.
Investors have high bargaining power; Because our project combines two relatively new technologies, it can be labeled as a high risk investment. This means that investors will be more reluctant to fund us, or demand high returns to compensate   for the high risks.
Client high bargaining power; The nature of our customer intimate strategy implies that we have only a few customers for whom we provide a tailored service. Losing one client poses a high threat to the us, therefore placing our clients   in an advantageous negotiating position. However, if we can become indispensable to our clients and difficult to imitate by other companies, the advantage can turn to our side.
Strong potential competition; A significant number of established companies with financial and technological strength can threaten our small business if they replicate our services.
Biotechnology industries historically have long development periods with low returns and tricky product approval cycles. Moreover, research requires high capital investment needs.
Technological Innovation and Adoption Strategy
In this section, we describe how Biolink can grow from idea to service. We describe the innovation process and utilize a strategic analysis tool: Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) Analysis to underline key elements that can help or hinder   our technology and its emergence.

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Trial7_-_-_TEXT.html," to keep us lighthearted.
Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our ""HR Guy"" he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project, Joe was our public voice and was in charge of all external relations such as collaborations, looking for sponsorship and even managing our Twitter account. In addition to public relations, Joe was also heavily involved in lab work. He assisted David in developing our silver stain protocol and helped develop our experimental design with Mattéa.
A day without our friend Joe is very quiet, and almost lonely. His presence (and sneeze) fills the entire room with a kind of light and positivity that many people lack or take for granted. Joe has the ability to see the silver lining in the darkest storm cloud and for that, we are very thankful. Thank you, Joe! May your beard grow strong and great.
Abbie Gottert
Abbie is one of the most caring, friendly and empathetic people you will ever meet. Between assisting with Logo and Banner design, reviewing the literature, helping Johannes out with the policy and practices, and assisting with lab work, she finds the time to have a full time job and maintain a balance between them. Always concerned with the well being of the group, she goes out of her way to make sure that everyone stays healthy, happy and mentally sound.
Thank you so much, Abbie. Although you couldn't be with us all the time in lab, we always knew you were there in spirit - whether it be a GIF image sent in chat or popping in in the late afternoon after your other shift. ""Good friends are like stars, you can't always see them but you know they're always there."" Abbie is our good friend and has been a shining star in our team.

Kevin Setzer
Throughout the summer, Kevin was extremely busy working full time while also helping out our iGEM team. Though most of his contribution was done outside of NAIT, we could not have grown into the team we are today without Kevin Setzer.
Kevin mostly worked with Joy in the coding and designing of Team NAIT's Wiki sites. He was the bug exterminator, the very necessary second pair of eyes involved in editing all the HTML, CSS and dreaded Java that coded our wiki. Additionally, Kevin also helped in the post-production processes of our 3D animation (i.e: After Effects and Photoshop editing). When he could, Kevin also came to the lab to help prepare re"

c. Working in harsh, unreachable areas: Dr. Randy Berthold sees potential in using UAVs in places that are hard to reach, and in places where noise/increase of sound might disturb the measurements.  UAVs could reach areas with toxic gases and extreme temperatures.
d. Planetary Exploration: Prof. Jim Heads from Brown University finds a lot of potential in using UAVs for geological and planetary Exploration. UAVs will be an efficient way to record sensory data which cover a large area without worrying about transporting astronauts and the costs that go with that.
e. Coast Guard Exploration: Dr. Philip McGillivard, a science liaison from Coast Guard PACAREA who has been working on Autonomous Underwater Systems (AUS) finds a lot of potential in linking UAVs with AUS in exploring coasts. UAVs can be used to explore and identify features of interest such as an oceanographic front or an iceberg and later, UAVs can communicate this information to surface vehicles which will then send the information to Underwater Systems in order to study that specific ocean area.
2. Opinions on Synthetic biology All of our interviewees believed that synthetic biology presents great potentials and capabilities in technology, especially in creating cheaper and eco-friendly technology. Most admitted that the scientific society is yet to discover the full potential of using synthetic biology for their missions. The experts working on UAVs reported that one of the limitations of using UAVs in their jobs is the payload of the UAV. They believed that UAV technology could be largely improved if  synthetic biology can create cheaper and lighter payloads with high efficient capabilities.
3. How can we address the stigma surrounding UAVs? All the interviewees agreed that people have concerns on the uses of UAVs mainly due to their connection with military uses, and also due to fear of their personal safety. The interviewed experts said this stigma could be addressed effectively if people are informed on the beneficial uses of UAVs, and if they are informed of the policies and regulations present on the uses of UAVs.
Part B: Social Survey
The social survey was conducted primarily for the purpose of collecting general public’s opinion on the use of UAVs for civilian uses. The survey was posted in many different social networks such as tweeter and Facebook. Due to the nature of the survey and how it was advertised, we ended up having most of the respondents (over 90%) of age from 18-25 years.  The total number of people who responded to the survey questions was 117.
Q1:"
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#blog_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Ganguly  was  chosen  as  the  principal  guide  of  our  iGEM  team  because  of  his   expertise  in  synthetic  biology  and  his  willingness  to  dedicate  time  and  resources  for  the   consolidation and success of the project. In the next few weeks, several meetings were held amongst the team members and with our   guide.  Related  papers  were  presented  and  discussed  and  the  idea  was  consolidated.   Accordingly, the work­flow for the project was chalked out. As many of the fourth year students   were going abroad for summer internships, the ones staying back had to schedule their work in   the  lab and  distribute  the  work  to  the  many  third  years  who  were  staying  back  too.  Those   members  who  were  going  for  interns  also  ensured  progress  of  the  wiki  content  development   and other non lab­related assignments.
Lab work:
Wet­Lab work regarding transformations and cloning had started before the arrival of the Kit of   Parts. Sriram and few other third year students had stayed back in the summers and practised   the  various methods of rDNA technology. Prof. Ganguly, along with few of his PhD  students,   was himself present throughout the  summer to train our team members in these procedures.   The Kit of Parts arrived in the summer vacation period itself. After that, experiments began with   full force and as the  vacations ended, the rest of the team members, who had gone for their   internships,  joined  in  one  after  the  other.  All  the  wet­lab  work  was  carried  out  in  the  fully   equipped UG lab of our department which remains open 24X7. Our  experiments  were  often  interrupted  by  setbacks  and  challenges.  When  we  first  tried  to   transform  the  luxR  and  crtEBI,  we  did  not  get  the  colonies.  This  may  have  been  a result  of   experimental errors like improper  spreading or  so. However, after  several attempts, we  could   rectify  it  and  obtained  colonies.  We  checked  our  plasmids  by  using  appropriate  restriction   enzymes and running gels.

As a control to show that the hydrogel formation assists in layer formation, layers of red and green cells were printed without alginate and CaCl2. Images of 76 planes over a distance of 37.5 μm with excitation at 488 nm and 561 nm were taken and of these 36 were used to make a 3D stack (Figure 28cd).
Figure 5. Layer formation of GFP-expressing cells (green) and RFP-expressing cells (red). a. Layers of hydrogel containing RFP and GFP cells were created on a plasma-cleaned coverslip. The z-stack consists of 34 planes and was created by stacking and interpolation of these planes. The bottom layer of around 29 μm in height contains cells producing RFP and the layer on top of around 34 μm in height contains cells producing GFP. b. Same sample as a, but seen from below. The red cells are in front, while the green cells are further in the background. Imaging of a. & b. was performed using spinning disk confocal microscope with a 100x objective. Images were captured by excitation at 488 nm for GFP at 9.7% intensity and 561 nm for RFP at 3.2% intensity using an exposure time of respectively 200-ms and 50-ms. c. Layers of LB containing RFP and GFP cells were created on a plasma-cleaned coverslip. The z-stack consists of 36 planes and was created by stacking and interpolation of these planes. d. Same sample as c, but seen from below. Imaging of c. & d. was performed using spinning disk confocal microscope with a 100x objective. Images were captured by excitation at 488 nm for GFP at 16.1% intensity and 561 nm for RFP at 9.7% intensity using an exposure time of respectively 5-ms and 1-ms.
This image shows that two distinct layers are formed when bio-ink was used and mixing between the layers is almost negligible. The height of the red layer is around 29 μm and the height of the green layer is around 34 μm depending on the position in the layer. The sample without alginate shows that without the use of bio-ink, the cells are not structured and a mixture of red and green cells is formed. This proves that the hydrogel"

Interdiscipline Studies are Cool and Fun!
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
In addition, we discussed the crucial issue of multidisciplinary researches with our audiance in our lecture. We have integrated the theme into our project perfectly. We incorporated ideas of information theory into biological research. Mathematical modeling plays an important role in our program as well. We are not only adcocators of intersections between different subjects, but also active practipants in action.
We are a special team. Of the 13 members, 11 are from the Department of Automation, the rest two from School of Life Sciences. This background enables us to think differntly and to concentrate on subjects traditional biologists do not concern about. Early in our project, one of our members tried to model the dynamics of the cell with electrical circuit simulation tools, which are handy and provided interesting outcomes.
Interdiscipline studies are cool and fun! We tell the world, not only by showing the possibily to listeners, but also by exploring the possibilities ourselves. Come and join us.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.

Introduction
To get clone of sleB, we use plasmid pSB1AT3 which contains restriction sites:EcoRI and speI. Also, our sleB primers were added with these two restriction sites when they were designed.After we digest sleB and pSB1AT3 with same enzymes,we can ligate sleB gene with pSB1AT3 backbone using T4 ligase. This ligased plasmid would trasformated into E.coli.

One team had difficulties in finding relevant questions to answer with modeling. To overcome these problems, teams seeked help from outside the team, either from other iGEM teams or from supervisors and advisors. It was also mentioned that having a supervisor specialized in modeling would have been helpful.
Analysis of the iGEM team compositions
General team composition
We collected data from total of 84 teams that took part in iGEM 2014. 23 teams were from Europe, 28 teams from Asia, 5 teams from Latin America and 28 teams from North America. Our sample consisted of 1063 majors. The majors were categorized under Biology, Biotechnology, Mathematics, Computer Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Other Engineering and Other majors. All the majors under each category are shown in table 1.
Figure 5: Fields of iGEM participants by category (n = 1063).
The division of the fields is gathered in figure 5. Biggest fields are biology and biotechnology with 48.5% and 26% of students respectively. The fields actively doing modeling according to our survey are a clear minority, with computer science at 6.8% and physics at 2.6% of iGEM participants. Mathematical sciences, mathematics, physics and computer science, make up a total of 11.2% of the fields.
Composition of synthetic biology research groups
Very few research groups have clearly outlined what the exact background of their members are, making it hard to compare with iGEM teams. Systems biology and synthetic biology group in Edinburgh and MIT synthetic biology groups had a total of 83 majors with 24 people left unspecified. Majors were grouped as with the iGEM team composition and are presented in figure 6. About half of the researchers came from biology and the second half from other sciences.

Discussion
Who does modeling?
Unsurprisingly, modeling appears to rather strongly rest on the shoulders of students of mathematical sciences. All the physics and computer science students that answered to our questionnaire were doing modeling as their main task. Respondents studying biological sciences are very little involved in modeling, but biotechnology students often do it in addition to other tasks, perhaps acting as mediators between modeling and experimentation.
Expectations for modeling and its results
The expectations students have for modeling appear to rather well meet the results they are getting from"
NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," our 3D printer was not precise enough to produce such a thickness, or rather, thinness. We expect that even if the 3D printer could print it, it would soon break anyway. While the rotor was still functional in this state, we felt that this design had room for improvement.
The third modification we made was to reposition the inlet and outlet for the silicone tubing.
Aachen 2015’s design stacked several Plexiglass layers on the stepper motor’s faceplate, forming a housing to hold a silicone tube inside a circular path. We noticed that Aachen 2015’s silicone tubes had a smaller outer and inner diameter than the tubes we planned to use, as the working volume of their bioreactor is less than ours. After analyzing their design, we realized that we only needed to modify one layer

Gene Card aims at promoting synthetic biology among primary and secondary school students and non-biology-major students. We have launched our campaign of Gene Card promotion in China and the card has been warmly welcomed. Meanwhile, Gene Card has both English and Chinese versions.
Why we design Gene Card
We want to renovate the inflexible educational approach to synthetic biology, and build a new model for public education. So we have designed a board game, which is entertaining and contains basic biological knowledge. We think that the best way to teach is edutainment, so we want students to have fun while learning knowledge.
How can we achieve our goal?
In order to ensure the reliability of the card game, Gene Card needs to be deliberately and sophisticatedly designed. So we built the mathematical model first. Then we used the calculator to simulate the game process, in order to obtain the best number of different cards.
Promotion
We entered several major middle schools in Chengdu and introduced our cards to them. Meanwhile, we organized some Gene Card games. Students gave us feedbacks and showed strong interest in playing our cards.
In the CCIC, we introduced Gene Card to all China iGEM team, and gave them Chinese version Gene Card as a souvenir. They played with us many times and liked it very much. And a detail which is worth mentioning is that Zhang Haoqian, the CTO of Bluepha Company, praised our card game on his twitter.
In the Innovative Entrepreneurship Week in Chengdu, we made a debut of our card. We introduced Gene Card to students. Many students had great interest in playing it, and wanted a set of it.
☁ Triangular cycle
Gene Card is the medium of human practice. We are modeling to achieve its design inspiration. It can attract the public, and the public will provide us with advice. At the same time, the project will provide content for modeling. This is the idea of our triangular cycle.
☁ Future
We want to promote Gene Card, so that students can learn more knowledge through entertainment. We want to make traditional biology class more lively and interesting, and make synthetic biology enjoy greater popularity. To achieve that, we will cooperate with schools and companies and endeavor to turn Gene Card into a campus biological learning tool.

Interact with students
In China, students only learn biology after middle school, so we hope to bring biology to younger students. We give middle school students or even primary school students an opportunity to participate in the activities of biology learning. And the theme of environmental protection is blended among these activities.

Hey there, I’m Ryan, a third year PhD candidate in Biomedical Physics studying under Dr. Francesca Palombo. I’m developing an understanding of the fundamental biomechanics and structure-function relationships that govern the physics and chemistry of the extracellular matrix. The iGEM experience persuaded me to crack on and do a PhD at the Physics-Biology interface; I was a student member of our very first iGEM team here at Exeter back in 2012, and am proud to have been an instructor to our guys ever since. I can’t wait to see what Exeter have in store for us this year! Exciting times!

Project Abstract
In Tacoma, Washington, arsenic contamination from the ASARCO copper smelter continues to devastate community soil and water. Even small amounts of arsenic pose a threat to long-term community health, causing cancer and child developmental disability. Tacoma and the state of Washington have spent more than 62 million dollars over 18 years testing in the region, with efforts still underway.
Tacoma RAINmakers seek to revolutionize toxin detection by engineering an affordable and simple biosensor that alerts the user of arsenic contamination. Our biosensor is user-friendly by design and will not require hazardous chemical reagents. Synthetic biology is the fundamental tenet of the RAINmaker sensor. By employing an arsenic regulatory gene (ArsR) native to E. coli, the RAINmakers are able to identify the presence of arsenic in the environment. ArsR functions as a repressor for a chromoprotein reporter complex. In the presence of arsenic ions (i.e. arsenate, arsenite), our arsenic regulator protein will bind to the toxin, change conformation, and allow expression of our indicator. As mentioned previously, the RAINmakers will be employing chromoproteins, namely amilCP and spisPink. Both of these reporters are non-fluorescent color-producing proteins native to coral. The biosensor will function in vitro; our circuit DNA material will be pipetted and lyophilized into a paper ticket.
Ultimately, this sensor will function as a qualitative test for arsenic that will be simple and inexpensive enough for layman use. The long-term goal is to improve community understanding of this ecological issue and bring an inexpensive tool to the hands of Tacoma and the world in a united effort to solve heavy metal contamination."

3. Replace culture medium by ultracentrifuging and resuspending cells in fresh medium.
4. Add AHL to culture.
5. Measure OD and fluorescence at regular intervals.
Results & Discussion:
A surprising lack of correspondence between AHL concentration and GFP fluorescence is noted. Simply adding chemically-derived AHL to culture solution may not be able to induce the receivers' promoter activities as a continual supply of AHL may need to be produced in order to offset the degradation and/or cellular metabolism of AHL molecules. The gradual and almost uniform increase in fluorescence for ALL samples may be simply due to increasing cell concentration which failed to be detected by OD600 measurements as at values of over 1.0 the linear relationship of OD with concentration is almost certainly lost.
Comments:
It was realized sometime after starting this experiment that in order to measure efficiency of promoter activation, the rate of change of GFP fluorescence would have been more useful than the absolute value of GFP fluorescence itself. Also, promoter activity might peak somewhere between the addition of AHL and the first subsequent measurement as response times of <10min has been reported for similar devices. The solution would have been to take measurements on smaller time intervals, eg. every minute, and calculate rate of change of fluorescence from the measurements. Unfortunately we were not able to access instruments capable of automatically measuring fluorescence at smaller time intervals.
Sensor Experiment 2: Senders vs Receivers
Procedure:
1. Pre-culture cells transformed with parts to be tested in solution medium overnight.
2. Pipette fresh medium into microcentrifuge tubes then inoculate with cells from overnight culture.
3. Culture overnight at 37 degrees Celsius in incubator.
4. Measure fluorescence.
Results & Discussion:
The results were rather disappointing as it appeared that only Lux Receiver I (which was a part we borrowed from Chiba University) showed any appreciable fluorescence when mixed and cultured with the senders. The parts we constructed ourselves - Lux Receiver II, Rhl Receiver and Cin Receiver, did not show much response to the presence of senders, even though it can be argued that at least their fluorescence was marginally above that of the negative control (receiver-only culture).
The reason for the huge difference in fluorescence between our parts and the one received from Chiba University may be attributed to a faulty GFP coding device being attached behind the promoters, as it can be seen that even in the absence of a sender the Lux receiver should show leaky promotion and create a 'baseline' fluorescence which is absent from our own parts. A PCR sequence check has been done on the GFP coding device but results are still pending.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#_-_-_TEXT.html," also generated several TetR transcription factor mutants and determined the specificities of a number of the new variants.
In vivo TF characterization
To be able to determine the in vivo activity and specificity of novel transcription factor variants we generated a suite of reporter plasmid systems . We successfully characterized a number of our reporter systems for functionality. We created a number of reporter plasmids to measure TetR activity, which lead to improved characterization data for the Partsregistry.
Microfluidics
We noticed that only a small number of iGEM teams have also made use of microfluidics in the past. Because we think that microfluidics are a useful tool for the iGEM community, we decided to promote the technique by creating the tamagotchip live online microfluidics game: from any web browser, you can control the setup located in our lab in Lausanne, as detailed here . In addition, we wrote a guide on the wiki to help future teams get started with these techniques.
In summary, over the summer we:
developed and characterized a new in vivo selection system based on “survival of the weakest”;
created and characterized a set of T7 promoter variants that express with different strengths;
created several TetR variants ;
created several reporter systems for the in vivo characterization of TetR;
determined the binding energy landscape of TetR and a number of TetR mutants using MITOMI;
performed experiments with and accordingly updated the BBaK112808 lysis device ;
developed and documented a cheap and easy to build microfluidic control setup for the iGEM community.

Overview
Synthetic biology is a brand new field of biological research which combines science and engineering. Since a large majority of people are quite not familiar with this promising and appealing field, we hope to promote greater public awareness of synthetic biology as well as the iGEM competition with our motivation and inspiration. To achieve this goal, we held a Synthetic Biology Workshop during this summer and autumn, including several activities listed below. In addition, we cooperated with several teams to promote the mutual rapid progress and development of synthetic biology.
iGEM 2011 China Meetup
The China Meetup this year is held in USTC(University of Science and Technology of China) on 29th to 31st July. Tsinghua team took an extraordinarily active part in the meeting.
Our team member, Guanqiao Li, attended the meetup as invited speaker and gave a splendid and impressive talk on Wisdom in Natural Systems(figure shown on the left). She described about several brilliant mechanisms of natural systems and highlighted the manipulations should be performed based on our deeper and more thorough understanding of natural systems. The wonderful speech drew forth enthusiastic applause and further heated discussion.
In addition, Tsinghua team also held a report on the progress of our project this year (figure shown on the right). As the first presenters of all the teams, we were under great stress. However, the result turned out to be great and we got highly recommend eventually, which is to our comfort. Quite a lot of students were quite curious about our project and asked detailed questions after the talk.
What’s more, we listened attentively to the talks given by senior professors and shared our opinions with other participants. In that meeting, we really learnt about the scientific frontier of synthetic biology and developed critical thinking of those projects.
Lecture on Synthetic Biology
To popularize the concept and spirit of synthetic biology, Tsinghua team held a lecture on September 23rd, which was mainly oriented to the lower grade students in School of Life Sciences, as well as all the other students who were interested in synthetic biology.
The preparation of the lecture started 3 weeks prior to the lecture. Posters (See below) were elaborately designed and posted up around the campus."
SCU_China,2017,Team:SCU China#Model#Melatonin_-_-_TEXT.html," are still some more details to                                     add                                     to the model. For instance, enzymes won’t diffuse through cell membrane, but Tryptamine, Serotonin and NAS do. Therefore, if we add some diffusion terms                                     in                                     equation (2.18) like what we did in the modeling of repressilator, maybe we                                     will                                     get some interesting results. All in all, we hope our work can be helpful in                                     relative enzyme reaction system in cells.

Article
After developing an understanding of the importance of providing greater access to information regarding synthetic biology technologies, iGEM UNSW decided to compose an article for the non-profit society, Synthetic Biology Australia (SBA). The article, which detailed the science behind and needs addressed by our project was published on the SBA website and then shared via our social media and faculty connections. Please read the article by clicking on the picture below:
The SBA society was established in 2014 to support the growing synthetic biology research field in Australia, New Zealand and the broader Australasian region. It achieves this by facilitating collaborations within its community hub, assisting academics and industry in public outreach, and providing education and training – making it the perfect channel for us to spread the word about our project.
Outcomes
Although the analytics about page viewing numbers could not be accessed, the SBA has a broad reach with over 200 participants attending their 2017 conference. This article has allowed for our team to reflect on our project development as, being written in early July, it is an example of the earliest iteration of our project. In conjunction with the description page , it shows all the learning process and changes the team has gone through in shaping the scaffold system and its proposed application. This is the result of significant wet-lab testing, mathematical modelling and human practices work all contributing to the refining of our modular and novel tool.
Presentations
Relevance
The field of synthetic biology encompasses a range of interconnected disciplines beyond molecular science and chemical engineering, which was verified at our symposium. As such, the iGEM UNSW team wanted to engage with different groups within the academic space to consider different perspectives on our project. Two members of our team gave a lecture to students in an Arts and Social Sciences class. They gave a basic overview of our scaffold’s use and the underlying science, but then focused on the ethical, legal"

Cloning
Picking of clones
3 colonies were picked each from plates 2, 3 (Part BBa_K568003 in pSB1C3) and 4, 5 (Part BBa_568002 in pSB1C3) and then inoculated in 5 ml LB Cam each. The cultures were incubated at 37°C over night for miniprep tomorrow.
Cloning of  Part BBa_K568004
To ligate the synthetic construct (cut yesterday with E, S) with T7ptag in pSB1C3, the following digestion was done:
After the digestion was completed, the sample was loaded onto a preparative 1 % agarose gel. After electrophoresis at 120 V, the correct bands were cut out on the transilluminator (365 nm, make sure UV lamp isn't switched on longer than absolutely necessary). Subsequently, the following gel photo was recorded:
pSB1C3 with T7ptag is 4743 bp long, which corresponds with the location of the cut-out band.
As a next step, the DNA was purified from the gel slice using the Promega Wizard Kit. The concentration of the product was determined to be 6 ng/µl using Nanodrop. This value is not reliable, but for lack of a second, quick way to measure the DNA concentration, the following ligation was perpared using the value nevertheless. Incubation of the Ligation occurred over night at 16 °C.
The product of yesterday's ligation was purified using glycogen-ethanol-precipitation (see methods). The product was stored at -20°C for transformation tomorrow.
Other Work
Electrocompetent cells cp919
new electrocompetent cells (cp919) were made by the following protocol: (it had to be adjusted due to circumstances)
the day before: 20 ml LB medium was inoculated with 1 µl electrocompetent DH5alpha (from the iGEM registry)
450 ml LB medium were inoculated with 4,8 ml of the overnight culture (OD600 = ""1,91"", goal for start OD600 = 0,02) and incubated at 37°C until a OD(600) of 0,58 was reached

Latest Updates
We reinforced and optimized the search database server. So, now you can get search results faster.
We added the currently available data of 2012 teams to the search database server. So you can get search results including 2012 teams.
Overview
Past project search is a search tool for past project wikis. It is a web based tool so there is no bother with platform. You merely input words that represent your interest and hit the search button. This tool searches all team wikis and abstracts throughout the years and displays the results with user-friendly UI.
Background
Until today we could not search for past projects across different years. This is unfortunate for all iGEM participants that they were not able to get knowledge about past teams easily. You had to reach team wikis using only tracks, regions, and team names from a list that does not contain any specific information about the project. Or you can search using the upper right search box on the iGEM official top page of each year. But this result depends on team projects at only one year. Using this Past Project Search, you can obtain these team information at once.
Methods
Past team wiki pages were retrieved using python scripts and Mediawiki API (http://20**.igem.org/wiki/api.php). Team information such as region, team track, abstract, and so on, was retrieved using python scripts (from https://igem.org/Team.cgi?id=***). These data were combined, converted to JSON format and stored in our own server. Regarding the search engine, open source software called ""elasticsearch"" (elasticsearch.org) was used as a backend search engine.
Results
Now, you can search for past projects across multiple years. You can narrow down search results according to track, medal, year, award and region. You can also get easy access to a team’s information from the search results page; for example their project title, project abstract, and school details. In addition, you can access past team presentation slides, video, and posters from this page, which in the past had"

Plasmid Isolation
Minipreps were performed using three colonies on each transformation plate to confirm the presence of the plasmid. One positive transformant for each BioBrick was used to make a glycerol stock.
PCRs
Our assembly begins with our PCRs: using carefully-designed primers with 5'-overhangs, we add restriction sites, linkers and other features to our parts of interest. Since most of our PCRs have such overhangs, our annealing temperature changes after the first few cycles — our PCR cycle parameters account for this variation. In addition, we used NEB's Q5 MasterMix and NEB's Phusion polymerase, both high-fidelity DNA polymerases which have a higher annealing temperature than usual.

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," just be fused to the end of EnvZ. This meant that we needed to find a binding domain that was likely to be stable, fold well and bind even when fused to another protein on both ends. Antibody fragments and molecules that mimic antibodies are often used to bind the protein biomarkers. Many families of molecules fit this description. We chose to work with Affibody molecules, an antibody mimetic first described at KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology, and further developed by Stockholm based company Affibody AB. The difference between antibody fragments and Affibody molecules in the receptor are shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Illustrations of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) and Bacterial Antigen Receptor (BAR).
Designing the chimeric receptor
Affibody molecules are stable and easy to express in bacteria. The original Affibody scaffold is based on the Z-domain of Protein A in Staphylococcus aureus. Affibody molecules are only 58 amino acids long and structured as a three-helix bundle. By randomizing 13 amino acids in two of the helices, Affibody molecules with specific binding affinity can be found. We chose to work with the Affibody molecule ZHER2:342 that binds HER2, a biomarker for certain aggressive types of breast cancer. The sequence of ZHER2:342 has been published and used in chimeric proteins by many independent researchers . Affibody molecules with affinity for different proteins are of similar structural configuration and it has been suggested that they behave in a similar way upon binding . It is then also likely that a working system with ZHER2:342 can be adapted for other biomarkers.
To find a BAR that would activate upon binding we had to find a good location to insert the ZHER2:342 into EnvZ. Since EnvZ forms homodimers in the inner membrane [3] and we wanted the function to be as similar to native EnvZ as possible, we needed to research its secondary structure. When expressed in the membrane, the N-terminus of EnvZ begins with 16 amino acids in the cytosol followed by a transmembrane helix. The following periplasmic domain is 123 amino acids long and largely uncharacterized. A second transmembrane helix then leads back into the cytosol to the signal transducing HAMP domain, followed by a histidine kinase. The structure and function of EnvZ are outlined in Figure 2.

Dimensionless process
In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, sensitivity of parameters,  feedback factors-we manipulate all the arguments and parameters to make them dimensionless.   Analysis of this part is crucial since parameters in vivo experiment may be different and   even at odds with modeling ones but a proper dimensionless can reveal the mathematical essence   of our model.
Considering the Hill equation in the simplification DDEs, A1c1 and KM1/ρ1 should be the same order of magnitude, thus KM1/ρ1 is a well measurement of quantities of A1c1. We have:
Parameters
Parameters in equations are listed below.

Sensitivity analysis
In order to find out the key parameters which will affect stability of the system at most, we need to make a sensitivity analysis on each. At first, we did brief and instinctive analyses on each parameter as follows. τ1* and τ2* represent time delay in cell 1 and cell 2 respectively, which have been discussed in part 2, have little influence on stability of system but intend to affect the oscillation period merely. Parameters a and b refer to feedback factors indirectly, which have not been discussed before, we will see how a and b affect our system later. We have clarified that parameter u is equivalent to  μ/γ, thus, u is directly decided by the dilution rate of signal molecules 3OC12HSL and 3OC6HSL in environment and will inevitably influence stability of oscillation. As for m and n, they are inseparably connected to the Hill parameters whose sensitivity have been analyzed in part 2, so we can deduce that m and n are both sensitive parameters to our system.
Here we mainly did sensitivity analyses on parameters m, n and u. Parameters were set fundamentally as Table 4 shows.
Simulation results reveal that the system can oscillate stably only when u<5.3(fixed the other two sensitive parameters), 11.9
34.4. In other words, to ensure the stability of oscillation,"

Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [19]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields. [18]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [19, 20].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed  to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we are working on market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions will be possible to implement.
Our Outreach Mission:
For the future of iGEM
We plan on making our project useful for future iGEM projects by producing informative media for iGEM teams.  We plan to provide a Youtube channel explaining scientific concepts, have lectures at local schools and have a public forum discussion in order to better educate the public on what exactly GMOs are! We also plan to publish a booklet outlining how to avoid burnout, and the effects it has on the biotechnology industry.
Collaborations
We are stronger together so when possible we are striving for collaboration with other iGEM teams. So far we are in contact with the teams of Aalto Helsinki, National University of Singapore (NUS), Lund Technical University (LTU), the team of Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) and with all other nordic teams at social events and channels. Besides collaboration with teams we also keep a close collaboration with Vidilab, a veterinary diagnostic company.
Vidilab
Besides collaborating with other teams, iGEM Uppsala 2018 has a very close collaboration with Vidilab, a company that works with the current veterinary diagnostic tools. They are offering us usage of parts of their lab and equipment during the summer and potentially during the fall. With Vidilab’s help we have also had the opportunity to collect tissue samples and feces samples for our research.

I also experimented with the manipulation of avatars:
Skins, which are skins worn over the avatars shaped in world by the sliders, are made in any raster based image editor capable of producing .tga files, Photoshop, Paintshop Pro, GIMP being the big ones. The skins are then uploaded and worn. Using sculpted prims (sculpties) seems to be the most promising and flexible method to manipulate an avatar’s look. I also had to do a survey to obtain $150 LD.

More building in Second Life
While waiting for us to get the ability to script/build on our island, we continued in Kings Bishop. We played with a 'door' script in order to make fridges, waterbaths, and other equipment with the ability to be opened, making them more realistic. Also, with our idea to make floating spheres that people could do the biobrick simulator in, I started learning the scripts for teleportation in order for people to get in to the spheres. Also built these spheres.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," time depend on the point during a bacteria lifecycle when inoculation begins. One research study conducted by Zachary Storms and Tobin Brown shows how the burst size—the squares, and the lysis time—the circles, vary with when the infection starts. Storms and Brown suggest that the burst size is the highest and the lysis time is the shortest if the infection starts when the bacteria cell enters the division stage, because at that point the cell has the richest intracellular resources.
Figure 1. Graph showing experimental evidence of correlation between phage burst size and lysis time and the time during a bacterial cell lifecycle at which inoculation begins.
4. Bacteria doubling time: the time it takes a bacteria population to double in size.
Equations:
Results and Interpretation:
The following graphs are constructed with an initial bacteria population of 1,000 and an initial phage population calculated according to the MOI used. However, the actual numbers of bacteria and phages do not influence the trends observed in the graph, as it is the ratio between these numbers (the MOI), not the actual numbers, that matters.
Figure 2a. MOI = 1. Bacteria population is quickly overwhelmed and exterminated around 60 minutes after inoculation. Without viable hosts, the phage population dies shortly afterwards.
Figure 2b. MOI = 0.01. Bacteria population first increases in number, but then, with an abundance of susceptible bacteria, the number of phages increase drastically and eventually overwhelms the bacteria population. Both populations reach zero within 160 minutes.
Figure 2c. MOI = 0.0001. With a small MOI, the bacteria population is still eventually exterminated, just over a longer period. As usual, the phage population dies shortly after all bacterial host disappears.
Discussion:
Although this model clearly shows the influence of the initial MOI on the bacteria/phage dynamics, it suggests that even with a very small MOI, the bacteria and phage populations always become extinct. This is not realistic because in many real-world instances, bacteria and phages co-exist. We realized that the problem with this model is that it treats time as a discrete variable. In discrete time, phages reproduce much faster than bacteria so that the bacteria population is wiped out regardless of the initial values. Hence, we proceeded with a different approach, treating time as continuous.
CONTINUOUS TIME MODEL
Purpose: Given initial populations of bacteria and phages (and hence an MOI), understand how the populations interact and change over continuous time.

Along with using new parts registry standards we     will be improving the algorithm, so that the software can search through     more complex relations and returns all possible functional constructs.
Project Introduction
As the field of Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM is growing     up very fast and the number of parts in the parts registry is increasing     with the addition of more complex parts each day. After facing some     difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry, the need     for more effective standardization of parts entry was apparent. We have     investigated the information on parts in iGEM’s 2010 distribution and     reorganized the information on the parts registry forms according to     the needs of our algorithm. Then we have used graph theoretic modeling     to visualize the relations between iGEM Parts and to standardize the     representation of the parts as much as possible by graph theoretical     methods. This helped us to find input output relations between the parts.     Furthermore, our program BioGuide is now able to provide alternative     pathways to construct the most reliable and functional Biobrick devices     with respect to given inputs and expected outputs as a guide to Biobricks     parts registry.
