Product and operational related risks
There is a risk that we may not actually be able to deliver the product to the market within the resources (time, money) that we have available. Furthermore, there is always the risk that our product may not work exactly as well as promised or envisioned. It is for example possible that some technical challenges may be greater than initially assumed. We try to minimize the consequences of these risks by doing solid theoretical research and by building prototypes in an early stage. This will limit eventually the extra time that is required.
Unforeseen scale-up problems are also a risk that we have to take into account. For example, it appears that bacteria sometimes react differently in a large reactor than in a small variant. When such an incident happens, this can have a major influence on the total investment. Therefore, it is important to minimize the probability of occurrence. We will talk with experts in this field in an early stadium of the development. Furthermore, we believe that making prototypes is very important to minimize this risk. Finally, we think it is wisely to use mathematical models and literature for this. This all should make it unlikely to have scale-up problems.
It is also possible that there are no qualified employees available. However, we think it is very unlikely this is the case and otherwise we think it is relatively easy to educate the new employees. After all, we have a new product, but we are operating in already existing industries with well-educated employees.
For some companies supply problems of raw material can be a major problem. We expect that this is not the case for our company, because we do not use very limited available and very specific materials. Therefore, we are not dependent on one specific supplier. It is likely that sometimes suppliers are not able to supply on time because of supply problems or because they are bankrupt, but the consequences are considered to be insignificant because there are always alternative suppliers.

Market size
First we will focus on the Dutch and German market. The total market size of both markets is equal to 36.5 GW. Based on the governmental goals, the market size has to grow to 74 GW in the year 2020. This means that the growth potential is equal to 37,5 GW. Currently there are 81 solar panel manufactures in Germany, which have in total around 50% of the market share of both countries (""Solar Panel Manufacturers,"" 2016; Wirth, 2016) .
Based on these data, we have estimated the potential market size. We believe that there is a potential market"

KoreaSonyeodul,2016,Team:KoreaSonyeodul#Public Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," in September 3rd. Two of our team members made the lecture, mainly introducing the mechanism of mealworm decomposing plastic. We showed and explained the mechanism of mealworms’ digesting polystyrene. In addition, we offered the students the opportunity to touch and observe meal-worms.
RAISING AWARENESS CAMPAIGN
The first thing that came to our team’s mind after pondering about how we should apply our project to the real world was campaign. The idea of our campaign was simple: ""to make people become aware of the situation."" Our team designed two steps to further elaborate the plan. Regarding that we all lived in dormitory, the sphere of activity was confined to our school. The first plan required participation of our school’s students. For three trash baskets in our school, we indicated a different basket only for plastic. After two weeks, our teammates gathered every plastic basket that we put and sorted the trash just in case there were wastes other than plastic. The image below is the how the waste baskets looked when we put it together.
After we were done sorting, we packed plastics for our next step.
The next step was the crux of our campaign. For our project of IGEM fundamentally aimed for seeking ways to save the environment, we designed our next step to appeal to many students as possible of our project. We believed environment was something that all people should be concerned with. Our team created posters that showed the dire situation of ocean wastes such as Great Pacific Garbage Patch. To visualize, we placed the plastics that we gathered on an open space of our school. Students were able to see what we were doing and our team explained to the students of our project.
The first campaign was successful in starting our project with participation of many students. We believe the essence of was in making people aware of the situation. Our team hopes this campaign will be a starting point for contributing further to any environmental activities.
RCNP EXHIBITION
Our team made a poster about our project to introduce it to students in Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies on July. RCNP is one of our school’s curriculum where students can participate in presenting their research on any topic they preferred. We exhibited our work in the main hallway of the school so that various school members including Humanities and Natural Science course students could see it. Our poster contained information about mealworms, bacterias inside of mealworms, and activities of what we did(campaigns, mini forums, visiting Korea University). The poster we created is shown below.

The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models to simulate and predict the process of biological systems. Our team established two models simulating the process of sweeteners binding on T1R2-T1R3 receptor and the process of sweeteners signal transduction in GPCR pathway. After that we designed and improved our biological systems based on the simulation results.
We developed our models for the following four main purposes:
1. Simulate different sweeteners how to bind on receptors.
2. Build a structural model to provide us with a solution for retrofitting and designing Gα.
3. The establishment of the GPCR signal transduction model gives us a better understanding of the sweetness signal in our system.
4. Simulate the relationship between sweetness signal and RFP fluorescence intensity and define the relationship between sweetness and fluorescence intensity.
Our structural model used the method of homology modeling on the SWISS MODEL server and then used AutoDock for molecular docking. The GPCR model was established by the reaction kinetics equation (RKE) of each signal transduction process. We used MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we obtained the relationship between sweetener concentration and fluorescence intensity of our biological system.
System Overview
Our goal is to detect the sweetness of the sweeteners by retrofitting the GPCR signal transduction pathway in yeast (Cen.PK-1C).
The structure of TIR2-T1R3 (Picture from：Molecular mechanism of sweetness sensation)
In order to make the signal more accurate and reliable, we established T1R2-T1R3 receptor structure model and took aspartame, glycyrrhizic acid, stevioside and so on with its docking. And we got the binding sites of different sweeteners with T1R2-T1R3 receptor.
The design of sugar hunter
As you can see, this is a simple line model for our biological systems. We can divide it into four modules: the T1R2-T1R3 receptor module, the nucleotide exchange reaction module, the MAPK kinase module, and the RFP expression module.

A couple of notes about our linearizations:
We need to clean up our restriction digests, especially the linearizations, using a PCR purification kit.  The problem is not so much the enzymes themselves as it is the components that go into the restriction digest (such as BSA).
Adrian suggested that we use a specific, well-characterized concentration of linearized DNA for our transformations.  He also explained why we should actually run a serial dilution on one of our transformations in order to determine the transformation efficiency.  This is how we can calculate it:
1) we know the amount of linearized DNA (in ng) that we add to a known number of cells (estimated from an OD measurement right after the 4 hr incubation)
2) we know the volume of cells that we distribute onto each plate
3) if we make serial dilutions (say, 100x dilution for each dilution) and plate the results on separate plates, we can observe how many
We should also run another gel on our PCr products just to make sure that we did not get pTEF.  We should only run the gel for"

When the input signal is present, it will induce the expression of part A, which will upregulate the part B a lot. In this way, the output will be strongly expressed. But the upregulation of part B would cause the expression of pT181 attenuator, which will repress the part A. And this will cause the low expression of part A and indirect low expression of part B. Although the remains in the environment would keep the amount of output, the low quantity of each part of the system will prepare it for any change from the input signal. In this case, the output of the system would response to the change of the input in a very short time. This can also eliminate the possible superposition between outputs from different input signals.
We used our model to predict whether the high repression effect of pT181 attenuator will cause the silence of the output, as it may cause the silence of part A. However, our model shows that the output will respond to the input perfectly, which support our experiment a lot.
In conclusion, the presence of pT181 attenuator will reduce leak of our system at utmost, as well as allow it to rapidly respond to the changing signal.

We generated two plasmids, one is for experimental group, the other is for a positive control. The experimental plasmid, which is the pT181 attenuator in this experience, contains the antisense sequence downstream of a constitutive promoter and followed by a double terminator on a high-copy plasmid. Meanwhile, there are also a GFP gene with a ribosome binding site downstream of the pT181 attenuator sense target sequence. The GFP coding sequence is also downstream of a constitutive promoter and followed by a double terminator.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," morning. Some golden rules of sterile technique: Always wipe down the lab bench with 70% ethanol before beginning; work as close to the flame as possible, as it creates a sterile “bubble”; and get into and out of pipette tip boxes as quickly as possible to keep them sterile. The autoclaving of new pipette tips and water was also used for demonstration purposes. Afternoon work consisted of continued definition of desired assays and design of nanowire genes.
THURSDAY, MAY 26
The creation of ready-to-use plates was the focus of lab work on Thursday. Interns followed an existing protocol to make plain LB agar, LB agar with ampicillin, and LB broth, culminating in the pouring and storing of too many plates to count. Caleigh, Sean, Suraj, and Paige took a field trip to the West Lafayette Waste Management facility to speak with Sara Peel of the Wabash River Enhancement Corporation (WREC) and Angela Andrews of the City of Lafayette Water Pollution Control. It was discovered that the facility is newly permitted for phosphorus removal; however, a chemical method as opposed to a biological one will be implemented August 1 for both political and financial reasons. The up-front cost for chemical treatment was less than for biological treatment, which made it the optimal choice for the time being, but the facility plans to switch to biological treatment as soon as it has the funds to do so, as this will be more cost-effective longterm. The team plans to return to the plant sometime in July to receive a full tour and collect wastewater samples to be used for testing.
FRIDAY, MAY 27
Brainstorming for both background content for the official iGEM project wiki and a project timeline were completed in addition to an establishment of a protocol for completing lab notebooks. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt Chart were constructed to record timeline information. Practice transformations of GFP and RFP kit plate parts were completed by the interns throughout the day. The conclusion of a successful first week!

Memorial Day was an optional day on the job, but the dedicated iGEM team put in an afternoon of work in Bindley. Practice transformations were successful–both GFP and RFP were apparently expressed, and growth on control plates was as expected. Practice minipreps were next on the agenda, which the interns also completed successfully in addition to some supply inventory.

We ran our PCR product on a gel - this was the product of the PCR reaction with the new, correct, CRO primers. Despite this, our gel showed one, thick band at the bottom of the gel, but no 300 base pair band. We streaked out TT9901 and TT9907 and TT25281 fresh from the stabs to use as template on our next attempt, and Dr. Grose is going to do it with us.

KK, KP Dr. Grose helped us prepare PCR again. We're running PCR with both a negative control AND a positive control - a template and primers that Dr. Grose proved yesterday work. We changed to annealing temperature to 69 C on our phusion program and we added DMSO, which we had never added before. DMSO helps to separate G-C rich sequences. We're learning to anticipate the lab work we'll need to do in the future. Today we also made the gel with which we'll check our products on Wednesday, and we purified 100 microL of the  plasmid pIG12 at a concentration of 116 ng/microL. This is the plasmid into which we'll be cloning CRO.

To choose the best droplet merging parameters we relied on fluid mathematical modeling  ( click here for the model ). The output the constructed model predicted, that the most suitable droplet volume ratios for the electrocoalescence should lie in the range of 1:3 to 1:5. Based on the fact, that droplets in which biomolecule are synthesised using in vitro transcription and translation reactions are 10 pL we choose the MDA amplification droplets to be 40 pL. Movie 4 displays the droplet merging we achieved after optimizing the parameters
Movie 4. Optimized droplet merging
Movie 5 displays the generation of 40 pL droplets containing the multiple displacement reaction mix and the reinfusion of previously generated 10 pL droplets. Droplet merging occurs at the junction between two electrodes. The amplification droplets are 1.25x times more concentrated, because the reaction mixture dilutes 4 times after droplet fusion: 10 pL + 40 pL = 50 pL. The videos below show, that we achieved near perfect droplet merging without disrupting the compartmentalization or stability of the fused droplets.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Moreover, to enable characterisation of the fiber, we flanked the C-terminus of the sequence with the N-terminus of the AceL-TerL intein which would splice out when associated with its compatible counterpart.
The assembly of this construct can be carried out through Gibson assembly or Golden Gate into our BioBrick2.0 construct to standardise it for Bobrick assembly. Finally, the fibre can also be modified to test different properties through assembly of additional repetitive regions into the core of the sequence. This is made possible by our SapI overhangs which are compatible with the ones on our Spidroin Core construct.
Intein Passenger
Overview of Intein Passenger
The intein passenger construct is the framework used to insert functional proteins into our highly modular platform. The design of the Biobrick allows it to flank any protein with inteins and, therefore, to functionalise biomaterials with a high degree of freedom. Design notes:
Intein
The choice of intein is important because we need to leave as small a fragment as possible at the sister construct.  We picked the AceL-TerL intein (DOI 10.1002/anie.201307969) since its C-terminal section is 125 amino acids long and the N-terminal section only 11.
Reporter
mScarlet was chosen as it is one of the brightest RFPs available and it is a fast folder.
Golden Gate Set-Up
To make it compatible with the Golden Gate assembly approach incorporated in the BioBrick2.0, we decided to use SapI. The chosen design allows the lowest impact on the linker sequence. An advantage of using SapI is that any downstream design will be simpler by maintaining the overhang in frame. SapI sites were coded as GRA and SSS. It uses GGC (upstream) and GAG (downstream) overhangs.
Promoter
We needed high-level expression but too much expression would make  the spider silk insoluble, so we used a T7 promote with a middle of the road RBS. This is based on part BBa_K525998 (T7 promoter and RBS).
Terminator
The BBa_B1006 terminator was chosen because of its termination probability above 90%  and the many reported cases.
Additional regulation
We picked a lac operator for improved silencing"

Summary
EB (Esp as extracted from the S. epidermidids genome) is one of our combat proteins targeting biofilm formation and prevents eDNA exudation. By expressing and attaching it to our spider silk, in combination with the other combat proteins, we hope to combat both biofilm and virulence in chronic wounds.

Results
Assembling a construct for recombinant expression of EB
By using 3A Assembly, the construct to produce recombinant Esp was assembled. The components used for this experiment were the T7-promoter (BBa_K525998), the coding sequence for EB (BBa_K531003) and a backbone, in this case pSB1K3. To obtain the final ligation product a classic 3A assembly was performed.
Digestion [✔️]
In this experiment double digestion was performed on the BioBricks T7 and Esp to prepare these samples for ligation. Also single digestions were performed to investigate the restriction enzymes functionality.
Both single and double digestions were considered successful except for the empty wells with T7 PCR products and an unspecific band, in well 9, for the T7 plasmid. However, it is hard to evaluate the results for the double digestion of the T7 plasmid since the expected size of 55 bp is too small to be visualised on a common gel. Since the longer fragments that this digestion generates were clearly visible, double digestion of the T7 plasmid was assumed to be successful. The next step was planned to ligate the digested fragments together into an appropriate backbone.

Week 1
(1st - 7th August)
Firstly, the gene ChlH was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated with the gene pLac which was digested with SpeI and PstI.  This resulted in the newly formed bio-brick pLac-ChlH. Addition of the lac promoter allowed us to control the expression of the ChlH gene in our composite parts through the introduction of IPTG in the growth media.
Following this, the pre-existing bio-brick pLac-ChlI-ChlD-GUN4 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated with ChlI2 which was digested with SpeI and PstI.
The resulting operon was then transformed into DH5 strains of E.coli . The plasmids were isolated from the transformant colonies, and PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed to verify the presence of each gene on the operon.
Fig 1. A lac promoter (pLac – 200bp) was incorporated into the front of CHLH (400bp), and a digest of the two genes was run on a gel. Lane 3 shows a shorter gene sequence and was excluded. Lanes 4-10 show the correct gene size for the pLac+ChlH gene and were used for sequencing.

The pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector was stored in our laboratory plasmid library, and two types of the target sequences (perfectly complementary or not, abbreviated as p and np) of miR-654 were provided by team NUDT_CHINA.
The target sites (each includes eight repeats of the target sequence) were synthesized and inserted into pmirGLO Vector respectively through enzyme digestion and ligation. Then a dual-luciferase miRNA target expression plasmid was constructed.
After that, the purified plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells to test their functions. Twenty-four hours after transfection with the plasmids, cells were analyzed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Beyotime, RG027) and a Thermo Scientific™ Fluoroskan Ascent™ FL. Normalized firefly luciferase activity (firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity) for each construct was compared to that of the pmirGLO Vector no-insert control. For each transfection, luciferase activity was averaged from three replicates.

The E.coli have been happily amplifying the chromoprotein plasmids (although only the aeBlue ones seemed to bother expressing any themselves as they have a bacterial promoter) and are chilling in the fridge over the weekend ready to be overnight cultured and lysed to give us a Summer's worth of chromoprotein gene DNA to play with.
I ran my first PCR with Miha to amplify up fragments for the chromoprotein constructs - we're trying five different colours, all of which we're nuclear localising and two of which we are trying unlocalised as well.
After running on a gel, the PCR had worked its magic perfectly on all but track 3... The template used apparently had several kb of stuff inserted between the two primer sites that I was unaware of and therefore did not work at all, whoops. Upon trying again with a new primer that only copied the N7 localisation sequence to Gibson in later, when I came down at the finish time it emerged that the PCR cycles were only 10% done. Lessons learnt - don't get minutes and seconds mixed up when reprogramming a PCR cycler. I stayed late refixing my mistake today :)
Excitingly, a lab in Tokyo that ran a mutant screen on a benzalacetone reductase from Rheum Palmatum (Chinese rhubarb) and found that the S338V mutant is twice as efficient as the wild type enzyme has agreed to send us DNA for both the wild type and the mutant. I'm excitedly awaiting a package of DNA from Japan.

Experiments and results
I-SceI is expressed and active in eliminating restriction-site harbouring plasmid
To measure the digestion efficiency of I-SceI, we transformed two plasmids with different antibiotic resistances into NEB Turbo E.Coli strain:
First plasmid: Low copy plasmid with encoded generator to express I-SceI meganucllease. Three version with different promoters was tested: I-SceI meganuclease controlled by pBad, pLac and pRha. For all version:
Backbone: pSB3C5
Resistance: Chloramphenicol
Origin of Replication: p15a
Second plasmid: High copy plasmid with encoded I-SceI restriction site, K175027 . This biobrick was a kind gift of the TUDelft iGEM team which we further characterized.
Backbone: pSB1AK3
Resistance: Ampicillin and Kanamycin
Origin of Replication: modified pMB1 derived from pUC19
We expected to perform transformation with both plasmids, and plate with two antibiotics in order to select for double transformants. We would then induce I-SceI expression in those clones to measure  its efficiency.
Transformation results
From the experiment we can clearly see that on plates with two antibiotics (Chloramphenicol,  Cm; & Ampicillin, Amp) there are no colonies, while on plates with only one antibiotic Cm or Amp there are numerous colonies.
The first combination of plasmids:
First plasmid: pBad & RBS & I-SceI [Cm]
Second plasmid: I-SceI restriction site [Amp]
Selection: Cm
Selection: Amp
Selection: Cm & Amp
The second combination of plasmids:
First plasmid: pLac & RBS & I-SceI [Cm]
Second plasmid: I-SceI restriction site [Amp]

The third combination of plasmids:

We suggested two hypotheses to explain the results:

Another is that the 20 uM solution for our primers could not contain any primer after all, remembering the issue about forgetting to vortex the 500 uM solution after adding water initially.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Using above-mentioned differential equations, we simulated behavior of the counter by Euler's method.
Parameter
Here, we explain how we determined the parameters of the deterministic model. PoPS (polymerase per second) of PConst is 0.03[3], so its promoter activity is 0.03/(6.0× 1023× 1.0× 10-15)[M/sec] = 0.051[nM/sec]. The switch point and the hill coefficient of PBAD are written in [4]. PoPS of PBAD is 5/60[5] , so its RPU (relative promoter unit) is (5/60)/(0.03) = 2.78. We set the RPU of Plac as 2 when IPTG is induced. We don't consider the leak expression from Plac.
The average half life of mRNA is 2-5 min[1], so we set the degradation rate of mRNA as 0.010[/sec]. The half life of GFP is infinite[9], so we set the degradation of GFP as 0.0[/sec]. The degradation rate of sigma factor[20] is fast. We set it as 0.001[/sec]. The degradation rate of anti-sigma is unknown, We set it as 6.0× 10-6, the average degradation rate of protein[11]. The equilibrium constant of the equations (1)is 80.0[nM][2]. The reaction rate of the association of sigma and anti-sigma is unknown. We assumed this reaction is fast and we set it as 10.0[/M sec]. The copy number of the plasmid is 100~300[7][8] , so we set as 200. When the number of lacZ mRNA is 62, the protein synthesis rate is 20[/sec][11], and we set the translational rate as 20/62 = 0.32, assuming it does not change from the kind of mRNA.
The summary of the parameters of this model is given in Table 1.

Integrated Human Practices
Based on the interview results, we have a better understanding of the potential challenges in building such kill switch and the importance of having kill switches for different synbio applications. From this understanding, we integrate the knowledge gained by proposing building a framework to make engineering customized kill switch easier.
Quick Link -> Gold
Improve a previous part or project
Improved the BBa_K116404 phosphate sensor-GFP reporter constructed by NYMU Taipei in 2008. By replacing the weaker RBS BBA_B0032 with a stronger RBS BBa_B0034, the new promoter is more sensitive to phosphate concentration with a higher expression level.
Quick Link -> Improvement
Modelling
We have carried out extensive modelling to design the kill switch for probiotics in silico. We built mathematical models of two kill switch designs (one generated by CELLO and one designed by the team) using ODEs. The performance of kill switch designs was evaluated based on the following criteria: number of parts required in a design, metabolic burden on cell, and response/lag time using ADVANCESYN Studio (a design and modeling software). We ran a number of simulations, what-if studies and sensitivity analysis, and identified the sensitive components in the circuit. Results showed that the kill switch design by the team has faster response and lower metabolic burden. Hence, we proceeded to perform experiments with this design. Apart from the kill switch design for probiotics, we also modelled and studied the blue light–pH NAND gate kill switch for BeeT bacteria from team Wageningen_UR iGEM 2016 using the methodology.
Quick Link -> Model
Demonstration
We have successfully completed the following tasks:
Constructed the temperature-sensitive system with GFP reporter (BBa_K2447014）.
Use modelling to facilitate the design of kill switch.
Constructed the improved version of the extracellular phosphate sensor with GFP reporter (BBa_K2447000).
Constructed the blue light activated inducible system with RFP reporter (BBa_K2447501)
Successfully demonstrated that our proposed standardized methodology for designing kill switches was feasible
Successfully constructed the plasmid that expressed IM2 protein (anti-toxin)"

15/08/2011 - Team Amsterdam among favourites
Team Amsterdam has been pointed out as one of the teams to keep your eye on during the competition by Christian Lund, a medicine student from Denmark. He participated in last year's iGEM competition, and is now following the different teams.
Lund wrote a previous blog about the teams of Cambridge and Bielefeld , but in his latest blog he wrote solely about the Amsterdam team. He called the project very ambitious and impressive. “The project has the wow-factor; imagine E. coli growing at freezing temperatures, that’s impressive!” Although the project has already partly been done, the team has a new and exciting approach. Using the results of previous teams and elaborate those results is following the iGEM spirit. “Some guys have created bacteria that can grow at low temperatures; let’s drop the temperature another couple to degrees to freezing!” Read the full article here .
The expectations for the Amsterdam team are high and the competition is enormous, but the team is confident about the project and is looking forward to the jamboree.

LuxR forms a complex with AHL that inhibits the subpopulation system, where 434 cl and λ cl are under the same promoter. This leads to either GFP production,  or RFP production depending on the same strength of quorum sensing.
Based on the modeling we hypothesized the following: when there are more cells present in the system, more AHL-LuxR complex is formed. The complex inhibits the subpopulation promoter.  When the promoter is inhibited production of 434 cI will be suppressed and production of λ cl will be activated. At a certain time point λ cl takes control over the system, because 434 cI has a higher turnover rate than λ cl.  In this case more λ cl results in more RFP.
In a later stage, to get the desired response, the quorum sensing system and the subpopulation system were combined. As shown in Figure 8, you can see how we intend to generate different cell populations. With this extended network we try to generate a model which predicts the behavior of the subpopulations. In Figure 9 you can see the increasing RFP over time after many cell divisions, indicating an increasing cell population.
Figure 9. Volume oscillations correspond to the dividing cells. Together they form a growing cell population. On the left y-axis you see the RFP, and on the right y-axis you see the volume. The x-axis is the time. The total amount of RFP produced by the toxin is shown by the red line.
Methods
During the research Matlab version R2016a has been used.
Because there was no data from the wet lab we assumed that all parameters exist within a biologically reasonable range between zero and one. For the analyses we used 100,000 parameter sets, 10 cells, random initial conditions between zero and one and 60 timesteps. Tuneable parameters are used, each parameter set can produce dramatically different population dynamics. To determine which of these parameters produce the best system response we used Latin HypercubeLatin hypercube sampling is a statistical method to sample the parameter space equally. It divides the parameter space according to the number of parameters and sample size and picks a random number from each parameter subspace. sampling.
With the Latin Hypercube sampling we made parameter sets that are obtained from a lognormal distribution a lognormal distribution assigns probabilities to all positive values. However the distributions is skewed to favour smaller values. Biological reaction rates have been found to follow this distribution 8 with a parameter estimation based on Raue et al 7 . In Figure 10"

Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.

At the same time we want to encourage you to become more resource-efficient through optimal allocation of scarce material. We would like to show new application for mechanism design (engineering part of the economics) and the stable matching algorithm allowing to better resource-management addressing the needs of the patients. We also aim to provide a contribution to the processing of medical data and open source science in the era of big data in medicine. Here, we see new application for Celulare, (and in futher perspective iGEM itself) to finally bring idea of transform healthcare with synthetic biology.

Video game
This year, as we continue our HP long term strategy, we developed an educational computer game. We are willing to use it to popularize synthetic biology term and our CeLuLa-Re project. The game was written in HTML5 using Construct2 software. Here you will find a link to an external server
The game is actually a demo as we plan to develop it. We believe we can reach and attract many people as the game is funny and everybody learns best, while playing. Here is a short film showing gameplay
The game consists of 3 platform levels and 2 quizzes about our project. At the beginning the two levels are locked as the player proceeds after collecting particular amount of lanthanides ions. You can especially earn a lot of them by giving correct answers in quiz. Platform levels are full of arcade challenges such as deadly spikes or enemies making it hard to reach ions. Both quizzes consist of 10 questions about synthetic biology, rare earths elements, our wet lab and HP part. All the correct answers can be found on our Wiki and on the official iGEM webpage. The main hero is a genetically engineered bacteria which wants to return home. Its space ship was destroyed due to collision with space rubbish. Now the bacteria searches a dangerous and unknown land for lacking lanthanides ions to build a laser to clear the planet's atmosphere and repair its space ship so it can safely return home.
Well, that is the demo. We have loads of other ideas to expand the game such as gaining super powers by hero when obtaining special BioBrick, different types of enemies and obstacles, new levels and of course we plan on adding more educational value. We are planning to create a book of knowledge and make a drag&drop task to teach cloning in BioBrick standard. We are inviting you to play"

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"From the reaction network We can extract follow equation sets From the reaction network:
 
 
 
 
Assumptions
1. When genes transcript and translate downward, the mRNA can bind with ribosome and then start translation subsequently, which can insure a constant amount during the whole process. Therefore, we use steady-state approximation on mRNA and mRNA-rib.
2. Because there is some acid buffer in the cell to transfer the produced lactate out of cell, pH will have a rather small influence on enzyme activity. Therefore, we assume that all enzymes activity are not affected by acid concentration, the rate constant keeps unchanged.
3. Concentration of protein will eventually keep constant, which is because expressed protein can have a negative effect on gene expression in return. Thus we assume that the concentration of rcfB protein is constant, and its magnitude is determined by the strength of the promoter upstream.
Equation Establishment
Genetic regulation circuit is shown in Figure 10. When rcfB protein is activated by lactic acid, it can bind to P170 and make it sensitive to RNA polymerase.
 
(24)
 
(25)
where KLa and K are constants and n is Hill coefficient The acP170 is the activated state, the P170 can be activated in two ways. One is to bind with the lactic acid dimerization and RcfB which can make it easy to be activated. Another one, we assume that a   of P170 can be activated directly. Both the binding and unbinding P170 can be promoted while they have different rate constant.
We conclude that:
 
(26)
 
(27)
According to the equation above, we can consolidate that:
 
(28)
Where km1 and km2 are integration parameters.
Next, by using law of mass action and steady state solution, we deduce the equation below.
 
(29)
 
(30)
Where the concentration of mRNA and mRNA-rib satisfies:
 
(31)
 
(32)
In the end, the concentration of RFP and the fluorescence can be written as:
 
(33)
 
(34)
Thus we construct the connection between fluorescence and lactic acid, from which we can know the concentration of lactic acid through the system.
Simulation Results
We set km1 =10 and use promoter J23100, then we get the following result
Figure 11. The result shows how P170,mRNA,mRNA-rib,fluorescence change with the lactic acid.
Fine tuning
From the equation, we can predict that:
1. the integration parameter km1 can characterize the relative level of leakage.

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Why Colonize Mars_-_-_TEXT.html," brainstorming sessions
Brainstorming was a big part of our first Skype meetings, and because of our early start, our discussions managed to shape parts of each others Human Practice projects.  We especially discussed how unusual it was for space related igem teams to question space travel ethically, even though there are lots of obvious questions to ask. We decided that we would like to explore the questions further and found especially the history of colonization and the moon landing, the arguments for and against Mars colonization and the ethics of colonization interesting and worthy of further exploration. We continuously met online and discussed what we had found for most of the summer months, and then began writing by the end of August.
The report
Our report on Mars colonization focuses on the reasons for colonization and the bioethics of humans potentially contaminating Mars. It analysis the reasons for colonization from a historical and a rhetorical perspective, and discusses the potential risk of contamination from a bioethical perspective. While the historical analysis is focused on analyzing reasons for the first moon landing and motivations for colonization of land on earth, the rhetorical analysis is focused upon analysing main arguments for and against Mars colonization in the public debate. The Bioethical discussion is concerned with the potential risk of contamination of Mars.
In the historical analysis of comparable events it is concluded that:
The major historical reasons for exploration of space and colonization of land on earth has been demonstration of power and eagerness to explore new land
Support from the public seems to play an important role in motivating such decisions
In the rhetorical analysis of argumentation in the public debate it is concluded that:
There are major arguments against colonizing Mars right now, that the average world citizen is likely to take into consideration. Therefore we find it unlikely that the wish to colonize Mars will gain significant public support right now
In the future, as technology improves and the realisation of colonizing Mars moves closer, and the current mayor problems for humanity hopefully takes an end the topic might gain more public interest and awake stronger opinions and more engagement from the public
In the bioethical discussion of potential risk of contamination it is concluded that:
The risk is rather small due to extensive sterilization procedures and that it is considered unlikely that any bacteria coming from humans would be able to survive in a martian environment and thereby contaminate Mars

This week had a major focus on completing the Interlab study (Adrianna, Winonah, Jocelyn, Ali, Adrianna, Indi, Ed and Thi were involved).
Transformations and overnight cultures were completed in time for the big day of data collection on Thursday which included the Interlab fluorescence measurement of plates.
We started early on the interlab task, first we made fresh cell cultures from the cells that had been incubating over night. Then we started with the absorbance measurements. We then made our time 0 samples, put the new cell cultures in the incubating shaker and left for 2 hours.
During the 2 hour period the serial dilution plate was set up.
Towards the end of interlab day, Team Member numbers were dwindling so Ed and Thi assisted with some pipetting to ensure we would be able to obtain spectrometer readings that day.

Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical                         ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.
……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their                         body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our                         country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply                         restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to                         UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution.
Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we                         need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects                         need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial                         production.
Q: Thank you for your suggestions.
Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?
A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs                         to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require                         three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or                         substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during                         the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of                         production overweights its potential profits.

On the other hand, we were able to determine that our senders were working as co-culture with all senders resulted in noticeable increases in fluorescence for Lux Receiver I. The relatively high activation due to the Rhl sender-Lux Receiver I pairing may be attributed to cross-talk.
Comments:
3 samples were prepared for each set of conditions (sender-receiver pairing or AHL concentration-receiver pairing). This was done in order to obtain averages for more accurate results. However it was observed that the 3 measurement values for each set of condition often showed great deviation from each other. This can be attributed to both human error and instrumental error, both of which were likely amplified by the small volume of sample used.
Therefore, this experiment is not recommended for quantitative characterization of sensor parts. It does serve, to a limited extent, as a qualitative evaluation of which pairings work and which don't, which enabled us to determine which of our devices were actually able to function as planned.
Methods
Sensor Experiment 1: Receivers vs AHL
Day 1 - Preparation
1. From transformation plate, pick up a small quantity of cells from a colony using sterilized toothpick and streak on LA plate with the appropriate antibiotic resistance. Incubate at 37 degrees Celsius for 8+ hr.
2. From the streak plate, choose a single-cell colony and pick up cells using sterilized toothpick, then inoculate 5ml LB culture medium to which the appropriate antibiotic resistance (50mg/l) has been added. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees Celsius in a shaking incubator.
Day 2 - Measurement
1. Transfer 1ml of the overnight culture into 30ml fresh LB culture medium. Incubate in shaking incubator at 37 degrees.
2. Measure OD of culture every hour or so, until OD reaches fixed value (culture at full growth).
3. Transfer culture into 50ml ultracentrifuge tube and spin at 8000rpm for 5 minutes.
4. Resuspend pellet with 30ml fresh LB culture.
5. Incubate culture in shaking incubator at 30 degree Celcius for 10 minutes.
6. Transfer 1ml of culture into microcentrifuge tube and put on ice. Immediately add AHL to rest of culture to attain desired concentration. (Note: Between the steps detailed below, samples should be kept on ice to minimize cellular activity.)
7. Obtain OD600 of 2x diluted sample by transferring "
Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Finance_-_-_TEXT.html,"  This was also inspired by our milestones timeline whereby we expect to have a product ready for the market by 2016.
This makes several assumptions listed below:
Salaries were determined based upon the need of attracting new talent to our business, as described in the operations section of the business plan. Additionally, we accounted for inflation throughout the years.
Equipment funds assume government grants will reduce the overall cost of the equipment components. 2014 electrochemical equipment expenses are higher than other years as they account for the purchase of a potentiostat. Subsequent years account for maintenance. Additionally, molecular biology equipment assumes lab support through government programs therefore requiring minimal input for large equipment.  Engineering equipment will be minimal as it only reflects research and development for small scale prototypes.
Prototyping fees have been assessed to be a total of $200,000-$250,000 with an approximate development round of 4 months per prototype assessment with 5 rounds of prototyping required to finalize the product.  This will occur from the later part of 2014 onwards to the beginning of 2016.
Consumables were based on averages collected during the 2012 iGEM season, examining the cost of technology development.
While prototyping is occurring in 2015-2016 so will field-testing, on commercially available samples.  Prototype equipment costs were based upon commercially available quotes for lyophilization systems.  We plan to be a small scale system in 2015 and a full production sized system in 2016.  This is similar for our bioreactor systems.  Prototyping costs were made based upon our manufacturing calculations.
Consultation fees were determined based upon the assumption that a consultation with industry will cost from $100-$125 per hour with an average number of hours of 100 per year.  These would be with end-users and outsourcing particular skillsets we require.
Market evaluation was determined based upon government grant programs for market assessments.  In 2015-2016 market evaluations will be more limited to potential new markets and ventures for our current and next generation products.
Field testing will require access to other analytical devices and third party services to compare our technology platform to other standard methods.  This can be incredibly costly, a single GC/MS sample and other systems can cost between $150-$250 per sample. We assumed four different detection methods at 50 independent samples at a cost of $150 per submission which will continue to grow in 2016 to a large number of samples.
As our technology is developing, new intellectual property will be generated, and this is reflected in our profitability analysis in the legal section.

GFP production model for diffusion simulation
Sunday, August 3rd
We need an efficient way to simulate diffusion experiments. A receiver cell at the end of a channel receives AHL produced by the well at the other end of the channel, and starts to produce GFP. By using quasi steady state aproximations (considering that binding is much faster than transcription and diffusion), we have a simple equation for GFP production as a function of AHL :
Equations and approximations for the model of GFP production by sensor cells used in simulation of diffusion and cross-talk experiments
By using producer cells on one side of the channel and receiver cells in the other side, and putting cells in a punched cylinder in agar, we should see fluorescence appear at different times depending on the channel length (1 to 4mm) :

There are several lengths of channels, this should enable us to retrieve diffusion parameters by recording when receiver cells start glowing.

Masters information day
Rica presents our iGEM project to an interested group of new students.
We were very busy this weekend. While two of our members went to the German iGEM Meetup in Marburg we presented our poster and work to the new Master students of the Molecular Lifesciences: Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology and Developmental Biology study program of our University. Through that we inspired the upcoming generation to take part in next years iGEM competition and tought them ways to adress crucial problems to make the world a better place, using synthetic biology.
Interactive Information Booth
Most people would agree that there is too much unfiltered material about glyphosate on the internet. Hence, we wanted to directly talk to the public to check on their state of knowledge and what they really know and think about glyphosate. Therefore, we packed our poster, together with some props and survey sheets and travelled to the Gänseliesel in the heart of Göttingen to uncover the opinion, knowledge and wishes of the people.
Proudly presenting our interactive information booth.
A nice day in the heart of Göttingen to update your knowledge over glyphosate.
This booth might seem small but there were several things to discover. For once, of course, the poster, that helped us to explain who we are and what we do. It also showed the current status of our project.                             What do you know about glyphosate? Can you tell us in which of these food items glyphosate was detected? Click on the pictures to find out:
A general concern about glyphosate is its impact on biodiversity in the soil. Since glyphosate was first introduced as an antibiotic, its accumulation in the soil may also influence the biodiversity of bacteria. There are approximately between 100 million and 1 billion bacteria found in a teaspoon of productive soil. These Soil Bacteria have a diverse set of skills, which allows them to act as one of the greatest “real-life” influencers on earth.
However, most of the visitors had only a narrow idea about what microorganisms are, what they do and where to find them. To illustrate and exemplify with how many different microbes glyphosate may interfere in the soil, visitors could participate in a small experiment, where they could leave there microbial fingerprint on a BHI agar plate. To check the microbial diversity on the hand of each participant we incubated the plates at 37°C over the weekend and published the"

Similarly, we insert this large fragment into the upstream of the ligated pTAL with terminator (Figure 2). Eventually, we successfully reconstruct regulative pTAL and offer 3 our own parts this year. One is regulative pTAL (K1311004, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311004:Design ); one is K1311005 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311005:Design ) and the other is K1311006 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311006:Design ).

Report System
We construct a report system so as to test the reliability and efficiency of our ‘Marvelous TALE’. In this section, we test the TALE’s DNA binding ability and report it with a common report gene ‘RFP’. We attempt to put the target of TALE’s DNA binding target sequence inside the expression cassette of report gene and binding TALE can disrupt the express of report gene. We use iGEM standard parts to build our report system.
We designed a standard iGEM part BBa_K1311007 to complete all the tasks http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311007:Design . This part contains
Promoter (J23102)-TALE binding site (repeats three times)-RBS-LacI coding sequence-Terminator(B0015)-LacI Regulative Promoter(R0010)-RBS(B0034)-mRFP1(E1010)-Terminator(B0015)
This part can convert the binding ability of TALE protein to its target DNA sequence to an easier available parameter, the florescent intensity of RFP. When the TALE protein is expressed, the TALE make binds to its target, which may interrupt the transcription of LacI. The lack of repressors may lead to the expression of RFP. So the stronger florescent intensity means the better binding ability of TALE protein. In this part, the target of TALE recognition site is chosen to be the 18bp sequence (ACCTCATCAGGAACATGTT).

Final remarks
As a collaboration with the HebrewU iGEM team, we provided their team the Escherichia coli DH5α strain for their InterLab study. Representatives of this team came to our lab and we were glad to give them a tour.
In conclusion, we hope that our measurements and results will provide the required data, which will help to achieve the final goal of this InterLab experiment.
It was a wonderful experience to work on an international, collaborative study and help to the synthetic biology field develop.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," cell an internal       model. Finally, AHL and leucine are organic molecules and therefore they will       degrade over time.                          We assume first-order kinetics meaning                         that the rate at which AHL and similarly leucine disappear is proportional to       their respective concentrations (3a and 3b) assuming neutral pH [6] .
$$ \frac{\partial C_{AHL}(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=-k_{AHL}\cdot C_{AHL}(\vec{r},t)                         \;\;\; \text{(3a)} $$                         $$ \frac{\partial C_{leucine}(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=-k_{leucine}\cdot C_{leucine}(\vec{r},t)                         \;\;\; \text{(3b)} $$
Putting it all together, we obtain (4), both for AHL and leucine.
$$ \frac{\partial C(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=D \cdot \nabla^2 C(\vec{r},t)+\alpha \cdot \rho_A(\vec{r},t)-k\cdot                         C(\vec{r},t) \;\;\; \text{(4)} $$
Note that these equations have exactly the same form as the equations for AHL and leucine                         in the colony level model. The crucial difference however lies in the                         calculation of the density of cells of type A. In contrast to the colony level       model, in this model the cell density is       not calculated explicitly with a PDE and is therefore                         not trivially known. Therefore a method to extract a density field from a                         spatial distribution of agents is necessary. This is addressed in the                         subparagraph below on coupling.
Box 1: Heat Equation
Heat Equation
The left-hand side of the heat equation (1) represents the rate of       accumulation of a chemical, while the right-hand side is proportional to the Laplacian       of its concentration field, which is a second-order differential operator.       This equation can be easily understood by       considering a one-dimensional concentration profile, as shown in Figure 1: if the concentration       can be approximated as a convex parabolic function, the second derivative       is positive and therefore the rate of accumulation is positive (i.e. more       accumulation). If on the other hand the concentration resembles a concave       parabolic function, the second derivative is negative and the rate of       accumulation as well (i.e. depletion). A special case occurs when the       concentration"

•P4: It´s a transcription factor from phi29 phage, which is a phage of B. subtilis, it is the activator of the A3 promoter[4,5].
•LasR: It is another activator transcription factor, its origin is Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, its correspondent promoter is LasB[20].
•CI: This protein is a repressor from Lambda phage.
•RFP: highly engineered mutant of red fluorescent protein from Discosoma striata (coral), this is our reporter gene[6].
•Omega cassette: The Omega Cassette provides resistance to Spectinomycin and Streptomycin; it was obtained from plasmid pHP45omega[7,8]. Specifically, the resistance is provided by the aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance gene (aadA +) originally carried on a 1.7-kb PvuII-HindIII fragment from the R100.1 plasmid[8].
•AmyE: Integration sequences allow DNA to be incorporated into the chromosome of a host cell at a specific locus. This is achieved by using leading (5') and trailing (3') DNA sequences that are the same as those at a specific locus of the chromosome. The 5' integration sequence( BBa_K143001 ) can be added to the front of a BioBrick construct and the 3' integration sequence specific for this locus ( BBa_K143002 ) to the rear of the Biobrick construct to allow integration of the BioBrick construct into the chromosome of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis at the amyE locus[18,19].
Heavy metal AND Results
•The pBAD/pXyl AND: The promoter pBAD is activated with arabinose, and pXyl with xylose. When both the promoters are activated it starts the transcription of P4 or LasR, and we will know it is working because our bacteria will be red, because of the reporter gene (RFP).
•pBAD: It´s the promoter under the sigma factor 70 from E. coli, which is analogous to the sigma A factor of B. subtilis. It’s repressed by AraC and induced by arabinose, which triggers the rearrangement of the AraC monomers binding for the recruitment of RNA polymerase["

A survey among peasants
On October 5th to 7th, to gain some physical experience of how farmers diligently do farming, to set better modeling for the weeds distribution in the field, and to obtain some inspirations for our project and our design, we have acknowledged the current condition of most farmers and their farming lands as well as how they use those common pesticides like glysphosate through the field investigation. The field investigation was conducted by one of team members through face-to-face interviews with most peasants and personal experience of utilizing pesticides and fertilizers.

physical experience \( \longrightarrow \) our design
As our project is primarily designed a novel pesticide instead of the chemical ones to better peasants’ farming environment and their farming experience, and gradually improve the overall Chinese natural environment, it is rather necessary for us to know farmers’ farming strategy in detail, such as how they get rid of those annoying weeds, how they apply fertilizers and pesticides to plants. To make the best effect, our team member has successfully borrowed those farming equipment from one farmer temporarily and truly felt that there were still a lot of work we can do to make it a better place for peasants.
1. During the field investigation, our team member have found that some weeds could still grow somewhere in the farming lands although there had already been applied chemical herbicide in the first place. To get rid of those newly-grown weeds, farmers couldn’t spray glysphosate any more in that glysphosate is a kind of nonselective herbicide which might kill other crops. Therefore, farmers needed to pull up weeds by themselves. The period is rather time-costing and labor-costing. To help farmers improve their farming environment, we possess a strong desire to design a bio-herbicide with higher selectivity so that they can apply herbicides whenever they need to.
2. When our team member did field investigation, most farmers were still utilizing their own simple plastic device to spray herbicide on the farming"

When first introduced to the iGEM competition by Dr.Huang, he was totally fascinated by the idea of assembling ‘biological machines’ using standardized biological parts. He thinks it is time to exploit the intricate principles discovered by so many talented scientists after centuries of dutiful research to engineer man-made organisms that can ‘change the world’ and help people. He was thus motivated to join the HKU-HKBU team. In the team, he devotes a lot of time to generating ideas,designing the project,editing the wiki and manufacturing Biobricks. With enthusiasm and diligence, he succeeded in collaborating with his talented teammates to create a bacteria-powered motor. The argument that our future world will heavily rely on the motors we've built may seem ridiculous to some. It may or may not happen, but who knows? Nothing is impossible. iGEM is for people with imagination.

I’m a second year student studying Biochemistry and Chemistry at the University of Hong Kong. I have a strong interest in doing research and enjoy the process of trying new ideas. On the team I spent most of my time doing wet lab. Although I have been defeated for many trials, once I had positive results, a great sense of accomplishments made all the efforts worthy. Meanwhile, the variable possibilities in experiments display the fascination of synthetic biology. Another great thing is that I have met lots of like-minded friends in this IGEM competition. We exchanged our ideas, experienced failure and success together, which made us like a big family. Outside the lab, I’m an easy-going person with lots of interests. I usually do sports and go travelling in my spare time to relax myself.

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Future_-_-_TEXT.html,". The private sector is interested in finding new ways to fill the rising energy demand, but is also very cautious about the opinion of the public. Many people mostly see the risks of genetic modification, and do not trust scientists enough to completely put their fate in their hands. The result of this is that more research needs to be carried out; not so much in the synthetic biology branch as well as in materials science, engineering and technology to find materials that can provide for more efficient solar cells and conversion of wind power. In addition, plastics, medicine and other organic components are all synthesised with crude oil as a starting product, and new ways need to be found to obtain these valuable products from a bio-based resource. Researchers are trying to find a way to make solar cells more efficient without using rare elements, while avoiding the use of hazardous materials and energy demanding production steps. At the same time research is done into the catalytic conversion of biomass into useful platform chemicals that can provide the basis for plastics and medicine. When it comes to sustainable energy, wind mills can be used extensively, but are limited by public opinion on visual pollution. As a result, research into other forms of electricity generation and storage is stimulated by governmental subsidies. Also companies that are currently in the fossil energy business look for possibilities to switch to renewables, as peak oil is reached and extraction rates of petroleum are decreasing, resulting in less profit. As oil is being depleted, the energy and fuel prices go up, bringing into view again the otherwise expensive alternative energy sources. The main alternative energy source is solar power. As no ideal way of storing electricity is found yet, research into this field is also stimulated.
Social change
As long as no alternative is found for fossil resources, it is not possible for countries to meet the requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and let a certain percentage of their energy sources be sustainable. This causes discussion among the public. On the one hand people realise that everyone must contribute to decrease energy consumption, on the other hand it is noted that the largest share of energy use is used by industry. People think that the government must use its influence to decrease this or make sure in another way that the Netherlands is less dependent on oil from other countries. Friction is also created by the increased amount of earthquakes in the north of the Netherlands, which are caused by drilling for gas. This results in the government heavily subsidising solar panels by 2040. This changes the atmosphere in society into a somewhat more positive one. People feel that they can contribute to a more sustainable future and are positive about generating their own electricity, thereby being self-sufficient. Initially, the investment"

Xavier Molero has helped to guide us through the iGEM process, including warning us about deadlines, giving us tips and tricks, and encouraging us to pursue many opportunities, such as grant proposals. In addition, we have exchanged project ideas, helping each other to develop our ideas more thoroughly. We have also helped to proofread and revise written material for the University of Valencia iGEM team, to help make sure the information made sense to the average native English speaker.

Kyoto,2010,Team:Kyoto#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," GM foods than people
Q2
The phrases “Cloning”, ”GM foods” and ”DNA” are highly chosen by people.
Because, speaking of genes or biotechnology, people especially has a strong impression about DNA, many people may have chosen “DNA”.
When questionnaire sheets title is “genetic modification”, the phrase ”GM foods” was highly responded. More than half of people respond.
When questionnaire sheets title is “biotechnology”, the phrases ”environment”, “biofuel” and “biohazard” was highly responded, related to genetic modification sheets.
Moreover, because biotechnology survey include the word “bio”, the phrases ”biofuel” and “biohazard” was responded more higher than “genetic modification” sheets.
The result may suggest that the word “genome” was lower acknowledged by people.
The tendency of answer shows that this is accurate information in terms of association, since figures of graphs are same as a whole.
Comparison between Arts and Science, between College student and the Other.
Science is more familiar to Academic term than Arts and the Other.
Science and the Other is more familiar to a term connected with life than Arts.
Q3
To see Fig.3.3 and Fig.3.4, there seems to be the same tendency as Question 1. Full-time House maker and part-time jobber relatively avoid genetic engineering or biotechnology, and college student and High school student relatively accept them.
we think that it is similar reason to Q1 why there is the tendency like this.
There are hardly any differences between the result of genetic engineering and biotechnology.
Q4
College student and high school student think that they can do genetic engineering than the other.
In addition, we find out that less Arts than Science feel genetic engineering bad.
We think that it is similar reason to Q1 and Q3 why there is the tendency like this.
There are hardly any differences between the result of genetic engineering and biotechnology.
Q5
The number of people who answered to survey of genetic engineering is larger than that of biotechnology think that negative information is major.
Now, Japanese tend to  have a bad impression on the word ‘genetic engineering’. On the other hand, Japanese does not feel biotechnology so bad.
There are hardly any differences between the result of university students and the others.
Most Arts among all groups think that negative information is major.
Q6
Surprisingly, there are hardly any differences between the result of university students and the others.
Comparing between Fig6.1 and Fig.6.2, there are a little more people answering ‘Yes’ in"
Debrecen_Hungary,2011,Team:Debrecen Hungary#Arsenic_-_-_TEXT.html," the drinking water of the south east region of Hungary can be found here: [2]
As the Edinburgh team tested the system only on distilled water samples spiked with sodium-arsenate, we contacted the team and offered our help to test the machine on real-world samples to prove that it works not only on artificial but on natural samples as well (with many different compounds that may interfere with the part's action). We also sent them twenty sterilized samples collected by a Local Public Health Organisation from different wells - this organisation has also provided data on arsenic concentrations gained from flame atomic absorption spectrometry measurements.
Method of testing
The contact person of Team Edinburgh 2006 sent us the protocol should be used according to their experiments. We collected samples from two wells which were known to contain elevated arsenic concentration (Szegfű and Madách street, Békéscsaba, Hungary). Find these places using Google Maps: [3] , [4]
We used DH5 alpha E. coli cell line with lacZDM15 mutation as host cells, than we prepared a medium consisting of:
2.0 g/l peptone
0.1 g/l yeast extract
0.3 g/l K2HPO4
2.1 g/l NaHCO3
a pinch of the indiciator powder: Bromothymol blue
10 g/l lactose
Autoclaved or filter-sterilized water sample dilutions
We spiked these media with transformed bacterial cells containing the arsenic biosensor system, and incubated 24 hours at 37°C.
Results
We received that the part works also on real world samples, not only on samples made of water and sodium-arsenate. The colour change of Bromothymol Blue seemed to be directly proportional to the concentration of arsenic. According to the reference dilutions made from Na-arsenate and MilliQ water the concentration of arsenic in our collected samples is at least 15-fold higher than the WHO recommended limit (Fig.1., Fig.2., Fig.3.).

At last, when the deposit become white and pure, using buffer contain urea to dissolve it. And the concentration of protein can be control and largely improved.
another one is that when we use the Ni column, we can not mix up when doing elution, and let the elution buffer flow out, and in the collected solution, the protein will be concentrated in two or three elution sample.

2.Grow salmonella in LB overnight at 37°C.
3.On the following day, the bacteria are transferred to LB broth, subjected to further growth at 37°C on a rotator to OD600= 0.8, and placed on ice.
4.In the following growth, they are diluted to a concentration of 104 CFU/mL in PBS on ice, warmed to room temperature, and 0.2 mL injected intraperitoneally or intravenously into C57BL6 mice (n=5-10).
Cell culture passage
1. Wipe your work area and hands with 70% ethanol before starting.
2. Decant supernatant fluid from culture into a waste collection jar.
3. Washing with PBS.
4. Add 3ml of cold trypsin and examine under low magnification for 3-7 minutes.
5. It appears that most of the cells have rounded up, but have not yet completely detached. Then immediately return to the hood and mix the cells with pipette several times to help break up the clumps of cells.
6.Add some fresh DMEM media to three new flasks (if you are doing a 1:3 split). Suspend the cells with pipette and quickly dispense the aliquot into each flask containing fresh media .
Bacterial replication in various tissues
Isolate and titrate bacteria from blood, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and tumor. Infected mice were euthanized and those tissues were removed aseptically and homogenized with 2ml PBS. Serially diluted homogenates were spread onto modified LB agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The titer of bacteria was determined by counting colonies and dividing them by the weight of the tissue (colony-forming unit CFU/g tissue).

Practices
Overview
Coordinated action is required to minimize emergence and spread of antibacterial resistance (ABR). The World Health Organisation have recently (May 2015) endorsed a global action plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance .
The plan sets out 5 objectives:
Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance
Strengthen surveillance and research
Reduce the incidence of infection
Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines
Ensure sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance
Our work is focused on the first two WHO objectives. In our project , we are developing the use of bacteria as living therapeutics to provide an alternative to administering antibiotics, thereby addressing objective number two. However, ABR cannot be overcome with research alone in view of the fact that misinformed antibiotic use contributes a large part to the increasing worldwide acquired ABR.
In line with the first objective of the WHO global action plan, to improve awareness and understanding of ABR, our project relies on a three way conversation between the team, the public and experts. This influences every aspect of our project, from our choice of application to the details of our delivery system. The emphasis of our Policy and Practices is to take an iterative approach to developing our idea, continuously taking input from the public and healthcare professionals, so as to ensure that our project could become a realistic method to overcome ABR.
The practices approach of our project has been inspired by the Royal College of General Practitioners TARGET Antibiotics Toolkit. TARGET stands for: Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education, Tools. 1 Our guidance comes from healthcare professionals and the public; in terms of education we have worked on increasing awareness of ABR and synthetic biology; and our tools are based around using engineered bacteria as therapeutic agents. The targeted nature of our solution is achieved by building the project around our practices, constantly feeding back and forth between the two.
We want to make our website as accessible as possible to all readers, regardless of their level of expertise. Words with a dotted underline will show a definition when you click them.

Tables
Creating tables in HTML is a tedious task. Unfortunately you will most likely have quite a few tables. Therefore please use the following ( \LaTeX ) table generator , which also supports exporting the table as HTML. Use this for Excel-to-wiki conversion: here If you don't want the first row to be header-row, simply replace the <th></th> with <tr></tr>.
Please also change the start <table> to <class=""contenttable""> such that the table gets represented as per our design. Consequently a table should look like:
<table class=""contenttable""> <tr> <th>header1</th> <th>header2</th> <th>header3</th> </tr> <tr> <td>content1</td> <td>content2</td> <td>content3</td> </tr> </table>

Including Images
You can include images simply by using the following code:
<img src=""https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/b/b5/Dnastrand3.png"">
Please upload images with fileformat Aachen_descr(_date).ext on the iGEM Server . descr stands for a short description together with an optional date in any of the allowed extensions.
Position your images adequatly. In most cases you will either need to align them left, right or as center. Please try to avoid having floating images as they usually get too small to see something. Please serve yourself with the example code:

Week 9
Monday (07/30/18)
Lab 1
The LabPats attempted their PCR again with no luck.
Lab 2
To begin the week in lab, the RX Lab Students planned their goals for the week.  They wanted to discover why the chitinase was cut during digestion and once that problem was figured out, then assemble pPTCC1 (Transformed Chitinase C-1).  They also wanted to try to test a combination of cinnamaldehyde and chitinase on Yarrowia and on Byssochlamys.  Finally, they wanted to successfully assemble cinnamaldehyde into the iGEM backbone. The team then split into the two working groups. Max and Jonah began another DNA assembly of cinnamaldehyde in order to obtain a higher DNA concentration.  They also began Yarrowia and Byssochlamys culture. Travis, Peter, and Chris started an enzyme test in order to discover whether it was a bad enzyme making the cut.  Finally, they mini-prepped and digested 20 colones (10 from NEB 5-Alpha and 10 from One Shot Mach 1) that Chia had prepared culture for the previous day.  Each clone showed that the chitinase C-1 was being cut in half.

Lab 1
The LabPats attempted their PCR again with no luck.
Lab 2
On the second day of the week, the RX Lab Students kept working towards the weeks goals. The team then split into the two working groups. Max and Jonah began Byssochlamys testing.  Once they found that their transformation failed again, they decided to order PCR primers in order to PCR the cinnamaldehyde. Travis, Peter, and Chris ran on an agarose gel the 20 colones (10 from NEB 5-Alpha and 10 from One Shot Mach 1) that had been digested the previous day. Each clone showed that the chitinase C-1 was being cut in half.
Wednesday (08/01/18)

Collaboration
Collaboration is an important part of iGEM experience. It's the first step of the creation of a community around synthetic biology. This        year, the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU team was involved in two collaborations :
The ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team believe that communication about safety issues can improve overall safety levels in synthetic        biology. Their outreach consisted in accumulating information on other teams' safety issues with their projects.         We contributed our data on KillerRed, applied to analyse its potential risks and the consequent measures taken to ensure         the safety of the researchers and the general public, as well as preservation of the external environment (see below).        We hope the collaboration with the ATOMS-Turkiye team will help encourage other teams to communicate about Safety;         as it is as essential as the synthetic biology we work on, communication and collaboration should be on the same         level for both. Thus we put this collaboration on he same level as synthetic biology for our team's outreach effort.
We collaborated with the NRP-UEA-Norwich 2013 iGEM team to send a soil sample from Grenoble to them.         Their project attempts to identify the antimycin-producing bacteria present in different soils accross         the globe and so in this case collaboration with other iGEM teams is essential.

They designed their wiki barrier-free and additionally gave us very helpful tips to improve our guide to an accessible wiki. Using their tips, like e.g. adding examples, our guide is now easier to understand so that even beginner wiki managers can use our guide to design an accessible wiki.
When contacting the iGEM team of the Kings College in London, our call for an accessible iGEM competition was met with a (to us) new idea. KCL has a public campaign in which they ask to design websites accessible for people with special educational needs (sen). We were  happy to participate in their campaign. It’s just as easy to design your wiki suitable for sen people as it is to design a wiki accessible for people with visual impairment!
To conclude, through this collaboration with all these amazing teams, we could improve the Human Practices part of our project by spreading awareness on the inclusion of people with disabilities into the scientific community. For the future, we hope for the iGEM community to adopt this design and by this to be a shining example for the rest of the scientific and general public. One possibility to do this could be to embrace accessible web design as a medal criterium or a requirement in general.
iGEM Duesseldorf - Postcards
iGEM Duesseldorf wanted to create a co-culture toolbox.  With their project “Trinity” they want to make microbial-communities usable for diverse purposes. Since 2016, iGEM Düsseldorf is doing a postcard campaign with the purpose of educating the public about topics in synthetic biology. We were happy to join and designed a postcard which fit with our project. #vibriGAINZ. When the postcards from teams all over the world arrived we were delighted to see the work everyone put into them. Additionally, by this we got interested in all those teams and had a further look into their project

The process of bringing a new product from the lab to the market will often result in the oversimplification of technical knowledge and the associated ethical considerations. People who are involved in this process, be it a businessman or a policymaker, should, in our opinion, be aware of issues that emcompasses the use of synthetic biology in their products. One area that is especially important to talk about is bioethics. A discussion about bioethics can help society define both possibilities that are welcomed and boundaries in which society should remain.
The advantages brought by modifying living organisms are far from minor [2]. Here, we will take the example of two industries central to this field: the pharmaceutical industry works in the medical sector and aims to improve the daily lives of suffering patients, while the agri-food industry seeks to feed the world, and the optimisation of its yields may seem secondary in comparison to pharmaceutics. However, the human population is ever growing, and feeding billions more mouths may become a more pressing problem than what we may first think.
In these two major areas, the synthetic biology industry is making great leaps forward and enabling innovations that directly affect society. The first is the creation of new medicines and skincare techniques that could improve and enhance the quality of life for everyone. The second is to increase the profitability of certain foodstuffs, which could help reduce hunger in the world.
Take the example of Taxol: it is a cancer chemotherapy agent, acting on spindle stabilisation. Its effects are proven on cancer but remain very inaccessible to many because of its price (about 6000 USD for a full cycle [3]). The reason behind the high cost is the inefficient extraction process from the Pacific yew tree that produces not only low yields of Taxol, but also impure mixtures of compounds. By going through a synthetic biology process, we can simplify the production and purification process. The cost of this drug could then drop dramatically [4] and therefore be much more readily available to those who need it.
Similarly, allowing the creation of plants for continuous food production regardless of the season would result in a significant cost reduction of food which could reduce hunger in the world. This raises the issue of the spread of this technology in the environment, which remains a major problem. Through the spread of artificial products, some ecosystems could become seriously threatened, and maybe even face disappearance. Humans introducing foreign species into different environments has, historically, not gone well, as the Australians can tell you regarding rabbits [5]. Introducing a species which is"

Today we met together as an entire team and discussed whether we would continue with the cholera project or not. After discussion, we decided that although work on this has already been done, the scope of what we are attempting with both detecting and destroying cholera biofilms is still unique, so we will continue with the cholera project. However, we will change the approach of our cholera project to incorporate phage into the destroy part of the project. This will make our project even more novel and will bring the two projects closer together so that our overall presentation will be more coherent.
Due to the restructuring of our cholera approach we have decided to change the subgroups of our cholera team and our focuses. The two destroy teams will be the phage team and the enzyme team. Our cholera-enzyme team will focus on finding, characterizing, and transferring enzymes that will disrupt the biofilm into our E. coli system and phage. Our cholera-phage group will have a two pronged approach. One side will involved engineering a known cholera phage with modifications that will degrade biofilm. The other side is a search for cholera associated phage. They will work on designing, characterizing, and transferring our phage into the E. coli system and link it to the quorum sensing signal system.

iGEM Conference
The 4th iGEM Asia- Pacific Conference  (8 - 14 AUG 2016)
We joined the iGEM Asia- Pacific Conference conducted in Tainan in August 2016, we have gained deep insights into perspectives of synthetic biology, from ethics to big data processing, via in-depth discussions with fellow iGEMers. The experience workshop and presentations with the 20 Asian iGEM teams also gives us inspirations in operating an iGEM team and conducting human practice. We had got valuable advice in connecting ourselves to the public from Ana Sifuentes from iGEM headquarters. Professors gave us precious advice on our future planning and orientation and pointed out the practical difficulties and problems hiding inside our project.
Pan-Pearl iGEM Teams Meeting (5 AUG 2017)
We attended and presented our project in the conference. We had exchanged ideas with other iGEM teams as well. Supervisors from other iGEM teams gave  helpful advices for improvement of our project. We also gain more experience in presenting and answering questions, it was like a small rehearsal for Jamboree.
DIYBio Biosafety Sharing (11 AUG 2017)
DIYBio HK shared with us their safety protocol, biosafety practice in their lab as well as the recent situation and regulations on genetically modified organisms in Hong Kong. We gain precious inspirations from the talk on biosafety and we realized that regulations in Hong Kong need to be improved. Meeting with all other local iGEM teams, we had nice communications on difficulties we are facing respectively and gave each other suggestions."

Other limitations are the opportunities for frequent contact, the support of daily doses to the population especially children and pregnant women and the logistic problems like need for training, medical staff and distribution infrastructure.
Another strategy is the accumulation of food via manufacturing or packaging with micronutrients which is just efficient by consuming the processed industrial products. The diversification of nutrition i.e. measures like education about consuming more Vitamin A containing food. The problem of this strategy is the regional and seasonal availability of Vitamin A containing food.
“No risk no fun”- Golden Rice in conflict
Figure 13: General circle of the interplay between Media, politicians, scientist and public
Media, politicians, scientist and public are the main actors in a so called vicious circle. The public become influenced by the media, the scientist and the politicians in negative or positive way (see figure 8). The positive and negative critics from advocates and opponents are given below.
“We would rather err on the side of caution.” (Daniel Ocampo, a campaigner for the organization in the Philippines)
Advocate‘s reaction
The statements from Anti-GMO Organizations that Golden Rice has negative influence to the population denys Potrykus vehemently with chemical evidences. In his opinion is the today’s genetic engineering more controlled and foreseeable as in the past. The intervention in the genome of the plant illustrates a lower risk in contrast to the “traditional” classical breeding ways which exercised the aged Egyptian. This he confirms with an example about producing profit-yielding types of wheat: via cobalt bomb uncontrolled mutations would induce in the wheat genome by what the genome were fragmented through gamma-rays. The wheat pasta which we consume today is consequently a product of breeding. The statement  of R. Künast(federal ministry of consumer protection, nutrition and agriculture): „It is more expensive because you need the matching herbicide and because the people there have no reproduction rights.“[ Künast's statement ]rebuts Potrykus with his humanitarian treaty (see 2.1). The statement from the opponents that the genes have negative influence to wild types Michael D. Purugganan( professor of genomics and biology and the dean for science at New York University) rebuts with “The genes they inserted to make the vitamin are not some weird manufactured material,” he wrote, “but are also found in squash, carrots and melons.” “Secondly this “genetic contamination” isn’t given by the fact that Golden Rice is typically self-pollinated.
