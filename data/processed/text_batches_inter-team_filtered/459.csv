We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

Overview
Caulobacter crescentus is a kind of bacteria with many necessary for our project: C.crescentus has a special life cycle, including swarmed period when C.crescentus possesses flagellum in one pole and stalked period when bacteria cut up flagellum and develop an extremely strong polar adhesive envelope structure known as the holdfast which is composed of protein and polysaccharide. According to the research, when holdfast cling to a surface, the force on it reaches 68 N/mm2 high,which is regarded as the most strongest biological glue known to exist in nature and is three times strong as commerical 'super glue'. With the knowledge we have already known, if we are able to regulate the biosynthesis of flagellum and holdfast simultaneously with flourescent proteins controlled by light input, C.crescentus will stop swimming, develop holdfast to stay firmly and evenly on the plate with expressing flourescent proteins corresponding to light color simulation.
In order to realize the blueprint of our design, we have these works to do as following:
1. Figure out the exact proteins regulating the biosynthesis of flagellum and holdfast or keeping bacteria staying in a place relatively and then construct a circuit which contains controling proteins triggered or inhibited by light signal.
2. Discover some methods to guide accomplished light sensing-imaging systems working in E. coli into C.crescentus.
3. Confirm the exact nutrition conditions for an even C.crescentus biofilm genesis with modeling work and lab tests.
Here, we are attempting to introduce the whole veiw of this amazing bacteria for you to be better understanding our project and its specialty.
Life Cycle and Nutritional Provide
The cyclic developmental program of Caulobacter crescentus starts with a stalked cell with a polar adhesive holdfast at the tip of the holdfast. The stalked cell firstly turns into S phase when it is time for DNA replication. At that time, the bacteria grow up into predivisional cells. Later the cell enters the G2 phase when the cell becomes incompetent for DNA replication and it keep growing until finally compartmental"

All those show that yeast two-hybrid system has many applications in synthetic biology. This year, our team introduce yeast prion to this system, and we will see the wonderful cooperation among these elements.

In this circuit, we combine the prion-determining region (PrD) of Sup35 and the AD, BD fragments in Y2H system. We have designed two fusion proteins: AD-PrD and BD-PrD. AD-PrD is inserted into Uracil labeled plasmid YEplac195, and BD-PrD is inserted into Tryptophan labeled plasmid PYeScGAp. For our downsteam reporter gene, we insert pGAL1 promoter and GFP into Leucine labeled plasmid YEplac181.
We predict the structure of our fusion protein: PrD-AD and PrD-BD by Phyre2[6].

Then we transform these three plasmids into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We expect this designded system is sensitive to temperature and concentration of protein denaturant GdnHCl. When fusion proteins AD-PrD and BD-PrD are produced in yeast, as Sup35 has some good properties (assembling, thermal control and reversibility), the fusion protein PrD-AD and PrD-BD also have such properties. When we give heat shock to yeast, because of the aggregation of prion, fusion protein AD-PrD-PrD-BD can be generated to activate downstream gene expression. However, protein denaturant Guanidine Hydrochloride (GdnHCL) can inhibit the aggregation of prion, and the expression of downstream gene. So we will realize the thermal control and GdnHCL control of gene expression. When the temperature is high enough to give yeast heat shock, expression of reporter gene"

In the context of synthetic biology, the CBD and NP apply to the genetic material often used  by researchers. Synthetic biology research and experimentation necessarily utilize significant quantities  of tangible genetic material. Thus, a fledgling community laboratory should strive to meet the  admirable standards set forth by the CBD and NP.26 The extent of this application, however, is unclear, as synthetic biology is not specifically addressed by the CBD or NP. 27 Specifically, although the NP  does note the term “derivative” and defines it as a gene segment produced or isolated by human  manipulation, synthetic gene segment produced by human manipulation, or a synthetic analogue  chemicals or gene segments, it does not extensively address the impact of synthetic biology.  Nevertheless, the CBD an NP provide meaningful goals that a community laboratory should strive  towards.
The model of a community laboratory set forth by organizations such as the LA Biohackers is  well on its way to promoting these goals, as exemplified by their mission statement: The mission of the  Los Angeles Biohackers is to make science accessible to people of all ages and educational  backgrounds.28

Tsinghua,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," is Toehold Switch
We choose toehold switch as our miRNA detector. The structure of toehold switch is similar to hairpin, except it has a loop at the top as ‘toehold’. Toehold switch functions as riboregulator through linear-linear interaction between RNAs. When target RNA appears, it will bind one of the toehold switch stems and open the loop, exposing the RBS.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger. The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single-stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest.
Our Circuit to Detect miRNA-144
There are 3 parts in our circuit in total.
Part 1 includes toehold switch for miRNA-144 and GFP coding sequence. When miRNA-144 exists, the switch is on and mRNA for GFP is transcribed.
Part 2 contains toehold switch for GFP mRNA and T3 RNA polymerase coding sequence (BBa_K346000). Note that, since the maximum length of trigger RNA for toehold switch is about 25nt, so we analyzed GFP mRNA’s structure and choose a small piece from it which ensures binding specificity and stability.
Part 3 is simply a GFP generator (BBa_E0840), with T3 promoter. As we know, T3 promoter can only function when bound with T3 RNA polymerase.
So now it’s clear that, part 2 and part 3 are designed for amplification. They form a positive feedback loop. So the whole process is as follow: when miRNA-144 exists, it triggers part 1 and GFP mRNAs are transcribed. These mRNA on the one hand can be directly translated to GFP and show green fluorescence, on the other hand, can trigger part 2 and T3 RNA polymerase is transcribed and translated, which enables part 3 to work, thus transcribe more GFP mRNAs. And these GFP mRNAs can also be used"

[2][3] Last October, researcher Stefan Turk published a study detailing and potential candidates enzymes for these steps and characterizing their activity in vivo in E. coli. [4] With the novel nature of his work in mind, our team contacted Turk in request of a sample of his engineered strain eAKP-672 with the highest 6-ACA yield when grown in glucose containing medium. We hoped to adjust Turk's synthetic plasmid designs and/or make our own genomic edits to optimize the metabolic flux of his biosynthetic pathways. Turk replied in the affirmative, shipping us two separate cell samples containing plasmids pAKP-96 and pAKP-444, which held the six enzymes necessary to induce one of the two above mentioned pathways in Escherichia coli. Unfortunately, issues with a large number of illegal restriction sites in the relevant genes made biobricking intractable, and we had to abandon this part of the project.

In short, we relied on the work of Tani et al. who discovered that an apoptosis-inducing protein with L-lysine-α-oxidase activity from Scomber japonicus retained that activity in a recombinant variant produced in bacteria.5 We verified production, purification, and functionality of this enzyme, marking the first step in a potential semi-synthetic route to 6-aminocaproic acid, caprolactam, and nylon. One of the primary advantages of enzyme use is specific targeting, and this product successfully targets and changes the α-amino group of L-lysine, opening the door to less specific chemical methods of reduction that have been developed for decades. Of course, the possibility of utilizing additional enzymes in a search for yet another completely biological route is also open. We hope that by providing this functional enzyme to the registry in a form that is easily produced in high functional yield and purified, the next steps in this journey will become that much easier.

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#MethodsDetection_-_-_TEXT.html," particles with the DLS, the particle has to have a different refractive index than the solvent. If not, the particle doesn't scatter light. Also the sample must be very pure. Any dust particle or aggregate can ruin the data output. This is because large particles scatter way more light than small particles. The data analysis requires vast amounts of knowledge and time [5].
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
Figure 4: Scematic overview of the NTA and the sample
The nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is been developed by Nanosight. This is a new method for a direct and real-time visualization of the virus-like-particles. On Tuesday 24th of October 3 samples were tested with varied results, but showed a promising technique that can be used for uncovering parameters of the assembly model.
A focussed laser is passed through the sample and hits the particles in the detection volume. The light of the laser scatters in all directions making the particles detectable for a camera. These particles are seen moving due to Brownian motion. The NTA program identifies the particles and track the centre of each particle individually. The average distance each particles make is automatically calculated. From this value the diffusion coefficient can be obtained. With the diffusion coefficient we are able to get the radius by the Stokes-Einstein equation [6].
In the slideshow below is our HepB wildtype VLPs visualized by the NTA program. We also tested two other samples, but there was no detection. In the slide show you can see aggregates, the VLps it self are too small to be seen on the slideshow, however they are being tracked by the program. Although no estimation of size was yet possible due to the wrong type of laser used during the measurement.
Thanks to the realtime and direct way of visualizing the particle sizes by the NTA program, it becomes possible to do studies about VLP assembly and aggregation [7]. With this technique it becomes possible to find parameters for the assembly and the human body model.
Comparison between the EM and DLS
The electron microscope has been used for years to detect VLPs, but is rather expensive to use. So we searched for alternatives. One of the alternatives we found was the dynamic light scattering technique. Dynamic light scattering is sometimes mentioned as a way to detect VLPs, but is never explained thoroughly. We didn't know any possibilities or limitations of the DLS, so we wanted to see if the output of the DLS is similar to the output of the EM. If the results are positive we can use the DLS as a cheap and easy way"

Applied Design Hardware Measurement Model
Bioreactor Setup
MSU-iGEM 2017 developed a hardware system that can be utilized by researchers across multiple disciplines. A simplistic bioreactor system that is cost effective and versatile can be used from renewable energy to measuring protein expression. Yet, these bioreactors can be used for applications outside the research lab such as testing for water contaminants and even as a teaching tool for synthetic biology. The design focuses on utilizing materials that are common throughout labs as well as durability when being used for multiple applications. Using mason jars as the main housing, promotes strength to withstand autoclaving and being shipped from research lab to field testing. The titanium wires, housing for the counter electrode and housing for the reference electrode allow for a single-chamber bioreactor to be effective and simple. The bioreactors themselves cost under seven dollars and a Microcontroller-based device can be a low cost alternative to a potentiostat for an entire system.
Useful for Everyone
The bioreactors and potentiostat set-up can also be used to detect protein expression in place of GFP fluorescence.  This will be significantly faster, easier, and cheaper to run.  This will also yield a consistent stream of data so that any iGEM team can more accurately analyze the data.  The entire system is a very easy way to test if a promoter works and should be used for accurate determination of the functionality of a promoter.  The steps are very simple to test if the promoter is functional.  Simply insert a new promoter in place of the old promoter or at the appropriate location upstream of the mtrB gene.  Then insert the plasmid into your Shewanella bacteria and place that bacteria into the bioreactor.  After this you induce the bacteria after they hit stationary phase and await the results!

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

현자의 돌은 한 번도 발견된 적이 없지만, 현자의 돌을 찾기 위한 당시 과학자들의 노력은 수많은 새로운 지식으로 이어지며, 오늘날 화학, 금속공학, 약학 등 다양한 분야의 밑거름이 되었습니다.

Cellulose is abundant in Finland, and less and less paper is used throughout the world, so our product is one good use for the wood. Thinning of the forest is a good way to acquire wood without disturbing the growth of the forest. Cellulose is a safe foundation for a product, and it does not pose a threat to humans or the environment!
We were also critical of microbeads which many cosmetic companies use as exfoliating agents in their products. Microbeads are tiny plastic particles which end up in the oceans, as they cannot be filtered from our waste waters. After, through plankton, they start to accumulate in fish and fish-eating birds [2] . Cosmetics is one of the major sources for microplastics that end up in the environment. In the beginning of 2017 microplastics were already detectable from table salt. Microbeads could be replaced with an alternative that doesn’t have such a huge impact to the environment. Currently, it is common to scrub one’s face with granulated sugar but for commercial exfoliation products an insoluble option should be used. We thus introduced ground peach seeds as a replacement to combat the trend of microplastics! Our end product is therefore environmentally friendly, and it is safe to discard in the trash and the sink.
There were a number of other ethical questions that were relevant to our project. You can read more about dermcidin in relationship to providing an alternative to antibiotics from the Safety page. As we are well aware of the problems of the clothing industry [3] , we wanted to purchase environmentally sustainable team clothing. Our team clothes are therefore provided by Pure Waste Textiles - a Finnish company that produces clothing 100% from the textile industry waste.
The Scientific Community and Intellectual Property Rights
One of the most difficult questions in the field of science today is the juxtaposition between open source research and patents. On one hand, the aim is to be able to provide good quality therapeutics to the population, as fast as possible. On the other hand, if we had no patents, the companies would probably be even more secretive about their findings, because there would be no guarantee that their investments would pay themselves back.
Patents were relevant to our project. You may read more about the legal aspects from our Entrepreneurship page . Clearly, patents sometimes result in extremely unethical situations, such as keeping the price of a cancer or HIV drug incredibly high. Yet, we do not have"

Harmful to achieve objectiv
Internal attributes of the organization
Strengths: - Our product has a simple procedure. Compare to the detecting services provided by companies, individuals can complete whole detecting process. -This product is cheaper than other similar products and services. -The criteria of detecting lung cancer is the ctDNA in patients’ blood. It can be found earlier than other symptoms of lung cancer, which gives an advantage in early cancer detection. -The result is clear and easy to understand.
Weakness: -At the moment, our product has it limitation on detecting a variety of cancer. This product only aim for EML4-ALK mutation in lung cancer. Only 4–6% of lung cancer involve this fusion gene.
External attributes of the organization
Opportunities: -According to the discussion on health check market above, China has a huge health check market with sustained growth annually. Our product is easy to used and efficient which is suitable to be used in health check. Unlike other lung cancer detection method, our screening chip provide detection services for a massive number of patients in a period of time. Therefore it has its advantage to be in the health check market. -People are more aware to have regular health check to prevent diseases. More people accept the concept of “early discover, early diagnosis, and early cure”. Therefore an additional option for lung cancer detection during health check match the demand from patients.
Threats: -Public may distrust our product due to lack of understanding of our product. Therefore education is necessary before promoting the product.

Once this is finished we'll hopefully be able to work smoothly through the assembly procedure. At this point I would probably give up a kidney for the ability to synthesize all of these constructs.

I ordered the rest of the primers we will need for the construction of our system (except for genomic integration, which I will order when I know what loci we want to use). Because we are having so much trouble assembling two parts of great size differences (the RBS – 18bp and a promoter – 1000bp) we are going to biobrick the RBS onto the promoter using PCR assembly. For that method I ordered two primer constructs for an inducible Gal promoter and the constitutive Tef promoter.
Although the Biobrick Verification primers that the registry uses work for sequencing and larger parts, PCR gel verification of biobrick assemblies or basic parts would be easier if we could amplify just the insert and not the ~200bp outside the insert. In that light, I constructed primers based on the biobrick prefix and suffix, including 6bp 5’ GCG clamps so that, if we so choose, we can use the PCR products to do assemblies.

Weekend trip to LA’s over – let’s dive right in:
In order to circumvent the difficulty of assembling biobricks of very different size (namely a ribosome binding site, 18bp, and a promoter, ~1000bp) we PCRed and biobricked the inducible pGAL and the consititutive pTEF promoters with RBSs on the reverse primers. Today we actually did the main portion of this biobricking. We’ll submit these promoters to the Registry and hopefully this will save some time and stress in future assemblies.
In order to use the backbone of the pCTCON plasmid (which has a trp1 selectable marker) we need a strain of yeast that does not have the trp1 gene.

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#outreach#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," a former iGEM participant (now supervisor of our team) met with Jaco Westerink and Cécile van der Vlught from the RIVM to discuss our project and iGEM as a whole. During the meeting a potential annual cooperation between all iGEM teams in the Netherlands and the RIVM was discussed. To that end we invited Jaco, Cécile and Dirk Stemerding from the Rathenau Institute to the National meetup of the iGEM teams hosted by Wageningen. It was there that the other Dutch teams got to meet the RIVM representatives and the groundwork for a gathering hosted by the RIVM was laid.
On September 17th all iGEM teams, Dutch synthetic biologists, members of several departments from the RIVM and policy makers from different ministries came together at the RIVM for a gathering focusing on information exchange regarding synthetic biology. The main issues that were raised: What is synthetic biology? What are the possibilities and constraints? What opportunities does synthetic biology create and to what extent caution is required for its application?
Professor Oscar Kuipers from Molecular Genetics at Groningen University, Dr. Roel Bovenberg from DSM and RIVM employee and former iGEM judge Dr. Mark van Passel spoke during the symposium. Offering different perspectives on synthetic biology, Dr. van Passel gave a general introduction pointing out that synthetic biology is a method that is used to engineer biology rather than an actual application. Prof. Kuipers explained the different applications his chair is working on using synthetic biology. Dr. van Bovenberg gave an industrial perspective, specifically focusing on DSM’s attempt to incorporate synthetic biology applications in a biobased economy.
From left to right: Dr. Roel Bovenberg, Dr. Oscar Kuipers and Dr. Mark van Passel.
In the inaugural symposium, the iGEM students proceeded to give workshops on their iGEM projects with a selection of the audience members. The day closed in the form of an open discussion: the different workshop groups gave an overview of the arguments that were raised during the workshops. Those were then subsequently elaborated on by the three speakers.                         During the workshops the specific applications of the iGEM teams were discussed, focusing on both, the technical and social aspects.

On potential stakeholders:
Companies producing or using pharmaceuticals and other chemical compounds are also stakeholders, since they have a purification obligation.
Water treatment plants also require concentration measuring methods.
On our biosensor:
Water samples should be filtered before applying it to our biosensor. As well, we need to make sure our biosensor survives in surface water and not only water used in laboratories (Milli Q water).

Michael Bentvelsen, Dutch Water Authorities
22/08/18 About Michael Bentvelsen
Michael Bentvelsen is a policy advisor for the Dutch Water Authorities (Unie van Waterschappen), that represents all Water Authorities in the Netherlands. Water authorities are responsible for both water quality and water purification.
Insights
There is a variety of filter methods that can be used for water purification needed for water analysis.
For water purification, BDS uses a method with one purification step, in stead of the chemical purification methods, which needs two more expensive steps.
Although the government seems a logical stakeholder of biosensors, in practice the producers of the specific compounds, like pharmaceutical companies, are the major clients of BDS biosensors.
Biosensors have great advantages compared to chemical analysis methods. They are cheaper, faster and often measure a broader range of compounds.
Applied
End product integration:
Experiments have to be conducted to determine what filter method will be sufficient for DeTaXion. The needed filter methods are more likely to be similar to the methods used by BDS than by chemical analysis, because the systems of DeTaXion and BDS biosensors are more alike.
So far, we have set our minds on producing a kit, enabling buyers to do the experiments by themselves. However, end product design will be easier and the results will be more reliable when the measurements are done at the lab. We will have to reconsider our choices based on these newly acquired advantages and disadvantages.

We can get Hill function parameters this way, but still need dynamic data from our own experiments to retrieve dynamic parameters (i. e. degradation rates).
Integrases don't seem to switch the terminator at the moment, maybe because of a mutation that we found in their sequence.

Integrase parameters
Friday, August 29th
In order to predict accurately the experiments we designed, we defined two different strategies to retrieve parameters for the integrase system.
As we did not find these parameters on the web, we used the data given by Bonnet et al.'s paper ""Amplifying genetic logic gates"" [9] . The figure S4 is particularly interesting, even if it does not give any information on the dynamics of the system. We modeled and wrote the equations corresponding to Bonnet's experiment.
At first, we try to fit the dynamic parameters of the system with only the steady states values.  To fit the parameters with the data, we first try to use a minimum search for the difference between the data and the parametric function. Then, using these first approximations, we tried to do a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to find a more suited curve. As these two methods are strongly prior dependent, we planned another step of screening in order to have meaningful results. However, our knowledge on the parameters, the number of data points compared to the high number of parameters did not give any meaningful results.
We then decided to simplify our system :
We consider that Bxb1a and Bxb1b have the same behavior. Therefore, they don't appear as differentiated in our system anymore.
The paper uses the tet system to induce their system. This was modeled explicitly before. We approximated this part to a Hill function, which takes leakiness into consideration. The parameters for the Hill function are the result from a study of an other iGEM team UCSF from last year. Please visit their page for more information. The same biobrick is indeed used in their work and in Bonnet's paper.
We consider that the dimer of the integrase and the binding to DNA were at quasi steady-state.
As we tried to fit the steady state, we obtained two different models, depending on which assumption we made. As these two models fit the Bonnet's curve well, we used them both to derive more precisely the dissociation constant of the dimerization reaction and the one of the DNA binding reaction. Each of them appear in one of the lump"

UNIPV-Pavia,2011,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Pavia_-_-_TEXT.html," that one. From 553 to 568 Pavia remained under the Byzantine rule and its fortifications were renewed. In 572, after three years of siege, it became the capital of the Longobard kingdom.
During the following Carolingian and Saxon Empires Pavia was still capital of Italy and several kings were crowned in St. Michael’s Basilica until the twelfth century. In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune.
In the following centuries Pavia was an important and active town. Under the Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis IV granted during his stay in Italy the Palatinate to his brother Duke Rudolph's descendants. Pavia held out against the domination of Milan, finally yielding to the Visconti family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.
The Battle of Pavia (1525) marks a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars, Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713 at the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession. Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon. During this Austrian period the University was greatly supported by Maria Theresa of Austria and saw a great renaissance that eventually led to a second renaissance due to the presence of leading scientists and humanists like Alessandro Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Camillo Golgi among others.
In 1815, it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence (1859) and the unification of Italy one year later.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html," A drawback from the riboregulated system is that the amplitude of the signal corresponds to the amplitude of the noise in the non-riboregulated system.
The experimental design also allowed us to detect eventual cross-talk with other signaling molecules, the one corresponding to the las system and the one corresponding to the rhl system. No cross-talk was observed with the signaling molecule of the rhl system. However, the las system signaling molecule activated the Lux promoter. We chose to model this cross-talk, which corresponds to the induction of a promoter, by an Hill function. This fitting allowed us to verify that the Hill function was adapted to describe a cross-talk phenomena. The derived parameters indicated that the concentration in the las signaling molecule had to be high in order to have an effect on our system (It was two orders of magnitude away from the needed concentration of AHL to activate the system). Nevertheless, once activated, the effects of these crosstalk are not to be neglected. Check the following article for more information on the experimental setting.
These results are promising and we look forward to fit the dynamic data of this system.

First cross talk experiments
Friday, 11th August
After having constructed the necessary regulator and sensor plasmids we were able to start first cross talk experiments. Therefore we transformed competent cells with different combinations of regulator and sensor plasmids. One example would be the strain siG0024 which contains the regulator plasmid piG0041 producing LuxR under a constitutive promoter and the sensor plasmid piG0051 that encodes for sfGFP. The latter is under control of a pluxR promoter, hence it will be transcribed in the presence of LuxR and Lux. To assess crosstalk and leakiness we conducted multiple experiments: after adding one of the three AHLs to the cultures we analyzed the raise in sfGFP production using a microtiterplate reader. In a first step we measured the dose"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#PostRegionals_-_-_TEXT.html," the predictions put forward by our modelling we ensured that our protein samples were balanced in order to have the same number ferritin cores in each sample. The catalytic activity of these proteins was then compared. From the data gathered we saw that the Prussian blue ferritin with fused coils (even if TALES are additionally bound to the ferritin via coils) was more effective as a reporter than having the TALE proteins directly fused to the ferritin nanoparticle (Figure 19). The results from this experiment suggest that the predictions made by our model were correct. Using coils however alleviates this issue as these coils are small and would not interfere in the ferritin self-assembly but can be used to attach our TALES to create the FerriTALE.
Figure 19. Samples of our parts that were converted to Prussian Blue ferritin were mole balanced in order to ensure that the same number of effective ferritin cores are present in every sample. Additionally the ferritin-coil fusion was incubated with the TALE-coil fusion part in order to allow their binding for a separate trial. Negative controls include unconverted recombinant ferritin, bovine serum albumin and a substrate only control. Samples were incubated with a TMB substrate solution for 10 minutes at a pH of 5.6. Absorbance readings were taken at the 10 minute time-point at a wavelength of 650 nm. An ANOVA (analysis of variance) was performed upon the values to determine that there was statistical difference in the data gathered (based off of three replicates). A t-test was then performed which determined that the * columns are significantly different from the ** column (p=0.0012). Neither * column is significantly different from each other (p=0.67).
Our Final System: Putting it all together  
Can we successfully capture our DNA with our detectors with specificity and report it?
Finally, we wanted to see if the TALE capture assay works (figure 17). In order to do this, we blotted TALEB fused to a K coil ( BBa_K1189030 ) was blotted on a nitrocellulose strip. Subsequently the strips were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST buffer. The strips were then washed and soaked in a solution containing [A] and [B] on the same plasmid( BBa_K1189006 ). The strips were then washed again with TALE binding buffer and soaked in a solution containing TALEA+β-lac ( BBa_K1189031 ). Then a blot dot was done"

Genetic Circuit
The SyntheticBiology.org website defines Synthetic Biology as:
A) the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and B) the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.
In our case, we did both! When it comes to the modelling, we have successfully designed and constructed a whole new system, based on new and existing biological parts.
The challenges around the biological systems are the following, and summarise the scope of the formation of the iGEM competition:
• Defining the device physics of molecular components
• Building and simulating models
• Using defined components from a standard library (biobricks)
• Building new biological entities based on quantitatively predictive designs
Mathematical Equations
The design of a biological system should include all the information needed to describe what is happening within the cell (Carlson, 2010). That is why a set of mathematical equations were developed to describe the system's performance and the simulations, based on these equations, could be visualised.
The cartoon description used to describe the protein expression as a result of the transcription of DNA into RNA by polymerase which is in turn translated into protein. The ribosomes, which are not included in the animation, play an important role in the production of the proteins, according to the “central dogma”, defined by Francis Crick in 1957 that information flows from DNA to RNA to protein.
The genetic switch, that we aimed to build in the bacterium E.coli, was to be independent of the application of a chemical signal, such as IPTG, that would induce the cells to start"

1mL of 50% His-Select Ni resin, was washed according to the Purification protocol. Clarified lysate of dxCas9-Tn5 protein was added to the washed His-Select Ni resin and incubated with gentle mixing for 60minutes at 4 ℃. The His-Select Ni resin was washed with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 5mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH8), and eluded with with 6* 500μL (6CV) of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH8) at 4 ℃, according to the Purification protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the dxCas9-Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain. Sadly no picture was taken. The results showed that the fusion protein would not bind to the column material. It was decided to do another purification, but with a lower concentration of Imidazole.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"

Tel-Hai,2017,Team:Tel-Hai#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," manifest spanning the world of ethics, covering subjects from the history of ethics to modern day implications. We read this text with guidance from Dr. Meshi Ori   and were inspired to write our own ethical guidelines. The insight we gained by reading their ethical standpoint inspired us to view our research in a different light, emphasizing ethics as a major component of our project.
Then came the time for our teams to meet and discuss in person. The session began with each team introducing its members and project and this is where we discovered that our projects share an important characteristic - their modular nature. This refers to the respective projects’ design, as a basic concept that may be applicable in other various contexts. Dr.Meshi began the meeting with walking us through the multi-faceted world of ethics, from the very arcane to the mundane. By doing so, we created a common language with which to discuss the ethical perspectives of our corresponding projects. Dr. Meshi enlightened the Technion team that, with the great depth their booklet goes into, it lacks a practical approach. Talking about ethics is a venerable pursuit, but in order to make our world a better place, we need to implement ethics in our daily reality.
Our benefit from this collaboration was the inspiration we gleaned from their book, which allowed us to draft our own take on ethics in general and how it pertains to our project. Thinking about our project with this newfound perspective, we reevaluated our role in the education for responsible alcohol consumption.
Dr.Ayelet Shavit then led a dialogue meant to challenge our perception of lab work, urging us to question all that we take for granted in terms of what we do every single day in the lab. The subject of this dialogue was the connection between science and morals, a cornerstone of this connection being objectivity - how can we assess the morality of what we do if don’t view it without preconceived notions? What is the role played by politics and money, within the scientific community and how does it affect the nature of the scientific work?
Rami, our Muslim team member, had a worthwhile perspecive to add to the discussion. As a practicing and devout Muslim he isn’t allowed to drink wine, nor does he wish to, seeing as how it’s not a part of his culture whatsoever. But when the time came to choose an idea for the iGEM project, he was the first to vote for our current idea. He realized that as a scientist he is duty bound to always ask questions regarding the nature and ramifications of his work, especially from an ethical standpoint.
Thanks to these various collaborations, our project grew in"
St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Modelling-tests_-_-_TEXT.html," to “combine” the individual species-specific time series into one, which would become our biomass data.
The time period coverage offered by different datasets varied significantly.  Some datasets included biomass data from 1874 to 2005; while others gave information for the years 1990 to 2006.
FAO provided fish catch data from 1950, hence it was possible for us to run our model only from this date onwards.  However, it was important that we could compare model predictions with ‘real’ data for as many years as possible, before we could use our model to predict future results.  We, thus, chose 1950 as the baseline of our equation.  The nature of our model, as a delay differential equation, meant that we had to have biomass data for 1-4 years (the average time for a fish to reach maturity) before 1950.
Chart: Datasets spanning different time periods
2/5 Extrapolating datasets between 1932 and 2006
The number of datasets present at 1932 was approximately the same as at 1945. Since the number of datasets influences the quality of extrapolation (refer to “How does extrapolation of datasets work?”), we could extrapolate just as well back to 1932 as we could to 1945.
The upper boundary of extrapolation was set to 2006, since after 2006, the number of datasets with information decreased rapidly.
Chart: The ""standard"" biomass sets
3/5 How does extrapolation of datasets work?
We termed those sets that had data for at least all years between 1932 and 2006 the “Standard Sets”.  For the datasets requiring extrapolation, we assumed that the population of the species described by these datasets varied between 1932 and the first year of the dataset in a proportional way to the way in which the sum of the biomass of the standard sets varied during that time period.  It is for this reason that it was extremely important, when searching for datasets, that we included as many as possible in our “Standard Sets” and our Standard Sets described species from many different temperate zones.
Chart: Extrapolated datasets
4/5 Combining the datasets
Once the charts were extrapolated from 1932 to 2006, we had 234 individual data sets. In order to combine them, we summed up all dataset values at each year. Since the data we had is only a fraction of the total world fish population (although, a representative one), there was a need to upscale it. We referred to Vill"

Proyecto Greenhardtii
La Tierra es un sistema que se mantiene constantemente en equilibrio, existiendo ciclos para reutilizar los materiales que en ella existen. Particularmente, el ciclo del carbono ocurre entre organismos fotosintéticos y heterótrofos. El primer grupo nombrado consume dióxido de carbono y produce azúcares, mientras que el segundo, consume azúcares y libera CO2. Pero actualmente, este equilibrio se ve desplazado por la quema de combustibles fósiles y la pérdida de áreas verdes hacia la acumulación de CO2 en la atmósfera. El incremento de las concentraciones de este gas causa el conocido efecto invernadero a una escala planetaria, evitando que escape calor desde el aire y acumulándose en la Tierra, generando un incremento de las temperaturas.
Ante esta emergencia, como equipo iGEM UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB, hemos pensado en mejorar una estrategia de captura dióxido de carbono, y a la vez producir biomateriales de interés económico y/o científico. En una primera instancia, nuestro proyecto consta de 2 transformaciones a la microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, siendo la primera la inserción del gen codificante para la enzima cianobacteriana Fructosa-1,6 / Sedoheptulosa-1,7-bisfosfatasa, con el fin de optimizar el ciclo de Calvin (que regula la captación de carbono), y en la segunda transformación, el gen codificante para RFP, a modo de conocer y parametrizar el promotor inducible que se utilizará (METE). Luego, en una segunda instancia, se desea usar esa información del promotor para construir una ruta metabólica con los genes necesarios para producir biomateriales.
Por otra parte, nos hemos propuesto poder entender

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," future iGEM teams. Still, our main goal was the in vitro production of a reporter protein as necessary condition to create a cell-free biosensor. To be up to date in a research area that evolves at a fast pace, we gathered literature and information. Furthermore, we asked two experts in the field of in vitro transcription and translation, who gave us valuable hints and comments for our preliminary experiments: Mr. Zachary Z. Sun, PhD candidate at California Institute of Technology, and Michael Jewett, PhD from Northwestern University.
Preliminary Experiments
What we aimed for
With only theoretical knowledge from literature and hints from experts, our first ambitious goal was to be able to produce the reporter protein sfGFP completely in vitro. The crude extract from E. coli cells should provide us with the molecular machinery, and we should add other compounds like energy source, amino acids and DNA template.
What we used to reach the aim
To check if protein production occured we used a plate reader to measure fluorescence signals. To prevent protein degradation in our reaction, we tried extract from two E. coli strains designed to express proteins: ER2566 and KRX . Both have been genetically engineered for very low endogenous protease activity and possess genomic coded polymerase of bacteriophage T7. T7 polymerase is a monomer, very specific to its promoter and more stable than bacterial polymerases ( Sousa and Mukherjee, 2003 ), which makes it perfectly suited for in vitro transcription.
How we started
To extract the molecular machinery needed for in vitro transcription and translation from E. coli cells, they have to be cultivated and harvested first. For optimal yield of ribosomes, cell harvest should in general be performed at mid- to late exponential growth phase ( Smith et al. 2014 ). At this stage of growth, the cells would have a highly active translation machinery. We therefore started to measure growth curves for the strains ER2566 and KRX at 100 mL scale in shaking flasks.
Growth curves of the two E. coli strains ER2566 and KRX. Induction of T7-polymerase was facilitated by adding IPTG to the ER2566 culture and rhamnose to the KRX culture, respectively. For details see notebook .
We observed that induction of T7-polymerase expression at OD600 = 0.8-1.4 was not critical for growth behaviour. Our conclusion was that a cell harvest at an OD600 = 3-4 would be optimal. At this time of cultivation there would be enough cell mass for the following purification steps"

4. Through analysis of gray, the match curve shows the dsRNA degradation trend differs when storage in bio-clay and dd water.
Figure 4: The compreson of dsRNA degradation when storage in bio-clay and dd water.
Results shows that bio-clay(particle diameter is 172nm) can effectively slow down the speed of dsRNA degradation.
Discussion
RNAi differs widely in different plants species, as expectation, the R2 of figure one is too low to give a credible and precise data analysis, but there still a trend could be referred. We found that in almost species when dsRNA length is shorter than 600 base pairs, it can efficiently silence target gene and finally we designed disturbed dsRNA length around 600bp in our experiments.
About bio-clay, the gel picture shows which could slow down the degradation of dsRNA. It gave us a direction in downstream application design.

Motivation
We wish our Bio-pesticide project could be brought to the market one day. And for this vision, we need know the actual dosage of dsRNA should be applied in the real crop fileds.
Different fields vary in acreage and weeds amount etc. Based on these variates, we predicted minimum application dosage of dsRNA in areas of China.
Methodology
We used this formula to describe the dsRNA dosage in different areas.     \[ W_{dsRNA} = S_{field}\frac{V_{plant}}{V_{field}} \times P \times \vartheta \]
Where
\( W_{dsRNA} = \) total mass of dsRNA should be used

The sgp30 have a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it  for purification.
Plan B
The construct was optimized for E. coli BL21. Strategy B consists of producing a soluble, mutated alpha chain receptor gp80 attached to novel signal peptides for secretion to the media. The mutated receptor will act as an antagonist protein. It will associate with IL-6 forming the IL6-alpha receptor gp80 complex but it will not bind with human gp130, thus, blocking the inflammation pathway by inhibiting the formation of IL-6-alpha receptor gp80-gp130 complex [3].
Composite part Plan B : BBa_K2760011
The system is first regulated by the pBAD promoter, which allows to induce expression with L-arabinose of the NsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter) and regulate then,  the expression of mutated gp80 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and mCherry will help us corroborate expression of both promoter systems. iLOV will be attached to the pBAD-NsrR system and mCherry to the PyeaR-mutated gp80 system. The mutated gp80 has a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it for purification purposes. It is also attached to a signal peptide for excretion into the media.
Construct for SP1-NSP4 characterization in E. coli
This construct is meant to be used in characterizations of the signal peptide SP1-NSP4. This peptide should be excreted into the media by the Sec-dependent (Sec) secretion pathway, the general secretion E. coli route. When these signal peptides are linked to the N-terminus of recombinant proteins, they are critical for translocation and secretion of proteins [1].
Construct for SP1-NSP4 : BBa_K2760019
This plasmid expression vector has a T7 promoter (BBa_I712074),induced by IPTG, and contains a T7 medium strength RBS for E. coli, the signal peptide SP1-NSP4, iLOV (BBa_K2760024) as the fluorescent marker with a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to it; and a double terminator (BBa_B0015).

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#Improving Flip Flop_-_-_TEXT.html,"igation of the iGEM vectors and asRNA device was unsuccessful, so that we will try it again in September.
Week 6
After three weeks, we return to work with renewed energy! We start checking the hypothetical ΔClpX ΔRybB strain. We make the PCR very carefully, designing the proper controls and putting our hopes in it. What a relief that at least one of the 20 colonies tested was positive! We got a ΔClpX /ΔRybB strain! The next step is to remove the selective marker used to provoke the delection. We will express a flipase which recombines FRT sequences. These FRT sequences are flanking the marker, so in this way, the strain will  be sensitive to this marker.
We try again the ligation step but we won’t be able to see the results until  next week. Once again, we tried the electro-transformation and this failed again.  No more words…
Week 7
Besides, since we had ran out of fragments to electropore our bacteria, we amplifyed the pKD3 and pKD4 markers.  We tried to electroporate the bacteria with the fragments at the end of the week. On Monday we will see the results (hopefully positive, this would be the last time we will try that protocol).
Also we checked three possible positive colonies which could have lost the marker (cloramfenicol resistance) and the F’plasmid. We have no results yet, next week we will obtain full details about our final strain.
Week 8
This week we were working hard trying to arrive well to deadlines.
On the one hand, finally we got a ΔSspb/ΔRybB!. It was really hard but at the end we got it. After PCR checking, we could say we had our strain. Now, we are removing the kanamicine resistance with the flipase.
On the other hand, Invitrogen sent us our improved flipflop. We are still cloning it into psB1C3 vector.  We’re hurring up!! Just checking the ligations!
This is a successful week! We hope to have some experimental results for jamboree!
Weeks 8, 9 and 10
After Amsterdam Jamboree we arrived with much more energy and ready to start with the work. First of all, we had to make up our strain. We had two problems, (1) the strain had a F plasmid with a LacI inside and (2) we should check our strain"

Clearing Zone Assay
Clearing zone experiment was conducted to semi-quantitatively test the ability of PhaZ1 to break down P3HB. PhaZ1 cell lysate was tested on a P3HB LB agar plate. The protocol can be found here .
PhaZ1 showing P3HB degradation ability by generating a clear zone on a P3HB LB agar plate. A. No difference between empty vector cell lysate and PhaZ1 cell lysate right after they were pipetted into the wells. B. PhaZ1 in the cell lysate started to clear P3HB around the well after 1 day. C. PhaZ1 created a clear zone around the well after 3 days, whereas it was still cloudy around the empty vector cell lysate well. Figure by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM
3HB assay
In order to show that phaZ1 is functional, we have measured the amount of 3HB monomers produced due to the degradation of the polymer, when incubated with the enzyme. We have repurposed a 3HB colorimetric assay kit that is used for 3HB detection from animal tissue and bodily fluid samples. Please see the [ https://2013.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/ Protocols#3HB_assay protocol] and the data sections for details.
PhaZ1 treatment of P3HB sample increases the amount of 3HB monomer going into sulution. Both of the sample were incubated at 37°C  sahking for 15 hours.
It is clear from our results that enzyme treatment produces a lot more 3HB than the control. We do expect to see some background "

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture

E. coli Extended Ribosome Binding Site
A derivative of the RBS found in gene 10 of the T7 bacteriophage, this 23 base pair sequence rich in A’s & T’s enhances ribosome binding to boost expression.
YncM Tag
The YNCM tag is a 12 amino acid sequence whose presence on the N-terminus of the protein targets it for secretion out of the cell into the surrounding media via the Sec pathway in Bacillus subtilis. YNCM was chosen because it was recently shown to be massively successful in targeting recombinant protein for secretion compared to a library of other signal peptides. Additionally, this was shown in B. subtilis strain WB600, which is the bacteria that our WB800 strain was derived from. So we expect that it should give us similar success in secretion of our constructs. (Guan et. al. 2016)
His Tag
We have included a tag comprised of 6 sequential histidines that form a vital aspect of our purification technique using affinity chromatography. Histidine’s high attraction to metal ions will cause the entire protein, insulin and all, to bind to a nickel column and separate it from the other proteins of the cell"

In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:
State of system has changed to 'TetR' state from 'LacI' state after adding inducer IPTG at 40000s.
The legend used in the figure is not clear. 13:DNA;(lacI153)4, 11:DNA;(tetR154)2, and 14:DNA;(lacI153)4;(tetR154)2 means binding products of initial plasmid with lacI tetramer at site pLacI gene, with tetR dimer at site pTet gene, and with lacI tetramer and tetR dimer both, respectively. At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually.

When setting the appropriate pH, the solution is mixed with the mixer in order to give a homogenous solution. 400g of the solution is weighted in the bioreactor and purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes without being closed. Set a mechanic mixer with one pipe, leading directly into inoculum, and one for measuring the products in bioreactors. The bioreactors were then purged again, this time with argon for 5 minutes. Argon is used because it ensures anaerobic environment alike nitrogen, and because it does not form compounds with the substances in inoculum. The protocol is the same as above mentioned with some modifications: two bioreactors were ‘blind’ without any added glucose that serves as control bioreactors and 6 bioreactors contained 2 g of glucose per 400 g of solution (inoculum + deionized water). 200 ml of sample with adjusted pH at 5.7 got frozen.
Preparation of samples for HLPC measurements
The syringe is placed on the neck of the plastic tube of bioreactor and then you open the valve of the tube and take the sample (approximately 2 ml). Next, close the valve and transmit the sample into microcentrifuge tubes that had to be marked with the time and date of sampling. The volume of the taken sample is constantly recorded to prevent: lest the removed solution from affecting the final production. Before proceeding on, the plastic tube has to be purged with argon, to prevent inoculum from staying inside the tube and preventing the sampling in advance.  Be careful; use only the amount of argon that corresponds the volume of the plastic tube so no argon is purged in the sample.
Transmit the sample in the microcentrifuge tubes and weigh them.  One microcentrifuge tube with the water, that weights the same as a sampling microcentrifuge tube, must be prepared for centrifugation. In the centrifuge, each microcetrifuge tube has to have the complementary tube that weights the same and it is placed in the hole opposite the hole with the sample in it. Microfuges tubes are centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10 000 rotations per minute with intent to remove solid substances. 0.3 ml of the supernatant is then diluted with 2.7 ml of distilled water and filtrated approximately 1 ml – 1.5 ml into vials.

Whole-cell catalysis
Whole cell catalysis means using complete biological organisms (ie, whole cells, tissues or even individuals) as a catalyst.             The essence is using enzymes in cells for catalysis. The method is a kind of biocatalytic technology between             fermentation and extract enzyme for catalysis. The advantage of whole cell catalysis is that the intracellular             complete multi-enzyme system can achieve the cascade reaction of enzyme, so as to make up the deficiency of cascade             reaction in reaction which only use pure enzyme and improve the catalytic efficiency. While eliminating the complex             process in enzyme purification, it is easier to carry out the reaction and lower production costs.

Concordia,2016,Team:Concordia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". coli from toxin invasion.  Here is a general layout of the experimental design:
NAWI-Graz had sent us their “Blue plasmid” construct. This plasmid contains the gene coding for a blue chromoprotein, constitutively expressed. It also contains the sequences for toxin ccdB and antitoxin ccdA. CcdB, which inhibits DNA gyrase, is known to be secreted in the media, while ccdA remains in the cell. The plasmids also contains the sequence for DAM-Methylase, which NAWI-Graz uses in their project as a mutation-inducer for their purposes.
The first step of the plan was to transform the DNA into DH5ɑ E. coli cells, followed by a colony PCR to confirm the plasmid presence. The production of the toxin and the antitoxin are induced using IPTG, and the toxin would be secreted in the growth media. Theoretically, this toxin could be isolated from the cells through centrifugation, as they would stay in the growth media while the cells would be pelleted. This media containing the toxin would be used for a different type of experiment, as shown below.
Our intention was to determine whether or not nanoparticle-coated cells would protect against a toxin.We hypothesized that our nanoparticle-coated cells would offer some sort of protection of cells from the toxin. We based this hypothesis on the idea that our silver-coated E. coli cells would have altered abilities to pump external substances into the cell. Our nanoparticles, which are citrate-capped and coated and neutralized using a cationic polymer, are evenly distributed in a non-selective manner along the surface of E. coli cells.
This experiment would be performed by monitoring the difference in optical density over time of our coated cells in contact with toxin. The necessary controls would be uncoated E. coli cells in contact with the toxin (to confirm toxin activity), and both coated and uncoated E. coli without toxin.
Unfortunately, we could not complete this experiment, as we had difficulty transforming the Blue Plasmid into E. coli. We likely diluted the received DNA in too much water since the measured DNA concentration was below the linear range of our spectrophotometer, leading to multiple failed transformations. Another possible reason for low transformation is that the toxin is under the regulation of a lac promoter and operator, which have some leaky expression. If the antitoxin is not expressed while some toxin is expressed, this may be killing the host cell, which does not endogenously"

OVERVIEW
HKUST iGEM understands the risk of working in the lab and intends to take all necessary measurements and precautions to prioritize the safety of our iGEM members. Following this matter, we have assigned the following procedures below.
LABORATORY SAFETY CONCERN
Our project uses SYBR Safe and Midori Green as our gel electrophoresis stain. However, we utilizes the same gel imaging machine with gels from the other lab that uses Ethidium bromide, which is a very harmful carcinogenic chemical. We use blue light for gel visualization. Our project also involves media culture with antibiotics that can be lethal in large amount. For sterilization, we use ethanol 70% that can be dangerous in large doses in the long term.
SAFETY PROTOCOL
During the wet lab, all lab members were instructed to always wear disposable nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, long pants, use eyes protection under the blue light gel visualization. Gloves are disposed each time we finished the lab. The glasses used in the experiments must be washed everyday after use. All the biohazard waste is autoclaved and transported to another facility which is responsible for regulating the biological wastes. Hand soap with antibacterial protection is provided to wash our hand thoroughly. Each module has one person in charge to better ensure the safety.
Our laboratories in HKUST are compatible for biosafety level 2. Our lab is equipped with biosafety cabinet with HEPA filter, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, flame-retardant benches, spill kits, safety showers and eye-washer. Our wet lab experiments are all performed under the supervision of our supervisor, Dr. Jessica Tang. At the same time, all of our reagents and materials are kept in a safe container with specific sign and precautions to handle. Each tube is labeled and sealed off before putting it together with other reagents. We put our media culture in a different refrigerator from the regular substance to prevent any unwanted reagents from contamination. We always maintained a clean workplace and tidied up after use.
SAFETY ORGANISMS
Our experiment is entirely safe, involving"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," interesting to note that bacteria with BBa_K2764001, which has the highest promoter strength, could be able to have the highest growth rate compared with the other parts, and can even surpass the growth of the control in the second half of the experiment. Supposedly, the more AlkL is expressed, the more toxic the overall effect to the host is. That said, bacteria with BBa_K2764001 should have the weakest growth and BBa_K2764003 the strongest. Contrary to expectations, that is not what we observed.
We hypothesize that bacteria with BBa_K2764001 instead has the highest growth rate because AlkL also imports long chain fatty acids from the LB medium it was seeded in. LB itself contains yeast extract, which is obtained from the cell content of yeast, will contain long chain fatty acids. Similar to how FadL, a native E. coli fatty acid transporter, can sometimes mistakenly import medium chain alkanes into the cell, perhaps the AlkL in our transformed bacteria can also mistakenly import long chains of fatty acids, which can be β-oxidized in the cell’s native system as a nutrient. This will aid in the growth of the bacteria instead. As such, it may be that while certain amounts of AlkL produced by the cell inhibits cell growth, larger amounts of fatty acids are still imported into the cell because of it, which will boost cell growth. It is possible that in this push-and-pull scenario, the effect of boosting cell growth is more favored than the inhibition when more fatty acids are imported and this enables net cell growth to be slowly achieved over time. This is supported by the fact that the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 is initially lower than the growth of control before rising slowly to overtake it, showing that the cell growth is slowly favored over time.
For the growth rate of BBa_K2764003 bacteria, there is relatively less AlkL but it seems it is already enough to inhibit growth to a large extent. While there is less AlkL, there is also less fatty acid transported, so perhaps in this push-and-pull scenario, inhibition of cell growth is favored over boosting of cell growth as not enough fatty acids are imported into the cell to offset the toxic effect of AlkL. It may be that from T=0 to T=1, the AlkL had not been expressed enough to reach toxic levels, so the growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764003 is similar to the rest. Then, after T=2, the amount of Al"

Next Steps
Demonstrate expression and activity of acdS in FCP2-01
Develop a regulation system based on abscisic acid to turn on only in drought
Inoculate B. distachyon and measure effects of FCP2-01 expressing acdS on plant growth and yield under osmotic stresses
Test transformation protocol on additional endophytic isolates of grasses
Evaluate ability for endophytic bacteria to enter roots, and how endophytic fungi may affect this process
Test species specificity of FCP2-01 and ability to horizontally transmit between a plant and a neighbor
Pathogenicity screens of FCP2-01 and more complete evaluation of antibiotic resistance
Review genomes of Enterobacter ludwigii for insights into plasmid stability and other factors affecting biotechnology potential
Field trials of FCP2-01 (if the strain is cleared as safe) to test persistence and physiological effects in real-world applications
Project Achievements
Successful Results
Isolation and screening of endophytic bacterial isolates provided a diversity of strains and for synthetic biology experimentation.
A transformation protocol was developed for a endophytic bacteria, which provides a chassis for affecting plant physiology without engineering the plant
Reinfection and persistence were observed in a distantly related grass 51.6 ± 7.9 (SD) million years since divergence (Vicentini et al. 2008). FCP2-01 is capable of stably expressing a fusion protein of acdS and GFP for at least 4 weeks in the plant.
Modeling
Unsuccessful results
Most transformations did not work. We were unable to transform and express any of our vectors in Pseudomonas spp. Attempts at transformation via conjugation were also unsuccessful.
Due to timeline disruptions by unviable seeds, we were unable to evaluate the effect of engineered FCP2-01 on plant growth
None of our engineered strain could grow with ACC as the only available nitrogen source. It is possible that the attachment of a GFP tag (used for identifying transformed colonies and visualizing bacteria in and on roots) disrupted the quaternary structure of the ACC deaminase"
Tokyo_Tech,2013,Team:Tokyo Tech#Experiment#RM-lac Hybrid Promoter Assay_-_-_TEXT.html," Our mathematical model (Fig. 3-7-4) shows the pulse wave which the temporal pattern for plant hormone production should achieve (details about this model can be found here ). While the RM/lac hybrid promoter activation by CI is a single-step reaction, the repression by LacI is a two-step reaction.  Thus, the activation of the RM/lac hybrid promoter is faster than the repression.  This time lag between the activation and the repression is important for generating a temporal pattern of plant hormone production.

Fig. 3-7-3. Our newly designed hybrid promoter
Fig. 3-7-4. Our mathematical model for temporal pattern generation
As a first step to achieve this system with an incoherent feed forward loop, we constructed a circuit shown in Fig. 3-7-5 to confirm that our new RM/lac hybrid promoter actually works.  We set GFP as a reporter of the RM/lac hybrid promoter and introduced the part into E. coli . We verified that our RM/lac hybrid promoter was activated by CI and repressed by LacI with the following assay.

Silk fibers from yesterday were soaked overnight in their respective coagulation baths (isopropanol and ethanol)
Today, we placed the fibers in ddH2O to rinse them
Took some samples onto microscope slides in order to image
Left the rest of the fibers on weigh boats to dry off
The silk is incredibly difficult to handle. We absolutely need a mechanical draw in order to handle the fibers better in the future!
Fibers were extremely brittle.
Overview of these fibers
15% w/v silk dope
Spun into 70% v/v ethanol or isopropanol
Used a 1 mL syringe attached to 0.0005 inch inner diameter PEEK tubing
extruded at a nominal rate of 6 uL/min on the syringe pump
After spinning, left in coagulation bath overnight
Then bathed in water
Then taken out and left to dry
Overall, it seems so far that ethanol is better than isopropanol as a coagulation bath. However, until we incorporate a mechanical post-spin draw, we can't say for sure.
Images of Silk spun into isopropanol
4x magnification
10x magnification
20x magnification

Those appear to be cracks
20x magnification
Notice the split: we were probably imaging multiple fibers, instead of one. This shows how difficult it is to handle individual fibers while they're still wet!
40x magnification
This is the edge of the fiber where we broke it.

Notice how compared to the isopropanol spun fiber, the morphology is much more smooth and uniform for the ethanol fiber. I wonder how these would look under electron microscopy?

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," things we can use for our project and we had interesting conversations with many technologists about our project. In the evening we have presented our own project. Watch the entire presentation on our YouTube channel. Most of the attendees had no biological background and therefore we started with a basic lecture about synthetic biology. During the presentation we asked them multiple question about their opinion about synthetic biology and it appeared that more than 90% of the attendees have a positive outlook towards synthetic biology. After this we off course discussed our project and fortunately most people were very enthusiastic. We are happy that also people from outside our research field are enthusiastic about our project and about synthetic biology in general.
BESSENSAP
The largest Dutch national conference where scientists, journalists and other science communicators could meet up was this year once again held in Amsterdam. As small-scale scientists, participants of iGEM, and of course as scientists of the future, we participated in the Bessensap conference.
Starting by pitching our project to the audience, we gained positive feedback from interested parties. The day was filled with inspiring talks and workshops. For example the keynote speaker talked about activism in science, arguing all scientists should be activists and changing the future for the better. For this, examples were given showing the importance of communication of different perceptions. This also holds for the iGEM competition, where this immediately could be used in our Policy and Practice. Concluding this inspiring day, a final collaboration in public relations was initiated.
NBC WAGENINGEN
The Netherlands Biotechnology Conference (NBC) is the largest conference for researchers and companies related to biotechnology. This year’s edition with the theme “next level biotechnology” was held in Wageningen. Other than inspiring talks and discussions, we got to meet up with other iGEM teams from the Netherlands. It was interesting to see what the other teams picked as a topic and how they enjoyed the first period of iGEM so far. Overall, it was an informative day and we are looking forward to see the other teams again!

2. Future scientists — from kindergarten to college
To propagate synthetic biology and share the fun of iGEM with future synthetic biologists, we organized a series of activities and lectures to students of all ages. Kindergarten: A mini-lab For kids in kindergarten, we host a mini-biolab to introduce some basic concepts regarding microorganisms in an interesting way. Moreover, we helped the lovely children cultivate their interest in synthetic biology as well as  inform them of the significance of keeping personal hygiene.  PS: Safety is guaranteed during this activity.
Canton primary school: Volunteer teaching When our team is working as volunteer teacher in rural areas of Canton, we also always bear the responsibility of sharing the idea of iGEM to more people. In Canton, to broaden their horizon to a grander world, our deliver introduced our project and some basic situations of iGEM to hundreds of seated students from primary school and junior high school. Though due to the limit of equipment and knowledge, they could not be iGEMers now, we have planted seeds of synthetic biology in their naïve heart which might grow up to a glorious tree one day in the future.
Senior High School: A newly set-up iGEM team
As for senior high school, we organized some lectures to introduce synthetic biology and our project. Firstly, we held a lecture in High School Affiliated to Fudan University (FDFZ). And this lecture gave us unexpected pleasure.
FDFZ is a well-known high school in Shanghai having a long history. And thanks to the abundant resource of Fudan University, the students of FDFZ can get easy access to top theory and technology in the science field and the atmosphere of exploring is really thick there. Thus, we reached a biology teacher in FDFZ discussing about holding a lecture in FDFZ and the possibility of establishing an iGEM high school team to help them participate in this creative competition. To attract more students to our lecture, we prepared beautiful posters for every classroom and made sufficient plans.     The outcome is more than fantastic. The number of students that came to our lecture is far over our expectation, and they were all eager to know iGEM and how to take part in it. Thus, we organized two interviews together with a teacher of FDFZ to select suitable students for future competition. In the interview, we asked about lots of things such as their basic knowledge of modern biology, experience in laboratory, the understanding of iGEM and their current ideas. To our surprise, some had attended"

Biofilms: Continued Growth of Biofilms.
Objective: Continue to determine what cleaners will destroy/degrade biofilms. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Results: The biofilms did not grow on any of the plates as there was no red ring. Using fresh RFP cultures might fix this issue because the cultures we had used were prepared earlier in the month.

Biofilms: Continued Growth of Biofilms
Objective: The biofilms made yesterday did not work, so fresh RFP cultures were prepared tonight for future biofilm testing. Colonies were picked from a streaked plate of RFP and placed in 5 mL of LB. 5 μL of KAN was added to each tube. Two picked colonies were prepared and left overnight in the 37˚C shaker.
