Westminster,2013,Team:Westminster#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," domains are opposite in the 2 enzymes suggesting the two enzymes degrade the polymer from different ends, ChiA from the reducing end and ChiB from the non-reducing end.   Chi C on the other hand is an endo-acting non progressive chitinase which attacks the chitin polymer by making random cuts in the more amorphous regions of the substrate opening these regions for attacks from ChiA and ChiB. ChiA and ChiB are progressive chitinase’s which degrade chitin from opposite ends.
The chitinases cleave the substrate (insoluble polysaccharide) at the α and  β-1,4 bonds in chitin and chito-oligosaccharides producing chitobiose.

Site-directed Mutagenisis
One of the most common methods for removing restrinction sites withing gene sequences is to use site-directed mutagenisis – such as the Stratagen method. The Stratagene method uses a forward primer which is 25-45 bases in length and contains the mutation in the centr of the primer sequence. The reverse primer is the complement of this primer. Primers have a minimum GC content of 40% and end in one or more C’s or G’s.
A high-fidelity long range polymerase is required as the whole plasmid is copied in the reaction. The reaction can be visualised as below.

Collaborations
We feel that collaboration within the scientific community is key for pushing forward beyond frontiers and catalysing innovation. Nothing exemplifies this more than the opensource nature of iGEM. As such, we enjoyed fully embracing the spirit of cooperation that the competition embodies. Click the logos above for more details.
TU Eindhoven
We collaborated with Eindhoven iGEM in the writing of a Cloning Guide , which is a useful tool for future iGEM teams to have an overview of all cloning techniques currently used in every lab around the world.
UCL
UCL iGEM 2015 is working on the development of probiotics and has looked into several pathways, such as the serotonin, Dopamine, GABA and Acetylcholine pathways. To help them, we introduced their pathways into our expression system in the form of a modeling collaboration. We simulated the expression of the different pathways and had some astonishing results. The incorporation of their pathways into our modeling system gave us valuable data of how the system needs to be changed to be capable of different pathways.  Furthermore as UCL had already surpassed their limits from IDT, we helped them by ordering two gBlocks for them using our oligo card.
NRP-UEA-Norwich
Norwich iGEM 2015 is working on the treatment of colon cancer and has different approaches. One is to introduce the butyrate pathway into probiotics. For the collaboration the butyrate pathway was incorporated into the iGEM Manchester-Graz expression system model to observe the expression of butyrate under the control of our system. We obtained useful data for Norwich and it helped us to understand further how the system is dealing with pathways that consist of several enzymes.
Paris Saclay
We took part in Paris Saclay iGEM 2015 survey about Bio Safety and got granted a Badge for our help.
Warwick
Together with Warwick iGEM we planned and attended an outreach event at Newman College in Oldham. During several Skype conversations we designed lessons about studying science at university and Synthetic Biology which we then presented together.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"
UCSF,2010,Team:UCSF#Notes#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," we create enhanced killing through the use of synthetic biology. We split into two teams and brainstormed and then we presented our designs to the entire group. From the first challenge we proposed to use combinations of activating and inhibitor modules on chimeric antigen receptors to create gates such as an ANDN (AND NOT) gate; these devices would mimic the self vs. cancer responses of natural receptors on NK cells. However our devices could be engineered to detect any cancer antigen for which an antibody could be raised. Although individual activating CARs had been reported by others, no one had used them in combination to create logic gates. For the second challenge we presented several ways to enhance cell killing by adding multiple signaling domains to one CAR receptor and also by engineering new granule components to overcome cancer resistance.
After the team challenge, the real work started. We were challenged to propose, list, and design the actual components of our devices. We generated lists and then in discussion and brainstorming with our advisors, we set a priority list for construction. We followed the same modular cloning to create our devices using the restriction enzyme AarI used by last year’s team. Advisors in the CPL ordered the clones we decided upon primarily from Open Biosystems. Once they arrived we went to work. We sequenced the clones to be sure they were correct and then we designed PCR primers for cloning and were in charge of all aspects of device construction and analysis. During the construction of the initial  CAR devices, we came up with the idea of sending GFP to the granules of cytotoxic cells using motifs from granule proteins and started the work on this as well.
We made many devices for assay (we had a lot of ideas :) ), but unfortunately we ran into a problem with our idea to use cytotoxicity assays to measure the killing response. The problem was that the transient transfection/expression of our devices by electroporation was too low to see responses (<20% efficiency). The large amount of untransfected cells dominated the response. In brainstorming with our advisors we decided to use/substitute T cell activation assays as a reporter of potential killing response as they should be correlated. The granule loading devices were looked at by microscopy with advice and supervision of buddies and advisors. Both of these techniques would allow us to look at transient transfected cell responses without a lot of background response from untransfected cells.
With all of this, we were only able to run a few experiments before the summer was over. We were only able to validate two ANDN gates and the loading of GFP into granules. It’s too bad that the killing"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

The yellow samples, indicate that no starch is present  - While there are black spots observed in some samples it is likely that these are due to damage from infiltration rather than starch. Black stain indicates the presence of starch. The level of staining doesn’t appear to differ between the different leaves and their conditions, suggesting that neither the infiltration process, or the expression of acyltransferases, affects starch production in leaves.
These results indicate that neither the infiltration process or the expression of putative acyl-transferases has an impact on the production of starch.

Our overall aim was to clone the coding sequences (CDSs) of the butyrate biosynthetic pathway from Coprococcus sp. L2-50 (DSM 16842) for expression in E. coli. In total the pathway contains eight coding sequences. We managed to clone the pathway that would convert butyrate into butyryl-CoA (Pathway I) and, separately, the pathway that would convert acetyl-CoA into butyryl-CoA (Pathway II).
Pathway I:
AIM:
To clone the CDSs from the BUK (butyrate kinase) and PTB (phosphotransbutyrylase) genes from Coprococcus sp. with an IPTG-inducible promoter . This BioBrick is designed catalyze the conversion of butyrate from/to butyryl-CoA. The PTB gene converts butyryl-CoA from/to butyryl-phosphate and the BUK gene converts butyrate-phosphate from/to butyrate.
METHOD:
The CDS of the PTB and BUK coding sequences were synthesised. We digested them from their shipping plasmids with XbaI and PstI.  The pSB1C3 vector was digested with EcoRI and PstI and, the BioBrick with the LacI promoter and RBS with EcoRI and SpeI (See digestion protocol). The digests were run on an agarose gel and bands were gel extracted (See gel extraction protocol). The BUK CDS was ligated into the pSB1C vector together with the IPTG-inducible promoter and RBS and the PTB CDS was added to this BioBrick to make the final pathway (Figure 1).  Transformation and colony screening was carried out as per our standard"

A Modular Approach to Constructing the Circuit
The general layout of our limiter circuit is very amenable to variation.  Each of the logical roles can be filled by a number of different parts, possibly resulting in different behavior.  This process was made especially straightforward by the modular transcriptional control elements at our disposal.  Work with these transcription factors in the Silver Lab at Harvard showed that they show efficacy in regulating a variety of promoters, including the minimal mCYC1 and the inducible pGAL1.  To extend this work further, we have constructed a library of regulable promoters for use in our network, ligating binding sites for the synthetic transcription factors onto a variety of yeast promoters.
Regulatory Regions
Minimal Promoters
mCYC was used as a minimal promoter, with all transcriptional induction and repression coming from transcription factors binding to sites ligated upstream.  We generated a variety of minimal promoters for use in the limiter system, with mCYC ligated to each of the four sets of binding sites, and three variations on mCYC ligated to two different sets of binding sites.  These will allow for construction of multiple variations on the limiter circuit.
Constitutive Promoters
In a limiter circuit with a static threshold, the Thresh. promoter above is constitutive, but also requires regulation from alpha.  To investigate the effect of changing the threshold, we ligated binding sites onto two constitutive promoters: the high-level TEF2, and the low-level ADH1.
Repressable Promoters
Work in the Silver Lab has shown success in using binding sites to regulate inducible promoters.  We have constructed two versions of the MET25 repressable promoter with binding sites, hoping to construct a limiter circuit in which we can set the threshold by varying the input concentration of"

Executive summary
aSTARice
We hope our iGEM project as application-oriented biosynthesis can serve the public., so we conducted an analysis of our ""aSTARice"" in the perspective of entrepreneurship.
After our survey and analysis, we find that the market requirement of astaxanthin is quite large. At present, astaxanthin is widely used in cosmetics and health products. Compared with collagen which is actually hard to be absorbed into human skin, astaxanthin is much better because of its easy intake and its strong effect on antioxidation as well as anti-aging. Therefore, most top cosmetics and health products are added with astaxanthin and their product forms include mask, capsule, oral liquid and so on. What's more, there is much effect on anti-cancer, preventing cancer and enhancing immunity in these products. So these kinds of products should be full of development potential in the pharmaceutical industry. With time going by, the method of harvesting astaxanthin has not been much improved. The main method of astaxanthin production is to extract from some kinds of algaes or yeasts. Because of this, the output of astaxanthin is quite low, leading to a high price in astaxanthin.
Our products consist of purified astaxanthin powder and some kinds of preliminarily-processed products (e.g. astaxanthin mask). For a better understanding of the public's thoughts, we design some particular questions concerning astaxanthin in our questionnaire about genetic modification(gm) as part of market survey. This survey on the status quo of genetically-modified food makes us think more about iGEM from our life in some degree.
After a long time of study, we already have a certain amount of awareness of social supports and legal contracts which are relevant with student entrepreneurship. During this time, we know about it that the supports from Chinese universities for those undergraduate students to carry out different kinds of entrepreneurial activities, especially those student groups with scientific or technological patent. Apart from financial support, school will also provide those groups with some opportunities to have a face-to-face talk with venture capitalists.
Industry analysis

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,", each output on the TERRA Adapter will have a set of valves for output selection. By actuating these valves in certain combinations, the TERRA Adapter selects for certain outputs while directing all others to waste.
Visit the TERRA Adapter page to learn more about how TERRA handles multi-output selection:
TERRA Adapter
To also handle multi-output chips, TERRA implements a flush protocol in between outputs to clean the nozzle tube with and prime it with the next output. To clean the nozzle tube, the TERRA must first move the plate to a corner of the plane after an output is finished dispensing so that ethanol does not contaminate the plate. A visual below demonstrates TERRA executing this protocol.
Integration with Benchtop Analytics
To accurately dispense user selected sample volumes, TERRA uses a droplet formation model to calculate dispensing times. Given a certain flow rate and tubing properties, the system calculates the dispense time per droplet and multiplies this value by the number of droplets required to fill the sample volume. Our model is located here:
Droplet Characterization
To prove that TERRA is compatible with the benchtop analytical tools, we ran a basic experiment that demonstrated the ability to detect GFP. A smiley face was dispensed onto a 96-well plate using the user interface and TERRA. The final plate was then read using the lab’s plate reader, the results demonstrate that the outputs of TERRA can be analyzed using benchtop analytics.
Now that we verified that TERRA is compatible with benchtop analytical tool, we can use a plate reader to prove that we can accurately dispense sample volumes.                  To test the model we plated a GFP gradient on a 96-well plate with TERRA using a single output microfluidic chip. The fluorescent reading of the 4x6 well gradient of three, two, and one 0.047 mL GFP droplets provides a quantitative measure of sample volume in wells.
In order to dispense different amounts of fluid into different wells, we needed to input the protocol into the UI individually per fluid volume. The resulting well-plate was analyzed in a plate reader to evaluate the accuracy of the dispensing system.
In the gradient, we observed a general decrease in fluorescence as droplets decreased. This proportional decrease, alongside video analysis, demonstrates that each third of the gradient had different sample volumes. However, the data the relative fluorescence of individual wells were inconsistent compared to the general trend. This can be attributed to GFP not diluted properly or spread evenly within the well.

This poses a troubling ethical question for clinicians and medical professionals in the field: Should they prescribe or dispense medication if they think or know that it will not be used safely? This is a decision that no medical professional should have to make, especially not in a day and age when we have the technology to completely obviate such questions. The real need, then, is to design solutions using relevant technologies that can directly address these problems.
Paper Can Help Overcome Storage and Information
Paper-based cell-free products help address the multitude of issues facing Mozambican healthcare in two ways: they can be a source of biologics and contain instructions on how to use them safely.
The stability of the paper systems (Pardee et al. 2016) obviates the need for the most stringent transportation and storage conditions. While paper still must be handled carefully, and could not be exposed to high heat for extended periods, it is a much more flexible and forgiving substrate. This increased flexibility would help reduce losses along the logistic pipeline and help ensure the quality of the final product delivered to patients.
Coupling the actual biologics with information on how to use them compounds the impact of both. One cannot travel without the other, and if the paper system is well-designed, the end user will never be without the information they need to safely and correctly use the product. This could help both the healthcare professional in the clinic to administer and store the product correctly, and the patient at home to do the same.
As an example of what a paper-based therapy for home use might look like, we created a mock-up of a Kaletra treatment passport for individual, long-term use. Kaletra is an HIV medication used to slow the progression of the disease. It is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, two protease inhibitors that are the standard of care for suppressing HIV activity and are known to be the best combination medication for treating children.
The draft booklet shown above is meant to be given to the patient by the prescribing doctor, who would fill in the details about the number of tablets per day, and any other notes they wish to include. The patient would drip water onto the target, which would initiate the reaction. They would then secure it against their body for the specified time, then simply consume the paper.
The title page contains paper sensors to indicate if the product has been damaged with heat or water. It contains a unique barcode for identification and inventory. The names of the doctor and patient can be written in on the front page, as well as the date of the prescription.

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#RNAi_-_-_TEXT.html," what the exact sequences are that will cause death in the organism when down-regulated. Just because a 100% match is required for the RNAi to work doesn’t mean that it can’t interact with and affect another area within the genome that is slightly different, impairing its function as well. Further testing of the RNAi spray would be required to determine the exact effects regarding the probability of off-target effects, but it has been shown that using a lower concentration of interfering RNAs reduces the amount of off-target effects within the genome [3].
Non-target effects are when the RNAi down-regulates a gene that is not in the intended target species. Due to the short length of interfering RNAs, there is more opportunity for sequence similarities between species. Therefore two different species could be equally likely targets of the RNAi. This means that the spray could influence the growth and function of other pests, pollinators, and crops and even cause death in these organisms. Similar to off-target effects, it is possible that due to lack of specificity a non-target species could have a sequence with a completely different function than the target which interacts with the RNAi. It is important to determine what species in agricultural communities could be affected by the chosen sequence, and what sequence similarities exist between species that are closely related to the target.
Off-target and non-target effects could potentially occur at the same time. For example, a non-target species could have short lengths of sequence similarity with F. graminearum and have its genome disrupted by the RNAi, but due to RNAi’s lack of specificity there could be off-target silencing downstream of the matching sequence within that organism’s genome.
Sequence BLAST
To examine potential off-target effects of our gene-silencing dsRNAs, we undertook an extensive comparative approach using NCBI BLAST. Areas of similarity within other genomes may result in potential silencing outside of the desired organism. We first compared our chosen sequences to the entire database of sequenced genomes. After finding minimal overlap between our sequences and any other off-target organisms, we moved on to compare specifically within humans and varietals of wheat. Again, we found no significant overlaps or risks in terms of silencing capability. Therefore, we are confident in the safety and specificity of our design platform.
Our search for potential off-target effects represents an exemplary level of attention to the safety of consumers as well as those handling and producing the dsRNA-based pesticides.
We tested our sequences against common species.

Motivation
    Communication between the scientific community and the public has been a problem. Though synthetic biology won’t “save the world”, we do not want to have its potential wasted by the misunderstanding of the public. So we organized some educational activities for the public to bridge the gap. And we also get our own perception adjusted according to their feedback.
     But as for the current solution for this problem, there are not many typical modes that can be built upon. We realized the hardness caused by this, and would like to establish a new mode for better public engagement.
 
A stall for education
    We consider that it is easier for people to understand a new idea if it is presented in a more familiar scene for them.  So we integrated our activities into local activities that people choose to participate in the weekends. We want to convey a concept that “science can be a part of their life, and their engagement do matters”.    In that way, we need to prepare some funny things to attract people’s attention. Various creative educational tools are designed by team members. We think about using a stall that integrates these tools to introduce synthetic biology and our project to the public. The stalls were put up in different places, such as the exhibition hall of STEM festival and the information hall of a science & technology museum. And we adjusted the types of the tools and the way to communicate with people in the process of activities conducting.

Risk Analysis
Just as every research project, every company and especially every startup has certain risks that they will encounter. It is important to be aware of these risks and to think about what can happen, how likely is it that it will happen and if it does happen, what the consequences are. This will give you the possibility to take measures in order to take away the risk or the minimize the potential (negative) consequences on time. There are many different types of risks, with negative consequences or positive consequences. To become successful as a company it is important to minimize the risks with negative consequences and to maximize risks with positive consequences (opportunities). We have used the risk matrix tool to analysis our possible risks with a negative consequence (Figure 7).
Figure 7: Risk matrix
Legal risks
The use of micro-organisms is associated with some specific legal risks. First of all, it is important that it is allowed to use our product outside the lab. Therefore, we have to meet several requirements and gain the necessary safety and technology approvals. These requirements can differ per country and there is a risk that we are unable to meet the requirements in one or more countries. This could in the best case delay the market introduction, but in the worst case it could also result in an impossibility to introduce our product into the market. The consequence will probably be major therefore. Fortunately, there are a lot of measures that could be taken in order to minimize the probability this risk occurs. For example, we have to contact the organization that judges applications about the use of our product outside the laboratory in an early stage of the research and development phase. Then we can, if required, still make relatively easy adaptations in our product. However, it is still possible that we want to introduce our product in a later stadium in a foreign market with different rules that makes it impossible to introduce our product into this specific market. Therefore, we consider this risk to be unlikely.
When we are allowed to introduce our product into the market, there is a small change that it appears that our product causes harm to people and/or the environment. For example, any remaining part of the micro-organism in our product to which the environment is exposed, could in theory"

Visiting Team Bielefeld
On the way back home from the Maker Faire , René, Florian, Ansgar and Michael suddenly found themselves in Bielefeld, the city they thought didn't exist (read more about the Bielefeld conspiracy ). After a moment of disorientation, they called our friends from Bielefeld-CeBiTec who invited them on some cake and a discussion on iGEM.
Aachen meets Bielefeld
After many years of iGEM participations, they gladly gave us useful advice that helped a lot in planning the forthcoming months of our iGEM project.
And of course our delegation did not miss the opportunity to invite them to be alpha-testers of our fluorescence-measurement device.

SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," impact of acidic sewage water to laccase activity, as well as providing a large surface area for contact between laccase and synthetic dye molecules. In typical biofilm, such as biofilms formed by E. coli, cells were stuck together in curli fibers formed from the self-assembly of secreted CsgA protein. Researches have reported that different functional proteins can be fused to CsgA through functional peptides, and introduce diverse artificial functions to the biofilms.
At this point, we need a specific type of enzyme that could decompose synthetic dyes. Laccase, a blue multicopper oxidase, came into our sight. Laccase can oxidize a series of aromatic substrates. It is firstly discovered in Chinese or Japanese lacquer trees, and originally involve in plants lignification. CotA laccase, initially found in Bacillus subtilis, was selected as our basic decomposing enzyme. CotA have a very low expression rate in natural hosts, by constructing CotA gene with suitable promoter and RBS, we managed to get a relatively high expression rate of laccase from E. coli. Therefore, the idea of using Biofilm x Laccase system to decompose synthetic dye, came to our mind.
Figure of csgA - SpyTag
cotA - SpyCatcher
Signal peptides - CotA
Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a specific Lys and an Asp residue in Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) fibronectin-binding protein FbaB, researchers split its autocatalytic domain, CnaB2, and obtained two peptides which they named SpyTag and SpyCatcher. It is widely use for connecting protein. In order to fix our powerful enzyme to the biofilm, we added a SpyCatcher sequence after the cotA. So that these proteins could fix onto the curli fibers of the biofilm using isopeptide bonds. These bonds are covalent bonds which is relatively stable.

to the V and K parameters of MerB. Additionally, the concentration of Hg in the extracellular space and cytosol were both
most sensitive to the V and K parameters of MerA. We can use this sensitivity analysis as a guide to what parameters are most
useful to improve. If we want the device to be more efficient at methylmercury conversion, efforts should be directed towards
improving the enzymatic activity of MerA and MerB.
Device Design
This device incorporates two key elements of mechanical engineering design: simplicity and functionality. Key concepts from fluid mechanics are applied to pump water into and out of the encapsulation as efficiently as possible. The system can be placed in or out of the water, which makes it easy to use in any situation. The sleek aluminum casing offers a durable resistance to the ever-changing surroundings and environment. Overall, the simplicity of the design makes it user-friendly and adaptable.
Our design is very similar to commonly used fixed-bed adsorption and ion exchange columns in that it involves flow of a fluid down through a packed bed that removes a solute. However, an important difference is those types of columns contain chemical resins or adsorbents that can become saturated (i.e. reach capacity) as they adsorb solute. Since we use encapsulated bacteria whose ""capacity"" is only limited their lifetime, our device has the added benefit that the mass-transfer zone (the part of the column where the solute is removed) doesn't move down the column due to saturation. This also means that we don't need to alternate between adsorption and regeneration cycles.

The wet work will focus on two challenges. The first being to add new functionality to the signalling parts present in the registry by re-engineering the existing LuxR quorum sensing system to create a bistable switch. This will allow us to infer a signalling molecule concentration required to deactivate the system much lower than the concentration required to activate it. We will characterise this system by using a fluorescent protein reporter and measuring fluorescence at different cell densities. The second challenge will be adding the cholera autoinducer synthase gene CqsA to Escherichia coli so that CAI-1 is secreted. The eventual aim is that the bistable switching system will be used to control CqsA expression, so that the ability to compete with other bacteria in the human gut is not compromised by this metabolic burden. The computational side of the team are focusing on generating ordinary differential equations to model quorum sensing in Vibrio cholerae and on modelling more complex problems such as bistability and multiple quorum loops working in tandem of our parts. No Vibrio Cholerae will be present in the lab, we will instead conduct proof of concept experiments with E. coli DH5.

Fig.9 We are talking with Dr.Liu in Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS.
Dr. Liu ‘s talk is mainly about the systematic evolution of Taxus species.                     He has no idea about why some of Taxus species can produce taxol and how the difference of                     taxol content in different species evolved. But he gave the phylogenetic relationships among present Taxus species. And this talk makes us more reasonable when think about yews. Taxus is                     just a kind of the miscellaneous plants in the world and he thought that the natural effect is more                     important than human activities for he thought about this problem in a further larger time scale. We                     noticed that though these people are all studying about the same species, they think about it from                     totally different dimensions. That’s truly inspiring.
Voice from society
Went to Pecking Union Medical College Hospital for an interview
Different anticancer medicines are clinically used in different cases, depending on the condition and                     illness history of the patient. And taxol, a broad-spectrum medicine targeting on the microtubule,                     is just a choice for cancer doctors. We wondered how these taxol-like medicine are used clinically                     and what problems they are facing. We went to PUMCH and get Dr. Yingyi Wang for an interview.
As he said, taxol is a widely used medicine for many kinds of cancers. But it is the                     wide-ranging that limits its application. Nowadays, targeted medicines which are initiated with                     precision medicine have great advantages in treating cancer. In the other hand, taxol treatment is a                     relative affordable scheme in most cases. From medicine history in a broader scale, small medicine                     agents like taxol would possibly fade out in several decades and be replaced by targeted medicines                     like antigen medicine or micro-robot which would have less sife effects and safer. However, our                     engineered device is still work whenever people want to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents.
He is very interested in our project. Click                     here to see the interview record.

The Brown iGEM Lab is student-run and consists of five undergraduates. This year, the team split up to work on two projects. We begin our training in the Spring semester with a lab class in Synthetic Biology.  With the gracious support of the UTRA Program, Research at Brown, and several academic departments, we were given the opportunity to pursue our own ideas over the summer.  With the guidance of graduate mentors, faculty advisors, and synthetic biologists nationwide, our lab has split our efforts to pursue two distinct projects- one an electrical reporting system, and the other a threshold regulation network.  This is the latter.

BroadRun-Baltimore,2016,Team:BroadRun-Baltimore#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," The specific rate of product formation, \(\frac{1}{X}\frac {dP}{dt}\) is proportional to the specific rate of cell growth \( \mu_g \) during the exponential growth phase whereas in the non-growth steady-state phase it is a constant, \(\beta\). If the yield ratio \(Y_{P / X}\) is defined as
\[\ Y_{P / X} = \dfrac {\Delta P}{\Delta X}\]
then the rate of product formation is expressed as
\[\dfrac {dP}{dt} = -\mu_g Y_{P / X} X + \beta X \]
Monod Equation for Limited-Substrate Growth
More often than not, cell growth saturates when a substrate becomes limited. If this growth-limiting substrate is S, the kinetics of limited substrate growth are commonly described by the Monod equation [1-4]:
\[ \mu_g = \frac {\mu_{m} S}{K_s + S}\]
where \(K_s\) is called the saturation coefficient. The Monod equation has the same form as another equation that describes the kinetics of enzymatic reactions and called the Michaelis-Menten equation, which is derived in the next section. The Monod equation is suited for microbial growth such as yeast where the growth is not rapid and when cell concentrations are low.
Michaelis-Menten Kinetics for Enzymatic Reactions
For enzyme-catalyzed reactions such as starch degradation by alpha-amylase, reaction kinetics are modeled with the Michaelis-Menten rate expression. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics applies to a single substrate \(S\) and single enzyme \(E\) reaction. If \(ES\) is the enzyme-substrate complex and \(P\) is the product, the reaction is shown by
\[S + E\mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{k_{1}}_{k_{-1}}}ES\mathop{\rightarrow}^{k_{2}}P + E\]
By writing three coupled differential equations (not shown here) for the rate of product formation, \(\dfrac{d}{dt}C_p\), the rate of enzyme-substrate formation, \(\dfrac{d}{dt}C_{ES}\), and the rate of substrate consumption,  \(\dfrac{d}{dt}C_s\), and solving these equation  the velocity of the forward reaction defined as \(\nu\) according to   \[ \nu = rate \: of \: S \mathop{\"

Prepare the E. coli cells, which contain the plasmid pMUTIN4, for long term storage.
Procedure
Transforming JM109 E.coli cells
In carrying out the transformation process, the team decided to use commercial JM109 E. coli cells purchased from Promega. Along with the cells, Promega enclosed their own protocol which we followed. There were a few changes that were made however:
Step 3 - instead of adding 100ul of Competent Cells to the culture tubes, only 50ul was transferred.
Step 4 - the DNA added to the competent cells was 5ul instead of 10ul.
Step 8 - the media used to grow the transformant cells was LB and not SOC.
We also took an alternative step when it came to step 8. The 'Notes' section of the Promega protocol gave us an option of rather spreading the transformant E. coli cells on plates (with antibiotics present), the cells are pelleted and resuspended in fresh 200ul of LB solution.
Plating out the transformant colonies
Mathew preparing some LB solution
Five agar plates containing LB + ampicillin were taken from the stock supply and used to plate out 100ul of the diluted transformant cells. This was done under aseptic conditions and involved using glass beads to distribute the culture over the plate surface. The plates were then placed in the 37ºC incubator overnight.
Storing E. coli cells which contain pMUTIN4
The two flasks of 100ml LB solution, inoculated with E. coli cells containing pMUTIN4 plasmid, were placed into 4 x 50ml Falcon tubes under aseptic conditions. These tubes were then placed in a centrifuged and spun for about 20 minutes.
After this spinning process was completed the supernatants were removed from the falcon tubes using a vacuum pump. The pellets were left within the tubes and placed within the -20ºC freezer for use another day.

UChicago,2015,Team:UChicago#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of synchronizing our group of oscillating cells in order to properly assay for oscillations. To do so we referenced the Silver Lab paper (Chen et al. Science 2015), in which cells were first induced in M9 minimal media with carbon supplements (0.4% glycerol, 0.1% casamino acids), then shocked in M9 minimal media with no carbon supplements for 1 hour. The oscillations in this study were tracked using M9 minimal media with leucine and succinate supplements to promote slow growth. We decided to adopt a similar protocol throughout our time course experiment and induced in the M9 supplemented medium (w/glycerol and casamino acids). We also implemented a synchronization shock for 1 hour and 6 hours after the maximum induction time of 16 hours. We conducted a 1 hour shock to remain consistent with the paper, and a 6 hour shock upon receiving recommendation from our host lab (the Rust Lab) that had experience with synchronizing cyanobacterial cells. Our final sample was taken after 62 hours of starting the experiment to simulate the time length we would assay the oscillations for.
The cell samples were analyzed using western blotting.

Raw protein values were fit to a standard curve developed by purified protein samples (ng of standards listed). Values also corrected for OD600 of cells.

Our results from the time course experiment show that the maximal steady state value of KaiA is reached after 16 hours. After the synchronization shock, the amount of KaiA decreases however only slightly. This decrease in KaiA was expected given the absence of rhamnose in the post-shock medium. This also indicates an inherent flaw in the set-up of our experiment -a decrease in KaiA will lead to dampened oscillations. However, the little range of decrease in KaiA indicates the potential of still being able to assay for robust oscillations. Accepting the fact that the oscillations may be dampened due to even a slight decrease in KaiA, we can still select for the most robust oscillations using different concentrations of"

This is my first post in my notebook. Project Clotho has been really fun so far. I finally finished (the first draft) of the help window. Hopefully for the next assignment I don't take over four days again to finish!
First draft of the Clotho help window.
My bio should be finished and ready to send to Doug. Once it's up I'll post the link.
June 11, 2008
Doug has now assigned me to work on the Features Library, Features Connection, and gave me permission to mess with the Sequence View Tools frame. Expect pictures soon.
June 16, 2008: Screenshots
Here's the first draft of the Sequence View Tools. Primitive for now, but constructed so to be easy to add buttons and connectors and such later on.
First draft of the Clotho Sequence View Tools window.
Also ready to display is my envisioning of the Features library window. It will look very similar to the NetBeans 6.1 interface for managing Java libraries, simply because I like the customizability and sleekness of their window.
First draft of the Clotho Features Library.
Still working on the Features Connection. Currently I'm placing priority to finish the Features Library and a new helper, ClothoFileChooser, which will, as named, act as a file chooser akin to Windows explorer. Priority was given because both were requested from Doug and Matt.
June 19, 2008
Doug's been out this week as he gets married on Friday. This translates to many good news and a tinge of the bad.
Good news: Doug's gets married. We get off of going to lab for a full week.
Bad news: I've honestly been goofing off the past two days.
The filechoosers are all done, for now. I doubt"

To be able to expose our bacteria to light in a controlled manner, we designed a new kind of device from scratch. Inspired by the LTA developed by Tabor Lab (Olson et al., 2014) we decided to build a simpler one, only with blue LEDs.
We built a portable device that can illuminate 16 bacterial cultures with different intensities of blue light.
Luckily we had some knowledge of electronics in our team, too."

We wondered if our project can be applied to their labs. The researchers said we could have a try and it is an innovation to apply our system to another model organism. Indeed! Applying our system into another model organism is an opportunity as well as a challenge.
The researchers also encouraged us to combine our fundamental research with industry, which was an affirmation of our project. They are willing to apply our projects to their labs in the future.

2.2.3 Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co. LTD.
In order to find more ideas, we came to Qingdao Bright Seaweed Group Co. LTD. It is a leading enterprise in the Marine biological industry of Shandong province, and the largest seaweed biological products enterprise in the world. We visited the seaweed science museum and the state key laboratory of algae active substances, learned about the alginate and seaweed polysaccharide industries.
In the process, we came up with a new idea that we can use our system to regulate the expression of one or two enzymes that are needed for the processing and production. The company's research and development staff agreed with our idea and suggested that we should design a complete biological treatment scheme and explore its cultivation conditions to realize the better integration of our system with industry. We learned a lot from the journey of Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co. LTD, which was a great progress for us.

We visited its factory, laboratory and production line of the enterprise, and preliminarily knew about the material selection, physical and chemical experiment and downstream product operation. We introduced our project to the researchers in the laboratory, who gave us a high evaluation of the project and affirmed our idea of applying the system to the regulation of anabolic circuits in order to integrate with the real industries better.

These bacteria have a capability to degrade plastic by producing an esterase enzyme that fastens plastic degradation process. This enzyme will degrade plastic to its monomer and using it as a carbon source to sustain the bacteria’s life. Therefore, no pollutants produce as a result of this degradation process.

Safety
Our team has used two bacterial chassis for our experiments. Escherichia coli strains DH5 alpha (for DNA work) and BL21 (DE3; our expression strain). Both of these strains are risk group 1 organisms which do not cause disease in healthy adult humans. Our genetically engineered bacteria will pose no risk to humans as both strains have been developed to not produce toxins and cannot survive in the human digestive system. However, when working with GMOs containment is also an issue. This is because any cells that manage to get into the environment could have wide-ranging effects on our ecosystem via the transmission of genes across/within species, such as antibiotic resistance.
Fortunately, both BL21 (DE3) and K12 strain derivatives such as DH5 alpha are attenuated, meaning that many genes/pathways that would confer a selective advantage in the environment have been removed. Even so, our lab team has taken the necessary precautions when conducting research to ensure that we have kept our bacteria contained. We wear coats and disposable gloves when working in the lab, all cultured bacteria are disposed of with Virkon and autoclaved. We have spill kits in the lab, as well as safety showers and fire extinguishers, and follow all standard PC1 (i.e. BSL1) containment procedures.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

We also collaborate with the founder of one-kilogram-box and spend 40% of the investment on the product. So far, we have just delivered 550 boxes to many high schools and universities, helping more students to learn about iGEM and synthetic biology. In the business circle, our team plays a role as the connecting part between customers and sponsors.
Secondly, the sponsors will also benefit in the business model for they can attract more customers on the online advertisements and get their potential customers during the offline activities. Since a big proportion of the users of Synsketch are students who may have the plan to study abroad, most of the sponsors are education agencies and they can get their customers from those who often view the website. And they can also get more potential customers during some lectures and other public activities for biology learners.
Thirdly, the public will also take full advantage in the circle. They can get access to a more convenient standardized software for genetic circuits and can also learn more about synthetic biology through offline activities.
As mentioned above, there is a virtuous circle with lots of benefits for every part of the circle. And since every part can benefit from the business model, it will carry on and expand to a larger and larger range and pose more and more important influence to the whole iGEM community and even the whole society.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

From the results, we can observe that except for REPAIRv2, other dCas-ADAR2DD constructs showed significant A-to-I editing activities on the target and showed different target preferences from dCas13b to dCas13d. For Cas13d, editing activities on Rluc W153X is particularly significant. Therefore, it is selected as the target position to investigate the effect of guide length and guide mismatch distance on the A-to-I editing activities.
Figure 4 shows the luminescence levels after the restoration of Rluc sequence by Cas13d using guides at different lengths and with different guide-target mismatch distance. The horizontal axis shows the mismatch distance and the number after items in the legend indicates different spacer length. Table 1 summarised all the observations made.

From the results, we were then able to design homology-based guides with appropriate spacer length and guide mismatch distances and evaluate the performance of A-to-I editing on target mRNA. 
 Endogenous mRNA Targeting
In this part of the experiment, we used guides to target two different regions of the PPIB and KRAS mRNA. They were termed as guide 1 and 2 for PPIB and KRAS. Then, some of them will be given a suffix of X.Y, where X indicates the target length and Y indicates the guide mismatch distance. For example, KRAS-1-50.25 is the guide RNA targeting region 1 of KRAS with a spacer length of 50 base-pairs and a mismatch distance of 25 base-pairs. The following results were then obtained from Sanger sequencing. Editing rate is calculated as the area under the guanosine signal in the chromatograph over that of adenosine.

 Conclusion
Here we have demonstrated Type VI Cas13 proteins can mediate efficient A-to-I base editing on mRNA, for both exogeneous and endogenous transcripts. From both experiments we can conclude that while the optimized REPAIR enzyme"

Additionally, the final fluorescence was lower than the initial fluorescence despite the fact that visual inspection demonstrated that it increased considerably from start to finish. This just goes to show the dangers of normalizing data without looking at it first! It also shows the importance of an internal ratiometric control channel which is measured in the same way - this should eliminate the normalization artifacts that we have found from using OD620 as our normalization channel. If the plate reader was unable to measure one fluorescence channel, it is unlikely that it would be able to measure the second, eliminating the artifacts.
We then attempted to transform the construct into Bacillus subtilis, with a view to repeat the same assay in this new chassis. Because the part originally comes from bacillus, we hoped that this might give more useful data. Unfortunately, we did not have time to characterise the part in this chassis, as our transformation attempts failed. This may be an excellent starting point for any future teams seeking to explore this part.
Ratiometrica
After a lot of technical difficulties, we were able to assemble our fluorescent construct using Gibson assembly. The photo below shows the predicted and obtained digest pattern using HINDIII.
The predicted digest, and the actual digest next to hyperladder I. The ladder is the same at the relevant molecular weights.
We ran a plate reader assay with ratiometrica with no induction of the reporter CFP. The results of this assay can be seen. In summary:
No change in CFP is observed with changing OD600.
YFP change is approximately proportional to OD600.
The ratio of YFP to OD600 approaches a constant value at higher cell densities.
These properties are exactly what we expected them to be. This assay also tells us that we should aim to take our ratiometric measurements only during late exponential phase, as this is where the data is most reliable.
Growth curves of 12 replicates of our ratiometrica containing e.coli. This is normal growth in e.coli, indicating that our part is not toxic.
Comparison of OD600 against YFP expression. We are aiming to use YFP as our representation of cell activity, so there should be a strong relationship between these two values. This has been observed, although only during the exponential phase of growth.
Comparison of OD600 againt CFP expression. We did not induce CFP with IPTG, so we do not expect there to be a strong relationship between OD and CFP expression. This appears to be the case, with almost no change in CFP levels with OD600.

Treatment
After the different spores, containing key and message, have     arrived at the recipient the key has to be recovered. Only with the     key it is possible to decode the message in the genome of the     message-spores. As visible in Figure 5, the spores have to recieve the right treatment during germination, otherwise the key sequence cannot be recovered.
Figure 5: Medium with spores
Wrong treatment: spores died & key lost forever
Right treatment: CryptoGErM lives
1. Decoy key hiding
To make it especially hard for unauthorized parties to access     our key, the key-spores will be sent in a mixture of decoy spores.     The decoy is present in a much higher ratio than the key-spores.     The key-spores have to be recovered using a specific selection     mechanism. We have developed a ciprofloxacin resistance cassette     that can be integrated into the B. subtilis genome. Only the     knowledge of this specific selection antibiotic will allow the     recovery. Even better: This resistance cassette also provides     resistance against spirofloxacin which is a conjugate of the     regular antibiotic ciprofloxacin and a spiropyran photoswitch. In     case of using the photoswitchable antibiotic, spirofloxacin (in its     inactivated state) could be already added to the spore mixture. The     recipient simply has to activate it by shining light of the     right wavelength on it.
To design a qnrS1 resistance cassette BioBrick we designed a     gBlock that contains the Bacillus subtilis promoter PatpI, which is     active from a very early stage of germination and includes a     ribosome binding site. The gBlock also contains the original qnrS1 gene sequence from E. coli, the double terminator BBa_B0015 from     iGEM as well as the prefix and suffix for BioBricks. The qnrS1 resistance cassette was integrated into the amyE locus of the B.     subtilis genome using the BBa_K823023 B. subtilis integration     vector. The qnrS1 plasmid and the selection process of the key-containing spores from the decoy can be seen in Figure 6.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!

Safety
What were the safety issues in the Biosensor part of our project?
Our project is divided into two parts. The first part, building a biosensor for sewage that can be used by the community living around the Gowanus Canal to monitor water quality, is very straightforward and presents typical risk for iGEM projects. The bacterial chassis used was E. coli K12 derivative DH5alpha and all the parts used present no risk to humans.  Since the parts and the chassis are from Group 1 organisms there were no unusual safety issues posed by this part of the project. Use of good microbiological practices would be sufficient to minimize risk.
The biosensor would, ideally, be deployed in a device placed along the canal with the engineered bacteria contained by a membrane that allows small molecules to pass through but not micro organisms. We have identified such a filter, used by the Imperial College iGEM team in 2014. The difficulty will be to design a device that shields the filter from mechanical damage yet allows the color change to be visualized. Once the sewage has been detected, the device needs to be discarded safely and replaced.
How did we address the safety concerns in the Biosensor part of our project?
One way to make the device safer would be to add a kill switch that would be activated by salt concentrations found in the ocean, which is the eventual place that bacteria would end up if they were released into the canal accidentally. Unfortunately due to the short timeframe of iGEM we were unable to build this device although we researched it. Another way to minimize the release of genetically modified organisms into the canal would be to place the biosensor bacteria into a kit where the bacteria are in a container that canal water is added to. The kit would contain bleach for decontamination of the device after use. The downside of this approach is that the community expressed a wish for real-time visual indicators along the canal.
What were the safety issues in the Microbiome Mining part of our project?
The second part of our project involves mining the canal microbiome for organisms and biochemical pathways that might prove useful for detoxification of pollutants. This required a bit more thought and strategizing since Genspace is a BSL1 facility and we"

So many people are in the lab now! Because so many of our small lab teams have transitioned to lab work, the “Yeast Parents”, or team in charge of maintaining the yeast and the lab, gave everyone a tour of the space to keep everything organized (and keep us all in line).
Unfortunately, with great numbers of people in lab comes great margin for mistake. We burnt through a ridiculous amount of Q5 polymerase this week because we miscommunicated the concentrations needed to perform PCR. However, the team took this as a learning experience and practiced concentration math and master-mix-making. We are also going to begin a crowdfunding campaign to supplement the team funds when/if errors arise in the future.
Outreach is really cool! Three of us, plus our PI (of course), spoke to Martyn Smith, Managing Director of the Family Planning 2020 Secretariat, over the phone. He nearly gave us heart attacks when he offered to help us reach local agents familiar with the regulatory environments in the countries we wanted our project to extend to. Aside from the FP2020 call, two of our members have been diligently working on outreach at home. They’ve started to develop a game as an interactive way for high schoolers to join in when we present our project to them later this month.
After double checking that we were using the right volumes for our PCR reaction, we were able to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2. We then confirmed this by running it on a 1% agarose gel seen below.
Our over-the-weekend cultures had little growth after 24 hours, but showed adequate growth come Monday morning. After discussing this with other teammates, we found it was most likely due to improper aeration of our samples, which were stored upright with a tight cap in the incubator. We then performed a plasmid isolation followed by a restriction digest to test the identity of our isolated plasmid. Our first digest was unsuccessful, which we hypothesized was because of the age of our enzyme sample. Our next digest, performed with our most recently acquired enzyme, showed the expected band pattern after altering the contrast on the gel image. We also attempted a PCR linearization of our amplified plasmid which was unsuccessful. Through these experiments we learned how to better analyze gel images by increasing exposure, brightness, and contrast, as well as proper incubation practices for liquid cultures. We also ran into several issues with budgeting time correctly in lab, which prompted us to change how we schedule our lab procedures to create as little “dead space” as possible.

Introduction
Background
Tuberculosis (TB) ranks as the 2nd leading cause of death among various infectious diseases [1]. The fact that earlier diagnosis and treatment indicate better prognosis attaches great importance to the diagnostic services for TB patients. The current methods include tuberculin skin test, blood test and sputum culture. However, tuberculin skin test is not sensitive, blood test is risky and sputum culture needs a waiting period as long as 1-2 months which will delay timely treatment. Methods based on nucleic acid detection (NAD) are highly sensitive, safe and rapid; however, they are not widely applied to clinical practice. Why?
After consulting some front-line practitioners of TB control, we found that NAD has high false positive rate because non-specific amplification frequently occurs and current methods of NAD are not able to read out sequence-specific information; this makes them barely reliable. What' more, NAD requires expensive and clumsy instruments which are not accessible to rural areas where TB is epidemic (For more detailed information, see Human Practice). Therefore, Peking iGEM 2015 is devoted to building a new reporter system that enables NAD to be specific, reliable and less instrument-dependent.
CRISPR
To improve the specificity, we need a system that can read out sequence information directly. The first thing coming to our mind is the clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, which is originally from prokaryotic immune system [2]. Cas9 is a sequence-specific, DNA cleavage protein guided by single-guide RNA (sgRNA); they form a complex and can be easily programmed to recognize any target sequence [3]; in previous studies it was engineered"
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Blog#14-05-31-01_-_-_TEXT.html,", there are also extensive—essential—differences. Firstly, the time span: Glaciers melt and climate zones shift over centuries, the ocean level rises over millennia. That timeframe is very suited for the international wrestling with measures and agreements, one that often reminds outsiders of a geological process. The first bacterial resistances against a new antibiotic currently appear within a few years.
And the case of climate change is still quite simple because there is an actual scientific consensus that can be recommended to politics. Regarding antibiotic resistances, it is way more complicated. Data is lacking everywhere. The only thing that a panel like that could agree on at this moment would be a substantial need for research.
This would be a fatal signal for practice: First a big multinational panel is founded that is supposed to recommend the ultimate measures against antibiotic resistances, and then the organisation can hardly say more than ""the facts are yet to be established"". There is a great danger that most stakeholders would first wait until the panel sees through its decision. And subsequently, one would still have to consolidate these recommendations at the governmental level—recommendations whose data basis is necessarily thin and incomplete. It would be easy for the profiteers of the status quo to thwart such an endeavour—just like it is happening with climate change.
Therefore, the combatants of resistances should rather avoid big politics and use the already-established networks to coordinate themselves internationally. If in doubt, influence on politics and corporations should be looked for on a local level. There are—as Woolhouse and Farrar wrote themselves—a multitude of examples for regional organisations and initiatives. Of course, such sectioned measurement structures have their disadvantages, but they are by far implemented more quickly. And the time factor is crucial: a race with bacteria has to be approached differently from one with glaciers.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"“. This system is more reliable than the enzymatic approach and could act in the background. However, for the bacteria to be able to express large amounts of synthetic protein saturated with phenylalanine, the protein itself has to be stable enough and the bacterial machinery has to be suited for the high frequency of phenylalanine codons. We used mathematical approaches (hyperlink) to acquire stable phenylalanine mutants of natural proteins and simulated the efficiency of this system under elevated expression of tRNA-Phe.
Kinetic model
We designed two different in vivo systems to decrease the amount of phenylalanine in the intestine. The first system is based on phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), which breaks down phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia. The second system incorporates phenylalanine into specific mutant proteins that possess high amounts of phenylalanine, thus lowering the concentration of the free amino acid.
Uptake
As both of the systems involve the uptake of phenylalanine into the bacteria, the kinetic equations can be applied to either of the systems. There are two ways for phenylalanine to enter the cell: 1. Passive diffusion; 2. Facilitated diffusion by phenylalanine transporter. The kinetics of these pathways can be described by classical equations: 1. For passive diffusion:
2. For facilitated diffusion:
The PheP coding genes are expressed constantly, reaching a steady state of the transporter in the membrane, which can be described by the following equation:
where α is the translation rate, β is the degradation and dilution rate of PheP, K is the transcription rate and δ is the degradation and dilution rate of mRNA. Together, PheP expression rate and the activity of the transporter dictates the rate of facilitated transport into the cells. Later, by combining both passive and facilitated diffusion rate equations we can determine the rate of phenylalanine uptake.
PAL
Bacteria with the first system expresses phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), an enzyme, which breaks down phenylalanine into trans-cynnamic acid and ammonia. This enzyme is either expressed at an induced or constant rate inside the bacteria, so in the latter conditions, a steady state concentration of PAL should be reached. The rate of convertion of Phenylalanine to TCA for different concentrations of PAL can be calculated from the following equation:
We have carried out experiments to acquire some of the constants regarding our model (see wet lab page). If the expression rate and activity of PAL and phenylalanine diffusion rate is known, the"

First prize Falling Walls Lab
 
Falling walls is an annual science event which has its finals in Berlin where researchers can tell how their idea breaks down the walls of humanity’s biggest problems. The day before the Falling Walls Conference, the Falling Walls Lab is organized, where young researchers can pitch their work. Speakers get three minutes to tell the audience about their project, and convince them of its importance.
On our behalf, Andries went to the qualifying round in Groningen where he won us the first prize! After the iGEM finale in Boston, he will fly back to Amsterdam, take the train to Berlin, and tell a large international audience about our bandage on November 8th.

GFP Project
 
Three students from the Zernike College are working on a project about GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein). They want to explore the usage of GFP within the biological sciences. They asked us whether we wanted to help them with some experiments related to their project. On Tuesday the 21st of October the three students will visit our lab, to transform a plasmid with the GFP gene to E. coli. Later that week, we will have a look at the cells through the microscope.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Groningen national meetup
 
After the success of the first national meet up, we (iGEM team Groningen) decided to organize a second national meet up. We enjoyed the hospitality of the Wageningen team, and liked the conversation and the set-up of the first meet up. We liked the whole day, but one thing: The travelling! Going to Wageningen was not the problem, but returning home was the hard part. Once we were in the mood for an even more fun evening, it was already quite late, and we needed to travel back. We decided it would be more fun to extend the day even more. Therefore we decided to organize a second meet up, with a more informal set-up including a sleep over.  At the 13th of September the day started with some drinks, while sharing our progress. After the talks about the project, we went to the pizzeria with all the teams present (unfortunately the Delft-Leiden team could not be present). We showed all the teams some nice and"

Cellulase
In order to create a practical system for Continuous Greening, our microorganisms have to gain sustenance from dry, nutrient-poor soil. We turned to wood as an energy source, since can be decomposed by many kinds of microbes. Wood fibers are made of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.  Of those, cellulose comprises the largest proportion. Cellulose is made of β1→4 linked D-glucose units; therefore if we can break β-glycosidic bonds between the glucose units, our microbes can gain precious nutrients from dead wood in dry areas.  Consequently, we focused on our efforts on realizing the degradation of cellulose through production and secretion of cellulase. Several different enzymes are involved in cellulose degradation and are collectively known as cellulases: endoglucanases break internal bonds in cellulose chains, exoglucanses break cellulose bonds near exposed ends of cellulose resulting in disaccharides called cellobiose, while β-glucocidase cleaves cellobiose molecules into 2 glucose units each. We aimed to produce all these enzymes from our microbe.
cellulose
In pursuance of more efficient degradation of cellulose, we investigated two different approaches. First, we BioBricked catalytic domains from many cellulases and tried combining them in various ways to obtain synergy between different parts. We theorized that combining the same set of genes in different orders will produce different proportions of each protein domain, thus resulting in differing efficiencies. We aimed to try several possible combinations and assay their activities. Second, we wanted looked into different microbes and their respective abilities to break down cellulose with the same set of cellulase parts. For this year’s project, we tried Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Today, our energy resources mostly depend on petroleum, coal, natural gas, and hydroelectricity. Some renewable energy such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heal are known as renewable energy source; however, it only covers 19 % of global final energy consumption (2008).   We need"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html,"5(-) were used to make overnight cultures, which were then miniprepped the following day to obtain the plasmid DNA of the putative hpaC biobrick. Digestions were performed on the miniprep products using EcoRI and Pst to look for part size as further verification for the genes presence in the plasmid. The results were good and two bands were observed on each column (one for vector and the other for hpaC)(second figure). hpaC was sent in for sequencing.
PCR reagents were prepared to re-test/confirm previous results of dszA amplification following two different lysing treatments (microwave + lysate buffer). This time, all three genes were amplified and gel verification showed clear banding patterns around 500bp range for all three genes for the microwave treatment. WHY DID WE PROCEED WITH THIS THAT ISNT THE RIGHT SIZE Remaining PCR products were run on a gel and extracted for further purification steps; however, presence of any genetic material were not confirmed through nanodropping which raised concerns about the composition of the purified products, the success of the initial amplification step, or perhaps even the lysis treatment. Further experimentation will have to be carried out to troubleshoot.
Week 7 (June 11 - June 15)
Ring Cleavage
Since last week we continued taking GC readings on the Pf-5 incubated with butylcyclohexane and toluene.  At this point the Pf-5 had been incubated with butylcyclohexane for 6 days and with toluene for 5 days.  The amount of both butylcyclohexane and toluene decreased by a large amount in the experimental cultures but the amount of each in the abiotic standards also largely decreased by about the same amount.  This lead us to conclude that the reason for decrease was not due to the bacteria metabolizing the compound, but due to unknown abiotic factors. To measure relatie amounts of bacterial growth we took OD600 readings for both cultures which were very low and indicated that there was little bacterial growth. The verification of XylE from the parts registry was continued using a miniprep on three overnight cultures from part K118021.  The concentrations were very high likely due to genomic contamination. A second part (J33204) containing XylE and an rbs site was transformed and a colony PCR was done on part J33204 but the gel did not indicate successful results, again only the positive control worked.  No positive colonies were found.

For the safety of the environment, we managed to classify all the experimental waste due to the environmental demands of the institute to prevent unwanted genes, if any, from contaminating the world around us. And since our project only concerns with the kinetic properties of bacteria, it is of no harm to the environment.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states? Taking into account that our team is aimed at changing some specific characters of bacteria, and the strains we are using are neither pathogenic nor toxic, no risks to security will be posed.
Please explain your responses (whether yes or no) to these questions.
Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):
- pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity? No.
- threats to environmental quality?   No.
- security concerns? No.
2.  If your response to any of the questions above is yes: a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work. b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
3. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate? a. Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they?  Provide a link to them online if possible.  Our institution has its own lab safety rules. We have them put up in a very evident part in our laboratory.
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any      concerns or changes that were made based on this review.  Our institution does not have a committee or group like that, but our instructors and advisors have made suggestions for the good of biosafety. According to their advice we are now using separate zones to study and performing experiments. c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training. Yes. We had a winter workshop before launching our project. The team members of iGEM 2010 taught us the basic information about how to get good results without getting hurt.  d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?  If so, provide a link to them online if possible. Our state government has set rules and regulations on biosafety, laboratories working on pathogenic microbes are registered and under strict surveillance. We also evaluate our experimental process according to the regulations put forth by relevant departments of P. R. China. To get the detailed information please visit: National Biosafety Clearing"

Health Risks
Nickel is a natural element that constitutes approximately 0.009% of the earth's crust. Nickel sulfides, silicates and oxides are commonly used in mining and natural resources.[1] The most common nickel sulfide mineral is pentlandite (NiFe)9S8, which accounts for the majority of nickel produced globally.[2,3] Domestic nickel production comes from the smelting of natural nickel ores, refining nickel matte, an impure metallic sulfide product from smelting of sulfides of metal ores, reclamation of nickel metal from nickel based or non-nickel based scrap metal, including salvaged machinery, sheet metal, aircraft and other vehicular parts and discarded consumer goods such as batteries.
Nickel compounds are used in construction, mining, smelting, electrical equipment manufacturing, and battery and fuel cell production, among numerous other materials. During construction, there is a high risk for nickel contamination. They can also make their way into the household through ceramics since they often form the bond between enamel and iron.
Nickel compounds are so toxic because they are highly resistant to corrosion and oxidation in air and aqueous environments; they are resistant to corrosion by organic acids and exposure to chlorine, fluorine, hydrogen chloride and molten salts.
Estimated average daily dietary intake is 0.1-0.3 mg/day.[4,5] Less than 0.2 mg/day of which is consumed via food and 5-25 ug/day from water.[2] Dermal exposure is one of the most common routes of exposure and even low levels of exposure may cause nickel allergic dermatitis.[6-8]
Common Effects:[1]
Gastrointestinal distress like: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
Dermatitis (eczema like effects: rash, itchiness)
Neurological effects
Nickel specific asthma
Extreme Cases:
Coma
