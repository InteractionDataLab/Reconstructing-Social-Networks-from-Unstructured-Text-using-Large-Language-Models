But collecting the steady states under different initial input light condition in the kinetic modeling, we can get the relation between the intensity of the input light and the amount of fluorescence.
The result agrees with the result in Tao's work .
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

We gave a tour about  academy and labs in our school to Wei Youyi and showed her the safety disciplines in our lab, and we found that safety is the highest principle in both labs we work in.
Nanjing_NFLS
Collaborating with Nanjing_NFLS, we got access to discuss our projects and help each other in a more profound way. As both of our teams wanted to share our projects and understandings of synthetic biology to the general public, we together held a special event for students in NFLS. Nanjing_NFLS helped to find the place for this lecture and invited students from synthetic biology club, who showed really great interest in biology. Both of our teams provided vivid presentations, sharing what synthetic biology and iGEM competition is and how we perform our subjects.
The lecture turned out to be a big success —students got fully engaged in the activities and a lot of them wrote their feelings about this lecture. It sparked students’ scientific curiosity and many of them even changed their views towards brain diseases.
It is a pleasure to collaborate with Nanjing_NFLS to held such a meaningful and influential event. It not only helps high school students to rediscover “horrible diseases”, but also sparks their scientific curiosity in Biology learning. We really appreciate and treasure this event.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," which partially binds to the His-terminator, 5' UUUCGUGG 3', suffices to enable antitermination as the picture and the corresponding video below display.
This highlights how strongly the length of identity site and trigger site are both responsible for antitermination, since both of them influence the overall free energy of the competitive reaction to termination. Thus, this proves, that a meaningful selection and optimization of trigger and identity site allows antitermination by RNA/RNA interaction and performing a specific addressing of single switches by only varying the identity site. This manifests the fact, that our idea could be implemented and the specific addressing and switching could be separated, as for example showed for the His-switch in the NUPACK-section.
Signal consists of 4 nt for the part which partially binds to the His-terminator and 4 nt of the random signaling part.

Results
We showed that in theoretical simulations the His-terminator works perfectly as the terminator itself is relatively stable whereas for appropriate signal length the terminator is not folding at all, that is antitermination occurs. We also demonstrated that a quite short signal length of 8 nt is sufficient for antitermination to happen. Nevertheless longer signals provide a larger number of implementable switches. 8 nt is only the minimal length for our switch to function, and the simulations showed that longer identity sites do marginally increase the antitermination process. This is because for RNA/RNA interaction, the rate limiting step is the binding of the first 3-5 bases.

The Trp-terminator turned out to be less stable than the His-terminator. The folded terminator is not the minimal free-energy structure for the given the RNA sequence, it's only the third minimal one at -12.9 kcal/mol compared with the His-terminator which has a minimal free-energy structure at -31.3 kcal/mol.

June 24, 2011
New project: a bioinformatics analysis of Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens genomes to search for non-homologous genes/pathways.  The viability assay was performed and using the results of the previous day’s growth curve we managed to expose the E. coli cells to the different treatments (different concentrations of different types of NAs, and tailings water) when they were rapidly dividing in log phase. A culture was made of bacteria transformed with I732005.

June 27, 2011
BNH: Tested Multiple Voltages (1000, 500, 350, 290, 220 mV) on two different concentrations (0.04% & 0.004% by Volume) of CPR.
Examined the results of the viability assay and miniprepped the cultures of I732005 and another culture for I0500 + B0034 was also miniprepped. they were both digested and run on a gel and the gel from June 22, 2011 was repeated.
Created a Foght minimal media with no carbon source so we can test Pseudomonas’ ability to work with naphthenic acids. Made a test overnight culture to make sure it could grow in it (40mg/L naphthenic acids).
June 28, 2011
Another gel was run for the restriction digests after which it was concluded that they had fully digested. the digests were used to make a construct of I0500+B0034+I732005 which was then used to transform TOP10 cells. XyLR operon was also used to transform TOP10 cells.
The overnight culture worked really well so we can perform survival and growth assays with this media now. Cells grew in the presence of the acid in the new media.
June 29, 2011
The transformed parts from the previous day were cultured.
Transformations of violacein (K274002) consistently seem to fail to grow. Most likely discontinung this particular part.

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#CEA_-_-_TEXT.html,". However, in our interactions with environmental groups, public officials in water quality management, and industrial groups, we encountered several important questions that were not built into existing CEA framework. Assessing the suitability of a synthetic biology-based device extends far beyond practical environmental risk assessment, into regulatory and economic concerns. The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI) released a report in December 2010 regarding important considerations for the ethics of synthetic biology projects, not all of which are encompassed by the CEA framework. In addition, as we approach field-deployability, the economics of the device become essential to assessing its viability as a solution to real-world water monitoring needs. These ideas are further explored in the remainder of this section.

PcelA ( BBa_ K1379002 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_ K1379003 ) construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for PcelA and PcomFA construct. PcelA / PcomFA gene was fused with BBa_E0240 , which contains a medium RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), GFP ( BBa_E0040 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). The purpose of this GFP generator is to indicate the functionality of PcelA and PcomFA in the presence and absence of σx. BBa_E0240 was obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit. The bacterial strain of E. coli used is DH10B.
PCelA / PcomFA gene
Identifying the Possible Promoter Regions
To date (12 Oct 2014), the core/minimal promoter region of PcelA has not yet been experimentally defined. In locating the promoter region required to initiate transcription, iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST team attempted in making educated guesses based on relevant information available from the literature. The Com-Box promoter consensus sequence “TACGAATA” was BLASTed for targets in the Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes of strains R6, D39, ATCC7699 and NCTC7465 in the NCBI database. Genome of strain NCTC7465 was particularly given attention because its gDNA was available for manipulation. A list of loci with annotated genes returned. σx was known to turn on late competence gene and therefore loci containing any of those genes documented were favored and filtered for. Those loci were then manually checked for consensus among the 4 genomes mentioned above. A sequence of 67 base pairs stood out as a promising target because it was 1) upstream of a late competence genes celA (encodes competence protein CelA), and 2) was identical across the 4 genomes. This 67 bp region has varying upstream sequences and the potential promoter region can reach as far as 200bp. Different truncations (67, 100, 150, 180, 249, 300 bp) were planned for deciding the minimal"

Characterization of expression of E.coli transformed into triple plasmids and testing if our target proteins expressed by our constructed gene circuits were concentrated in precipitation or supernatant  (8.12)
2013/9/26 22:07:46
Description :  We had transformed triple plasmids into one E.coli and the DNA gel picture indicated it was ligated successfully. So now we were very eager to know if our circuits could work well in E.coli. Furthermore, we wanted to know that if our target proteins expressed by our constructed gene circuits, in other words, pSB1C3-gfp-luxI and pSB13T5-aiiA were aggregated in precipitation or supernatant. So we run SDS-PAGE using BL21(blank control), three cells transformed into different single plasmids(aiiA, ndh and gfp), one cell transformed into double plasmids(aiiA and gfp) and our E.coli transformed into triple plasmids in three forms respectively, whole cell, precipitation and supernatant.  Data analysis:   From the SDS-PAGE gel pictures, we could easily find that the clear AiiA band (marked in red) but NDH was not clear in PAGE because the gene ndh did exist in the genome DNA of BL21 native strain.

We've found that maybe there's some mistakes in our strains which cause us couldn't get a expected microfluidic experiment result. And we analyzed that DH5α maybe a better strain than BL21 so we changed the host. We firstly confirm the expression of three single plasmids transformed into DH5α.  Data analysis: The band marked in red was not the target band. Maybe it is the complex of AHL-LuxI. The target proteins of pSB1C3-gfp-luxI have been expressed while the target proteins of pSB3T5-aiiA and pSB4K5-ndh did not be  expressed because the promoter should be induced by AHL.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,". The core staff recognise what the issues are but are not experts, so don't really teach in those areas.
He said it was important for all science students to be aware of how science interacts with the rest of public life. He said this might be something universities are generally not very strong on.
Allan said that in his first three years as a student, it seemed that concepts of biosafety and broad ethical concerns were not strongly emphasised. Graeme pointed out that the instruction you receive depends on your precise field; biomedical students get more instruction in these areas; they may get taught about ethical issues surrounding stem cells, for example.
Graeme noted that a lot of issues are very new, because they only arise due to advanced science and technology. When these technologies are developed, the ethical issues aren't fully thought through. It's only recently that scientists have accepted there are major ethical issues that need to be debated. This debate can't just be done by scientists. In many cases scientists must hold up their hands and say ""we can't determine if this is right or wrong"".
The government seeks advice from scientists, and such advice is liberally given, but scientists don't always know what's right or wrong. Sometimes scientists get pilloried in the press for this. But for some questions, a scientist can only say ""I don't know, and we have no way of knowing"". The press and the public don't like this.
Fionn said everyone needs to think about how what they're doing impacts society.
Graeme said that 4th year honours students get to have debates about issues of a wider nature, including ethical issues. The Biotechnology Honours class make plans for hypothetical businesses, and ethical issues always arise. Sometimes getting people to role-play can be useful to get people thinking about others' points of view.
Fionn asked whether there was adequate emphasis on these issues in biology teaching.
Graeme said there was a growing awareness.
Allan asked how the law affects scientists in biotechnology and whether the level of regulation was appropriate.
Graeme said the law only impinges on very specific areas, though any genetic engineering at all has to be recorded and approved. There are different levels of safety requirements and different levels of risk, dealt with in different ways. Of least concern are experiments on disabled E. coli strains, for example using modified E. coli for the sake of producing a lot of some specific enzyme.
At the other extreme, there are genetically modified human cell cultures, and genetically modified animals. There are major controls here; any animal experiments require a Home Office license."

Attributions and Thanks From the RHIT 2016 iGEM Teams
The RHIT 2016 iGEM project is a continuation of the RHIT 2015 iGEM project.  We continued to use, build on, and verify the completed parts submitted to the database by last years team, as well as finish a few parts that were not completed but designed by members of last year's team, such as pSB416 GPD.  We are very thankful for the hard work last years team put into iGEM and glad to have had the opportunity to push their project forward and continue to engineer yeast mitochondria using synthetic biology.
Alexander Lacrampe and Xintong Xia worked on the mls-yeGFP for the duration of the project and  finished constructing pSB416 GPD with the help of Joe Lee as well as verifying its function.  Xintong and Xander also worked on testing mRPS12 TU in pSB416 and attempted to use it to restore mitochondrial function in mRPS12 TU knock out yeast
Holly Cox worked on and finished converting P413 GPD into pSB413 GPD.
Connor Holthouse, Justin Mader, and Joe Lee worked on the P416- CYC1 expression vectors and P426-GPD that did not get completed in the time period due to complications.  Justin managed both the team's collaboration with Purdue as well as our outreach a local high school and submitting the paperwork to start the Rose-Hulman Synthetic Biology Club.
Jake McClure and Holly Cox accomplished a majority of the work done on the team’s wiki page, with help from Connor Holthouse, Justin Mader.  Xander and Xintong wrote the project description, experiments, results, and basic parts pages.
All members of the iGEM received guidance and lab training from our PI, Dr. Anthony.  He also helped double check and order geneblocks from IDT and secured funding for the 2016 iGEM team.
We would like to acknowledge a few people for which the project would not be successful without. We would like thank Dr. Reizman for the help and use with the nanodrop, Shannon Tieken for the technical support with our equipment and providing us with the chemicals"

e. Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause)
- pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity? None of our parts or devices are associated with, or known to cause pathogenicity, infectivity or toxicity.
- threats to environmental quality? No parts or devices have been suspected to be a threat to environmental quality.
- security concerns? There are no security concerns associated with our project or the parts and devices constructed.
2. If your response to any of the questions above is yes:
a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
As non of our parts or devices are associated with or known to cause pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity it was not necessary to address such issues in the project design or while conducting laboratory work.
b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
There where no safety, security, health and/or environmental issues regarding our submitted parts.
3. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
a. Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they?
At the Center for Microbial Biotechnology at DTU, there are safety rules that all employees and students have to follow. There are some general rules regarding fire, accidents, preventing accidents, and personal safety outfit. The general safety rules and the biological safety rules  of CMB can be found here .
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group?If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes that were made based on this review.
At CMB we have a local biosafety group that ensures the laboratory safety. Before initiating our project at CMB we signed a formula concerning the safety rules. Furthermore, we had to write short description of the type of experiments that are expected to be performed during the project, which is standard procedure at the institute. This description included the toxicity of the chemicals used, how to dispose them, and which precautions to make in order to perform the project in a responsible and safe way. The safety group found that the safety aspects of the project were sufficient, and the project was initiated after the approval. The safety group furthermore advised us to work according to standard safety protocols for genetic engineering and molecular biology.
c. Did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project?If so, describe this training"

BBa_K1930001: Message in pSB1C3
BBa_K1930004: qnrS1 in pSB1C3
BBa_K1930005: pATPI in pSB1C3
BBa_K1930006: sfGFP in pSB1C3
Integration and recovery of messages in DNA
We integrated an encrypted message and a key sequence into the amyE locus of the genome of two different Bacillus subtilis strains. Both Bacillus strains were treated to form spores. Subsequently the spores were allowed to germinate, the DNA was isolated and the key and message sequences were amplified using corresponding primers. The amplified DNA was sequenced and we inserted the sequencing results into our encryption and decryption machine ( Encoder and Decoder ) . We were able to recover our key and with the key we could decrypt the sequencing results for the message. We could recover our message stored in DNA! To test out the system under real life conditions we sent the message-spores and the corresponding primers to two iGEM teams in the Netherlands. They also recieved the key from us in order to encrypt the message. The iGEM teams from Eindhoven and Wageningen were both able to decrypt our message. Our concept is working!

* Levels means all possible values the parameter can have.
The general code for filtering a numerical range parameter X using R looks like this:
FilterForX <- function(data) {  if (input$FILX_min == "">max"") data <- data[-which(data$X < max),]  else if (input$FILX_max == "">max"") data <- data[-which(data$X < input$FILX_min),]  else data <- data[-which(data$X < input$FILX_min | data$X > input$X_max),]  return(data) }
The general code for filtering a single string parameter Y using R looks like this:
FilterForY <- function(data) {  matchY <- rep(0, times=length(data$Y))  for (i in 1:length(input$FILY)) {   matchY[which(data$Y == input$FILY[i])] <- 1  }  data <- data[-which(matchY == 0),]  rm(matchY)  return(data) }
For each filter the corresponding selection elements (max, min or multiple selection) are added underneath each other below the plot of the app."

Find the reaction \(j\) such that \(\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{0}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} \alpha_{i}\leq r_{2}<\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{0}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{j} \alpha_{i}\).
Implement reaction \(j\) and increment time \(t\) to \(t+\tau\).
Repeat steps 1-5 until a sufficient time or computation budget has been exhausted.
Turning the reaction rates in our model into propensities is simple - for example, the propensity for the association reaction                                 \(Arab+AraC\rightarrow Arab:AraC\) is \(\alpha_{3}\left[Arab\right]\left[AraC\right]\).
Diffusion
Deterministic
The standard from for the diffusion equation,
\[\dfrac{d[P]}{dt}=D\dfrac{d^{2}[P]}{dx^{2}}\]
where \([P]\) is the concentration of our product, \(t\) is time and \(x\) is distance and \(D\) is the diffusion constant, can be solved analytically in any number of dimensions:
\[[P]\left(x,t\right)=\dfrac{1}{\left(4\pi Dt\right)^{\frac{N}{2}}}\exp\left(\dfrac{-\sum\limits_{i=1}^N x_{i}^{2}}{4Dt}\right)\]
where \(x_{i}\) is a generalised position co-ordinate and \(N\) is the dimensionality of the system. This solution only applies to a source of [P] at the position \(x=0\). We can also solve for a grid of 1 or 2D points using finite difference models given in the tutorial section .
Stochastic
We have the option of using three stochastic models for diffusion - random walk, random velocity and compartmental Gillespie.
Random Walk
We initially take a collection of particles and, for each one, compute the number
\[dr=\sqrt{2Ddt}\xi_{r}\]
where \(dt\) is the size of our timestep, \(dr\) is the absolute distance moved in the timestep and \(\xi_{r}\) is a normally distributed random number with mean 0 and variance 1. To"

NCTU Asia iGEM Meetup
The big event that NCTU_FORMOSA had been preparing for so long started on 8/19, which lasted for 4 days. We had 27 teams present, about 210 attendees from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We even have teams from India and Kazakhstan join us during the meetup through the internet. So all the process of Asian conference is open to the whole world. Throughout the 4-day conference, each team had prepared presentation for their amazing projects and ideas. We learned about each team’s idea and the progress of their project so After all the presentations, our professors also as judges will give pieces of advice to the teams. Afterwards, Q&A time was a chance to interact with each team. Besides presentation, poster time during every meal not only fed us with exquisitely prepared food but also knowledge. All these activities enable us to rethink our project with different angles, improving our 27 projects into a new level.   At the end of the conference, each team were given special gifts, embraceD bunch of friends, and feel happy and proud to be igemers. After the conference, we planned a day trip in Taipei, visiting National Palace Museum and Taipei 101. Both are the must-go attraction that nobody would miss when coming to Taiwan.

Visit in Mackay Memorial Hospital
We paid a visit to Mackay Memorial Hospital to ask some questions about prediagnosis and prescription for designing our project. And we had been educated to a certain degree that our design will function in practical use. Following is our record.
1.We learned that before using targeted therapies we must do pre-diagnosis. Nowadays, the most commonly used methods are IHC (immunohistorychenistry) and FISH(fluorescence in situ hybridization). And we learned that currently there are no cancer detecting methods using blood. Because of this, we come to realize the significance of pre-diagnosis, and that the project which we are doing will benefit the society.
2. We learned that there are several kinds of targeted drugs to fight against cancer, such as Tykerb,Herceptin ,which have different pathways to inhibit the tumor cells.Because of this, we get a first glimpse of targeted drugs and their mechanisms.
3.We learned that there are some tests to check whether the targeted therapies work or not,"

Tonbridge Science Conference
<img src=""
"" style=""width:30%"">
On the 11th of October, a few members of our team carried out a 20 minute presentation of our work as part of the Tonbridge science conference. The team also had the opportunity to showcase our poster, in a similar fashion as would end up doing at the Giant Jamboree.  This conference included a number of other secondary schools from the surrounding area who also gave presentations and a number of talks which were given by experts in varying fields of science.
Our team found the experience extremely enjoyable and helpful. The conference allowed us to educate pupils from similar schools and of similar ages about synthetic biology and the IGEM competition. As the first UK state school to go to the Giant Jamboree in Boston, we hope that other state schools which were in attendance were inspired to follow in our footsteps.
Medical Society
<img src=""
"" class=""left"" style=""width:30%"">
The presentation given in the Judd medical society was focused on the issue of iron deficiency and excess iron in the body. The talk covered the prevalence of iron deficiency in the developing world and how our project is specifically designed for this demographic. The medical society presentation was a good opportunity to focus on the potential of our project in the real world before our interview with the haematologist. The medical society is attended by students from all years but primarily by sixth form who have an interest in studying medical sciences therefore the talk also covered why healthy iron is so fundamental to life and addressed common misconceptions surrounding anaemia and iron deficiency as well as discussing some of the latest research which illuminates just how harmful excess iron can be in body. We raised awareness about iGEM and synthetic biology among students who have expressed an interest in medicine and hopefully shown them the global positive impact can have in the medical field.
Whole School Assembly
The assemblies were used as a tool to educate the school about synthetic biology, a subject only touched upon in A level biology. As a team, we believe that synthetic biology needs to be talked about more in high schools as it is rapidly becoming the most influential area of science.
In our presentations, we explained what synthetic biology entails. We talked about the ever growing need for innovation to help resolve global issues. Issues such as the global food shortage and energy crisis. We  also talked about the ethics of synthetic biology and why the public has been so opposed to its use in the past."

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Metalsensing_-_-_TEXT.html," for gene expression regulation. To read more information on the cadmium sensor, please visit the Cadmium Sensing section of the Project Overview.
To create this AND gate the team made use of the CadA promoter; this promoter, which usually regulates expression of the CadA cadmium efflux channels in the presence of cadmium ions, bears the CzrA binding site. Therefore if this promoter is coupled to the ArsR binding site, expression of a signal protein will only be made in the presence of cadmium.
Why don't we just use the CadA promoter then? The answer is this - cadA can respond to other metals too so a system totally reliant on the cadA promoter as a sensor would not be efficient in achieving the aims of this project. We need a tightly-controlled cadmium sensor
Modelling
To simulate the effects of cadmium intake and sensing, the Metal Sensing Team constructed models using CellML. Please click on the link here: Metal Intake/Efflux Model
BioBrick constructs
For our cadmium-sensing BioBrick design, we have ligated the ArsR binding site( BBa_K174016 ) next to the CadA promoter ( BBa_K174017 ). The CadA promoter drives expression of the CadA efflux channel and this expression activity increase in the presence of cadmium. Yet more importantly the CadA promoter region contains the CzrA binding site the team needs for the cadmium-sensor AND gate.
By placing the ArsR binding site next to the CadA promoter, expression of a signal protein will only be achieved if there is cadmium in the cell.
Lab Work Strategies
In carrying out the lab work required for the construction of the cadmium-sensor, we adhered to the following lab strategy. Please click on the link here to review our strategy: Metal Sensor: czrA+arsR .
Other Presentations and Diagrams
The diagram below illustrates the way in which ArsR and CzrA respond to cadmium ions, which will make their way into the cell via the MntH (manganese transporter) channel:
Please refer the key below to better understand this diagram! In short, cadmium ions make their way through the MntH channel and bind to the ArsR and CzrA repressor proteins. Their removal allows the DNA polymerase to make a signal protein which will feed into the stochastic switch.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Future_-_-_TEXT.html," genetic fusion of an allergen to SbsC S-layer proteins from Geobacillus stearothermophilus combine reduced allergenicity with immunomodulatory capacity. These qualities make them to an ideal allergen carrier/adjuvant in specific immunotherapy, which is the only causative treatment for type I allergy.
In conclusion, S-layer proteins are one of the most innovative and promising discoveries for combining biology with engineering in the new field of nanobiotechnology.
Read a more detailed S-layer description
Impact on the Parts Registry
With our approach in the field of functional S-layer proteins we made it easy for future iGEM teams to create compact, well defined nanobiotechnological surfaces with chosen characteristics and to realize their own projects in a cell-free and biosafe way.
We provided two different fully BioBrick-compatible S-layer genes to the partsregistry (<partinfo>K525301</partinfo> and <partinfo>K525401</partinfo>) which cover the lattice geometries oblique and square, so future iGEM-teams are able to choose the one they like to use for their application.  Because of the Freiburg assembly standard it is easy to create fusion proteins with the S-layer self-assembly domain on the one side and a functional domain on the other side.
Take a look at our practical guide to do it yourself nanobiotechnology to plan and realize your project with our S-layer proteins.
NAD+ detection
Applications
The reviewed molecular beacon based NAD+ bioassay can be applied to biochemical and biomedical studies. Accordingly, it can be utilized to detect NAD+/NADH-dependent enzymatic processes. The low limit of detection, its reliability and manageability provides a practical alternative to present colorimetric, fluorometric, chemiluminescent, electrochemical or mass spectrometric methods detecting NAD+ or NADH. In context of clinical applications and therapeutics the NAD+ bioassay can be useful to monitor cellular NAD+ levels during treatments of tissues or cell cultures for identification of drug targets, for instance. It may also be applied in the field of diagnostics. Finally, the principle of the proposed NAD+ bioassay can be used for cell-free optical biosensors by taking molecular beacons either immobilized on the sensor surface or being present in the reaction medium.

To get the accurate values of absorbance, it is needed to consider the residual E.coli in the supernatant. While the supernatant is incubated for several hours for the enzyme reaction, the cells can grow, produce chitinase and consume reducing sugar for their metabolism, which should influence to the result of DNS assay.
3-2-1 The time-course change of OD 550 of the supernatant.
In this experiment, we checked if the cells were still observed in the supernatant and assayed the growth behavior of cells. Figure 2 shows the time-course change of OD 550 of supernatant. The absorbance values of M9 were hardly increased and they were smaller than 0.2 during the incubation. The absorbance values of SOC were also increased slowly, but were higher than those of M9. The absorbance of values of Plusgrow Ⅱ were increased obviously, especially between the 3h and 5h, and much higher than those of M9 and SOC.
From figure 2, the increase in absorbance of Plusgrow Ⅱ was thought to be due to the cell growth. So, we considered that the cells also existed in M9 and SOC medium though the significant cell growth couldn't observed.
Fig.2: Absorbance of supernatant itself.
3-2-2 The DNS assay of the supernatant.
In this experiment, we evaluated the influence of the cells and its growth to the DNS assay. In other words, we confirmed if cells consume reducing sugar and affect the result of DNS assay. Figure 3 shows the absorbance of each culture supernatant. The values of M9 and Plusgrow Ⅱ were almost zero during the incubation. The absorbance of SOC was observed, but there was little change during the incubation.
From figure 2 and 3, the cell growth didn't affect to the change of absorbance. About M9 and SOC medium, each medium contains only glucose as sugar source and it is considered that glucose was mostly consumed after overnight culture. This is the reason why the cell growth didn't observed. On the other hands, Plusgrow Ⅱ didn't contain reducing sugar, but the cell growth was observed. It can be considered that even if Plusgrow Ⅱ doesn't contain any reducing sugar, the cells consume polysaccharide for their metabolism.

Duesseldorf,2016,Team:Duesseldorf#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," visited by a lot of people, more people than we expected to come. The audience were very diverse: There were Biology-Professors, Bachelor- and Master-Students, as well as pupils and other people, who are not connected to the field of the biological sciences at all.
We held a one-hour long presentation about iGEM, cancer itself, our project and our team and gave an outreach overview about what we already achieved and with whom we worked together to reach our goal.
Our aim was to inform people who are not in touch with biological science and research itself too, so we tried to keep it simple and deliver the information in a clear and easy understandable way.         To make sure that everyone in the audience would understand every detail of the presentation, we also gave a bit of basic information about the central dogma of molecular biology
(DNA → mRNA → Protein), the DNA and proteins itself and what they are made of, as well as optogenetics and its way of functioning.
At the end of the talk, we received many interesting questions and intellectual approaches.        For example, someone asked us, when the therapy that we are developing could be established. We were very happy about this question, because it showed that there was a great public interest in our project.
Another spectator asked us about the applications of our therapy and to which forms and stages of cancer it could be applied. Theoretically, it could be applied at any stage and to any form of cancer.        Additionally, we got asked about whether we would apply a patent on our idea. Naturally, we will not, because the iGEM competition is not about making the biggest capital out of a project, but to promote science.
Many other questions were asked, the people were very interested and wanted to know much about us and our project.
After the presentation, there was a buffet in the foyer of the “Haus der Universität” for everyone who came. Every member of the team prepared something delicious to eat, so we had a big and tasty amount of food to offer. We also bought mineral water, apple juice and beer.
While eating and drinking, we and our guests had a very pleasant time chatting and answering more questions about us and our project.
The feedback that we got was mostly extremely positive: Even the ones not knowing anything about biology understood our talk and enjoyed it. We found out that many of our listeners were (former) cancer patients and therefore had a very personal tie to the topic and our project.
All in all, the evening was a giant success! We are very happy, that we could reach so many people so"

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Calculation_-_-_TEXT.html," way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it be orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. Principal components are guaranteed to be independent only if the data set is jointly normally distributed. PCA is sensitive to the rela-tive scaling of the original variables. Depending on the field of application, it is also named the discrete Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT), the Hotelling transform or proper orthogonal de-composition (POD).
PCA was invented in 1901 by Karl Pearson. Now it is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. PCA can be done by eigenvalue decompo-sition of a data covariance (or correlation) matrix or singular value decomposition of a data matrix, usually after mean centering (and normalizing or using Z-scores) the data matrix for each attribute. The results of a PCA are usually discussed in terms of component scores, sometimes called factor scores (the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point), and loadings (the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score).
PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses. Often, its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. If a multivariate dataset is visualized as a set of coordinates in a high-dimensional data space (1 axis per variable), PCA can supply the user with a low-er-dimensional picture, a ""shadow"" of this object when viewed from its (in some sense) most informative viewpoint. This is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced.
PCA is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix.
How to use PAC?
Principal component analysis (PCA) involves a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of (possibly) correlated variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The first principal component accounts for as much of the var-iability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible.
Determine the Objectives?
Generally, there are two objectives of the PAC listed in the following:
To discover or to reduce the dimensionality of the data set;
To identify new meaningful"

Helping TUST prepare for their first year of competition.
To begin with, we offered them some constructive suggestions, and communicated with their team adviser. In 24/3/2017, we were invited to TUST to carried out a recruiting propaganda for them, and helped them form a team.
Giving TUST Constructing and experimental advice
In 2017.08.01, TUST and Tianjin held a meeting together, during which TUST gave an account of their recent progress, we suggested them to add some new synthetic routes and elements in their project, and probably a new strain instead of simply Xylinus for fibrin.

oGEM - Ontario iGEM Collective
This year, QGEM collaborated with the Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine Collective, which is composed of iGEM teams from the universities of Toronto, Ryerson (new this year), Waterloo, McMaster, and Ottawa. With oGEM, we meet several times during the year to discuss ways to promote iGEM in Ontario, funding strategies, project troubleshooting, and new ways to collaborate for wet lab, dry lab, and policy and practice departments.
One of the oGEM collaborations featured this year was promoting iGEM at the 66th annual conference for the Canadian Society of Microbiologists (CSM) venue at Toronto in June. It was an overall wonderful opportunity to promote synthetic biology awareness amongst the conference delegates while also telling professionals about our research within each of our individual iGEM team projects. At the end of the conference, each of the oGEM teams had an opportunity to present their 2016 projects to professionals in the field of microbiology, specifically focusing on the societal applications of our projects in the fields of medicine and technology.

One of the collaborations we did this summer was with Team XMU-China, who featured QGEM and our 2016 project on nonribosomal peptide synthetases in their September 2016 iGEM Newsletter. In the newsletter, 46 different iGEM teams from around the world are featured alongside their 2016 project, all carefully put together by a talented Team XMU-China. Queen's was one of the 46 teams who contributed to the development of the newsletter, and we would like to thank XMU-China for their tireless efforts towards leading this collaborative project! See the full newsletter here ."
Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#human practice#start-up kit#report_-_-_TEXT.html," that the number of human practice projects is increasing at an acceleration, also as given from graph 5.1. By observing the correlation between the 3 graphs, the turn events of the number of projects done is in 2011 where it increased by almost twice than in 2010.
Conclusion
After reviewing the past human practice projects in a detailed manner, it is safe to say that human practice is becoming a large part of iGEM. Furthermore, the space for improvement and future development was found by looking in to regions and types of projects done.

COLLABORATIONS
During this iGEM season, we have met amazing people from all around the world and performed great work with some of them. We are happy to describe here what we did with them.
iGEM WASHINGTON & iGEM SORBONNE U PARIS (EDUCATION)
This summer, iGEM Washington team wrote a booklet to teach synthetic biology to children and they were looking for someone to translate it in several languages. In collaboration with the iGEM Sorbonne U Paris team , we have translated the booklet into French and corrected some errors in the original one

iGEM GO PARIS-SACLAY (EDUCATION)
With the iGEM GO Paris-Saclay team , we organised a conference and activities in a senior’s residence to explain them what synthetic biology is. Our team focused on explaining what bacteria are and how we can use them and the iGEM GO Paris-Saclay team described the process of insulin biosynthesis using genetically modified microorganisms. More information on this collaboration is on our Education & Public Engagement page .
iGEM MUNICH (COMMUNICATION)
We met the iGEM Munich team during the European Meetup, which they had organised in the summer. This event gave us the opportunity to talk with them about a nice initiative: sending postcards to other teams to share our project. We participated in this initiative and created our own postcard."
Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"ine is converted intracellular into dopamine (Fig. 9).
Figure 9 L-DOPA and Dopamine pathway. Tyrosinase (=Tyrosine Hydroxylase), AADC and CYP2D6 are the enzymes used to incorporate the pathway to the system.
The incorporation of the pathway in the model was done by changing the mRNA transcription rate and the translation rate of the different proteins. This was necessary, because the length of the DNA sequences and the proteins change the rate of the transcription and translation.
New species had to be added to the model to introduce the pathway. Dopamine and L-Dopa are the desired end products of the pathway and can also diffuse through the cell membrane (Fig. 10). The tyrosine amount in the cell was estimated as 280 molecules, which is 1% of the total tyrosine in the cytoplasm [13]. The available tyrosine in the cell is held constant in the modeled cell, since the cell produces constantly tyrosine.
Figure 10 Overview of incorporating the pathway to the model. New species and reactions were added to model the pathway
which is controlled by the previous expression system.
To get an overview of the model all new parameters and species are listed in the following tables.
Table 3 New Parameters to introduce the Pathway
Table 4 New Species for the pathway
Enzyme velocity
AADC is known to be the rate limiting step in the pathway. The enzyme velocity of the Tyrosinase was found in literature to be 0.3 conversions/min [14]. So the velocities of the other enzymes were estimated according to this value.
Results
Figure 11 Expression of the three genes of the pathway. The graph of the Tyrosinase is the same as CYP2D6 (yellow).
The three enzymes of the pathway were modeled in a way all enzymes are expressed in an equally amount. This is the case if the first gene of interest in the expression system (CFP) is replaced by the Tyrosinase and CYP2D6, whereas the second gene of interest (mRFP) gets replaced by AADC (Fig. 11).
Figure 12 Dopamine and L-Dopa yield in the environment/gut.
The model showed a high yield of dopamine and a lower yield of L-DOPA in the gut (Fig. 12). If we recalculate the molecule values into concentrations we get a yield of 401.75 μmol/h/L or 61.54 mg/h/L. This means, it takes 1.6 hours to get an"

Another motivation is to work together with students  of other university courses and to share experiences and knowledge. At least there is one  more motivation to take part in the iGEM-Project. The international level shows that there is a big demand in such projects and so I’m very proud of taking part in it.

Greetings! Being a humanoid protocol droid I'm eager to carry out any protocol I'm provided  with in a wet lab environment always trying to enhance my current program . And  our project for the iGEM competition offers a remarkably way to do so. The idea of  constructing biological systems with novel features that provide the potential to  benefit my fellow humanoids and the analogy to electronic circuits, which, as a droid, I'm based on as well, is quite appealing.

I was always interested in biological processes, mechanism of life and therewith associated medical research. Therefore it is a great opportunity to be a part of such a big project. On the one hand I gain experience in the laboratory and so at teamwork. On the other to develop a project from beginning till the end, like in working life later. Furthermore on our project I am fascinated by the fact that we only have to exchange two small amino acid by the hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) to  create a new biological machine, which produce a new hyaluronic acid. My biggest motivation is that we can with this new machine in further future help people.

Our Vision
""Collaboration leads to a better and more accepted technology""
Consultation with both university specialists and beekeepers has pointed out the main cause of the Colony Collapse Disorder: Varroa destructor. Our collaboration with the Design Academy Eindhoven has led to a design of our final application, and in collaboration with Synenergene and Resource Wageningen we created a magazine of the future where we illustrated the techno-moral consequences of our technology. We invited the other Dutch iGEM teams for a national meetup. Finally, we organized and attended multiple events related to synthetic biology.
We contacted the NBV, Dutch Association for Beekeepers, in order to understand the impact of V. destructor on bees and beekeepers. In addition, Bob Mulder, the communication specialist of Wageningen UR and team adviser, pointed out the following principle: ""Don’t change the consumer, change the technology"". After several conversations with beekeepers from the NBV and through Bob Mulders advice, it became clear that an improved product must meet the following criteria:
It should be effective and specific, not killing the bees or have any negative influence on the beekeepers.
It should be adapted to the hobbyist character of beekeeping, ensuring the viability of E. coli in the sugar water so no changes have to be made in beekeeping practices.
It should not interfere with honey, like the curent usage of thymol does.
Design
We contacted the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) to help us in designing an applicable format for BeeT. After mutual visits, a design student from the DAE – Thieu Custers -  proposed a product that incorporated the daily practices of beekeepers and BeeT: A juicebox-like product that beekeepers apply to the sugar water just before the start of the winter.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content3_-_-_TEXT.html,"2.2 Protein Synthesis
What else, a resonance may happen among the oscillators which results in a peak synthesis of protein under some conditions. This phenomenon can be used to increase the yield of some medical proteins such as antitoxic serum and antibody[9][10].
2.3 Prevention pathogen
In the applications of controlling pathogens, quorum sensing system plays an important role in regulating growth and reputation of microorganism. So we could restrain quorum sensing system to control microorganism to make our life more healthy and nice. The most important part in the metabolism of pathogens controlled by quorum sensing system is the synthesis of toxin and the formation of membrane system. If we can restrain these two kinds of effect may we decrease some potential diseases resources and improve the effects of antitoxins. What's more, it is a particularly attractive point to prevent pathogens through restraining their quorum sensing system instead of killing them directly as it offers the prospect of combating effectively infections resistant to all existing drugs. As we all know, just treat diseases via using antibotics or antitoxin can help these pathogens improve their resistance to various drugs, which is very dangerous for us human being. To date, although we've found that different fungus form different signal molecules, the quorum sensing system almost takes part in cell morphological transformation and information communication. We think our oscillatory gene circuits provide a very useful and meaningful model to promote more and more research in this field[11].
Gene sinusoidal signal generator
With the development of science and technology, computer had been here and there with larger RAM, faster CPU and smaller volume. All these changes owe to VLSI （Very Large Scale Integrated Circuites）, which consists of different electronic component.
Just image what if we can control cell as a biocomputer. Cellular computer is a device consists of different kinds genetically engineered bacteria, which can do the calculation, such as add and subtract like a normal computer. To finish such a device, scientists need various gene circuits to complete different operations. These circuits are just like electronic component working in an electronic computer.
At the beginning of this century, biocomputer is still a crazy dream far more than a possible blueprint. But now scientists have had the technology to make this ""impossible mission"" comes true. In recent months, scientists from Stanford constructed a new ""bio-crystal valve"" by DNA and RNA, which can do the logical operations in the living cells[6].
Two months later, scientists from MIT used less than 3 gene devices to do the digital operation in division, logarithmic and square root. Thus, constructing gene"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," invest the time into the patent searches for a completely different reason as well - they can be a valuable source of knowledge on how to structure the claims and the main description. Patent “language” is a completely different style of writing and one can only start learning it - be reading more of them.
4. Generally speaking the patent is divided into three main parts: specifications, drawings and patent claims. The most important part of the patent is claims.They point out the aspects of your product or technology that you regard as your invention and define your exclusive rights to it. The rest of the patent is there to support to what is claimed. You will also need specifications (a full and complete description) of your invention which provides the proof of understanding of the claims, and drawings that illustrate certain aspects of the invention so the reader can follow the text more easily.
When filing a patent you want to describe every detail of your invention, as well as its alternative versions. However, you can have the most thorough description of your invention but it will not matter unless you have been granted the claims that cover that description. Also, it is important to note that you can rearrange the patent application, but you cannot add a new material without filling a new patent application.
5. After you submit your application it is all about waiting. It may take up to a few years for patent to get fully accepted. This time is meant for the experts analysis, and also competitor disputes.
Customer profile
The largest part of our products will be unique and precisely tailored. As our future company would facilitate a B2B model, the most important sales and marketing factor would be building strong relationships with each of our clients. Mainly they will be companies producing drugs and/or chemicals that require enzymatic solutions for their production pipeline, or enzyme producing companies that are looking for technological solutions and research services.
Potential clients:
1. Novozymes. A Danish biotechnology company that develops and manufactures enzymes and microorganisms for industrial use. The company holds an estimated 48% of the global enzyme market, making it the world’s largest producer of industrial enzymes.
2. BASF. A German chemical company that extensively produces chemicals , including plastic materials, pharmaceuticals and chemicals for agriculture. It is the largest chemical producer in the world.
3. DSM. A global science-based company active in health, nutrition and materials.
4. Johnson & Johnson: number one on the list of top pharmaceutical companies across a range of industries from medical devices to pharmaceutical and consumer goods.
5. Novartis. It is the Switzerland's largest pharmaceutical companies and specialises in the development of biological therapies.

Gibson Assembly for small parts
During the construction of our first plasmid, we had many problems dealing with getting correct assemblies of the constructs which involved small parts (< 200bp). We found that for those kind of assemblies, people would recommend different conditions. For example, some people recommended using as much as 5 times more DNA from the smaller insert in relation to the amount of plasmid backbone, arguing that such a small insert would be completely chewed up by the T5 exonuclease when in small amount. Others would recommend 1 to 1 mix of parts for Gibson Assembly. Because we did not find an authoritative source or consensus with respect to the optimal conditions for small part assembly, we decided to run tests under our experimental conditions.
Our analysis of the reaction gave us the notion that the number of resulting colonies would be in direct relationship to the amount of available backbone. However, the total number of true positives would only be influenced by the ratio at which the inserts could compete with the assembly of aberrant constructs, such as the one described by the Washington University 2011 iGEM Team about selfcomplementarity of the NotI sequences embedded in the prefix and suffix.
Considering that the small part would be degraded by the T5 exonuclease and that without insert available the remaining backbone would end up assembling with its selfcomplementary ends, we decided to evaluate whether by changing the amount of T5 exonuclease in the reaction we could improve our rate of true positives.
To test this hypothesis, we designed a Gibson Assembly which involved a small part of mRFP1 and a large backbone"
SYSU_CHINA,2015,Team:SYSU CHINA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," will not revert the DNA flanked by LR sites.
In the design of Micro-timer 3.0, each inverted promoter flanked by BP sites is at the downstream of an inverted reporter gene and followed by a ser integrase gene. The reporter i(inverted reporter gene)-attP-promoter i-attB-integrase unit is defined as a counting motif, named eukaryotic timer integrase motif (EIM). EIM can be inserted into different sites of chromosomes, creating a large scale and multi-level system in eukaryotes.
The circuit can be programmed to record time by counting a specific type of events such as the expression of cyclins. Once the motifs are activated, the downstream expression can work automatically and will not be terminated or reset by the hosts themselves, which is the reason why we believe that such a system can imprint “the same time” on microbes derived from a monoclone.
To make better use of the bxb1 integrase, we improved the biobrick BBa_K1039003 submitted by iGEM2013-Waterloo, optimizing it to match RFC 25 standard (BBa_K1641900) and thus it can be applied on 3A-fusion-assembly.
Registry Contribution
New application of Cre (BBa_K1179058) and its detailed measurement.
Although the data in the iGEM Registry is pretty large for iGEMers to obtain most common information, there is limited material about recombinases, and less about the invertase activity. Hence we tried our best to gather information about one of the most commonly used recombinases – Cre.
BBa_K1179058 is a Cre CDS provided by team iGEM13_MIT, and all of our experiments about cre is established using this sequence. We developed a real-time invertase dynamics testing system based on BBa_K1179058, and confirmed its functionality as an invertase. Further, we measured the dynamics pattern of its enzymatic activity and discovered some interesting property of this invertase.
In sum, we not only provided a new application for this part, but also measured the detailed dynamics pattern of this recombinase.
RFC25 optimization of bxb1integrase (BBa_K1039003)
The bxb1 integrase part has been submitted by iGEM2013-Waterloo (BBa_K1039003), but it does not match the RFC25 standard and thus can not be applied on fusion via 3A assembly. In SYSU-CHINA 2015, we modified the bxb1"

TAL-based transcriptional regulators
We created several TAL repressors by fusions of the KRAB repression domain to different positions relative tothe TAL DNA-binding domain and reporter plasmids with their respective binding sites (operators).
We created several TAL activator constructs by C-terminal fusion of the VP16 domain with TAL DNA-binding domains and reporter plasmids with their respective operators.
We improved and characterized the NicTAL DNA-binding domain (deposited by the iGEM2010 team Slovenia) by adding the missing subdomain of the protein and created a designed repressor and activator.
TAL:KRAB fusions exhibited over 90% repression of reporter gene expression regardless of the position of the KRAB domain.
Minimal promoters used for construction of reporter plasmids showed no or minimal leakiness and were activated over 1500-fold by TAL:VP16 fusions.
(NEW) Our experimental results on designed TAL regulators provided parameters for the quantitative deterministic modeling of bistable switches.

For the past two decades, engineered zinc finger proteins have been extensively used for targeting specific DNA sequences. However, in spite of the many years of technological development, engineered zinc finger proteins are not able to target every desired DNA sequence due to the impact of neighboring fingers on the recognition of base pairs. Recently DNA-binding proteins with a simpler DNA recognition code were discovered. Transcription activator like (TAL) effectors are bacterial plant pathogen transcription factors that bind to DNA by recognizing a specific DNA sequence in which each base pair binds to a single tandem repeat in the T"

All the iGEMers in our team are my friends and I do enjoy performing experiments and exchanging ideas with them. It is in iGEM that I learned how to cooperate, how to think and the basic skills for doing research of synthetic biology.
Hello! I am Zhengyu Luo, a senior student major in math and I am the computer engineer of the team in charge of the construction of the webpage. I like art and design and I am full of energy and prepared for any kind of challenges. Synthetic biology is a very hot subject these days so I joined WHU-China to learn something about it. I believe it must be a very interesting experience.
Hey guys! I'm Li Yuwenbin from Wuhan University, a team member of Whu-China.

Creating ‘The E.ncapsulator’: in situ manufacture and oral delivery of human biopharmaceuticals
A major, yet unsolved, challenge in the pharmaceutical industry involves overcoming the harsh acidic environment of the stomach in order to deliver proteins to the gut. This year the Imperial College iGEM team has decided to tackle this problem by developing an innovative, self-contained drug fabrication and delivery system. In our 'E.ncapsulator', Escherichia coli will be engineered not only to efficiently manufacture important biopharmaceuticals, but also to coat and protect protein based drugs until release in the small intestine.
Furthermore, in order to create E.ncapsulator tablets for oral delivery, there has been much focus on designing and engineering a number of modules for implementation in E. coli. The modularity that is central to our project will be evident in the areas of protein drug production, self-encapsulation and genome deletion. Utilising the E.coli bacterium, we are creating a re-usable chassis that will allow the development of a range of biopharmaceuticals to be delivered to the gut. Our E.ncapsulator is therefore intended as an elegant solution to, not one, but a range of human ailments and conditions, which cannot currently be successfully treated by oral drugs.
The first module involves engineering E. coli to synthesise the protein drug of interest to sufficient quantities. Once accomplished, activation of module two initiates the encapsulation phase, in which E. coli coats itself in a protective layer of colanic acid to form the E.ncapsulator. This protective capsule is what shields the biopharmaceutical against the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. The third module, genome deletion, is composed of a ‘suicide trigger’ mechanism that destroys the genetic material of the bacteria. Finally, once in the small intestine, the capsule will be naturally degraded by enzymes present, thereby releasing the designed biopharmaceutical to the gut micro biota where it can carry out its intended function.
The self-encapsulation of a synthetic biology chassis is new to iGEM and represents a completely novel and innovative approach to biopharmaceutical design, manufacture and delivery. Throughout the project we have followed an engineering approach that incorporates modular design, detailed modelling and simulation as well as systematic integration. Using such an approach, we are hopeful that the E.ncapsulator will be coming soon to a Pharmacy near you!

However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
How to create products based on database description?
In MoDeL frame, products are composed of both definite parts and ST parts. The sources of ST parts are defined in component listOfTransferTable. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, A-B, where A and B are both NST parts. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be A and B. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products as expected are connected by the tree node. To find products with correct structure, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, Trimming and Splitting. Three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched for some template chain as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and"

The –C lane is a negative control. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1100-bp when digested. The gel was a 2% agarose gel and was run at 80 volts for 90 minutes.
A construction attempted this week consited of placing the RFC25 fusion standard GFP ( BBa_K648013 ) gene behind the promoter BBa_J04500 . Also attempted were plasmid switches of all of the coil genes ordered. Colonies were seen for all of the transformed ligation mixtures for these constructions. Colony PCR of these transformed colonies only produced potentially viable results for the J04500 + K648013 construct. The K-coil, K-coil His-tag and E-coil His-tag plasmid switches also displayed bands around the expected size during colony PCR.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
This week contained some disappointment as the BioBrick constructions continued to have limited efficacy. The confirmation digests of the construct that showed some promise during last week’s colony PCR (J04500 + K648013) and the plasmid switches (K-coil, K-coil His-tag and E-coil His-tag) did not produce expected results. One rather notable issue is the ~200-bp size difference seen in the J04500 + K648013 from the expected size of 955-bp. The difference appears to suggest that the LacI promoter is not present. This hypothesis was confirmed with sequencing results. This would suggest that the wrong enzymes were used during construction or that there is potential contamination of the enzyme buffers used.
A replicate of these constructions this week also produced similar results. Due to this it is recommended that new buffers be used for further constructions. Some of the difficulty present with plasmid switching the coils is due to their small size however. Since the coils themselves are at minimum approximately 60-bp in size. This is not kinetically favorable for BioBrick construction. It may be wise to primer on the coils to appropriate constructs when the time comes for their addition.  Also present in our constructions are re-ligations of the original vector. Due to this the time for phosphatase treatment will be increased from two to three hours to limit this issue.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Proceeding with the recommendations from last week regarding BioBrick constructions the plasmid switches of the coil genes into pSB1C3 were"
Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Culturing and purification of BBa_K2380043 acted as a negative control because the COD on this plasmid has no His-tag for purification.
Outlook
Further experiments for the subproject chitosan are the validation of the new generated BioBricks BBa_K2848000 and BBa_K2848001. By varying the amount of IPTG and arabinose induction of expression can be optimized. Purification of NodC and COD from cell culture with a His-Trap column should be analyzable by SDS-PAGE. Eventually the staining method has to be more sensitive (e.g. silver staining, western blot). After proof of function chitosan could be produced by E. coli in one culturing step by adding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to the medium.
The final purification of chitosan from the cell culture has to be investigated. The fact that chitosan is possibly toxic to E. coli must be considered. Eventually, induction of chitin synthase and chitin deacetylase has to be separated to protect E. coli from early cell death (see Design) . Otherwise, intracellular chitosan has perhaps no toxic effect, because it interacts with peptidoglycan [C.1] .
Nisin
Team Nisin generated BioBricks that enable the production of a modified nisin in E. coli. The template for the construct of nisin (containing two tags: one for purification: His6-tag, one for covalent linkage using tyrosinase: YAAY-tag) was synthesized by IDT. This template then was used for successful amplifications of the NisA inserts (Figure N.1).

Our Journey
 
''If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go  together.''
- African proverb -
  The beginning of our journey
 
When we first saw that The National Institute of Chemistry was looking for team members  to present the colours of Slovenia iGEM HS Division, we thought it would be a great  opportunity to do what something we were interested in and learn something new. We  applied to the call for applications and hoped for the best. Parts of the application  procedure were writing a motivational letter, attending an interview, taking part in a  personality test and, the toughest of them all, solve a scientific problem.
 14 months ago, we knew nothing about synthetic biology because we only learned the  basics in our biology and chemistry classes. We had no clue how demanding the project is  going to be at the time.
Building a knowledge basis
 
When we started with our team meetings in September and October 2014,  we first had to  learn the basics of biochemistry and biotechnology.  Through autumn and winter we have  had having lessons two afternoons per week after school. We learned about cloning,  plasmids, PCR and biobricks. Moreover, we learned how to edit wiki pages, use  bioinformatics programs and data bases. At the same time we were also studying the  additional literature and developing our ideas. We learned about E. coli, conditions for its  optimal growth and bioreactors. Finally, we got to enter the labs where we practiced basic  lab techniques and protocols, such as pipetting with micropipettes. We also cut the vectors  with restriction enzymes for the first time and tested our samples using agarose gel  electrophoresis.  It needless to say how fascinated we were when we were actually able to  see several pieces of DNA of different lengths.  It was a great experience because we were tutored by university professors and scientists  who were really able to explain to us everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
Afterwards we decided to divide in two working groups: biotechnologists and synthetic  biologists"

Termites are recognized as the 5th pest around the world, based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards wood. Owing to their wood-eating habits, termites are terminators of crops, trees, buildings, river dams；and spoil people’s life. ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified  toxins expression system with a delivery carrier CNC (cellulose nanocrystals), capable of exterminate whole nest of  termites based on their trophallaxis in an indoor designed device.
To prevent the bacteria from being released into environment or simply being degraded without completing its mission, and to reduce termites’ resistance towards toxins; we designed bacteria carriers self-assembled from the generated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC).
We are always exploring a more convenient and intuitive new way to promote synthetic biology and iGEM projects better to the broader public. So, this time we have created Poly Cards, a new public education tool to communicate synthetic biology and iGEM projects.  The cards have been successfully incorporated biobricks and iGEM projects.  For better practice of Poly Cards, cooperating with Zhejiang China Association for Science and Technology, we held a Syn-bio Share.

Description of the System
Fig. 3 shows our flow focusing model configuration with boundaries specified. There is one main inlet for IA         phase, and two for each LO and OA phases on the left side. On the right side, there is an outlet with outflow         pressure set to p = 0. For laminar flow, wall condition is set to no slip, which states that the flow velocity         at the walls is always v = 0 and it gives a good approximation of the whole system.
In experimental set-up, we coat the OA channels, junction and post-junction with PVA to make it hydrophilic,         contrary to hydrophobic PDMS, which is the material of which the microfluidic devices are made. This provides a         good setting for liposome formation5, and we take that into account by adjusting contact angles at the wetted         walls for ternary phase field node. With respect to model limitations, all the         contact angles in IA and LO channels are set to 90 degrees. In the coated side, we assume phase OA has a         perfect wetting condition on the channel walls against both IA and LO phases, while the contact angle between         the latter two is set at 30 degrees.
The aforementioned interface thickness parameter ϵ is set to 1.4 µm as it is the lowest stable value regarding         our mesh and mobility tuning parameter, though it is more than enough to accurately depict the results of         simulations. Surface tension is another important aspect to be considered and it is set to σ = 0.0085 N/m,         which is an interfacial tension between octanol and water 6, for all three interfaces between phases (See             Limitations).
In order to make our model as realistic as possible, several other parameters are taken from a single baseline         wet lab experiment with similar materials and geometry as mentioned before.
Flow rates are transformed into flow velocities for COMSOL and calculated as described in Tab. 2.

Safety
All our team members received safety and operational training before working in the lab. This included training in good laboratory practice, waste disposal and the idiosyncchrasies of working in a hackspace lab. The appropriate personal protective equipment was used which included lab coats gloves and where necessary safety spectacles.
All work that was required to be carried out in a CL1 or greater environment took place in the labs of UCL Biochemical Engineering department. This work was overseen by a Safety Officer of the UCL Biochemical Engineering department. UK regulations were adhered to.
Work with Escherichia coli strain DH5-Alpha was considered low risk in accordance with classification from German TRBA as a Risk Group 1 organism.
Work with wild type Gluconacetobacter hansenii LMG1524 (ATCC 23769) was considered low risk in accordance with classification from German TRBA as a Risk Group 1 organism.
Additionally, our procedures for removing bacteria from cellulose products were informed by work done by iGEM 2014 team Imperial College London .

Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," position 12 and 13 in difference, which reasonably leads to in cell homologous recombination under the functions of Rec family proteins. Apparently, it can happen to one TALE, with one repeat crossing with another in this peptide chain. Moreover, it may happen to several TALE which contains a relatively larger amount of homologous regions. Thus, the RVD will be disturbed and the targeting function of the TALE will be missed.
Our solution is based on the codon usage bias, which refers to differences in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in coding DNA.[1] The translational efficiency of heterologous genes can often be improved by optimizing synonymous codon usage to better match the host organism.[2]

TALE Assembly
The TALE assembly strategy uses the Golden Gate cloning method, which is based on the ability of type IIS enzymes to cleave outside of their recognition site. When type IIS recognition sites are placed to the far 5’ and 3’ end of any DNA fragment in inverse orientation, they are removed in the cleavage process, allowing two DNA fragments flanked by compatible sequence overhangs, termed fusion sites, to be ligated seamlessly. Since type IIS fusion sites can be designed to have different sequences, directional assembly of multiple DNA fragments is feasible. Using this strategy, DNA fragments can be assembled from undigested input plasmids in a one-pot reaction with high efficiency.
We chose the native TALE AvrBs3  as a scaffold for customized assembly of TALE constructs. The central DNA binding domain of AvrBs3 is formed by 17.5 tandemly arranged 34 amino acid repeats, with the last half repeat showing similarity to only the first 20 amino acids of a full repeat.

PTS screening
Trusting on our targeted approach alone seemed risky − that is why we planned a PTS screening to find the most favorable PTS for our three receptors. Dueber et al. (2016) used the Violacein assay for a similar purpose. They screened for the best PTS for the wild type receptor and were successful. Hence another subproject of our team is the integration of the Violacein pathway into the peroxisome ( Violacein ), we were already supplied with all necessary enzymes − VioA, VioB and VioE.
Figure 1.8: Pathway leading to the production of prodeoxyviolacein − the assay is based on the green color to identify colonies without functional import mechanism.
The figure above shows the principles of the assay. VioA and VioB are localized in the cytosol and lead to the production of the IPA imine dimer while VioE is tagged with a PTS1 variant. Successful import leads to white colonies whereas missing import results in green colonies due to the cytosolic production of prodeoxyviolacein.
Our rests upon the following two plasmids which are co-transformed into yeast.
Figure 1.9: Plasmids used for Violacein assay. The left one carries the coding sequence for the Pex5 variant, VioA and VioB whereas the right one contains the gene for VioE plus the attached PTS1 variant.
As shown above, we created one plasmid containing VioA, VioB and one of our Pex5 variants while the other plasmid only contained VioE. We then designed primers which bind to the VioE plasmid to amplify the whole plasmid except the terminator − random PTS1 variants were attached to VioE with the help of a random primer library. Following up, we did the ligation with the corresponding terminator and obtained a mix of several different VioE-PTS1 plasmids.
After plasmid amplification in Escherichia coli we then co-transformed yeast with the two constructs and waited for the colonies to grow. With the yeast growing, prodeoxyviolacein should be produced in yeast cells with absent import (green color) and the IPA imine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.

Analysis:  Lanes 1-4 are J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 trial 1 (treating B0015 as the Insert).  Lanes 5-8 are trial 2 (treating J13002-LuxOD47E as the Insert).  Lane 9 is J13002-LuxOD47E (a size control), Lane 10 is LuxOD47E BBK (another size control) and Lane 11 is a negative control.
This gel seems ot be kind of slanted, which isn't very good for size comparison.  It looks like some of the first lanes of Trial 1 may have worked (contain the B0015 terminator) as they appear slightly higher than other lanes, however we will run a new gel with the PCR product to be sure.

One more time concentration Graphs: Shifting
Mathematica graph function (a built-in function) gets a list of numbers and plot them in a way that we have the list of numbers on Y-axis and the indexes of the numbers in the list on X-axis.  Knowing that, when we just have one cell in the simulation, and we want to plot the concentration graph of a given agent in the cell (for example AI-2), we pass the number of AI-2s in teach time step as a list to our built-in graph function and we generate it. However, when division occurs we have to pass two lists of numbers (one for first cell, and the other for the newly produced cell). That is where we are faced with a problem. The problem is as it was mentioned Mathematica automatically plot the graph by the indexes the numbers in the list, and the indexes for the cells existing from beginning of the simulation is as same as each time step, but for newly generated cells we need to shift the graphs to the time step they become to exist.  To do so, we need to save the time steps that divisions occur, and then somehow differentiate the lists of numbers we are passing and add the time steps to the lists that are for new cells.
