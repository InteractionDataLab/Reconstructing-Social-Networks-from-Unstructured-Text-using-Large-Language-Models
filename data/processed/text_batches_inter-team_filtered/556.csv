8. Re-suspend the cells in 1/25 of the original culture volume of ice cold TFB2, using vortex, in the cold room. For a 250ml subculture use 10ml of TFB2.
9. Incubate the cells on ice for 60 minutes and then aliquot 100µl/ Eppendorf tube for storage at -80°C.
10. Quick freeze the tubes in a dry ice/isopropanol bath (or liquid nitrogen). Cells should be stable for between 3 months to 1 year.
Transformation:
1. Thaw the competent cells on ice. Use 50µl per transformation.
2. Gently mix the cells with up to 5µl of DNA without pipetting up and down.
3. Incubate on ice for 20 minutes.
4. Heat shock the cells at 42°C for 45s.
5. Place the cells on ice for 3-5 minutes.
6. Add 200-950µl of room temperature LB or SOC media.
7. Incubate the cells at 37°C whilst shaking them at 225rpm for 1hour (2 hours if plasmid contains chloramphenicol resistance).
8. Spread up to 200µl on the selection plates and incubate at 37°C overnight.
Colony PCR
1. Combine the master mix for PCR on ice (20µl reactions are sufficient).
2. Dip the pipet tip to the selected colony and now either:
a) Pipet up and down directly into PCR mix aliquot and store the tip inside eppie in the fridge, or
b) Pipet the bacteria into 10µl of H2O and pipet 1µl into the reaction, storing the rest in the fridge
3.Continue the PCR as normal and run the gel, you can then grow the selected cultures from the bacteria you saved in the fridge.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
1. Design the primers with mutation that meet end to end (there is software for that) and have them synthesized 5' phosphorylated (SDS-PAGE purification recommended).
2. Perform a PCR as usual with high fidelity polymerase.
3. Recircularise the amplified plasmid with DNA ligase.
4. Digest with DpnI. This is optional if you use little amounts of template (as low as 10pg) and are going to send 3 or more samples for sequencing.
5. Transform.

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"On Monday 13th of October we received parts to be evaluated in Bacillus subtilis from the iGEM Team Groningen. The goal was to evaluate Promoters fused to a super-folded Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP)  towards their activity in B. subtilis . In order to do so we had to bring the BioBricks into our integrative BioBrick compatible backbone pSB1C . The final analysis was done using fluorescent-activated cell sorting ( FACS ). The results of the strains carrying the Promoter-sfGFP insertion were compared to the B. subtilis W168 strain.
The following Promoters were analyzed: CP1 , CP11 , CP29 , CP30 , CP41 , CP44
The data achieved via FACS shows no change in distribution of FL1-A intensity. This strongly inidcates, that the promoter-sfGFP constructs are not active when integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome. This might however be not only due to an lack of Promoter activity. To further invesitgate a quantitative assay using promoter-lux fusions should be carried out.

Collaboration with iGEM headquarters
In addition to the usual team collaborations, we communicated with the iGEM headquarters and pointed out that we had difficulties with the pSB1C3 plasmid vector sequence. A restriction digest of the backbone yielded more fragments than expected. Therefore we sequenced the whole backbone and found 7 mutations. Although the vector replicated fine and the antibiotic resistance was functional, we feared potential future problems and sent the correct sequence to the iGEM headquarters. Based on these findings iGEM headquarters introduced versioning of the plasmid backbones and our pSB1C3 was named pSB1C3_001.
Mutations in the pSB1C3 backbone:
Collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team ESBS-Strasbourg
We established a collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team ESBS-Strasbourg, who asked for our assembled Biobricks of YFP and CFP cloned into the standard pSB1C3 backbone. We sent out the plasmids so that they could use and test the plasmids for their cloning purposes. To expand our collaboration, the Strasbourg team visited us at our laboratory. Both teams made a presentation of their project and exchanged impressions and ideas about iGEM and the daily laboratory work. After that, we spent time together having a nice barbecue.

UQ-Australia,2009,Team:UQ-Australia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering surface protein. Coupling a mercury sensitive promoter to the expression of Ag43 enables cells to accumulate mercury then aggregate in solution.
P. syringae is a ubiquitous airborne bacterium which expresses a unique protein, InaZ. This protein acts as a scaffold for ice nucleation, inducing precipitation. Optimal growth of P. syringae occurs at 22oC. By introducing five heat-shock genes, the tolerance range will be increased to better suit the Australian climate.  This modification has the potential to increase the availability of Australia’s most precious resource; water.
Bioaccumulation (Mercury) Project
Project Outline
Water contamination is a key environmental issue for many countries around the world, both developed and developing.  In Queensland, Australia we have a particular problem with Mercury (Hg2+) contamination of water supplies around the major mining town of Mt Isa, and also from Airforce bases. After searching through the iGEM projects from previous years,  the arsenic detection system inspired us.  As the UQ 09' team, we wish to take this idea one step further and completely remove the offending heavy metal from water systems.
To do this we will be utilizing a strain of Escherichia coli, with their already established mercury uptake, reduction and efflux system and making a few modifications. One of our aims is to couple the detection of Mercury to the expression of a native bacterial protein, Antigen 43 (AG43).  This protein, when expressed, causes the bacteria to stick to one another. As the bacteria aggregate in clumps, they will fall to the bottom of the sample.  Our idea is for the bacteria to take up the mercury, activating  Ag43 expression, resulting in aggregation, and the Mercury-filled bacteria will fall to the bottom leaving clean water.
There are a number of parts that we hope to add to the registry. The first is Ag43 as a protein coding sequence and the MerR promoter sequence.  We will also add the completed mercury uptake and aggregation system as an operon.
Project Background
Many bacteria carry heavy metal resistance systems, either encoded on a plasmid or within their genome. For example, the bacterium Cupriavidis metallidurans, first isolated from a sludge tank contaminated with high levels of heavy metals, contains genes which encode for reistance systems to Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(IV), Hg(II), Ni"

We were trying to obtain the FAO1 gene. We did a yeast colony PCR. Using an sterile tip, we picked one C. tropicalis colony and we introduced them into a vial containing 30 μL SDS 0.2 %. The vial was vortexed 15 seconds and then heated 4 minutes at 90°C. Next, it was centrifuged during 1 minute ans the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 μL vial. That was our PCR template.
We performed a control PCR employing control primers (HSRI Rtrv + 1149 and HSRI BamHI + 480)and the another PCR using FAO1 primers as previously done (iGEMJul09 and iGEMJul10).

Fusion: Fusion of the B-lymphocytes from the spleen and a murine myeloma cell line (B-lymphocyte cancer cells), thus creating immortal and high-yield antibody producing hybrid cells.
Screening: Affinity based screening tests of the different antibodies to select the most effective one. This involves techniques such as ELISA and are followed by affinity chromatography purification. Reference: Siddiqui MZ. Monoclonal antibodies as diagnostics; an appraisal. Indian J Pharm Sci. 2010;72(1):12-7.
Multiplication: Growing of selected hybridoma cell in a culture dish or transplantation of the tumor cells into a new animal for a higher yield. The latter is the typical procedure.
Harvesting: The hybridoma cells will mass produce their antibody and mass divide. This causes tumor development and accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavities (ascites). The fluid can be drained and the antibodies harvested from it.
Antibodies generated in the murine model will have to be further modified before they can be used therapeutically in humans. The murine antibodies will be recognized as foreign in humans and will elicit an immune response against murine antibody. Before mouse antibodies (or any other animal antibody) can be used in clinical medicine, they have to be 'humanized'. Humanized animal antibodies are also known as chimeric antibodies limited Reference: Berger M, Shankar V, Vafai A. Therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies. Am J Med Sci. 2002;324(1):14-30. and are generated by combining the constant part of a human antibody with the variable (epitope-recognizing) part of the murine antibody. However chimeric antibodies are still about 30% foreign for the human body, and therefore they elicit significant immunogenicity in humans. Reference: Berger M, Shankar V, Vafai A. Therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies. Am J Med Sci. 2002;324(1):14-30. Creation of chimeric and humanized antibodies is not as easy as it might sound. It requires extensive knowledge and characterisation of the antibody structure and effective methods are still limited. Reference: Berger M, Shankar V, Vafai A. Therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies. Am J Med Sci. 2002;324(1):14-30.

Warsaw,2010,Team:Warsaw#galTest_-_-_TEXT.html," in fantasy books, metal music and for some time in sword fighting.
Kamila Ornoch I come from Warsaw and study Biology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology is about intracellular localization of Suv3 protein from Danio rerio. And I love to climb: high is my infatuation :)
Kamil Koper I come from a small town in south-east Poland, but I spent most of my life living in Warsaw. I study Biotechnology at the Warsaw University in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology. My B. Sc. thesis focused on human mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and their correlation with the occurrence of specific forms of cancer. If I'm not in the lab or out playing billiards with friends you can usually find me in my workshop, or playing vintage video games.
Jakub Piątkowski I study biotechnology at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). My research interests include RNA turnover in mitochondria and the evolution of organellar genomes. My B.Sc. thesis focused on a novel RNA-binding protein DMR1p in S. cerevisiae. Currently I’m working on my M.Sc. thesis, where I plan to include more detailed description of RNA-protein interactions in yeast mitochondrion. I also participate in the activities of the students’ societies: of Molecular and Synthetic Biology.
Marcin Ziemniak I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include all aspects of bioorganic and theoretical chemistry connected with biopolymers, and some fields of biology involving synthetic and structural biology. Actually I am working in Division of Biophysics, UW and try to synthesize some new analogues of 5’ mRNA cap structures with superior biological properties. Moreover, I am about to finish my B. Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Anna Saffray I am a high school student and I have lived in Warsaw since 2003. Before that I lived in France near Paris . I always loved to do some experiments in my school , so when I started to work in the laboratory it was a great pleasure spending days with pipettes.
Radosław Stachowiak My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop"

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html," to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 2).  CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ modulate rotation of the flagellar motor and thus change cell behavior and movement; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state to make feedback to CheW and CheA.
Fig. 2 Signaling components and circuit logic. E.coli receptors employ a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.  Abbreviations: OM (outer membrane); PG (peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall); CM (cytoplasmic membrane).
The pictures are from Parkinson Lab - University of Utah ( The website address [http://chemotaxis.biology.utah.edu/Parkinson_Lab/projects/ecolichemotaxis/ecolichemotaxis.html])
But the original chemoreceptors of E.coli do not respond to the root exudates, while the McpS of the Pseudomonas putida , McfQ and McfR do (Parales, et al.) . McfQ responds to citrate and fumarate, and McfR detects succinate, malate and fumarate. To compare with the work what 2011_Imperial_College_London had done, we chose McfR which also responds to malate. The mechanisms of prokaryote chemoreceptors are similar, so we designed a plasmid to express chemoreceptor. McfR in the E.coli makes the bacteria have the ability of chemotaxis towards TCA intermediates. As our experimental condition is limited, we just did experiments on chemotaxis towards succinate and malate. What’s more, in an attractant gradient, the chemoreceptors monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move around. And they use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event. And we searched the pattern of their chemotaxis towards a concentration gradient of attractant using capillary assay. The results are demonstrated below.
Results
We did both agar assay and capillary assay to detect the response of E.coli to different attractants and different concentrations of each attractant. Because the agar assay (Fig.3) is difficult to replicate and collect the data from"

Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," linked to municipal            sewage systems. This presented a direct link to our design’s applicability for            Toronto’s wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, the OMAFRA has two major issues            within the food sector. The management of phosphorus due to sanitation cycles and            the capture and removal of biological oxygen demand (BOD), fats, oils and greases            (FOG) and suspended solids (SS). Our project would respectively focus on the removal            of BOD and SS. To authenticate these applications, we met with Ping Wu, the past            president at Professional Engineers Government of Ontario (PEGO). We discovered the            OMAFRA had problems with BOD. As water efficiency improves in homes, due to low            flush toilets, the residential BOD increases. Increased BOD results in more hydraulic            capacity use in wastewater treatment plants. In Germany and the Netherlands in the mid-90’s regulatory response to increasing            residential loadings was to cut manufacturing off of sewer services. In some            communities, it meant that the entire cost of wastewater treatment was then borne            by residential users. In Ontario, this has happened when large food processors in            small communities lose their food processors – such as the closure of Nabisco in            Exeter and Libby’s in Wallaceburg.
Conclusion
We created opportunities for feedback from the public to integrate and influence            the direction of our design. These included the SynBio Forum, our SynTalks podcast,            and our public survey. The SynBio Forum [CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS] engaged the            minds of the public on the topic of synthetic biology and its environmental, legal,            social and ethical implications. Audience members were asked to complete a short            survey which illustrated their preconceived notions of synthetic biology and their            opinion on our project. After the panel, audience members were asked to conduct a            post-panel survey to measure the efficacy of the information conveyed during the            panel. Our SynTalks podcast [CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS] presented the opportunity for            us to gain insight from professionals from various fields associated with synthetic            biology and our project. We interviewed policy experts from the Department of            Environment and Climate Change Canada on the legal and ethical issues that revolve            around our project and synthetic biology. Furthermore, we produced episodes which            interviewed experts from the medical, agricultural, and environmental field which            aimed to disclose the facts and educated opinions of synthetic biology and            genetically engineered microorganisms. As a result of these interviews, we            integrated the knowledge acquired from these experts and policymakers to establish            how our design would be effective, safe, ethical, and beneficial"

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#XY Plane_-_-_TEXT.html," however, that the timing belts were difficult to maintain the correct amount of tension without a proper tensioner, which would not be possible to integrate to our system. Also, it would be difficult to standardize if the user were to cut their own timing belts according to how well they put together their XY-plane.
When designing the XY-plane, we decided that we would like the default, starting position of the plate holder to be in the bottom right of the plane. During the first iteration, we brought the holder to position by traveling the span of the plane fully every time, which caused it to jam into the sides and also stall the motors. From there, we realized that we needed a method for the plane to communicate to the Arduinos in order to stop the motors when it has reached the correct position.
Below are clips of a Creo assembly demonstrating how the XY-plane should be and the first physical iteration of the XY-plane.
Design 2
For the final design of the XY-plane, our team decided to 3D-print all of our supports in order to increase accessibility and decrease to cost of the hardware components of TERRA. All parts were printed using the UPrint SE with ivory ABS stock material. Previously, the holes of the 3D-printed parts were too small, mostly due to the relative inaccuracy of this fabrication method, so the new iteration of the supports include clearance holes rather than tight fit holes.
We also chose to choose standard, close-loop timing belts in order to minimize the problems we were encountering with ensuring the tension in the timing belts were correct and that the belt would not slip over the pulleys. Using closed timing belts also eliminates the problems with gluing together ends of the timing belt.
In order to send our plate holder to the correct position, or its ""home"", we needed a technical and reliable solution. Our team decided to integrate contact switches to the plane, allowing us to consistently and accurately home our system every time we run a new protocol, ensuring that the output from the microfluidic device dispenses to the correct wells of a microtiter plate. This also allows us to further remove human error from our system. This was done by creating negative features on some of the 3D-printed supports to hold the sensors in place.
The CAD and STL files are available on our GitHub in order to allow users to easily recreate our system."

She was invited by our team to participate in the conference. Her thesis subject concerns the apprehension of the notion of scientific uncertainty by the French and European law.
- Pierre Crozet : Professor at Sorbonne University and one of the supervisors of our team, he is specialized on Plant biology, more particularly he works on understanding the molecular mechanisms allowing plants to adapt themselves in stress conditions. Since 2016, he is using synthetic biology tools to improve the fixation of the carbon in Chlamydomonas which will permit to improve the use of these micro-algae in studying the cycle of Calvin-Benson.
The conference took place at Sorbonne University, Wednesday the 26th of September and around sixty professors and students were attending it. During the first part of the conference, speakers shared perspectives about synthetic biology and its impact in our future. Unfortunately, Bordeaux team could not be present in conference. Therefore, the event was broadcasted on our Facebook page and both Bordeaux and Saclay teams shared the link. This has allowed the diffusion of the conference in Bordeaux, Strasbourg and in others French cities. More than 1,700 people viewed the broadcast throughout France. At the end of the conference, we gave the opportunity for the audience to ask questions about the intervention.
Afterwards, the audience and the speakers continued their discussions around a buffet that we organized with the help of iGEM Saclay and Bordeaux teams.   It was a wonderful experience that pleased the professors as well as the students. We have been asked whether another conference will soon take place. Thus, we think of proposing the future teams of Sorbonne U Paris, Bordeaux and Saclay to organize a conference on another subject related to synthetic biology.
Practical Sessions in ""Maurice Genevoix"" High school
Education holds a pivotal position in science. After some events with the large audience, we noticed that there is a negative vision on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in France. Furthermore, the synthetic biology is a recent science little known by the people. High school students in France have no concrete idea of the genetics and the molecular biology. That is why we decided to intervene, with the help of iGEM Montpellier team, in a 6th grade scientific section class at the High school Maurice Genevoix at Montrouge. It was very important for us to explain synthetic biology in a didactic way with a practical exercise.

Tec-Monterrey,2015,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,", from this the production rate should have a positive value only in [tI+ΤIV,tI+ΤD] and be zero everywhere else, from this we know we are looking for a production rate of the form:
(12)
where ψ(t)>=0. If $\Phi$ is the average virus production per infected cell we expect that:
(13)
The shape of the curve ψV is given by the mechanism of production. To obtain this shape by experimental ways may be too difficult to accomplish in this project but instead we proposed different shapes, based on the knowledge of the promoters used.
This function is expected to increase as the virus production begins until it reaches a maximum of production and later, it would decrease as the metabolic functions in the cell decline. The skewness of the function will depend whether if an early promoter is used or a late promoter.
From the previous assumptions the consider a displaced normalized Bessel Function of the first kind from 0 until its first root. The Bessel function can be defined as:
(14)
Here, Γ(t) represents the gamma function, defined by:
(15)
For the normalization we consider the first value jv>0 where jv(x) is zero. We scale the interval [0,jv] unto [τIV,τD]
We define the normalization factor αVv as the value of the following integral:
(16)
With this definition it can be observed that the function ψ(t)=(ΦV/αVv)JV(tjv/(τV-τIV)) satisfies the desired condition. Moreover, the parameter v can be used to modify the skewness of the function, having a positive skewness when 0< v< 1 and a negative skewness if 1 < n.
From this argument it follows that in a certain instant $t_I$, the virus production is increased by a certain amount f(t-tI)C'I(tI)dtI, where:
(17)
But we have to consider the contributions made in all the previous moments until a given point in time to know the total virus production. Considering the infection instants as a continuum, we can rewrite the equation (9) as:
(18)
Protein Expresssion
For the protein expression we can obtain a similar equation through an analogous argument. Clearly the average protein production per infected cell will differ from the one of the virus; also the protein may take a different time to begin its production, therefore we consider a different time lapse $\tau_{IP}$ between the infection and the production. Beside this, we consider"
UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a NanoDrop. To fuse the two genes a fusion PCR was carried out. The purified gene products was used in a PCR along side with a prepared MasterMix containing GC buffer, see protocol section for the exact composition of the MasterMix. The PCR program for fusing and amplifying the gene construct was a follows 95°C for 3’, 95°C for 45’, 60°C for 35’, 72°C for 3’ and 72°C for 10’. After amplification the PCR product was loaded on a gel for electrophoresis. The conditions for the electrophoresis was 1 hour at 115 volt, and the obtained band was purified using Gel Extraction Purification kit from QIAGEN.
Result: As for LPE and GFP, both PCT and YFP were amplified by PCR using primers that would incorporate the right overhangs. For PCT the overhangs was the 3’ end of GFP on the 5’ end of PCT, the 5’ end of YFP on the 3’ end of PCT. The final PCR product can be seen in Figure 20.
The PCR product was clearly seen at the expected sizes, meaning that the PCR was a success and it was possible to amplify both of the genes. PCR purification was carried out, and the purified products was used to make a fusion PCR to fuse PCT and YFP. Also here, the PCR protocol had to be updated to obtain a band at the correct size. The first few times, the fusion PCR did not work (Fig. 21A), so the protocol was improved in regard to annealing temperature and elongation time.
With the updated protocol it was able to fuse the two genes (Fig. 21B). This can be seen as a rather strong band at the expected size of 2.6 kb when the PCR product was loaded on a 1% agarose gel. AS it also can be noted a lot of unspecific binding was present, forcing us to made gel purification instead of the more efficiently PCR purification. This can be avoided by improve the PCR protocol further. In conclusion the data strongly indicates that the two genes indeed can be fused together as expected. However, to get a more pure final product, the PCR protocol needs to be improved to avoid all the unspecific binding that can be seen in Figure 21B. Another way to improve the outcome of the PCR is to design new primers to make them more specific to the gene.

Project
Many different ideas were discussed during the startup of our iGEM project. We finally decided to focus on the skin disorder Vitiligo. We have discussed our project idea with two leading Vitiligo researchers in Sweden (Mats J. Olsson & Håkan Hedstrand, Uppsala University), both who have shown interest and encouraged us to go ahead with the project. We have also been given a grant from the Swedish Vitiligo Association .
Vitiligo - in short
Vitiligo is a skin disorder causing affected parts of the skin to turn white. This is due to abnormal melanocyte function, resulting from the immune system mistakenly targeting the pigment cells, making Vitiligo an autoimmune disease. Vitiligo usually begins before the age of 20 and is estimated to affect 0.5-2 % of the world population. It is a very complex disorder and there is a lack of good treatments.
Spot on Treatment
iGEM Stockholm on the Vitiligo project This article is an effort from us in the iGEM Stockholm team to explain our Vitiligo-treatment scientific project in words that anyone can understand, consequently we will keep the scientific explanations on a basic level.
Our primary goal is to merge current scientific knowledge with an innovative new investigative approach known as Synthetic Biology, in order to hopefully help Vitiligo patients achieve faster and more efficient repigmentation of affected skin in the future.
Background
Vitiligo (leukoderma) is a skin disorder in which pigment cells known as melanocytes are destroyed,   resulting in white patches of the skin1. Melanocytes are the cells responsible for creating skin color, so when these are destroyed, the normal shade of the skin turns white. Vitiligo is in itself not dangerous and does not lead to any severe health problems, but patients’ life quality may be seriously altered by the cosmetic appearance that is a result of the white spots from Vitiligo. Between 1-2 percent of the world population are estimated to be affected by Vitiligo, with varying levels of severity. The disorder is characterized by patches occurring on the skin in various parts of the body,"

- Divide the plates into 6 quadrants with a sharpie. Label the quadrants 7.15, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -8.
- Using the mutagenized phage stock from step 1 above, create a 1:100 dilution series of the 6 solutions in step 1 for -2 and -4 in eppendorf tubes. Then make a 1:10 series for -5, -6, -7, and -8.
- Spot 5ul of each eppendorf tube (-4 through -8) onto the plates. Also spot 5ul of 7.15 phage stock on each plate as a control.
V) Results
2) Spot Test to Confirm Phage Viability
From the spot tests, 1 and 3C had a plaque at -4 (The plaque on -4 for 16 was incorrect, as we accidently added -2 to that spot). All plates have plaques for the 7.15 control.
VI) Conclusion
It appears as though incubating the phage with mutagen for 1 hour is better than 3 hours and 16 hours; however, we cannot hold this to be terribly accurate because the control for 1 hour showed no plaques at -4, suggesting that there might be something wrong with the experiment.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Off targeting_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 mln basepairs (bp)), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8 mln bp), Staphylococcus epidermis (2.5 mln bp) and chromosome 27 of the domestic cow (Bos taurus, 45 mln bp). E. coli BL21 is a commonly used lab strain, which was the strain containing the tetracyclin resistance-conferring (TcR) plasmid that we designed the crRNA for. S. aureus and S. epidermis are common pathogens in mastitis , while genetic material from the cow itself may also be present when detecting sequences in cow samples, for example milk. Scanning the entire genome allows to investigate if tiny local off-target effects together influence the reliability of the output signal.
In Figure 6, we present $P_{FP}$ for our crRNA sequences for the different genomes/chromosome. In general, we find off-target cleavage probabilities below 1 in 100.000 for the bacterial genomes. As expected, the $P_{FP}$ is generally larger for the Bos taurus chromosome 27, which is approximately tenfold larger than the bacterial genomes, but reaches a maximum of 1 in 1000. As such, we conclude that the probability of a false output is low and likely does not compromise the usability of the Cas13a-mediated detection system.
In Figure 6: Off-target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. $P_{FP}$ for different crRNAs and genomes of four organisms ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). There seems to be no relation between genome size and per base false positive output probability, as the Bos taurus chr. 27 scores for the different crRNAs are not systematically highest. Interestingly, the off-target activity per base pair tends to be highest for E. coli, the organism containing the plasmid for which the crRNAs were designed. Despite the size of the genomes, ranging from 2.5 to 45 million basepairs, even the cumulative off-target effects do not result in high false positives output.
The simulations so far indicate the detection system to be reliable, i.e. have a low probability of yielding a false-positive output. However, insufficient data are available to accurately determine the model fit parameters. In addition, experimental validation is lacking. As such, it is possible that experimental work proves Cas13a to have increased off-target activity. We investigated what the effect of this"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteriocins have no effect on human cells in low                             concentrations, less is known about higher concentrations. Besides lysostaphin, our E. coli will produce pyocin, a                             bacteriocin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pyocin has been shown to be effective against P. aeruginosa lung                             infections in mice, with its required dose 100-fold lower than the commonly used antibiotic tobramycin (12) . It                             still needs to be determined whether it is safe in humans, but there is no indication it will be.
The hydrogel that we use is biocompatible and has been used in humans before. However, GMA that is necessary for                             the synthesis is highly toxic and carcinogenic.  Dialyzing the methacrylated dextran product for one week ensures                             complete removal of GMA. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to verify that during storage in                             demineralized water, no dextran or other starting products leak from the hydrogel . Therefore we know it is safe to                             use for an application on the skin. The trace amounts of organic material that do leak out could not be assigned to                             any known reagents or (by)products but it was collected from the 50 mL of storage water. This means that the presence                             of organic materials in the storage water can be neglected as their concentration is extremely low.
The strains of E. coli (BL21(DE3) and BLR) that we use do not present a direct threat to human health, plants or                             microorganisms, since it is an biological agent of category 1 (13–15). This means that it is very unlikely that they                             are harmful to humans. Besides the bacteriocins that are secreted, E. coli has been modified to express a number of                             different proteins. As mentioned above, these proteins are harmless.
In conclusion, to make our gel user friendly and safe, we used a hydrogel that is not hazardous and is safe when in                             contact with living organisms. Our E. coli strain is harmless. However, it must still be confirmed that the used                             bacteriocins are safe to humans. To this date there is no indication that it the bacteriocins would be any more                             hazardous than conventional antibiotics.

Furthermore, in our first Skype meeting with iGEM Team Concordia, we also talked about the ethics of our project. We addressed questions like: For what reason do we not care about manipulating our microorganisms to die for us? Is it because of size differences? Is it because there are vastly more single-cell organisms than humans? Because single celled organisms do not have nerve cells meaning they can’t feel death? Is the alternative just too problematic that the ends justify the means?   The ethical discussion was exciting and we all got new inputs concerning ethics related to our projects.

Killling Ability Test
I. Background
      The ideal killing ability of the warriors includes the two following characters. First, the killing ability of the warriors from the two sides must be roughly equal. Second, the killing ability of the warriors must be adequate——neither too strong nor too weak.
II.Experimental design
    To test if the killing ability of the warriors from two sides are the same, we let equal amount of the two kinds of warriors to grow together. We attach different fluorescins to different warriors in order to differentiate them. We compare the killing ability of the warriors by monitoring the ratio of the two kinds of the warriors.
    To test if the killing ability is adequate or not, we do a gradient experiment. We let warriors and beggars from different sides to grow together with different starting ratios. The warriors and beggars from different sides are attached to different fluorescins. We monitor the change of the amount of beggars with time to see if the killing ability is ideal or not.
III Methods
1. Construct our warriors and beggars by co-transformation. (the gene circuits are as follows) *if you want to know the details of how we assemble the parts together, see our protocol “DNA construction”
Fig 1 gene circuits of warriors and beggars from both sides
2. Pick bacterial clones from the petri plate, then shake it overnight in the LB medium (3ml) with 50μg/ml Ampicilin and 30μg/ml Kanamycin at 37℃. For each combination, 3 clones are"

We have successfully cloned LacRS+CysP in pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1526008 ) into E.coli DH5α
Characterising CysP:
In order to characterise the sulfate secondary transporter from Bacillus subtilis we have acquired E. coli BW25113 strain mutants from the Keio collection for complementation assays.
We have used CysW (GenoBase code: JW2416) and CysA (GenoBase code: JW2415)  mutants from the Keio collection as they represent deletions of different subunits (respectively, permease and ATPase) of the main sulfate transporter in E. coli (ABC transporter).
We have transformed both the mutants and the wild type with our LacRS+CysP plasmid and grew them on M9 media (1mM of Sulfate and 0.4%w/v of glucose).
We did not have time to make the optical density measurements on  a 96-well plate on the FlouStar Omega plate reader kindly loaned to our team by BMG.
Improving the characterization of pYodA
pYodA (also called ZinTp) is a cadmium sensitive promoter endogenous to E. coli, where it regulates the bacterial response to stress stimuli after exposure to metal ions. As our final construct relies strongly on the sensing of cadmium, we wanted to improve the characterisation of BioBrick BBa_K896008 submitted in 2012 by the NYMU Taiwan team.
We assembled the Green Fluorescence Protein GFP (BBa_E0240) downstream of pYoda in order to assess the strength of the promoter in response to different concentrations of Cadmium chloride (CdCl
2
) and to assess its specificity to this particular metal.
First test: E. coli DH5A viability assay
To characterise pYoda we adjusted the OD600 of an E.coli DH5alpha overnight transformed with pSB3K3 carrying BioBrick to 0.1 in LB broth.
The same procedure was performed for an overnight culture of E. coli DH5 alpha (WT) and to a DH5 alpha transformed with pSB3K3 carrying GFP under the control of the constitutive promoter BBa_I20260 (ConstGFP). These would be our negative and positive controls in fluorescence expression respectively.

Pneumosensor Module Description
Overview
Pneumosensor primarily adopts the quorum sensing pathway components in Streptococcus pneumoniae to detect populations of S. pneumoniae. The main     advantage of this system is its detection specificity- the Gram-positive quorum sensing mechanism is incorporated into the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli to     eliminate possible cross-talk of the autoinducer molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) with native E. coli molecules.
There are two modules to our Pneumosensor- the Detection Module and the S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module. The Detection Module comprises of the CSP     receptor ComD, its response regulator ComE and the promoter PcomCDE which is induced by phosphorylated ComE. The σx Promoters Module involves a     highly specific reporting system, whereby σx is associated with RNA polymerase and binds to promoters PcelA and PcomFA which     are specific to σx for activation. These promoters then drive the expression of GFP as a reporting system. Another protein, ComW, is expressed alongside the     σx as its stabilizer against proteolysis.
Detection Module
S. pneumoniae σx promoters Module
Detection Module Description
Figure 1. Detection Module Diagram
CSP released by S. pneumoniae is detected by its receptor ComD, which autophosphorylates at the expenditure of ATP. ComD~P then phosphorylates         ComE. ComE~P then induces the promoter PcomCDE, which drives the expression of GFP.
Transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, like many other species, depends on specialized state called competence.      Competence is achieved during the exponential growth stage of pneumococcal culture by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP"

Construction of LuxPQ-B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 by inserting B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 (AK) into LuxPQ (in AC)
Purpose: To construct LuxPQ-B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 by inserting B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 (AK) into LuxPQ (in AC). This Restriction digest was set up overnight with the following sets of enzymes: XbaI and PstI (insert) and SpeI/PstI (recipient).
KATIE
Continuing to Progress in the Lab
I had to change the order script within the restriction digest tubes since everything needed to be added backward, which turned out to be a problem with my inventory function, which I now have adding inventory names to a list in the opposite order so that it is now correct. I completed the movement scripts I have been working on within the restriction digest tubes so they will move to the water bath, the heating block and then the insert tube moves to the incubator and I think that maybe I will make it wait there for a while until the avatar goes to get it as well as placing it on a timer so if someone does not go to retrieve it will return to its original position anyway and just not give anything and reset the whole script.
Bacteria colony note cards have been made to give when the texture has been changed on the plates, when they are empty, they are inactive, just needed to determine what permission I will need to set on these note cards so that they cannot be copied to inventory, cannot be modified but are still able to be read although not when contained within an object.
I am changing names within construction sites, but decided to keep some of the ones I was going to change general instead of part information, which will now be within the note cards, which people can look at after it is given. I would really like to add more genes to the biobrick construction activity so then I may ask what biobricked part they would like to perform restriction digest on, which provides more of a variety of genes that could be used (I think we will stick with the same promoter/rbs and terminator since it lessens time spent performing restriction digest on similar parts, but people may create circuits that serve different functions).
I have planned out how to begin the lagging strand simulation, which will have to use detection or collision in order to be successful since it will detect (DNA polymerase"

Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being factored into the design of our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.

On-the-spot investigation
        In order to acquaint the needs of the target users, we visited an electroplating factory and asked the responsible person what problems they would encounter in the practical testing.
        The head of the factory first led us to visit the electroplating process to find out how the polluted water produce. She said “a great number of heavy metals in inorganic form are used in the electroplating and they are usually excessive. So the wastewater contains a lot of heavy metal ions. And wastewater will be treated before discharge and checked the content of heavy metals before and after treatment.”
        Then we introduced our testing paper  method to her for some suggestions.” The accuracy of indicator papers is not high enough for factories. Besides, judging the heavy metal concentration according to the  color depth by workers  is prone to deviation. But cheaper testing method is really appealing to the users.” she said.
Solution:
        We finally used application in phone to scan the sample so that the concentration of the heavy meatal can be presented in digital form and the cost of indicator paper can be saved.
Interview
We then interviewed three professors and got lots of advice to improve our protocol.
Junjiu Huang
        Associate professor, school of life science, Sun Yat-sen University; Nature’s ten people who mattered this year (2015)
        Prof. Huang said, “for better application in actual environment, you should put the modified E. coli not only in the samples only containing heavy metal ions but also in the samples from the actual environment. You can collect and detect the water samples with heavy metal pollution and then compare the results with those of physical or chemical methods.”
Result:
Figure 1. We took the sample in the pool near Jiahewanggang subway station in Guangzhou City, and put some mercury in it to simulate the heavy metal pollution in actual environment. We had strongly proved that our product can be actually used in the reality world.

Then we put the two protein into lots of 1.5ml EP tubes,each contain 50ul protein,Quick freezing and keeping under -80℃.
Common operation
All of our experiment can be describe as three processes, the preparation of reaction system, the reaction and the detection. In order to describe easier, some common operations are explained in this part.
1.   The preparation of reaction system
All of our reaction system have a final volume of 100ul, and each system contain one piece of plastic (3*3*0.25mm). The reaction vessel are PCR tubes.
2.   Reaction
We put those PCR tubes which contain the reaction system in a table, the speed is set at 220 rpm, the temperature is set at 50℃.Each reaction system are mixed uniformity before put in table.
3.   The method of detection
As the plastic have a degradation, the turbidity of reaction system would changed which can be monitored at OD600.
Pre-experiment
To find a appropriate condition for our main experiment, we did some Pre-experiments.
1.   Decide the detecting time.
We set three detecting time: 3h, 6h, 18h. In this experiment, the concentration of the two protein are set at 2 mg/ml. The pH of buffer are 7.0.As to each protein, we set three reaction system which have the same condition except the detecting time. To study how the proteins themselves would change as the time change, we also set a control group which have no plastics in the reaction system. All kinds of reaction system can be seen as follow table.

De templates van Paris (PCR, ligitatie, ...) zullen worden overgenomen qua inhoud. Hun gebruik en uitleg over de parameters zal worden verzorgd op de Tools pagina. - Antoine
Concreet houdt dit in dat alle info voor elke PCR reactie/ligatie/digestie die uitgevoerd wordt, in zeer overzichtelijke tabellen in de notebook terecht komt. Zonder dat er voor de user uitgebreide code aan te pas komt. Indien nodig kan er ook een templaat gemaakt worden voor 96-wells platen.
Freezer
Paris 07 heeft ook gebruik gemaakt van een 'virtuele freezer' om de traceerbaarheid van hun werk gedurende de zomer te verhogen. Telkens wanneer een reactie (ligatie/PCR/digestie) succesvol was werd er een corresponderende lijn toegevoegd aan de freezer met een unieke code (Lx/Px/Dx respectievelijk, waarin x een oplopend nummer is). Elk product kan bijgevolg geidentificeerd worden via zijn specifieke code en de datum waarop het bekomen is. Dit systeem is misschien ook zeer handig om het overzicht te bewaren tijdens het project en tussen de verschillende teams.
Dit lijkt me een zeer goed idee, zodat iedereen alles gemakkelijk kan terugvinden (en achteraf ook alles goed kan gearchiveerd, of weggegooid :-) kan worden). Zorgt ook voor een continuïteit tussen de verschillende deelgroepjes. Lijkt me ook goed om te kunnen zien of er nog iets over is van bv. een PCR product, en eventueel een plaats van stockage? -- Sigriddk 13:30, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

Waterloo,2009,Team:Waterloo#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Some people even likened it to genetic engineering disasters or out-of-control pathogens. Once we explained more clearly the potential and goals behind iGEM people felt much more comfortable and engaged. The hands-on displays were very helpful in sharing some foundational information that will help individuals to understand scientific developments in the future. Having demonstrations showed the group that modern science is not something that happens in secret laboratories but can be accessible on different levels to virtually anyone.
Biology Reunion
At this event, on September 26th, our iGEM team had the opportunity to speak with former Waterloo biology students.  We enjoyed being able to show alumni the work that was going on in the biology department.  Individuals were very interested to learn more about what is new in the world of science.  The group had the chance to check out hands on displays about DNA and RFP.
This was an exciting audience to be able to address.  This group has the foundational knowledge necessary to understand developments in modern science but are not always on the cusp of the newest scientific developments.  The alumni were very excited to learn about the developments in science and to see that these developments were happening in their own community!
Student Life 101
On July 25th, 2009 future students accepted to Waterloo visited campus to catch the flavour of what Waterloo has to offer. iGEM was featured along with some of the other engineering student initiatives.  We set up a display with some interactive demonstrations to educate students and their parents about synthetic biology.  This event gave students an overview of our work and information about how to learn more.
Science Communication
Even intricate and effective science tools risk becomming obsolete/unused without a means of disseminating results and information to the greater public.  We feel that in order for synthetic biology to expand from universities and science labs into industry, media, and the mind's eye of the general public, regional networks of synthetic biologists must be strengthened. With increased communication the current efforts of synthetic biologists can be supported with feedback and analysis. Moreover, by strengthening our own regional community we will be able to acquire for ourselves, a clearer picture of the state of synthetic biology and thus be able to better convey that picture to other audiences.  Our goal was to help lay the foundations for the type of community that will be useful and necessary in the forseeable future.

Overview
From the start, our iGEM team wanted to do something to address questions of distributive justice. That is, we wanted our project to advance an idea that could help bring the power of modern biotechnology and synthetic biology to the broadest group of people possible. This is why we chose to work on a paper-based project, especially since paper has already been used and deployed to address biomedical issues in low-resource areas.
Working with paper has many advantages, including low cost, ease of transport, and chemical stability. However, designing a solution with paper meant first understanding the root of the problem. Here we chose to focus on Mozambique because we had connections to experts with deep experience in the structure of the healthcare system and clinical experience in clinics around the country and region. We spoke to Ruth Bechtel, Mozambique Country Director of Village Reach, an organization that works to improve health systems capacity and efficiency through improvements in supply chain logistics, about the structure and function of the Mozambican healthcare system. We also spoke to Kebba Jobarteh, a clinician and healthcare entrepreneur with decades experience in southern African health systems, about healthcare structure, as well as his experience working in clinics in Malawi and Mozambique. Given the dearth of data concerning healthcare questions in Mozambique, we relied heavily on the experiences and descriptions of the experts with whom we spoke for information on these issues.
Below is an account of what we learned from our research and conversations, how that learning influenced our design ideas on how to address these issues, and how we contributed to growing connections between researchers in the lab and experts in the field.
Logistics in Mozambique
When it comes to healthcare systems in Mozambique, “most issues are logistical, or stem from a lack of knowledge,” says Ruth Bechtel. To better address the question of how a paper-based system could alleviate some of the issues, we first sought to understand the structure of the Mozambican healthcare system.
The logistical system for import and distribution of biologics in Mozambique consists of three main systems :
“The problems begin at the point of purchase,” says Kebba Jobarteh. The vast majority of pharmaceuticals in the"

Everyone in College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering in Xiamen University knows a seemingly bizarre equation ""S=C3H3"" which was put forward by Prof. Jiaxi Lu. The equation means a scientist(S) needs three qualities: Clear Head, Clever Hand and Clean Habit. All of us keep this equation in mind.
Safety Management
All members have taken the laboratory safety operation course taught by departments, in which we learned a lot of standards, such as wearing rules, the ban of eating or drinking, proper position of reagents and usage of dangerous chemicals. Before entering the laboratory, we read through the official safety guidelines proposed by the iGEM HQ online and the safety manuals written by university office carefully. Tutors and senior students carried out safety education especially clarifying the location and usage of fire-fighting equipment. Safe use of fire, electric heaters, microwave oven and the UV lamp was emphasized. There are also laboratory assistants supervising the safety of the laboratory. Any insecure behaviours will be warned or criticised.
Safe Project Design
Firstly, E. coli BL21 and E. coli DH5α were the only chassis when we performed the molecular cloning and expression. Halomonas sp. JC-5B which is a marine bacterium was used for DNA extraction and all the plasmids are harmless for humans. In terms of parts, none of our parts would raise any safety issue according to the current expertise. What is more, the engineering bacteria have a suicide system. The expression of the lysis protein leads to the death of the engineering bacteria, which prevents damage to the environment and the creatures. In addition, M13 bateriaphage used in the siRNA delivery system infecting E.coli only and is temperate phage. Phage experiments were performed in a special room and a biosafety cabinet. Last but not least, all experiments were performed in vitro.
Safe Lab Work
Laboratory coat and gloves are necessary when entering the laboratory. All culture fluid and culture medium with bacteria were processed"

Module 1: Protein Production Overview
Enzyme Delivery
To carry out their functions, enzymes must maintain their precise three dimensional conformations. Many enzymes denature in the acidic conditions of the stomach rendering them inactive. Even enzymes that survive stomach acid must face an assalt from stomach proteases. For these two reasons, enzymes are well suited for encapsulation. The E.ncapsulator has been showcased with two important enzymes: phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and cellulase.
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH)
PAH converts one amino acid (phenylalanine) into another (tyrosine). PAH is normally found in the liver, however individuals lacking this important enzyme suffer from the genetic disorder Phenylketonuria (PKU). Individuals with PKU must limit their consumption of phenylalanine otherwise its accumulation can result in problems with brain development, leading to progressive mental retardation, brain damage and seizures.
PKU is currently tested for by genetic screening newborn babies. There is no cure for this disease, and current treatments revolve around following a strict low protein diet.
Since PAH is usually found in the liver, it unsurprisingly lacks any natural resistance to proteases found in the intestine. In order to overcome this problem we introduced a mutation into the structure of PAH to increase its resistance to proteolytic degradation. The delivery of PAH by The Encapsulator is particularly relevant on two accounts. Firstly, it represents a landmark in metabolic subcontraction and secondly, it offers a treatment for a genetic disease.
  About PAH and how we modified it as well as more about the condition phenylketonuria.
Cellulase
Ruminants survive on a diet high plant matter through the breakdown of cellulose and xylan by their gut microflora. Non-ruminants, such as humans, are unable to release much of the energy found in these compounds, and so must rely on an omnivorous diet.
Of course, the transfer of energy between trophic levels is notoriously poor. If non-ruminants were able"

Hello everyone, Here is the team of WHU-China!  Team WHU-China 2014 was born at the foot of the mount LuoJia, November 2013. The team is mainly formed by sophomore and junior of the college of life sciences, Wuhan University. Our team has a great tradition and this year is the third time to join in the competition. In our warm small group, both sophomore and junior work together. We hope that we can learn more knowledge of synthetic biology and get access to more experimental skills by ourselves during the competition. What is more important is that we can make a contribution to the society. Let us join hands to swim in the vast ocean of synthetic biology and find treasures one by one!
Haoyuan Sun, as the captain of the team, is devoted himself into the completion. From the establishment of the project, to undertake the whole experiment guideline, he is just like a glaring star in the night to guide us where to go ahead. In the iGEM team, he not only uses his knowledge to solve the problems, but also encourages us by his humor to get through the difficulties. Besides the iGEM, he is skilled in playing ball games and telling jokes.
Hi, I am Zheng Sun, In the team of iGEM, everyone can find his/her own place, and iGEM has different meanings to different people. As for me, iGEM provides me with a great chance to explore the field of synthetic biology and the way to go into the society to touch different people and handle series of things I have never met before. Thanks iGEM for giving me such a chance and I believe this wonderful experience can leave me the beautiful memory and treasure in my life.
Here is Yun Xue, this is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because I'm fond of synthetic biology and I'm skilled in the mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology. And I would like to pursue these interests in future and do research about mathematical modeling of biological systems. I enjoy sport activities such as badminton, tennis and basketball. I am lookng forward to solving problems and getting good achievements.
Qiushuang Wu: the smart girl provided us with the original idea for our project this year in the brainstorming. As the housekeeper in our lab, she kept the lab organized when doing experiments. And she herself did a lot of experiments, involving all"

We worked on the basics in the iGEM concept. We discussed the definitions of biobrick, basis part, composite part and devices. We learned the ""Standard Assembly Method"", it's condition, uses and limitations.
We defined the conditions for our own device and started searching for the necessary parts in the iGEM registry.
Wednesday 18/6
We digested two plasmids, 161 and RFP, each with the enzymes XbaI and EcoRI. Unfortunately it didn’t work as expected, as XbaI did not cut. We made some control experiments to check this and concluded that one of the plasmids might miss the EcoRI restriction site.
The results after running it on a gel shows that somethings wrong with the plasmid, 161, since Xbai doesn't digest it, but digests plasmid, RFP. Since EcoRI digests, we can conclude that there's something wrong with the plasmid's XbaI restriction site.
Several control experiments with the XbaI enzyme was made - another borrowed Xbai enzyme was tested as well. Since the borrowed enzyme worked, the other was tossed out. Conclusion: We're buying a new one!
We recieved lab safety training.

Another difficulty depressed us was the terrible environment. The dustbins emitted a disgusting smell, hand washing basin was surrounded by a swarm of mosquitoes, laboratory tables were scratched out and rag and mop were also nauseating.
Fortunately, the terrible environment of the laboratory does not extinguish the passion of us. Everyday, team members came, did experiments and discussed their success or failures in experiments. On everyone’s face, there was big smile. Carefully and energetic, we progressively conduct our experiments and researches. And finally, our dream comes true.

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity of tumors in mice after treatment of PBS or KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes (exosome). The intensity of tumor fluorescence in mice treated with KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes showed dramatically decrease compared with the group treated with PBS. (****: p < 0.0001)
2.2 Mice were divided to receive different treatment, testing the function of iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA
Mice were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n=20 per group) and treated differently. One group received PBS injections, the other group is treated with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA via tail-vein injections. The administrations were given five times for 2 successive weeks since contamination of HEK293 cells resulted in exosomes shortage and the treatment of mice were delayed.
2.3 The measurement of tissues harvested indicates the function of KRAS siRNA on the tumor treatment
Subsequently, mice were sacrificed for tumor harvest after in vivo imaging. All the tumors were measured for length, volumes and weight. Small pieces from every tumor was cut independently and fixed by paraformaldehyde to prepare for histopathological examination.
Figure 10. Quantitative analysis of tumor weight measurement for mice treated with PBS or KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes (exosome).
2.4 Pathological section to observe tumor cells
After measurement of tumors, HE staining was conducted to verify the function of iRGD-exosomal siRNA. HE staining enabled better visualization of tissue structure and cell morphology, which can be used for morphological observation of normal and diseased tissue. The detection result showed that tumor cell necrosis rate in experimental group was much higher than control group. In other words, iRGD exosomes KRAS siRNA can effectively induce tumor cell necrosis and suppress cell proliferation
Figure 11. Pathological section of tumor tissues from model mice treated with PBS or iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA (exosome).
2.5 iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA reduce the KRAS expression in tumor cells in vivo
Then, total protein and RNA were extracted from the rest tumor tissues to evaluate the expression level of KRAS in vivo. Results showed both KRAS protein and mRNA level were reduced in tumor cells of mice injected with KRAS-siRNA-iRGD-exosomes compared with mice treated with PBS. Though the down-regulation is not that evident, it still demonstrated that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can efficiently be delivered into tumor cells and regulate target gene expression, taking"

The only thing that needs to be considered is whether abnormally high concentrations of the peptide risk the development of microbial resistance against it. In that case, the body would lose its natural mechanism of defense against acne among other pathogens. One article [1] hypothesizes, however, that it may be much less likely that resistance develops against this peptide, as the peptide is evolutionarily very recent and resistance would require big changes in the constitution of the bacterial cell wall or membrane. Compared to antibiotics, which are used to combat far more dangerous diseases, resistance against our peptide does not pose a huge public health risk.
We didn't want to use any synthetic and oil based materials like micro plastic exfoliation beads that are commonly used in skin care products currently on the market. Since cellulose is abundant in Finland, and less and less paper is used throughout the world, our product is one good use for the wood. Thinning of the forest is a good way to acquire wood without disturbing the growth of the forest. Cellulose is a safe foundation for a product and it does not pose a threat to humans or the environment.
In package design, we had several potential material candidates like biodegradable wood based plastic PLA, paper and wood. We decided to go with a wooden package because we had a somewhat humorous idea of wood based product packaged inside a wooden package. With a wooden package we also represented Finnish nature, which was an inspiration in whole design process. The package is made out of curly birch wood, which has a naturally beautiful structure and outlook. Our product name was laser engraved on top of the package and ingredient information can be engraved on bottom of the package. In actual production process, a wooden package will most probably prove too expensive. For now, however, we wanted to focus on a showpiece; an idea of a beautiful package that can be used after the product has run out. With a wooden package we will also get more attention. In the future, the package could be a PLA tube or a coated paper tube which is easy to recycle or burn.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"40Å long outer membrane barrel [the channel domain] that anchors a 100Å long helical barrel that projects across the periplasmic space [1]. In review, the trimer forms a single beta barrel for the passing of proteins. Each monomer gives four antiparallel beta strands and four antiparallel alpha helical strands. This forms the channel and tunnel domains, respectively [1]. There are also small loops present on the sides of TolC that allow for phage binding or colicin attachment. It is thought that the tunnel assembly is supported by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.
TolC is interesting because unlike other efflux pumps, TolC bypasses the periplasm. To bypass the periplasm, instead of using a multiprotein assembly to span the membrane, TolC only requires the outer membrane protein. This protein interacts with the inner membrane translocases traffic ATPase and an adaptor protein. There is not just one TolC and interacting translocase, but one cell may have more than one TolC homolog with multiple compatible translocases. This contributes to antibiotic resistance: multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has four major efflux systems.
Function
TolC is known as an efflux pump; it provides an exit for large proteins. TolC is used for protein export for proteins such as “heat-stable enterotoxin, cationic antimicrobial peptides, and microcins” [1]. For interest of our project it also effluxes antibiotics, contributing to antibiotic resistance. The protein is exported through translocase, such as AcrAB, then through the TolC periplasmic entrance [1].
In Antibiotic Efflux
TolC’s role in antibiotic efflux is what interests us as a target for fighting multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Koronakas expressed interest in finding a way to block the TolC pump. Our iGEM team aimed at finding bacteriophage that use this pump to bind and kill the bacterium.

After protein functions were confirmed, we further tested the microtubule aggregation level by                     treating serial concentration of taxol samples. Since the excess amount of substrate proteins                     (α-tubulin-YNE, α-tubulin-YCE and β-tubulin) were treated. The aggregation level could be represented by the fluorescence intensity. The experimental results (Fig.15 Table 1) showed that                     there is an obvious positive correlation between taxol concentration and fluorescence intensity when                     the substrate proteins are abundant.

ArtCenter_MDP,2014,Team:ArtCenter MDP#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," became a serious problem. As a West Nile outbreak sizzled in the region, we had to find tools that could address the problem without hurting algae growth. We ended up using bug bombs to attack the larvae, anything more powerful would have negatively influenced growth.
Second, the pools' integration into the urban ecosystem required constant surveillance to watch for animals. In the heat of summer, raccoons, squirrels, cats, and opossums all took interest in the algae pools.
Third, the perception of the surrounding community became more intense and the simulations wore on. Neighbors were often grossed out by the pools, and sensed some sort of danger from the algae growth. To promote knowledge and interaction, we began holding ""pool parties"" and inviting neighbors to take part in communal maintenance.
Fourth, maintenance needs became increasingly labor-intensive. Materials like yeast were needed to jumpstart growth, and pH testing and color observation became daily activities. Environmental changes also needed to be made to create a healthier growth environment, and it was common for us to move pools to sunnier areas.
insights
The process of simulating biofuel production and multiple scales led to valuable insights about sustainable production on a large scale:
First, we learned that wildlife management would be come a pressing matter as scale increased. Control of the environment surrounding the pools was key, and moving forward new methods for addressing wildlife interaction would be needed. Proposed solutions would involve signage and new pool access (or inaccessibility), incorporating design changes with a spatial reimagining.
Second, finding ways to research and disseminate farming techniques to maximize yield would become necessary on a community to community basis.
Third, the economy born out of large-scale production became the largest sphere of change. Beyond how the shift from a gasoline-based to an alternative transit economy would affect the city, the necessity of new technicians began to alter the future community. The pools created a need for an entirely new specialized industry, and the technical expertise would be needed in every pool-inclusive community.

Figure 2: Developing a Toxin Sensing Organism
We performed the transposon screen with the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5: a native tailings pond bacteria shown to degrade oil sands toxins. From this screen strains which responded to general oil sands toxins (sulfur-heterocycles, nitrogen heterocycles, and naphthenic acids) were kept for further analysis. We characterized these strains and selected from the original responders, strains that reacted to oil sands toxins but not general hydrocarbon compounds and stress agents (Figure 3).
Figure 3: FREDsense strain detects toxins. Characterization of one of the transposon strains responsiveness to petroleum toxins using an X-Gal blue-white screening assay.  Cells were inoculated in duplicate at different dilutions into LB media as a control, and LB containing different toxin compounds at environmental concentrations. Absorbance was read at 615nm (maximal absorbance of X-gal) every hour.
This response consists of production of a reporter enzyme capable of cleaving a substrate which could then give an electrochemical response. Further testing on one strain using tailings pond samples showed a higher than baseline response, and the organism was capable of survival in the toxic substrate (Figure 4).
Figure 4: FREDsense strain detects toxins in environmental tailing pond sample. Current change over time was monitored in a tailings pond water sample, illustrating lacZ induction by our identified transposon sensory element. Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) was used as a base-line negative control.
Electrochemical Enzymatic Reporting System:
The reporter proteins utilized by FREDsense are part of a class of enzymes known as hydrolases. Characteristic of these enzymes is recognition and cleavage of their target structure from another compound that it is bound to. An example of this is the protein β-galactosidase (encoded by the gene lacZ).  Hydrolases recognizes and cleaves sugars bound to other compounds and has traditionally been used for colorimetric reactions in biological science study. For our purposes we are using sugar bound to electroactive compounds or analytes CPRG, PNPG, and PDPG. Freeing this into CPR, PNP, or PDP respectively, unmasks its charge, permitting electrochemical detection of it in solution by cyclic voltammetry.
Also characteristic of many hydrolases is the specific recognition of their substrates. A cell can produce more than one hydrolase by independent stimuli and those"

Underlined bases represent BsmBI recognition sites. Bolt bases indicate fusion sites for LVL1 assembly. Bold and underlined bases show BsaI recognition sites. N bases written in bold and italic show fusion sites for lvl1 assembly and have to be custom-designed.
Additional bases between parts
The fusion sites of most golden-gate-based cloning methods create a four base pair scar that is referred to as the fusion site. The fusion sites are the feature that makes toolboxes compatible with each other. Between some parts, additional bases are required for different reasons. These bases were chosen carefully to achieve best performance of the respective part. Please note that these additional bases are not a strict requirement to use or being compatible with our toolbox but we recommend them for the design of additional parts.
The first additional bases were incorporated between the Promoter and

part. The fusion site is TACT and AGAG was added additionally. The sequence between promoter and

Concluding, the CINDY Seq method is outstanding in rapid and simple detection. However, the key of success depends on the integration and implementation of CINDY Seq. With the current technology available, the product is not yet available for household use and should thus come with a service. The outcomes of our value proposition, market analysis and SWOT analysis show that the method will have high potential to be commercialized and that the IP position is strong due to the pending patent. This is further supported by the interest we have received from the industry.

This promoter is both repressed by glucose and induced by polygalacturonic acid, allowing for full control over the expression of the recombinase.  When the pelA promoter is activated, the recombinase will be expressed and the antibiotic resistances will be spliced out of the genome.
We anticipate that this system is very well fit for fungal genetic engineering and horizontal gene transfer control.  If this system were utilized in a prokaryote with plasmid DNA, then the removal of the antibiotic resistance (and thus the selective pressure) could also remove any useful genetic tool implemented in parallel.  The rationale is that expressing extra genes on plasmid DNA decreases the overall fitness of the organism, so if no selective pressure is used, then the organisms can expel the plasmid [3]. We hypothesize, however, that the lack of selective pressure will not be as big of an issue in fungi, as organism evolution is much slower and integration into the full genome will increase the stability of inserted genes.  Therefore, after the initial selection of successfully transformed organisms, the Cre-Lox system could then be activated, splicing out the antibiotic resistances and leaving only benign genes behind to be expressed, preventing environmental exposure to harmful genes and lowering production costs due to antibiotic use.  Success of this system has already been demonstrated in fungal eukaryotes [2], and it should be effective in basidiomycetes as well.
Kill Switch
Background
As detailed further in the future applications section, Ecovative hopes to one day develop their product into a living, self-healing material.  Their current products are killed and desiccated before distribution, but the implementation of a living, genetically modified product raises many more biosafety concerns.  To address some of these concerns, we’ve developed a kill switch system compatible with Ecovative’s living material ideas and any other fungal genetic engineering applications.  When implemented, the user would be able to both suppress and activate the kill switch, allowing a high level of control over life and death of the fungal cells.
Construction and Implementation
The system involves two stages that work together to degrade the complex fungal cell boundary.  The first stage involves the expression of a lambda bacteriophage holin designed by UC Berkeley in 2008 (part BBa_K112306).  Bacteriophage holin proteins are well documented in their ability to greatly increase cell membrane permeability, leading to lysis [4].  In the case of fungi, the increase in membrane permeability itself would not lead to lysis because the cell wall would remain"

As seen from the results, the difference in mean methylation score between 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines and 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM regular cytidines reads is around 40%. This change in methylation score (reference nucleotide count) proves the fundamental step of catalytic activity information recovery from the DNA. By identifying the mean methylation profile it’s possible to assign the ratio of reference (in this case 5mC) and product nucleotide incorporated into the DNA. This ratio corresponds to the starting concentrations of nucleotides present in the DNA amplification step. The starting nucleotide concentration ratio (5mC to catalytically converted nucleotide) depends on the catalytic activity of the analyzed enzyme. More active enzymes catalyse the conversion of larger amount of nucleotides. Thus, by determining the methylation score of the sequenced DNA is possible to extract the catalytic activity data of the enzyme which created the corresponding ratio of the 5mC to product nucleotides. These findings conclude, that Nanopore sequencing and present base calling algorithms are delicate enough to differentiate and assign mean methylation scores to sequencing reads which correspond to different starting nucleotide concentration ratios.
7. CAT-Seq determined activities
The final step in the journey of Catalytic activity sequencing workflow is to sequence the control libraries (esterase mutants, toehold orthogonality and RBS parts) and compare the data to results measured in bulk experiments. The correlation of the results would prove that catalytic activity of a biomolecule indeed CAN be incorporated into DNA as a ratio of nucleotides and that it CAN be extracted from it using Nanopore next generation sequencing.
Recording the sequence-activity information
The constructed in silico designed mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was prepared and sequenced with Nanopore. By applying the same data preparation and analysis pipeline discussed above, the mean methylation scores arising from reference nucleotides for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized to Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and K227R mutant (lowest activity).

He said that we would likely need to find a way of reducing the oxygen in the activated sludge as part of a cycle to promote the N. multiformis to do denitrification. He also said that knocking out the gene that converts nitrite to nitrate might work in forcing the pathway through to completion but we really don’t know until we try. He also said that having a constitutive promoter on the plasmid with all of the necessary genes might also do the trick; if the proteins are being made irrespective to the bacteria’s demands then the bacteria might just go ahead and use them to get more energy. I also ran my ideas for assaying the denitrification plasmid in E. coli and later in N. multiformis; he thought the Durham test would be a good test and also suggested we test the nitrate level of the broth before and after. Doing both will allow us to confirm if nitrate is being used up and if nitrogen gas is being produced as we designed. He also informed me that E. coli naturally denitrifies in anaerobic conditions when nitrate is present, so for testing our plasmid out in E. coli we will need to use a strain that is knocked out for denitrification genes.

Furthermore, it is able to predict the probable cleavage site of the signal peptide after its translocation into the ER. For all constructs, signal peptide functionality is predicted, as well as a potential cleavage site. The complete translated amino acid sequences of the respective receptor constructs were used as input. The algorithm for eukaryotes with default D-cutoff value was chosen.

B) Identification of signal peptide functionality and cleavage site within the receptor construct containing the EGFR, Igκ and BM40 signal peptide via the SignalP 4.1 server. Plotted probabilities represent the raw cleavage site “C-score”, the signal peptide “S-score” and the combined cleavage site “Y-score”. C) ClustalW multiple  sequence alignment of the BM40, EGFR and Igκ signal peptide construct, depicting a gap for the EGFR-signal peptide construct compared to the newly designed ones, indicating smaller length of the 5'-UTR . For the Igκ and BM40 signal peptide constructs, a T7 promoter spacer as well as a Kozak sequence increase the distance between TATA-box and protein-coding region.
For all three signal peptides, the high S-score indicates high signal peptide functionality. For the Igκ signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 20 and 21 within the signal peptide is predicted. For the BM40 signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 17 and 18 is predicted, and for the EGFR signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 24 and 25 is predicted.
Quantification of signal-peptide mediated translocation via a secretion luciferase assay
For the quantification of signal peptide functionality via a luciferase assay, three constructs were created and tested - each containing one of three signal peptides (the EGFR signal peptide, the Igκ signal peptide or the BM40 signal peptide) and a nanoluciferase as well as a CMV promoter, a Strep-tag II for immunochemical detection and the hGH polyadenylation signal sequence. Not containing a transmembrane domain, the nanoluciferase fusion protein is being translocated into the ER and then secreted into the medium. Using a luciferase assay, one can quantifiy the amount of luminescence - and thus, proportionally, the amount of secreted luciferase - by measuring the conversion"
