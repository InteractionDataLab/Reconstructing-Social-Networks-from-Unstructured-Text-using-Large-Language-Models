Digestion
R2 (red writing: MiniPrep iGEM R2 31.5.11) was digested with X,P and T7prom (black writing: 17.6.11 T7) with S,P. After heat-inactivation, GLP was added to the digested DNA. The samples were applied onto a 1 % Agarose gel. The samples, along with those from the PCR (see below), were applied as follows: 2lod DNA ladder (5 ul); R2 (20 ul); R2 (20 ul); T7prom (20 ul); T7 prom (20 ul); PCR cut; positive control; PCR approach 1; PCR approach 1; PCR approach 2; PCR approach 2; PCR approaches 1 and 2 pooled. The gel was run for 1:30 h at 110 V. The following bands were expected:  3.1 kbp for lacZ with rbs and 2 kbp for vector pSB1A2. 3.4 kbp for T7prom in pSB1AK8. The bands are excised from the gel and the DNA is recovered using freeze 'n squeeze.
The original file before cutting of the bands seems to be corrupt.
Ligation
In the next step, K238013 (from 23-08-2011; cut with S,P) was ligated with rbs&lacZ (=R2; X,P), rbs (from 22-08-2011; S,P) with T7pol (from 23-08-2011; X,P) and T7prom (S,P) with rbs&lacZ (X,P). Each time, ligation was performed as normal and as quick-ligation. After that, the transformed cells were plated onto LB (Amp) plates and incubated over night.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," brightness information. We can use the relative position to pick 10 pixel in each line, and calculate the mean value of each line’s brightness. We assume that there is a linear relationship between the brightness of the system and the amount of GFP in the system. Now we can get a relative stoichiometric relation of three mi-RNA. We use the function mentioned above to sum the data proportionately. We set B2P(Brightness to Possibility) as the symbol of this value.
Finally we use this data to calculate the possibility of having cancer.(Of course we have to get the threshold of B2P value. But that can be easily calculated through a machine learning or a basic statistical method if we can get enough samples.)
Outlook
Exactly，all of the experiments we have done is to improve the channel capacity and reduce the disturbance from the noise at the same time. Anyway our final target is to make sure that we can transfer more information when the environment is noisy. Our team focuses on comparing performance between two ways to get fluorescent protein (EBFP), namely, to express the protein directly from the gene, or to independently express two proteins and let them assembly afterwards to become the same protein as the one in the first way. Beside analyzing the experimental data by calculating channel capacity of two systems we wanted to know if there are any difference between two circuits in amplifying the inputs or responding to the noise. And we also want to know which frequency of noise makes our circuit worse and which signal-to-noise ratio may have a higher channel capacity?
So we have these simulations first and we will conduct more experiments to collect data and confirm our conclusion.

HUMAN PRACTICE
We try to ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine our projects in a social context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of our technologies.
Synthetic Biology

Daily Life
Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook#iGEM42_-_-_TEXT.html,", but with no option to see which teams contrbuted to each portion of the graphs. Thus a table output was implemented, that shows the teams' names, years and wiki links. To allow for better overview, one can select how many tams should be display (none, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 or all) and in which order. This can be done either by the score, displaying the best teams at the top of the list, by year starting with most recent teams, or alphabetically. The data-frame displayed always represents the fully filtered data. Thus the user can narrow the number of teams down using the filters and can then go directly to the corresponding wiki pages.
Facts and Figures app
Since the type of data handled in the scatterplot and the timeline app is very similar, the two apps were put together into one app changing it's appearance depending on the chosen x-axis scale. For this a conditional panel was used to either display selection for the scatterplot y-axis parameters or the one for the timeline-summing parameters.
In order to have a continuous design and to be able to target both plot types to the same div the scatterplot was changed from rPlot to nPlot. This means it is now generated using nvd3 instead of the standard R-methods.
Additionally a selection for the categories was added. The data displayed can now be grouped by either region, track or medal awarded. The grouping per year is no longer needed, since the timeline gives the optimal time-resolution of the data.
Methods app
The goal of the methods app was to quickly lead the user to wikis providing high quality protocols for various methods. For this purpose the methods were clustered and now the interface was implemented. It contains two main drop down menus - one for the method cluster and one for the particular method. The options given in the second drop down menu are determined by the first one via conditional panels. There is only one responsive filter applied to the data, which is similar to that for matching the awards. The only differences are, that exact matches instead of regular expressions are detected in the data set and that no empty rows have to be deleted resulting data set. The result is displayed only through the table containing all teams matching the method, which can again be customized regarding the number and order of teams.
To give an overview over the most popular - or until now the most mentioned - methods a table displaying the top 10 methods was added to be constantly displayed in the application. Unfortunately this list only contains 9 elements using the current list of methods and thus the list has to be"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#FutureScenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," for more      space to make sustainable the living of new generations, without using      the green areas.
Within this fictional scenario, CryptoGErM could offer a potential      solution.
CryptoGErM is a system for the storing and safe-sending of      information. By making use of the first purpose, we could store the      whole current information contained in books, newspapers, articles and      other physical paper-based within bacteria to reduce the      space needed for the storing of such information. Bacteria, such Bacillus subtilis is able to store up to 1.5 GB of      information; furthermore, 1 mm3 of DNA can store up to      109 GB of information. [1]
Just to put an example of this fictional application; it is      estimated that the the information contained by the U.S. Library of      Congress is equivalent to 200 TB, currently it is stored in a physical      space of 186,000 square meter. If this information is stored into DNA,      it would only occupy 0.0002 mm3.
Furthermore, storing int DNA is more eco-friendly, because it does      not require any specific medium to keep it functional, in contrast with      current magnetic and optical storage medium that requires energetic      supply to continue working. Just in 2015, 416.2 terawatt hours of      electricity were used by world’s data centres. This consumption was      “significantly higher than the UK’s total consumption of about 300      terawatt hours.” [2]
Storing information in the DNA of bacteria, will replace the current storing medium (Fictional scenario)
Spores of Bacillus subtilis from 2016 found in the New Groningen
Second fictional scenario
This fictional scenario was created as an extreme case by using the    long-term stability of Bacillus subtilis spores.
One of the advantages of our system is that the spores can survive    for several years even if they are exposed to hard conditions. So far,    studies have shown that spores exhibit incredible longevity in a broad    range of environments on our planet. Actually, there are reports from    research groups that have recovered and revived spores from samples as    old as 105 years. This data shows the capability of our    system to store information for hundreds or thousands of years, even in    a hard-conditions environment.
This application seems promising in a near future, as we found out    after the interview we had at the Groninger Archives; Jan Jaap Hoogstins,    collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, explained"
Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," the purified sand, whilst the perchlorate is being             broken down. We place a water-proof canvas on the area we intend to use for             farming. All the purified sand is place here. This way, we can easily isolate             the pure sand from the perchlorate-contaminated sand. If we water this purified             soil, it cannot drain down into the soil, due to the canvas.
This comprises             the system that we found ideal for making Mars habitable.
Our technique             has a huge advantage when compared to using filters or reverse osmosis; the             perchlorate is broken down. The perchlorate is not moved anywhere, it is reduced             into oxygen and chloride. The oxygen is then pumped away, the chloride is             precipitated.
In addition,             it is advantageous over chemical reduction as well. Chemical reduction start a             highly exothermal reaction, which can easily turn explosive. In the past,             numerous incidents have occurred to to the exothermal nature of such oxygen             generators. ValuJet 592 crashed 4 , killing all             110 passengers inside, due to the explosion of a number of oxygen generators.             Another airplane (ATA DC-10 Flight 131) was destroyed whilst being parked, due             to a malfunctioning oxygen generator 5 .             Additionally, two passengers on a submarine [6] have died due             to an oxygen generator. Furthermore, the MIR space station was lit on fire by             such a reaction [7] .
By using             bacteria to break down perchlorate, we can achieve the same performance of             perchlorate reduction, whilst retaining major advantages compared to the             techniques discussed above. To summarise:
1.      We send an Eppendorf tube containing our             bacterium, together with components for a small bioreactor to Mars. This means             that it takes significantly less weight than an ion exchange system. Sending             heavy items on a spacecraft is a challenge in itself. With our technique, we             can easily get the components on Mars.
2.      Due to the fact that the bacterium utilises the             energy released by breaking down perchlorate, an explosion is impossible. In             aerospace engineering, any risk should be avoided. Conversations with Airbus             Defence and Space, as well as the European Space Agency and Interstellar Space             in Leiden have informed us about the demands of spacecrafts. In coordination             with their requirements, we have designed a system that is able to meet the             high standard of safety and reliability required in space.

The formats are [name][trigger_condition][event_assignments...] The name of the event is usr defined, trigger_condition is a bool expression, all the variables inside this bool expression must have been defined in one of the above three blocks. Event_assignments is a list of assignments, something like assignment1 assignment2 assignment3, with white space separated. There is no constraint on the number of assignments. Each assignment must be the format [variable]=[expression]
A general rule in the algorithm is that the name of the variable must be started by A-Z –z and other characters can be A-Z-a-z-0-9.
Rationale
According to the rule-based languages, such as BNGL[1,2] and Kappa Language[3], molecules are represented with structured objects comprised of agents that can take any number of sites. Bonds could be formed by connecting sites on different agents to group them together and form complex. Typically, sites represent functional physical entities of various kinds of molecules, such as DNA-binding domains and promoter regions. Besides serving as terminal ends of bonds, sites can also take on any number of labels representing its internal states. Labels can be phosphorylation/unphorsphorylation status of proteins and open/close status of a complex of RNA polymerase and a promoter. Biological processes between agents can be easily and conveniently represented by the changes of their sites on the binding status and labels. An example of Lac dimer is given to briefly illustrate the syntax of this representation. Each Lac repressor, LacR, has one dimerization domain dim and can thus be written as LacR(dim). By connecting the two dim domains of two LacRs, the Lac dimer is then represented as LacR(dim!1).LacR(dim!1), where `.' separates different agents and the same number following `!' shared by two dim domains indicates a bond formation between them. The essences of those languages are preserved in MoDeL but with some major changes to make it better suited to describe synthetic biological systems.
Synthetic biological systems are mostly Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRNs), in which regulations in both transcriptional and translational level are key to control the system to exhibit some complex bahaviors, such as oscillation. DNA sequences composed of basic BioBrick parts (agents) are not consicely represented, resulting in unreadability of the reaction rules containing such DNA sequences. In their representations, each part has both upstream and downstream domain and adjacent parts are connected by"

Usually people were excited about our printer and hoped to hear more about it in the future when it would be in a more advanced stage.  In the fablabs for general public rather than researchers though, they feared that past the initial excitement of having a new toy in the fablab, people might lose interest quickly if there isn’t concrete, useful applications for it. Thomas Landrain from la Paillasse on the other hand seemed to like our project a lot because it combines AND gates and optogenetics, which are both rather robust and well characterized nowadays. He thinks such a printer, if proven reliable, could be used not only for research, but also for fun, and in workshops. Since the materials (media, bacteria) are cheap, the use of the machine could probably be DIY-ed quite easily, which would allow the community to use it and explore its possibilities. LIMITS OF OUR BACTERIAL PRINTER We got excellent feedback on our project, with very constructive and useful advice which we tried to take into account in the design of our printer as much as possible.
Here are the main limits/drawbacks they saw:
the need of an expert to operate and maintain the machine and the cell culture
the definition of the prints might be lower than regular printers, so the quality wouldn’t be as good
the ratio financial investment / actual use. It’s an expensive machine and it’s not obvious that the general public would use it a lot
the potential difficulties to extract the product from the media
the bacterial resistance to light, since they will be exposed a lot and it could be toxic to them
the ability of the bacteria to secrete in a controlled, homogeneous manner

the applications would be few and very specific, so only a small number of people would actually want to use it.
As Gabi put it nicely, our printer is in early-stage development and still very much an object of study by itself, so it will take time and research before we can overcome the constraints above and before our printer can start being used for other people’s projects.

Thanks to our primary research, we listened to all of the concerns that was mentioned by the general public as well as professionals. Safety issue was the most important one. Therefore we integrated a"

Gold Medal
Expanding our human practices, we tried to educate ourselves, and later, the public, about the plastic waste problem and its existing solutions. You can find all our meetings, events, publications and activities in our human practice page.
In our project, one of our aims was to improve an existing PET degrading enzyme. Since we worked on the UC-Davis 2012 LC-Cutinase gene , we have managed to further characterize the previous wild type gene ( Part:BBa_K936013 ) using kinetic activity tests and high-resolution identification. Furthermore, we registered new mutants for this gene who showed improved activity in comparison to the wild type enzyme. All the information can be found in our Results page, and the improved parts are: BBa_K2091004 and BBa_K2091005 .
Since our project consists of several different sub-projects, all designed to work together as a complete product,                             we showed several separate proofs of concept. For example, we have proven PET degradation by LC-Cutinase,                             and utilization of its products (specifically, ethylene glycole) by E. coli . i.e., we have shown that E. coli expressing LC-Cutinase can survive using PET as a sole carbon source. Moreover, we have constructed this experiment                             inside a dialysis have also seen PET degradation by E. coli . Since the PET degradation and the dialysis bag are essential                              in building our biofuel cell, we consider these achievements as proof-of-concepts towards our final goal. We have also                              shown biofilm creation of our chassis bacteria, P. putida, on an anode of a biological fuel cell, and managed to produce                              energy from the bacteria- that is a part of our final design. More info in our Results page.
A big part our goals was to demonstrate our working product- a PET degrading biofuel cell. Our working method was to divide the system into small, attainable parts that we can demonstrate separately, before we build the final product. For example, we demonstrated a working biofuel cell with P. putida, and a working dialysis bag with E. coli. These tests prove that each of the parts can separately work in conditions similar to those existing in a working fuel cell. More info in our Results page.
In addition to the medal criteria, we also applied for several awards:

What is VEGF-scFv?
Test results
Summary
Reference
Best basic part: BBa_K2886002
What is VEGF-scFv？
We present BBa_K2886002 as our best basic part which encodes VEGF-scFv that can recognize VEGF.
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), originally known as VPF (vascular permeability factor), is a ligand commonly used in research. As a kind of endogenous growth factor produced by both human and mouse cells, VEGF has various biological effects such as stimulating the formation of blood vessel and enhancing the permeability of it. VEGF is a big family, consisting of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E and PGF, of which VEGF-121 and VEGF-165 are two main types in body as well as used in research.
VEGF-scFv, standing for VEGF single-chain variable fragment, is adapted from the outermost Ig-like domain of the antibody of VEGF. VEGF-scFv encoded by BBa_K2886002 is a fusion protein containing light chain and heavy chain linked by a GS linker. As for its function, VEGF-scFv can bind many kinds of VEGF including VEGF-121 and VEGF-165, the most commonly used subtypes of VEGF referred above. Thus, iGEMers could use this part to achieve the detection of most kinds of VEGF efficiently and conveniently with our part.
Test results
Moreover, to realize higher affinity and efficiency of ligand-receptor binding, we alter a few amino acids on the binding surface with the assist of Rosetta.
Actually, we are not the first one to introduce VEGF-scFv to iGEM. Team NCTU-Formosa did this work in"

The Microfluidics Manual
The Manual
As a part of Human Practices we decided to develop a manual for manufacturing a microfluidic chip for heat shock transformation. Hopefully this manual can make microfluidic chips easier and more available for other iGEM teams and other small labs.   The manual covers the full manufacturing process for a microfluidic chip based on a 3D- printed mold. It includes all required materials, step-by-step protocols for the making of the chip and also a protocol for cell transformation on the chip. To make an example this manual is made specifically for heat shock transformation, but the design of the chip can be altered to fit any other purpose.
Improving the Manual
When we wrote the manual we wanted it to fit the needs of smaller laboratories that might lack all the necessary equipment and prior knowledge. We therefore reached out to the organisation Stockholm Makerspace. After a short discussion concerning intellegent property and the writing of a contract, our files containing the design of the chip, as well as the manual while it was under progress we're sent to them. The collaboration with Makerspace gave us important feedback and lead to an overall improvement of the manual. The manual was adjusted to make sure that that the content was comprehensible and accessible for the people that read it. The Biohackers at Makerspace are going to test our manual in practice in the near future and we look forward to see the results from our manual and manufacturing method being used.

Summary
We met with top government officials in the state's biotechnology department to tell them about our project. The use of Ag43 to clarify cultures and replace centrifugation is a novel procedure and we will apply for a patent on the same once preliminary experimental results concerning the same. We received ~$9,000 towards our project from the state government's biotechnology department.
We also received ~ $15,000, the maximum prize money from the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India as our proposal was one of the winners of the Indian Bioengineering Competition (iBEC), a pre-iGEM competition to provide financial support for Indian iGEM teams.
We also received funding of ~ $5,000 from our institution's undergraduate department towards the team registration for iGEM. This we felt was a triumph as it is our institution's first time participating in the iGEM competition and the funds were provided only when our idea was approved by the dean.
GoK grant
We had a sit down on July 27th, 2016 with top officials at the Government of Karnataka’s (GoK) (the state in which our institute is located) department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology and presented to them our idea and its applications.
We presented our project and its possible implementation in the government biotechnology parks which are lacking in machinery for automation and downstream processing, some of these processes can be performed by our BioBricks, which can effectively replace or supplement these expensive machines. The intent was to convince our government representatives of the need for enhancing the current government biotechnology facilities and a possible option of doing so.
The novelty of using Ag43 for clarification of cell cultures and using this to replace or supplement energy and capital expensive centrifuges and its application in conjunction with auto-induction using quorum sensing made our idea patent worthy in their opinion and hence, to continue our research, the GoK’s biotechnology department granted us ~$9,000 towards consumables for our project.

Risk Assessment
Issue
Beyond the bench-top experiments, our project contains a major question. A risk to commercialize the “Flavorator”. To address risks, we carried out the Risk Assessment of “Flavorator”.  There are two risks in this project.
health of humans
The first one is the risk to the “ human health”. If you want to save the food in the “Flavorator” with genetically engineered E. coli cells, there could be a risk of E. coli to adhere to food. As it is well known that E. coli used in the recombinant experiments is harmless to human and/or animals. However, avoiding direct adhesion to the food for preservation is a wise way, if you do not want to unwanted growth of E. coli in the food.   If you want to save the food in the volatile terpenes, you may meet the risk of these terpenes, as it shows toxic and/or cytostatic activities to the microbes.  So, we need to consider the risk to human and/or animal bodies.
Solution
Experiments using human cells and/or animal cells to assess toxicities to mammalian cells must be accomplished. Animal experiments are also required, although they should be avoided and alternative experiments should be performed if they are possible. We have investigated previously published works on the toxicities of one of our candidate terpenes. Oral administration to rats showed LD50 of 3.6g/kg body weight. If this rate is extrapol"
Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," followed by DNA miniprep extraction yielded DNA that was sent for Sanger sequencing. This confirmed, to our great surprise and joy, that we had successfully managed to build the complete operon.
Carrying on from this success we then attempted to express the operon in E. coli BL21 (DE3). PcrA, PcrC, PcrD had been synthesised with either a His-tag, Flag-tag or HA-tag respectively.
Figure 10: Western blot of PcrA (106 kDa), PcrC (26.8 kDa) and PcrD (26.7 kDa)
Figure 10 shows strong bands corresponding to the molecular weights of PcrC and PcrD. However, there is no band for the expected molecular weight of PcrA. We know that pcrA must be transcribed (due to the presence of PcrC and PcrD), therefore either PcrA is not translated, is mis-folded and bound up in the cell debris (after BugBusting protocol), or is rapidly degraded.
Summary
The following evidence demonstrates that many of our parts worked. Firstly we needed to determine if the signal peptides native to A. oryzae, A. suillum, D. aromatica and N. defluvii were functional in E. coli. To do this we engineered GFP to contain the signal peptides from these proteins and performed cell fractionation and a Western blot to assess whether the proteins were present in the periplasm. This Western blot showed that 3 of the 4 signal peptides were functional in E. coli, with the exception of N. defluvii. Next we determined whether to clorite dismutases were expressed in E. coli, again via Western blot analysis. This demonstrated that three of the four were expressed, again with the exception of N. defluvii. We then demonstrated the activity of the three expressed chlorite dismutases using a Clark electrode and showed differing rates of oxygen production. Finally, we have managed to clone the pcrABCD operon and demonstrated expression of PcrC and PcrD.

We ligated the product for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then we cleaned up the product using min-elute columns, and eluting in 10 ul of water. We had the following yields:

Plate reader results
The cultures did not grow as well as they have in the past. This could be due to experimental error (the plate adapter was accidentally left in the reader overnight) or perhaps the cultures we inoculated with were too old. Another possibility is that the change from LB to NM-based media causes a metabolic shock, so we will try the plate reader experiment again with cultures grown up to saturation in NM+his (with the appropriate antibiotic).
Summary: the dilutions did not grow as well as previous plate reader experiments had shown. See graph below for example.

Results of yesterday's transformation
The background has significantly decreased, so it looks like adding the Xba1 helped.
There is the possiblity that the background has artificially decreased because of adding that Xba1--that is, it went down because most of the plasmids have the Xba1 cut, and not the Bsa1 cut.
However, there is not much of a difference between the control plates and the transformed plates, so it looks like our transformation did not work.
It is possible that this occured because our Bsa1 enzyme has gone bad. We used new Bsa1 when cutting the backbone yesterday. We should try re-cutting the library with new Bsa"

D’ailleurs, l’aspect financier n’est pas négligeable, puisque l’administration des médicaments chimiques ou biologiques s’effectue en ambulatoire ou à l’hôpital et, ainsi, handicape encore leur généralisation. De même, le coût d’une extraction et d’une purification de protéine recombinante est bien supérieur à la synthèse d’un oligonucléotide.

Conclusion
L’instabilité des protéines, leurs difficultés à être produites, et également leur déficience intracellulaire, sont responsables d’un grand nombre de maladies. Cela met ainsi en évidence l’intérêt que suscite le gène médicament.
Peu de traitements ont réellement prouvé leur efficacité, sans apporter une forte toxicité. Pour cette raison, la thérapie génique apparait comme une approche fort prometteuse. Transformer le gène en médicament apparaît ainsi comme une stratégie séduisante.

The result shows that when
is very small which means that the rate that AraC-arabinose complexes binds to araI site (
) is much bigger than that it separates from aral site (
), there will be fluctuations before Cre degrade to zero.
Analysis of the rate of flip
We use
to denote the rate that genes in state ‘C’ change to state ‘B’, as well as the rate that genes in state ‘D’ change to state ‘A’. Then we change
from 100 to 1, we can get the following result.
The result, especially the bottom of the number of genes in state ‘A’, shows clearly that genes in state ‘A’ first change to state ‘C’ before they become state ‘B’. The following figure can give us more details about the affection of

Background
1 Industrial wastewater
2 Halogenated organics
3 Industrial wastewater treatment
Industrial wastewater
    Industrial wastewaters can be simply defined as wastewater discharged from industrial and commercial sources [1].
    Besides conventional inorganic pollutants, they may also contain some toxic organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) and persistent organic pollutants(POPs) detected in many major industries. With closer regard to the effluent of one of the major industries, pulp and paper industry, its typical content include about 500 different chlorinated organic compounds and absorbable organic halogens(AOX)[2].
    Due to the toxicity, mobility and loading of industrial pollutants, industrial wastewater may potentially do more harm to water resources, human health and the environment than the actual volume of wastewater[2].
Halogenated organics
    Halogenated organics or organohalides are organic compounds to which have halogen atoms covalently attached.
    Their physical and chemical properties vary greatly depending on their molecular structures and weight, type of halogenation and the number of halogen atoms. In general, the more complex, the heavier, the more halogen atoms, the more toxic and the poorer biodegradability these organohalides are.
    Over the recent years, emerging reports and studies have gradually shown their adverse impact on human health and ecosystems. However, in addition to their wide distribution in the production process, their acute toxicity and poor biodegradability also make them one of the most troublesome pollutants in industrial wastewater treatment. Safe, efficient and economical solutions are urgently needed to deal with them.
Industrial wastewater treatment
    Industrial wastewater treatment covers the mechanisms and processes used to treat industrial wastewater.
    According to the latest World Water Development Report, the ratios of treated municipal and industrial wastewater to untreated differ greatly in the light of different-level-income countries. And globally, it's commonly estimated that over 80% of all wastewater is discharged without treatment[2].
    Different types of contamination of wastewater require a variety of strategies to remove the contamination. Here we focus on the organic ones. Concerning to the remaining organic recalcitr"

- since the bio-compiler idea is abandoned, we thought about other ways to store data:
- ROM memory: 8x8 grid to store 64 bits of data, the bacteria interaction can be modified to give to outputs, which indicates the two binary states (0 or 1)
- JK flip-flop or synchronized counter
- 7-segment display: one bacterium -four input channels-each channel with two states (0 or 1)-nine outputs to give nine numbers (0 to 9)- control the corresponding segments to display the number
-bacterial minesweeper. an inhibitor can be considered as a ”mine”. The main problem is that secondary diffusion is very difficult to control. a mass transfer equation must be modeled for each individual square
Bacteria that solidify the soil in the presence of urea
Sporosarcina pasteurii or Bacillus pasteurii from older taxonomies is a bacteria with the ability to solidify sand given a calcium and an organic nitrogen source through the process of biological cementation. This will be a good recycle of land waste, urea waste and a food waste.
However solidification requires a high pH and produce toxic ammonium waste. Even though ammonia increase the pH this should be control using synthetic biology to model the right amount. ammonium can be subjected to other products which we are still searching for. Another application might be using ammonium produce to tighten the dye we made using the pigment which might allow the full house to be made easily from the brick. (Text by Ming)
Bile Acid Sensor
- the idea came up with Si’s final year project
- a biosensor can be produced for daily home use to detect the bile acid concentration level in blood to prevent a series of liver diseases, especially the Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)
- the basic concept behind this sensor: bile acid - enzyme binding with the acid molecules – promoter – triggering the FXR gene – production of GFP
- GFP is normally used as an indicator of the bio-sensor. The main problem is that the fluorescent intensity is very hard to quantified for a home-user
- being inspired by the cosmetic skin colour sample card , we can make a sample card of fluorescence to give the rough concentration level of bile acid
- a threshold value is required to tell the patient when their blood bile acid level is dangerous and may need a medical treatment
- therefore,"
Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," of the trap that is connected to the outside has an open boundary condition.
The lower face of the trap, where the molecules are released, has a specified constant flux. This flux can be calculated through the given production rates [4]. For formic acid, at the end of 7h we expect to have 50μmol/L, so an average rate of 7,15μmol/L/h. For butyric acid, at the end of 13h we expect to have 150μmol/L. So this corresponds to 11,5μmol/L/h.
We assume that the bacteria are in a bag with a volume of 15ml and an area of 60cm². The flux goes through a face with an area of 0.005 m². So this gives a flux of 0.00497 µmol/m²/s for formic acid and 0.00799 µmol/m²/s for butyric acid.
The initial concentration are 0 mol/m³ everywhere except for the face with the flux. Note that we put an initial concentration of 0.001 mol/m³ because we are working in a logarithmic scale.
After meshing the geometry, we can compute the results (see below) and interpret them.
Diffusion of formic acid in our trap over time.
Diffusion of butyric acid in our trap over time.
We can see on these two movies that diffusion is effective throughout our trap, for both acids.
The weak link of our trap is the funnel. It is designed to keep varroas that fell in the trap from climbing out (which would definitely be counterproductive) but we also observe that it restricts diffusion.
This is not really an issue concerning formic acid since the varroas to kill will be at the bottom of the trap. It actually would be very interesting to be able to keep formic acid in the trap to make sure that the bees will absolutely not be affected by it.
Regarding butyric acid, a diffusion that is too low could prove to be a problem. Here it seems to be acceptable still, and butyric acid is a molecule that is detectable at very low concentrations.
If we were to slightly adjust our trap's design, we would need to take this duality into account: trying to facilitate butyric acid diffusion while still making sure that formic acid does not go out in the environment.
Discussion & Optimisation
As a reminder, required acid concentrations for our system to be effective are:

Institute of Hydrobiology, China Academy of Sciences and Wuhan University
After our long period of initial research and literature review, we felt we were ready to finalize our design and proceed with our wet lab work. To ensure we had the right conceptual understanding and the advantage of expert advice, we searched for many institutes and people who could offer us valuable insight. Eventually we were delighted to hear that Dr. Hu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Hydrobiology, in Wuhan was more than willing to discuss our project and provide guidance to us. Dialogue was opened over email and In early June we agreed to board a train and take an two day visit to the city of Wuhan to visit his lab. Before the trip to Wuhan, our plan focused heavily on how to exploit the naturally occurring symbiotic relationships between microalgae and bacteria to begin the process of designing a “synthetic ecology” with the objective function of enhancing the microalgae to produce more of a high value product, such as Omega-3 oil DHA.
We also took the opportunity to meet with the Wuhan University iGEM team to gain advice on parts design and advice any specific considerations we may have overlooked. Both meetings were invaluable to us in shaping our final project and the advice we received allowed us to alter our project in a meaningful way by complimenting our original primary research.
Euglena Meeting
In order to evaluate the impact of our research aims on the microalgae industry, we arranged a visit to the Shanghai branch of the Japanese microalgae development and marketing firm Euglena™.in late June. Euglena is a Japanese company that researches, develops, produces, and markets microalgae worldwide with a focus on the particular species euglena. This discussion allowed us to develop understanding about the obstacles  facing the research and development of microalgae for commercial biotechnology applications. We also used this opportunity to learn more about marketing strategies within the microalgae industry, the range of applications of relating to this area of research. We also wanted to learn of any potential problems that may exist with respects to growing this business within China as part of the the wider Asian market as well as expansion into the wider global market.

    Synthetic biology is based on biology, chemistry, physics, computing, engineering and other multi-disciplinary cross, for organisms to redesign in the form of engineering and even from scratch, to overcome the limitations of natural evolution, create ability beyond the natural life of synthetic biology. With the development of synthetic biology technology, the application of synthetic biology is becoming more and more widely. How to protect the biological safety of synthetic biology has become a very important and key problem to be solved. Our experiments are in strict accordance with the laboratory biosafety code and protection regulations. Our lab is level 1 with low risk. And our work area is open bench. Although we all have experimental experience, we still have carried out corresponding experimental safety education and skills training to ensure the safe operation of the experiments.
Training:
    Our PI Guocheng Du will be responsible for the safety of our laboratory. For the L.lactis used in the project, our Secondary PI professor Juan Zhang has long-term research experience on it. Therefore, we can ensure the safety of the organisms in the project. In addition, the advicors will stay with us during the entire experiment to ensure the safety of our experiments.
    All of our experimenters have already received safety training. Training content including biological safety related laws, regulations, measures, standards, our laboratory biological safety manual, biological safety management system, emergency plan, emergency reporting and disposal process, biological safety risk assessment, biological safety operation specification, equipment use, maintenance, proper use of personal protective equipment, bacteria strains and samples of the collection, transportation, storage, use, destruction, laboratory of disinfection and sterilization, infectious waste disposal, first aid, etc.
Protection:
    1.  Safety Clothing:
    All lab members wear lab coats, nitrile gloves, closed-toe shoes, and goggles to ensure personal protection from any harmful chemicals and microbes.
    2. Equipment:
    We used a UV lamp to visualise and cut agarose gels. We had to ensure we had no exposed skin on our hands/arms and had to wear a visor to protect our faces and eyes. Additionally, if any accidental emergency were to happen, all members of the team knew"

Three approaches exist to construct synthetic promoters responsive to endogenous factors. First, the structure of promoters is modeled by generating large data sets describing the relative spacing and coincidence of transcription factors (reviewed in [5] ). To our knowledge, such predictions have not been tested in vivo. Second, promoters are generated by randomly or repeatedly cloning response elements upstream of a core promoter. In our understanding, repeated cloning of response elements works well [6] and is frequently applied, but no suggestions exist on how to apply this strategy to the generation of more complexly regulated promoters. The random creation of promoters works well to generate constitutive promoters [7] and was even applied to broadly identify activating elements [8] , but no promoters of specific regulation have been described for this approach. A third approach is the randomization of spacer elements between transcription factor binding sites, which is applied to generate libraries of promoters of varying strength [9] , [10] .
In order to be able to design synthetic promoters, an understanding of natural promoters is required. Mammalian promoters can be subdivided into several ""domains"". The core promoter is the binding site of the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase and associated factors. Core promoters differ in composition, but are more or less similar for most genes (reviewed in [11] ). The main regulatory domain is the proximal promoter, which is where regulatory elements bind. It can be very large (4kb), meaning that some transcription factors regulate transcription despite being very far away from the RNA polymerase. This is mainly possible because of the three-dimensional structure the DNA adopts. In addition to this, there are even more distal elements that are referred to as ""enhancers"" and ""silencers"". A further challenge is that some transcription factors are not able to initiate transcription on their own, but rather they require other transcription factors for their activity [5] .

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the density of Earth’s atmosphere and consists of 96% carbon dioxide and virtually no oxygen (1). Moreover, our fungus needs organic compounds as a source of carbon and energy. Bringing substrates from Earth is out of the question due to the costs of transportation, thus in situ production of materials is vital. To solve the problem of available carbon sources, one can introduce cyanobacteria to the production system. Cyanobacteria can utilize the carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, albeit, like the fungus, they, too, are unable to grow directly in the extreme conditions of Mars. To solve the problem of the Martian hostility it is necessary to have a production facility. Such a production facility for cyanobacteria has been theorized by researchers at NASA (2). Using covered thermally insulated ponds with compressed air and water from the Martian ice, it would be possible to grow cyanobacteria on Mars. Supporting this idea is the fact that all of the essential elements needed for cyanobacterial and even plant growth can be found on Mars (2). Based on this system theorized by NASA, we suggest appending it with the capabilities of using the cyanobacterial biomass to produce fungal materials.
Fig 1: - Creating bricks in unconventional molds.
However, non-destructive ways of harvesting nutrients could possibly lead to a more effective process. So instead of using lysed-dead cyanobacteria, there is also the possibility of using biomass produced by them as a secreted substrate. Cyanobacteria can provide heterotrophic organisms with both nitrogen and oxygen through their photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing pathways. Specifically, they can convert carbon dioxide, the most abundant gas in Mars’ atmosphere, into oxygen and at the same time provide NH4+ to the feeding organisms by utilizing N fixation (2). These problems are beyond the scope of our project, but provides an interesting starting point for future projects.
Choice of Organism
The choice of organism used in our project was based on an inductive strategy. We had two variables needed to be fulfilled in our attempt to achieve the goals we had set. The first was to find a fungus species that, given the right substrate, would have the ability to form firm brick structures. The second was to use a safe microorganism with a sequenced genome and established genetic methods, thus enabling us to do genetic modifications. The project started with three candidate-organisms: Pleurotus ostreatus, Schizophyllum commune and Aspergillus oryzae. These organisms have previously been grown on a variety of substrates and some have been used for creating bricks. We were also recommended"

Improved Flip Flop
This subteam, consisting of Víctor, Felix and Yolanda, tries to optimize the Basic bistable operation. The basic bistable has different weak points that we will try to solve by using a double proteolysis-sRNA (small antisense RNA) mechanism.
We basicly need to tackle two problems: Firstly, the tremendously long time that the bistable needs to switch from one state to the other and in second place minimize leakiness from one state to another.
We try implementing a proteolysis and an sRNA system, one for each part of our bistable, we will, at the same time, it will remove the reporter and the repressor genes quicker and more efficiently which we hope turns it into a more robust system. Detailed strategy it is explained in deep detail in the different sections of this wiki.

First and                         total order sensitivity indices is displayed for every parameter, as                         well as their confidence intervals.
As shown, the binding of the repressor to the promoter is a critical                     parameter for the final stabilization of sfGFP. Under these circumstances,                     it is necessary to estimate kD (= koff / kon). kD can be evaluated                     experimentally as the point of the curve that the repressor concentration                     leads to the expression of sfGFP in half of its repression. However, the                     kon and koff reaction rates are not available and can not be found from                     experimental data. Thus, different combinations of kon, koff can lead to                     the same kD, which can cause a different time of arrival of the system to a                     steady state. This does not affect our analysis as we do not study the                     speed of the system.
For these parameters, second order interactions appear to have interesting                     results.
Figure 6: Heatmap representation of Second-order sensitivity indices                         for the same analysis as Figure 5.
We see that a major part of the Total influence of dT to the final output                     is coming from the value of the kon. This is understandable as the two                     parameters are in the same reaction and are therefore dependent.                     After the process of sensitivity analysis and parameter definition, the                     question we had, was whether we should set a value for dT. Finally, we have                     left it variable for the moment and its definition was made after the                     Robustness analysis.
Robustness analysis
At this point three parameters made the result of the model variable, kon,                     koff and dT. Wishing to approach the behavior of the model under different                     values of these parameters, we applied a Robustness analysis by keeping the                     average of the values of sfGFP per copy number for 10,000 parameter sets.                     The Robustness analysis process is explained in the workflow.
Figure 7: Mean sfGFP production for TALE system under different                         parameter settings.
As stated at the beginning, our main goal was to characterize all the                     parameters of the model. In order to do this, we combined the data we                     obtained from robustness analysis with the proven TALE experimental error                     [1]. This error is 0.52 for TALEsp1 and 0.07 for TALEsp2.

It was a great honor to have a breakfast meeting with Prof. Roman Jerala. As an expert in the field of synthetic biology, he has led the Slovenian team to participate in iGEM for many years and has achieved remarkable results. We talked about our project design and details of protein design in our experiment. He thought that our two-chain system can be improved and simplified into one system. Inspired by this, we evaluated the possibility of a flexible linker and its cutting of another chain. Prof. Roman Jerala provided a unique view for our project which improved the STEP system's protein structures and gene expressions.

How to reduce the background noise? We ran into many problems when testing our STEP system on 293T cells and Hela cells. For example, during the process of testing the activation of the STEP system, we found that the response of the system contained a lot of system noise. Wu, a researcher in the National Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering who specializes in the field of cells, suggested us to solve the problem of system noise by reducing the transfection concentration of the whole two chains in the system. He thought that we hadn't constructed enough cell membranes which were capable of accommodating the artificial receptors. Moreover, if the number of plasmids transfected into the cell was large enough to express two strands, it was less likely for some of the artificial receptors to be located on the cell membrane. Because of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on the transcription factor we had designed, the expression of the downstream gene circuit was directly activated. Therefore, it is possible to solve this problem by reducing the amount of transfection.

Estradiol is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics and it also has important effects in many tissues. Though estradiol levels in men are much lower compared to those in women, estradiol has important roles in men as well.
Estriol (E3): is a weak estrogen and a minor female sex hormone. Levels of estriol in women who are not pregnant are almost undetectable. However, during pregnancy, estriol is synthesized in very high quantities by the placenta and is the most produced estrogen in the body by far.
17α-Ethinylestradiol (EE2): is an estrogen medication which is used widely in birth control pills in combination with progestins. It is also occasionally used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. It is a synthetic derivative of estradiol and has greatly improved bioavailability when taken by mouth, is more resistant to metabolism, and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the liver and uterus.
Xenoestrogens:
Bisphenol-A (BPA): is an organic chemical that forms the basic-intermediate unit of high-performance polymers and coatings, mainly polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Bisphenol A-based applications are many and varied, ranging from DVDs, computers and home appliances to glasses and construction frames and lenses, paints, coatings for food and beverage cans. Small amounts of Bisphenol A are also used as components of formulations of antioxidant additives in soft PVC (wires and cables) and as a color preparer in thermal papers.
Octylphenois and Nonylphenols (NP): are organic compounds of the large family of alkylphenols. They are products of industrial synthesis formed during the alkylation process of phenols, particularly in the synthesis of polyethoxylated detergents. They are found in many industrial, domestic, agricultural, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. They are mainly used as detergents, emulsifying agents, wetting agents, solubilizers and degreasing agents.
Water Contamination
Water bodies are one of the major sources of EDCs exposure. Surface and underground waters can be contaminated by industrial, agricultural and domestic effluents. The last one is one of the biggest sources of estrogen pollution. Both men and women daily secrete a number of estrogens through urine. Unfortunately, most urban sewage treatment stations are not effective on the removal of this compounds from water, allowing the continuous return of these"

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," and if an infection in humans was to occur, it can be treated with antibiotics. In addition to that P. aeruginosa is an abundant endogenous organism and has not been modified by our work in any way.
Environmental safety
Accidental release is very improbable because the strains we are working with are not able to survive outside lab conditions and biowaste material is treated with respect to the safety rules of our department. Equipment is either autoclaved or disinfected, and all students wash hands before leaving the lab.
The worst case risk would be if we chose to scale up the process, i.e. used our engineered E. Coli in wastewater treatment plants. If we do so, we will employ a suitable containment strategy. The E. coli strain that we are using will not be able to survive for long in non-regulated conditions. Also naturally occurring bacteria are routinely used in the treatment of waste water and the measures taken to sterilize the water before it leaves the treatment plant are suitable to neutralize our engineered bacteria as well since they do not posses increased resistance to sterilization methods.
Release of the produced nitrous oxide has to be strictly avoided since it has a number of adverse effects on the environment. Most importantly it is a strong greenhouse gas [3] .
Any nitric oxide produced during the denitrification process is assumed to be short lived since it will be converted rapidly into nitrous oxide. If however the conversion to nitrous oxide should fail, the nitric oxide needs to be contained as well, since it can be converted to nitric acid when entering the atmosphere, causing acid rain [4] . Additionally, nitric oxide is abiotically converted into nitrous oxide, which as already mentioned, is an ozone depleter.
Lastly, the plasmids carrying the denitrification genes also hold antibiotic resistances in order to evoke selection pressure and avoid loss of them. It is therefore important that the engineered E. coli stay contained so that the resistance genes cannot be propagated by horizontal gene transfer.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
All our parts can be considered as biosafety level 1. The Nir region was taken from P. aeruginosa, which is itself BSL 2, however the part should not be classified as BSL 2 since it does not encode resistance or virulence genes. Our genes are under an arabinose inducible promoter, so they will not be expressed in the absence of arabinose, giving a small amount of control.  After carefully evaluating potential risks,"

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," using 34 N's as a constraint in the ""Constraints"" field. Nothing used in pre sequence field. First 60 bp of original superfolder GFP used as ""coding sequence"". Clay started working on MATLAB program for codon optimization.
Friday, May 23, 2014
The transformed colonies took over 24 hours to grow - something unusual for this strain but something Ashlee had observed since after she inserted the HMF pathway and attempted to insert dCas9. We picked six colonies for overnight growth to do more cloning tomorrow.
Design of GFPs continues as Clay works on program to optimize genes. Question asked: which GFP should be optimized? GFP mut3b and superfolder GFP both present advantages and disadvantages. Met with Chiam Yu to discuss effects of codon optimization on translation. Acquired data from previous codon optimization project, which will serve as the basis for our fast/slow codon optimization.
Saturday, May 24, 2014
Memorial Day Weekend? How about lab cloning weekend! Only one of the 5 terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 ligation colonies grew. Ashlee conducted plasmid preparation of the terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 vector and digested this (the backbone) and the dCas9 system (the insert) with restriction enzymes AatII and AflII.
More RBS library calculations run. Problem: since TIR is dependent on the first 60 bp of a coding sequence and our variant GFPs will differ in this region, how can we ensure that an accurate library is developed?
Sunday, May 25, 2014
The 5 colonies still did not grow. Ashlee prepared a gel and ran the dCas9 and backbone digestions and gel purified them. Colonies had not been growing well for Ashlee in the latter half of the semester as the plasmid size increased above 12 kb, so a new strategy would have to be pursued.

Instead of creating a plasmid with the HMF pathway (7.5 kb) and dCas9 system (5.5 kb), we shall add the HMF pathway and dCas9 to the P. putida genome using homologous recombination.

We transformed and plated the pA13AW ligation from yesterday. We also retried the PCR to append KpnI and BamHI cut sites to pC13F again, using the newly received Q5 mastermix and higher annealing temperatures. We ran a massive gel screen and found that the cut site PCR and Gibson assembly may have been successful, but that the construction pC13AY most likely failed. We then digested pC13F with cut sites appended with BamHI and KpnI  for ligation with pC13BE to make pC13BF. We digested pA13CZ with SpeI and PstI, which is to be ligated with GFP from pC13Z and mRFP from pC13AK. We ligated the Xpa1, Pst1, Spe1, Apa digested pC13AK and Spe1 and Pst1 digested and dephosphorylated pC13BG to make pC13CG, which we transformed into BL21-A1 cells to check transformation efficiency. We also tranformed into DH5α and plated both for comparison. The sequencing results of pC13BJ 7, pC13BK 6, pC13BL 7, and pC13BM 6 confirmed that we were successful, so we made new cultures to create glycerol stocks from, but the initial cultures were thrown out and the plates were difficult to re-pick from, so we hope that cells made it into the culture and have the correct plasmid. We did a PCR clean-up for pAK13AB, pAK13AC, pC13A, pC13A, pC13N, pC13L. We digested pC13I, pC13J, pC13N, pC13L with XbaI & PstI, pAK13AB & pAK13AC with EcoRI & Pst"

R. sphaeroides MotA/MotB do not function in E. coli or V. alginolyticus, and PomA/PomB function only in V. alginolyticus. MotBE and PotB7E function in E. coli and V. alginolyticus. The properties of motors containing either protein are essentially the same in both species. Stators containing MomB7E or MomB7R function only in V. alginolyticus.
It is possible that the PomA/PotB59 system could be effective without the PotX and PotY proteins.
In light of the above information, we decided to use the PomA/PotB59 system in addition to the mutant HNS protein to increase the bacteria’s flagellar speed and torque strength.

Design Level
You should choose what level you focus on. Generally, there are four levels: parts level, device level, system level and abstract level respectively. The former three levels should be designated before design for a certain database should be selected to link. They are aimed at real application by using practical materials. The last level is rather general and mathematical. It doesn’t link to certain database while providing topology information only.
Parts Level
Since, the function of parts can only display when they are in device with other kinds of parts. Thus, this level is to serve the device level that details about parts could be retrieved while designing a device. Details about kinetic laws and kinetic parameters these parts play in biochemical reactions are needed.
Device Level
Devices are composed by basic parts and fabricated in a special manner. The function may vary be inserting different parts of same kind like promoter to the same place in device. This way is actually means to change the kinetic parameters in order to change the response of the device. Both static and dynamic transfer functions are needed to describe each device in order to be inserted or replaced in the software for simulation and design purpose.
System Level
Systems are usually composed by devices while details of parts are not emphasized. The system level is an extension of device level, but focusing on much complicated ones even the entire cell, organism and ecosystem.
Abstract (mathematical) Level
Topology is crucial for a network even if the kinetic laws are not that clear. Here, we do not care what concrete parts we use but rather mathematical and graphic form. It is universally significant and instructive for design process.
Design Type (sub level)
After you choose what design level you focus, there are four types of sublevels to select. We define these sublevels because the users are unnecessary to run the every design step that we give prior for an entire design process but some certain functions. Given these information, users could quickly start their design without wasting additional running time. Though our software runs relevant functions according to your input, it will be helpful and clear for the users to know what sublevels fit their"

Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.
Reddit Synthetic Biology Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange. Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations. Building with Biology’s mission is very similar to the our Human Practice’s mission: which is to go beyond the laboratory and delve into the underlying issues of projects in a social/environmental context.

The hydrogels were saturated with the liquid in which it was immersed. Our manufactured hydrogel has a degree of swelling of almost 600%.
Chitosan Hydrogel with high pH-level
The pH-level of the hydrogels are easy to adjust. Depending on the solution in which the hydrogel is swelling, the gel has a high, neutral or low pH-level (Production see video).
Manufacturing process of our chitosan hydrogel with a high pH-level was performed by rinsing the 2% chitosan solution with a defined NaOH solution with the desired pH-level.
The Produced hydrogel was rinsed with NaOH solution (pH 10) (left). The transparency is shown by placing the hydrogel on a nitrile glove (right)
Chitosan-Agarose Hydrogel
A hydrogel composed of chitosan and agarose fulfils most of the required criteria for an “ideal” wound dressing.  Agarose is a biocompatible, linear polysaccharide which is extracted from marine algae. It consists of 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-α-L-galactose and 1,3-linked β-D-galactose derivatives.
When the agarose is dissolved in water, it forms a gel with a three-dimensional scaffold and a porous structure providing a good environment for cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation. It is capable of gelling within the desired site because of the polymer interaction. By varying the concentration of agarose in the hydrogel, the mechanical properties, which are similar to those of tissues, can easily be adjusted [8] . The simplicity of preparing the hydrogel and its multifunctionality allows many future applications of agarose-based hydrogels [9] .
The shown hydrogel contains 1% chitosan, 1% acetic acid and 1% agarose. It is a very promising gel. It is a little bit adhesive to generate hermetically sealed, moist conditions for wound healing.
Chitosan-Agar Hydrogel
The mixture of chitosan with agar forms hydrogels with enhanced swelling compared to pure chitosan ones.  Agar is a hydrophilic cell-wall polysaccharide extracted from the family of seaweeds. It composes of alternating (1-4)-D-galactose and (1-3)-3,6-anhydro-L-galactose repeating units and"

Electroporation
Transformation of E. coli via electroporation Preparation:
Pipet 1 µl of the plasmid solution into a pre-cooled 1.5 ml reaction tube. Ligation products have to be diluted in H2O (1:4 usually works) or purified in advance.
Heat 1 ml of SOC to 37 °C.
Pre-cool an 1 mm electroporation cuvette on ice.
Thaw an aliquot of electrocompetent cells on ice.
Electroporation Procedure:
Pipet 25 µl of the competent cells into the tube with the plasmid solution.
Transfer the mixture carefully into the cuvette (avoid air bubbles)
Electroporate at 1800 kV for 5 ms.
Immediately add 1 ml SOC, mix by pipetting up and down, and transfer the solution into a 1.5 ml reaction tube
Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C at 350 rpm
Plate 100 µl on agar with the respective antibiotics. Note: If more than one plasmid has to be transformed, the procedure stays the same. Both plasmids have to be mixed in equal amount prior to the addition to the cells. Again, only 1 µl should be used. For the last step, agar plates with 2 antibiotics have to be used.

This product can separate into two separate plasmids (P1, P2) whose Cre can bind and unbind from the lox sites in the         same manner as before
The knockout eﬃciency can be calculated as
.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In our model, we do not consider the other products that could form from Cre-lox recombination. In particular, two         original plasmids with 2 Cre at one lox site on each plasmid could theoretically recombine to make a joint plasmid         together based on the principle of Cre recombinase. However, this is less likely because the lox sites are located         much further apart than those on the same plasmid. Thus, in order to simplify our model and limit the number of species         to be considered, we do not consider them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the Recombination module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
4.1 Cre-lox Recombination
Fig. 1 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre tends towards 53.5 % after around 5000 seconds         (around 83 minutes). While this knockout eﬃciency is not particularly high, we will show in the population dynamics         model that, over time, it results in most of the plasmid eventually being those of the knocked out.
4.2 Cre-lox Recombination without Reverse Reaction
In our construct we use lox66 and lox71, which are mutants of loxp for which the forward reaction is highly preferred         over the reverse reaction because the product of recombination includes a mutant loxp which has a very low tendency         to recombine. Because we were unable to ﬁnd reaction constants for the reverse reactions of lox66 and lox71 in the         literature, we simply simulated a version of the model where the reverse reaction is ignored for reference.

COMMUNICATION
Communication is an important part in this competition. Teams can benefit a lot from others. This year, our communications via net-video and face-to-face meeting establish a deep friendship with counterparts.
Ⅰ. Net-video Meeting
We skyped with the following iGEM teams: NCTU_Formosa, NJU_CHINA, Pasteur_Paris and SYSU_CHINA. It is really a good chance to share ideas with each other. During the net-video meetings, we learned a lot from our counterparts: NJU_CHINA is the first team to have an online meeting with us. We exchanged some ideas on April 4th and their team leader somehow inspired us the topic of the first Newsletter, mentioning the ""Help Another Team"" part. They benefited a lot from their project in 2013 iGEM, which enlightened us about the continuity of our project. Our second online meeting was with SYSU_CHINA on April 11th. We shared our outline about our project. At the same time, we found that they had also got a clear direction. On April 30th, we skyped with our French friends from Pasteur_Paris. They showed great interest in Newsletter and they finally did the part about ""Interviews on scientists relevant to bioscience"". We met NCTU_Formosa online on May 13th. We’ve learned a lot from the differences of the manner of working and the way of thinking.

Ⅱ. Face-to-face Meeting
We also had face-to-face meetings with leaders of both teams from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU-Software and SYSU_CHINA). It is really a rare opportunity to talk with both wet team and software team. We were illuminated a great deal from their methods of management.

SIRV MODEL
What is SIRV?
An SIRV model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Vaccinated) for the spread of a virus, in general, divides the viral host population into four classes: those susceptible to be infected, those that have already been infected, those that have recovered from an infection, and those that have grown resistance to the virus and thus not susceptible to be infected. The difference between our SIRV model and the earlier simple continuous time model is that with the SIRV model, we take into consideration the possibility that certain individuals from a strain of bacteria may, over time, become resistant to a type of phage through genetic mutation. This is in keeping with the law of natural selection and evolution, and we hoped that this model may help to explain why bacteria and phages co-exist in many instances.
Purpose:Taking into account the possibility of genetic mutations and virus resistance, we improved our previous continuous-time model in hope of explaining the co-existence of bacteria and phages.
Assumptions:
All the assumptions from our previous Continuous Time Model.
No recovery is possible. Unlike other viruses that attack animals and plants, phage infection of bacteria is relatively fast, and a recovery is unlikely. Therefore, we did not consider the possibility that an infected bacterium may revert to a susceptible state.
Definition of Parameters and Variables:
1. All parameters and variables from the Continuous Time Model.
**The intrinsic growth rate and natural death rate of bacteria will apply to both the susceptible class and the resistant class of the bacterial populations in this model. The prototype below will demonstrate this.
2. Mutation rate: the mutation rate represents the probability that an individual from a population of bacteria will develop resistance against the infection of a certain type of phage through genetic mutation.
3. Probability of successful lysis: Although it is assumed that no infection may be reverted, there is a small probability that an infected bacterium may not be able to produce phages (The bacteria may have defective enzymes, for example), in which case the infected bacteria will not be lysed. This parameter, the probability of successful lysis, is involved in computing the number of infected bacteria and number of phages produced at any given moment.

We visited their                     Headquarters and presented our project in front of Anna Maria Chronopoulou,                     Head of Corporate Communication & Corporate Social Responsibility and                     Georgia Papaioannou, Communication and Market Access Associate. After a                     fruitful conversation, we investigated the utilization of our project for the stabilization of                         metabolic pathways in the development and production of pharmaceutical                         compounds and, more specifically, its use over conventional methods, such as                     extraction or chemical synthesis."

@ Roberts Lab / Towson In Attendance: Dr Roland Roberts, Dr Liz, Dr Schiefele, Patrick, Ryan, Duke
Dr Liz introduced this group of iGEM folks to Dr Roland Roberts. Dr Roberts is willing to have a small cadre of the iGEM Team Baltimore work in his lab. Because Dr Roberts is not officially an iGEM Advisor, we are going to be especially considerate about using his lab space. We are not going to have any more people come into his lab space at this time. There may be room for one more person to work in the Roberts' Lab at a later date.
Dr Roberts has a very disctinct protocol in his lab, and he was kind enough to distribute Lab Instructions to all of us -- these are what he gives his own students when they first comoe into his lab. We are very grateful for Dr Roberts' support, and we will show that by being especially sensitive to his lab policies and procedures. Dr Roberts keeps a sterile working environment. PCR reactions and cloning are always done under the hood. His lab only uses filtered tips. Dishes do not stack up in his sink. We"

Before integrating our multimerized plasmids, we first tested the circuit by making each gRNA correspond to a different fluorescent reporter. The data for this experiment can be found below. There were four possible combinations of two drugs, and each combination yielded a relatively high expression of its corresponding fluorescent gene.

Blog #15 - Noneffective Antibiotics (Part I): Dangerous Battle against Killer Germs
By NBailly 17:06, June 23 2014 (CDT)
SEM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
An opportunistic, nosocomial pathogen of immuno-compromised individuals, P. aeruginosa typically infects the pulmonary tract, urinary tract, burns, wounds, and also causes other blood infections. Picture by Janice Haney Carr.
Are we soon going to be dying of pneumonia again? It is almost unimaginable, but the danger that our antibiotics will soon fail against plagues thought to be conquered a long time ago, is eminent. In fact, the situation has grown very acute. The all-purpose weapon antibiotic is on the verge of losing its vigor since many pathogens, such as the pneumonia causing bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have become resistant. Experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) have already raised a loud alarm: In their recently published first global resistance report , they are drawing a rather apocalyptic picture. If nothing is done, doctors soon might not be able to do anything but stand helplessly next to their patients while they are dying from nowadays easily curable diseases or even smallest wound infections. But how did it come so far? There were so many drugs against once deadly pestilences such as syphilis and tuberculosis, and against everyday infections such an inflammation of the middle ear or bladder infection. Meanwhile, these remedies even have become dirt-cheap. And herein lies the problem: Almost all pharma companies abandoned antibiotics research due to economic reasons. Today, they can make more money out of cardiac and cancer treatments that patients have to take for years, than out"

The D.I.V.E.R.T concept
In their work published in 2016 Crook et al. probably generated the very first retrotransposon-based system for in vivo directed evolution by inserting a gene of interest into a truncated version of the native Ty1 retrotransposon in S. cerevisiae (Figure 1)11. Thus, the GOI is subjected to the retrotransposon life cycle and continuously mutated due to the error-prone nature of Ty1 reverse transcriptase (low fidelity is inherent to most reverse transcriptases12). 
Figure 1: Scheme of the design used by Crook et al. (image taken from their publication 11, which is open access under the CC BY 4.0 license).
Although having delivered impressive results such as a mutation rate of 0.15 kb-1­ the concept still holds room for improvement as argued by Zheng et al. in their review of targeted mutagenesis13.  For example, Ty1 as a mobile genetic element can reintegrate anywhere in the genome, preferred upstream of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III14 possibly reducing selection efficiency due to the presence of multiple copies of the heterologous gene in a single cell. Additionally, in this setting the reverse transcriptase likewise is continuously mutated increasing the risk of inactivation as time carries on.
Drawing inspiration from this retroelement-based approach and having its potential weaknesses in mind we started thinking about the benefits of a more universal hypermutation strategy relying on reverse transcription of the gene of interest and reintegration of the generated cDNA such as:
Site-specific reintegration would make sure to replace the original gene variant maintaining single-copy status for optimal selection behavior.
Expression of the required reverse transcriptase in trans rather than within the synthetic retroelement eliminates the risk of inactivating the enzyme by mutation.
In such a system only the GOI would be mutated and remain being present in just a single copy. The overall scheme of our D.I.V.E.R.T. (directed in vivo evolution via reverse transcription) concept is depicted in Figure 2.
Figure 2: General scheme of the D.I.V.E.R.T. cycle
Theoretical considerations
To sum up: we wanted to build a fully synthetic retrotransposon-like genetic element that would allow our gene of interest to continuously undergo the retrotransposon life cycle accumulating mutations over time. The main events that need to be functionally implemented for such a system to work would be the in vivo reverse transcription carried out by a heterologous reverse transcriptase as"

Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.
iGEM2010 China Meetup Shanghai
Something amazing happened at Shanghai this summer. On August 5th, USTC_Software, together with teams from 6 other top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, ECUST-Shanghai, Peking, Tsinghua, USTC, ZJU-China, and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.

But how can we convert the invisible sequence information into easily measurable signal?
Split luciferase
Split enzymes [5] were selected as the candidates to convert the presence of target DNA sequence into measureable signal. Each protein fragment by itself is inactive; when the fragments are reassembled, the enzymatic activity of the original protein would be reconstituted, thus providing easily measurable readout through enzymatic reaction. Among diverse split enzymes, we chose split luciferase which produces bioluminescence signal (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Illustration of the working mechanism of split luciferase. A functional luciferase is split into two inactive fragments (Nluc, orange and Cluc, yellow).  Each fragment is fused to an interacting domain (gray) that tends to dimerize. The interacting domains cause non-covalent complementation of Nluc and Cluc to reconstitute the enzymatic activity, thus to emit measurable bioluminescence.
Design
We combined dCas9 and split luciferase to obtain a paired dCas9 (PC) reporter system that can not only extract the sequence information of target DNA, but also quantitatively visualize its abundance through bioluminescence emission. As shown in the schematic diagram (Figure 2), when N-luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complex and C-luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complex simultaneously bind to adjacent sites on a target DNA, the two fragments of luciferase are brought into proximity and the subsequent complementation brings measurable bioluminescence signal.
Figure 2. Schematic of the paired dCas9 (PC) reporter system. dCas9 was fused with fragments of split luciferase (N-luc and C-luc), respectively, to form two kinds of split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes. In the presence of target DNA, the complexes, respectively, bind to two adjacent recognition sites, bringing N-luc and C-luc into proximity to produce bioluminescence signal.
Results
Validating the functional reconstitution of split luciferase
We began by examining whether our split luciferase could be really functionally reconstituted by protein fragment-assisted complementation (PFAC) [7,8]. For the complementation-assisting partners, we chose rap"

In enhancing the awareness of high school students about genetic engineering and iGEM, most teams undertake some form of a. and c.; however, we think we stand out by including b., a technique by which students would be able to quantitatively predict the output of the circuits they construct. The objective was to convey that genetic engineering is a diverse area with inputs from biological and more abstract areas of science and engineering.
The presentation was followed by a questionnaire presented to the audience to see how the presentation changed the audience’s knowledge of the topics (related to our iGEM project) and their views about the importance of the question addressed by our iGEM project.
The collaboration was during the presentations in Chennai, the city in which our collaborating college, SVCE is located. The point of the collaboration was that the iGEM projects of both the teams could be presented to the students and since our projects were quite different (ours was basic while theirs was applied research) and we could give the students exposure about the challenges in both these types of projects.

I got nice colonies with the lacI generator ligated controls. None of the colonies are now glowing. Hence I think my assembly worked. Since I had a meeting today whole afternoon I was not able to prepare for miniprep tomorrow.

Introduction: Overview
Abstract
     Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affects more than 17 million people worldwide, and current treatments for T1DM, known as insulin therapy , require continued insulin injection, diet control, and constant monitoring of blood sugar. Gene therapy methods that restore insulin production in non-pancreatic cells might provide a one-shot cure for T1DB. We propose a gene therapy for T1DM using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that transfects somatic cells with an insulin gene controlled by a glucose-sensitive promoter, thus potentially restoring glucose-regulated insulin production in diabetic patients. Preliminary tests are conducted on cell lines to assess the efficiency of the therapy.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a very important thing to do these days.
So normally I think to control 90 % of the disease is very easy, because you can make mass drug administrations. So in endemic regions where most of the people are infected you will provide the drug and the [prevalence] will go down and you will see a major benefit. But once you stop the treatment infection numbers will again increase because you have all these low-level infections and mosquitoes can be infected on their blood. This causes a major rebound. We have seen this in regions where they made major efforts to control malaria and
malaria was nearly extinct. Once they stopped the measures they had a worse situation than in the beginning. So once you start to control malaria you must not stop it. I think this is important.
iGEM Hamburg: Are there traps, which are designed to heal the mosquito from the Plasmodium instead of killing the mosquito?
Dr. Jacobs: I am not aware of any traps, which can do this. Manly traps are used to kill mosquitoes. But there is one example which might be similar. There is a vaccination of humans against a protein from malaria, which is only expressed in mosquitoes. When the mosquitoes suck the blood they will also ingest these antibodies [formed in the human] and the Plasmodium will die within the mosquitoes. So this vaccination is not beneficial for the human or at least not for the patient directly. It actually will kill the parasite in the mosquito. So somehow you get a “vaccination of the mosquitoes”. – So to say. There are some ethical problems, because you have to vaccinate the people and they will not directly benefit from the vaccinations. But the vaccination can have side effects and so on and so forth. However this might be very interesting, because there are not many polymorphic molecules in the mosquito, which will change over time since in the mosquito there is not a big immune system and there are no antibodies in the mosquitoes. Once the parasite needs this protein the antibody will be there and will prevent the function of the protein. I would not expect any resistance at this stage. So this is actually similar to what you asked.
iGEM Hamburg: How about the following generation of mosquitoes?
Dr. Jacobs: The Plasmodia will be killed within the gut of the mosquito. So the mosquito will be healed as you suggested and will developed normally over time. But over time this human antibodies in the mosquito will be degraded. There are also proteases in the mosquito for example. So the antibody will be vanished. It will not be a long lasting action, but with the next"

Biology of Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS)

FA Sensing Mechanism
Protein Trafficking
Overview
In our project, we introduced bacterial glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells to create alternative metabolic pathway. However, unlike their native environment in bacteria, the two enzymes needed to find their way through the high compartmentalized system in order to reach the citric acid cycle where they could act on.
To guide the glyoxylate enzymes into the mitochondria where mammalian citric acid cycle resides, we produced recombinant glyoxylate enzymes by attaching the Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) to their N-termini.
We have also constructed the MLS in its own into standard BioBricks ( BBa_K1119000 & BBa_K1119001 ), and we quantitatively characterized their behavior using GFP reporter.
Biology of Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS)
In eukaryotes, the signal sequence guides the translocation of the newly synthesized peptide.
The story starts with the MLS attached to the N-terminus of the protein of interest. Once the protein of interest is synthesized, this preprotein would remain unfolded by associating with chaperons. The preprotein will stay in the cytosol until the MLS gets recognized by receptor of the TOM complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Binding of the MLS to the receptor will trigger the feeding of the peptide through the translocation channel. Afterwards, the MLS will then be handed over to a TIM complex which sits on the inner membrane, which will then open up the channels on the inner membrane and allow the peptide to pass through. Once the peptide is through the double membranes, mitochondrial chaperone will be involved in pulling the peptide into the mitochondria and refold the protein. Lastly, the MLS will be cleaved by signal peptidase and dissociate from the transported peptide. (Alberts, 2002)

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," coagulant contains, Tisseel is not available to be used in a home setting by an individual. Instead, it is supposed to be applied by a healthcare professional in a medical setting (Drugs, n.d.). And since Tisseel is a fibrin sealant, it is found to be more expensive than other types of coagulants (2009).
Duraseal and Floseal: These are both surgical compounds and would not be beneficial to an individual for use on a normal wound. (Corporation, 2016; pdriscoll, 2015).
Xyntha: This coagulant is only useful to people with a deficiency of factor VIII (classic hemophilia), and isn’t useful to other types of hemophilia or Von Willebrand's disease (Pfizer Inc, 2016).
Overall, the table shows just why our product Coagu.coli is the perfect coagulant.
Our Constructs
First Construct
To obtain our goal of an accelerated clotting process, we have deployed the venom serine protease “Cerastotin” which will act on the thrombin, bypassing multiple factors in the clotting cascade and cut long fibrinogen strands into fibrin monomers which will stop the bleeding at a greatly accelerated rate. In order for the venom to stay localized at the wound site, we have augmented a short fibrin peptide with the venom that will polymerize with the other fibrin monomers at the wound site. With the polymerization of the venom within a permanent clot and with blood pressure directing flow to the wound, the venom will not be traveling throughout the body and initiating a clot other than that of the wound site.
We chose a constitutive medium strength promoter (J23107) and a medium/strong RBS for our construct in order to produce an ample amount of venom, but also allowing our Thiol isomerase time to stabilize the multiple disulphide bonds in the venom, so the protein will fold properly and its enzymatic activity increases.
To ensure our venom protein folds properly, we have a periplasmic signal attached to both the venom/fibrin protein as well as the thiol isomerase. Foreign proteins don't fold well within the rough cytoplasm, so we sent our proteins to the periplasmic space which is a more ideal situation for our venom. With addition to the DsbC, the enzymatic activity of the venom should be significantly higher which in turn should accelerate our clotting. By having our proteins in the periplasmic space, we only need"
