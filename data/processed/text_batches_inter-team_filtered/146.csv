OVERVIEW
One of the most important processes within synthetic biology involves the introduction of small molecules through cell membranes, with the most prevalent being bacterial transformations. This process is routinely conducted using chemical means where washing of cells with numerous chemical mixtures allows for the creation of pores in the membrane. Another method commonly utilized is known as electroporation, where high-voltage pulses are delivered to cells resulting in temporary pore formation allowing the small molecules to enter. Electroporation is often favored due to its increased transformation efficiencies, faster protocols, and less materials necessary in preparing the competent cells, however, a major inhibitory factor persists due to the need for electroporators. These devices cost thousands of dollars, require electricity, and are difficult to transport, preventing their incorporation in many labs across the world, in high schools, and in field biology. With inspiration from frugal science inventions such as the Foldscope and PaperFuge, we set out to develop an electroporator that address each of these obstacles. We present the ElectroPen, a novel 20-cent electroporator built using the underlying principles of a common household lighter that weighs only 13g, can be fabricated using everyday materials, and requires no access to electricity.

Our Team
Our team consists of 11 members majoring in biomedical sciences or electronic engineering to represent CGU participating in iGEM. We are resourceful, thriving on challenge and eager leaners. Everyone brings what he or she has learned into full play. After interdisciplinary brainstorming for several months, we hope to contribute to the society and world by providing another possibility of adjuvant during the iGEM project.

iGEM is a highly-cost competition, so that we have no choice but to go around canvassing and collect requisite capital for iGEM. There are four parts in our total budgetary, including registration fees, experimental costs, transportation & living expenses, and others. Our project will require extensive DNA work and large-scale antibody test. The required reagents count significant cost to our budget; the actual cost varies depending on the results and progress. Any remaining funds will go towards being used in personal registration fees to MIT (USA) Jamboree where we present our project, and living expenses later.
At first, we think how we could get subsidized by others? Then we wrote request letters for small donations and emailed them to the faculty of Chang Gung University and thousands and hundreds of biotech-associated or –unassociated companies. In the letter, we described, “your small donation will do help us achieve our goals and support the CGU iGEM team in the years to come. The desire to win glory for Taiwan impels our team to work more diligently. Finally, we are going to contribute to the world by our ultimate outcome.”
Additionally, we participated in the plenitude of seminars, lectures, and exhibitions, like Joint Annual Conference of Biomedical Science in Taiwan and numerous academic seminars held in the CGU, so that we could have a direct contact with managers or agents of the companies to ask them for assistance.

The effect of expression of fluorophores on growth
Introduction
As consitutive expression can sometimes be hard on the cells, we investigated the effect of the different consitutive promoters on cell growth. In a 24 hour kinetic cycle alterating shaking at 37°C with fluorescence and optical density measurements, we investigated whether this was the case.
Methods
An overnight culture in eM9 medium was inoculated in fresh eM9 to an OD600 of 0.1 in a 96 well plate. The emission at 522 nm was measured every 15 minutes. Measurements were done in quadruplicate with pure eM9 as a blank.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the 24 hour measurement of optical density and fluorescence intensity. The final OD600 is approximately equal for all different strains, suggesting that the level of constitutive expression was not influencing the growth. Furthermore, fluorescence intensity drops after the exponential growth phase, suggesting that GFP is being broken down by proteases as a response to nutrient limitation. After this event, growth continues at a slower pace, while GFP activity keeps decreasing. All in all, constitutive expression of GFP does not seem to have a detrimental effect on cell growth during exponential phase.
Figure 1: GFP. Kinetic measurement of fluorescence intensity at 522 nm and optical density at 600 nm, while shaking at 37°C. Above 6·104 the intensity was too high to be measured.
Cells expressing mCerulean or mVenus, however, seem to be having a longer lag phase before exponential growth starts (Figure 2). Also, they reach a lower final OD600 than the ones expressing GFP. These fluorophores might be slightly harmfull for cell growth. Nonetheless, they do grow and exhibit fluorescence, so they can be used in further experiments.
Figure 2: Kinetic measurement of fluorescence intensity of mCerulean (left) and mVenus (right) at 544 nm and 475 nm, respecitively, and optical density at 600 nm, while shaking at 37°C.

Discussion and Conclusions
We were able to succesfully construct and characterize two biobricks with brand new fluorophores for the iGEM registry: mVenus and mCerulean . Both of them exhibit a bright fluorescence, which is useful in our futher experiments. To our knowledge there was no part available in the registry consisting of promoter, RBS, GFP coding sequence and terminator Therefore, we constructed five new composite parts to provide"

Thus, we need to ensure the society reaction and acceptance due to its ethical aspect including the legal and religion view. This ethical review is also being held to direct our project according to the society’s view so that our project can optimally affect the society.
2.1. Legal Perspective of Finding Diphthy Project
The legal perspective of our project is being discussed with Mr. Wahyu Andrianto, S.H., M. H., one of lecturers in Faculty of Law, Universitas Indonesia, who is an expert in Health Law aspect. The discussion was held in 26th July 2018 in the Faculty of Law, Universitas Indonesia. Here, we are discussing about genetic engineering in general and our project through the national law perspective.
According to Mr. Adrianto, in general, genetic engineering technology has not been strongly regulated by the Indonesian law. Mostly, the law only regulating about genetic engineering in food product, therapeutic, and a few of stem cell development, while our project tends to be included as medical research. Despite of that, inform consent of its project has to be held and has to be operated by health professionals according to Regulation of Ministry of Health No. 585 Year 1989 renewed in Regulation of Ministry of Health No. 290 Year 2008 and also supported by the special rules (lex specialis) in Constitution of Health No. 36 Year 2009.

Although the Indonesian National Law have not strongly regulating about this issue yet, but we can us the legal aspect corridor from Helsinsky Declaration that regulating about medical research that involving human which containing some regulation according to clinical test, research, and etc.
Concerning about the using of HB-EGF gene, as long as the gene is obtained from a legal method and institution everything is acceptable. In addition, the fact that the gene supplier has its own legal perspective in which country it is located (which is different to Indonesia) is need to be concerned. But, for Indonesia itself, as long as the supplier has a legal permission from Indonesia Ministry of Health, it can be stated as legal and acceptable.   In addition, concerning about its implementation, it is still possible to apply the operator independency of Finding Diphthy tool that makes the society able to use it by themselves as long as we have a clear boundaries and procedure, safety instruction, and accounted validity.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

We had talk  Christina D. Smolke while she was in Cuernavaca participating in the Seminars of Frontiers in Genomics, a course in Undergraduate program in Genomic Sciences.
The talk was focussed specially in two parts.
Explaining our proyect and how does it function.
Perspectives, realities and backwards in synthetic biology in iGEM competition.
For the first part Dr. Smolke listen our project and told us  her opinion about it, she found interesting our proyect specially because it has the potential to stablish communication between life and computers.
Second part, was focussed in perpectives in SynBio specially the work on Eukarya Synthetic Biology, she was fascinated whit proyect of Heildelberg 2009 . Also we talked about part Registry issues, and finally we asked to her, about her own definition of sytntetic biology; she said that:
""My definition is: the application of engineering design principles to the construction, characterization, and design of biological systems.             Specially synthetic biology, focused in developing a foundational tool bases that make biology easier to manipulate. That make faster and scalable.""

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We have E. coli that produces our lure and our toxin in one place. But this production is actually started by another culture which produces glucose. These are cyanobacteria which are just dependent on sunlight. And I do not have a model of our trap right now but you have to imagine that there are like two chambers: One above contains all the cyano bacteria which are made to produce all this glucose.
Dr. Hammond: So you are creating a completely self-sustaining environment for these two populations that feed each other.
iGEM Hamburg: We tried to do this. This is our main goal.
Dr. Hammond: I mean that is very cool. Ambitious. Tough, I would say. One of the problems that you might experience is that the bacteria will tend to kick out what you put into them. So these toxins and the lures that will be produced by the bacteria, I would imagine after a couple of weeks they would have all lost this. So you need some sort of selection to keep that.
iGEM Hamburg: Now we have provided them in plasmids. This is because we do not have that much time for the project. We have only one year in order to work on this in course of the competition but of course one of our long-term goals would be to establish them as drains. But maybe another selection factor may be even more needed. We have not actually thought that much about it, it is very good input we actually need to consider. You are right. We needed to establish these cocultures first and of course it is a matter of the concentration of the lures whether it is going to work. We have heard the combination of lactate, myristic acid and 3-methyl-1-butanol should be one of the most promising combinations that we have. Like CO2 is also supposed to be a huge factor in the attraction in the attraction of malaria mosquitoes.
Dr. Hammond: Yes, it is.
iGEM Hamburg: But it is very difficult to integrate this part in our trap. So we thought about other approaches and we came to the conclusion that for example heat production is also a very important factor which is attracting to mosquitoes. So we modeled and established a new promotor which is induced by a cold shock and if the nights get cold the bacteria start to produce heat by uncoupling the electron transport chain from the ATP production for example. And you have mentioned that the production of all these proteins and those modifications is probably a very huge stress and affects the E. coli propagation mechanism very much which is why we controlled it by a gate meaning that"

In this way the target population has grown from year to year and therefore the awareness of routine life of celiac patients. It is not easy being a celiac sufferer, the expenses are high and the social awareness has grown, however not in favor of the patients, on the contrary, the celiac sufferers community has become a cynical economic potential where food manufactures take advantage over them.
On the background data we collected through a few activities (survey, interviews, contacting the Celiac Association in Israel, Canada and the United States), we decided to focus on the following four aspects: 
A. Raising awareness of celiac disease.  
B. Striving for student equality rights for celiac sufferers in the school food nutrition.  
C. Raising awareness of the disease in the restaurant industry.  
D. Reducing the costs of gluten-free food prices.
Raising awareness of celiac disease
There is primary importance to raise awareness of the disease. Raising awareness will allow early detection of the disease and save the patient's suffering. In addition to early detection we may prevent comorbidity that characterizes the celiac disease, a fact that will save the state huge amounts of money in the continued treatment of patients. 
Awareness has been done by us inside the primary school, ""Meginim"" in Kiryat Shmona during the month of June. During the activity, students learned about the sensitive topic of food, with focus on the celiac disease. The school principal is a celiac patient herself and spoke of her difficulty as a sick child, until the disease was diagnosed. 
In the framework of the summer camps we had a ""Day on the subject of celiac disease"" (07.21.2015). The Scouts Summer Camp hosted the IGEM Team on a day of activities related to the topic. The students prepared gluten-free brownies, held a ""Treasure Hunt"" on the gluten issue, and held a conversation with a celiac patient. Surprisingly, two students admitted being celiac patients themselves, and spoke mainly about the difficulty in avoiding foods they love. 
The tourist season has begun in our town of Kiryat Shmona; people from around the country come to northern Israel these days. We decided to raise awareness of celiac disease also at the mall through ongoing publicity about the disease and of course about our project. The crowd showed interest, and expressed great appreciation in what is being done. It seems that quite a few people certainly understand the difficulty of the disease both in health and economics.

Otoimmün bozukluklar vücudun kendini yabancı bir organizma olarak görmesi sonucu, bağışıklık hücreleri ile belirlenmiş ve işaretlenmiş organlara ya da dokulara saldırmasıdır.

Modified M9 minimal medium with emulsified oleic acid as sole carbon
Minimal medium was the same with that in Materials and methods for PfadR
What's Important:
Slowly pour M9 minimal medium into mixture of oleic acid and Triton X-100 to get more homogeneous solution.
Analysis the concentration of the oleic acid in the medium by cupric-acetate method
Step
1.Collect 5 ml medium which has been used to cultivate bacteria. Then centrifuge the medium at 3000rpm for 10 min to separate bacteria and medium;
2.Decant 3ml supernatant liquid into a 10ml EP. Add 3ml acetone to the liquid, 1ml at a time, shaking 10-20 times before adding another 1 ml in order to avoid the effect of the ions of the liquid during the extraction progress;
3.Add 3 ml isooctane once ,shaking for at least 90s, stand for 2min or longer until layering completely;
4.Collect 3 ml clear isooctane in a 5 ml EP, Add 800?l cupric-acetate (5% m/v, adjust pH to 6.8 with pyridine), Shaking for 90 seconds, stand for 2min or longer until layering completely;
5.Detect OD of organic phase in a spectrometry at 715nm.
The Standard Curve
We add 1.6ml, 3.2ml, 4.8ml, 6.4ml, 9.6ml, 11.2ml oleic acid into 3ml M9 medium to generate a gradient. The absorbency is measured as described in the protocol.
We slightly modified the methods provided by Kwon and Rhee, 1986, adding the extraction step, for it is indispensable when bacteria are in the medium. The standard curve is still very close to that of the paper's, which proves the applicability and accuracy of our modified protocol.

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#youshalnotcast_-_-_TEXT.html,"avy lines represent transcription of the protein and the “*” represent degradation.
We further assumed that the concentrations of SAM and, C6-ACP are at a constant levels S0 and C0, respectively. Hence, we may model the production rate of AHL by,
The background noise production rate is donated as kd and ka is the AHL production rates due to the initiation process.
Compared to the timescales of interest, cell division time, these internal biochemical reactions occur very quickly, and it is reasonable to assume that equation (1) is in equilibrium (mathematically, it means dL/dt =0). Combining the result with (2) gives
When polar and coast cells were initiated by diffusing AHLs, they would start to produce chromoproteins. However, it is very hard for us to determine how many chromoproteins that those cells produced unless we disassembled the cells and purified proteins multiple times. Thus, for this reason, the second attempt of this modeling practice was to investigate the initiation status in polar and coast cells.
To achieve this thought, we need to find the diffusion pattern of AHL toward/from the medium. We introduced the factor η=σ⋅A/Vc based on the work of Garcia-Ojalvo (2003) and ETH-Zurich 2013 igem project (2013), with σ representing the membrane permeability, A is surface area and Vc is the cell volume, and ηext=δ/Vext with Vext being the total extracellular volume. Hence,
in which Ae was external AHL concentration and Am was internal concentration of AHL in marine cells.
The marine cell concentration nm change rate donated as,
Where K is the carrying capacity and α is the intrinsic growth rate.
We assumed that, for the location of coast and polar cells, external AHL concentration was consistent with Ae. Hence,
The production of chromoproteins depend on both the concentration of AHL (A) and growing stage. We use a Hill function (Eq. (6) and Eq. (7)) to model the AHL-dependence of chromoprotein synthesis. The Hill function provides cooperative switching from the synthesis-off to the synthesis-on states, via two parameters a and m,
Those two cooperative switch function gave the insight of the producing rate of different chromoproteins in polar and coast constructs."

                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

Project description
While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories of energy than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought us attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lack of glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We envision to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequence of introducing nonnative cycle unknown, Dean et al. at UCLA recently has introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cell to investigate fatty acid metabolism (2009). They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acids uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells and cells expressing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt.
We believe the introduction of an inducible glyoxylate shunt will serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cell that increases energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This will help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.

A major concern: STI detection
Very early in the project we have decided to build a detection device. Sexually Transmitted Infections quickly appeared as an important problem that needed to be solved. Very few iGEM teams had worked on it, and the currently available commercial solutions did not satisfy us. So we thought it would be great to advance on this particular topic.
Sadly, STIs are still a major public health issue today. Treatments are often started too late resulting in health problems such as sterility.  If prevention is probably the most effective action one can take to prevent the spread of STIs, early detection can help limit their deleterious effect. Moreover, after a risky behavior, the question is: “am I infected with a STI?”. We therefore decided to develop a cheap, easy to use, self-test, addressing contamination for several STIs at once.

We had the opportunity to talk about biomarkers with Prof. Rainer Bischoff, a dutch biomarker expert. Here are the different topics we talked about during the interview.
How would you define a “good” biomarker? Which characteristics/properties do you require in order to consider a biomarker as a “good” one? Do you think that the “strength” of a biomarker can be different from an individual to another one?
Defining a good biomarker starts with asking the right question. What is the biomarker supposed to diagnose/prognosticate? What are the required sensitivity and specificity? Be aware that for population-wide studies you may need a specificity well above 99% in order to avoid false positives. To give an example, if you were to screen 10 million people for a disease and you had 1% false positives (99% specificity) this would still mean 100,000 false positives. The health care system is finding this out ‘’the hard way’’ in cases like colon cancer screening, which incurs an enormous cost for follow-up examinations. So please think carefully what you want to achieve with your biom"

These transgenic microorganisms will be applied on the patient's scalp, and will secrete the enzyme to their environment, providing a constantly renewed supply of the treatment. The proposed DHT-inactivating enzyme is the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) enzyme. DHT is inactivated by the 3α-HSD to form 3α-androstanediol 13 , as shown in figure 1 below.
Figure 1:Androgen metabolism in the human prostate 13
3α-HSD exists naturally in human prostate, performing the mentioned reaction 14 .  However, according to previous research, the isoform originated from rat liver has greater specificity to DHT than the human isoform 16 . Therefore, we chose to use the sequence of AKR1C9 for our project.  We altered the sequence in order to delete forbidden restriction sites according to the iGEM regulations for BioBricks.
The components of the project
An illustration of our proposed solution and project components can be seen in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of the project design, incorporating its main components: Bacillus subtilis (illustrated by the blue bacteria) which secretes 3α-HSD (illustrated by the yellow circles), engineered E.coli (illustrated by the red bacteria) for NADPH molecule (illustrated by the green circles) overproduction, and a comb as a tool to create a user-friendly experience.
In order to better focus on the many different components of our project, we split up into groups to tackle each component: Expression of the 3α-HSD enzyme, secretion of the enzyme, and cofactor production.  Additionally, a group worked on developing a comb- a tool which could provide a user-friendly solution for the consumer in applying our product to the scalp.

Our novel treatment for male pattern baldness is separated into three modules for modeling analysis, which constitute our entire system:
The Bacillus – our enzyme producer
The E.Coli – our cofactor producer.
3α-HSD – the ""engine"" of our process.
Since the goal of our system is to break down the DHT molecule, we chose to focus on the enzymatic activity for our model, which has the key role"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2015,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html,". We created a system that controlls GMOs. With this system GMOs can be used safely. It can take away a fear and let us use modified organisms in many ways. Also controlling modifed organism can take away a tense between scientists and society. With this project we created an essencial dialogue between two groups of people.
We done a lot of things, which proves that we are worth to win a medal:
We created a discussion in Cafe Scientifique;
We visited high scools, gave lectures there and created discussions.
More information about our human practices activity is in our wiki .
Gold
Achievements:
Our project – Coliclock – is a system that can control GMOs. After the discusions with students we received the information that we and sociaty itself needs more knowledge and education about GMOs, so we had a meeting with GMO committee of Lithuania. It was necessary to understand laws about to GMO and attitude of the society. Also we made a survey and asked lithuanian people their opinion about GMO. As a conclusion we can say that our project, which is associated with GMO, was a good choice (especially in Lithuania) and helped us to crystalize the idea. We understood that people have to work on genetically engineerd organisms – not only create them, test them, use them, but also to control them.
Things, we have done to achieve gold medal:
we analyzed lithuanian people answers of the survey;
we have met with the GMO committee.
More information about our human practices activity is in our wiki .
We cloned a biobrick BB_K195613 for Toulouse team .We also collaborated with other teams by filling in their surveys. We have met SDU team from Denmark.
We charachterized BBa_R1051 biobrick by investigating its interaction with the product of BBa_K077039 biobrick. BBa_R1051 is a GFP expressing device that can be repressed by cI protein. We obtained data, which indicates that BBa_R1051 is indeed repressible in vivo conditions by cI and we also hypothesize that even cI production from BBa_K077039 biobrick is highly unpredictable in our conditions.

Through this short-term course series, we’ve discovered some patterns on the way these high school kids interact with introductory synthetic biology courses. Generally, due to lack of background knowledge, at first, they appeared indifferent about the theoretical knowledge, such as the assembly of the gene pathways. On the contrary, stories.
Recruitment Campaign:
Since the very beginning of team iGEM BNU-China, we’ve been modifying the process of propagating, team member selecting and training to better prepare our iGEMers. This year there’s a lot modification regarding both the procedure and the training contents.
On Sep. 24th, we held a recruitment campus event. We invited our coach, Prof. Zhu Xudong, to give us a keynote speech on the general idea of synthetic biology and iGEM. Later on, our core member presented some detailed information on the exciting iGEM experience and the composition of an iGEM team.          这里要放图10-13的拼图!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At recruitment campus event
After signing-up closed, we began our training session, which is carried out in a mentor-student system. Specifically, each core member of BNU-China 2017 is assigned 3-4 students matched according to the mentors’ specialty and the students’ interests. Students learn the required materials and supplementary ones listed on the syllabus. Mentors monitor the study pace of each student, answer their questions in the weekly meeting. Up to now, those, who had received trainings both by lectures and by our new mentor system, commented that they had gotten much more and much faster in this interactive system. In January and February, we plan on inviting several learned researchers and professors to give new iGEMers inspiring keynote speeches. Meanwhile, the training of lab techniques will start as well.
Motivation Investigation:
As we’ve all acknowledged, successes and breakthroughs in iGEM are tightly linked with the ability of the participants to self-motivate to learn and improve themselves. So we employed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) to assess iGEMers’s motivational orientations and their learning strategies within the Chinese iGEM community. In total, we ‘ve collected XX questionnaire results in Chinese community. For the contrast group, we’ve sent out XX questionnaires to iGEMers all around the world.

The gold medal we got from iGEM Aix Marseille for submitting more than 30 surveys.
iGEM TU Delft
During the national meetup in the Netherlands, the iGEM team from TU Delft told about their plans of building a 3D biofilm printer. Our project is about an ion-selective biofilm so we decided to collaborate. When the K’NEX 3D printer was ready Anne and Marit from the iGEM Delft team travelled to Groningen to test if they could print with our B. subtilis 3610 comI. It was indeed seen that their 3D printer also worked with B. subtilis, using a mixture of bacteria in alginate, with using calcium chloride for polymerisation. As alginate is negatively charged, we decided to expand the experiment to also test the printed biofilm in our test device to test its selectivity for sodium ions. We tested the printed layer in our setup, but unfortunately the layer was not able to block water, making it impossible to measure a reliable value for the potential.
iGEM Linkoping
This iGEM team asked us to sing part of their Human Practices iGEM song, which would be used to create a iGEM song with all the participating teams. We submitted the first part of the song! The result should be visible on the Jamboree.

As the gut is strongly innervated by the sympathetic nervous system and plays an important role in inflammation. [Link] Straub R. H. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in intestinal inflammation in Gut. 2006 Nov; 55(11): 1640–1649[5] and because many E. coli strains have an inbuilt system for response to epinephrine we designed a construct with an epinephrine sensitive promoter, flhDC. This promoter is controlled by the transcription factor QseB which is activated by the epinephrine sensing membrane bound protein QseC. [Link] Clarke M. and Sperandio V. Transcriptional regulation of flhDC by QseBC and sigma (FliA) in enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli. in Mol Microbiol. 2005 Nov;58(4):1203[6]
In a study with rats researchers have already tested whether QseC could sense epinephrine. QseC-loaded liposomes were treated with the physiologically intestinal-relevant concentration of 5–50 μM epinephrine. [Link] M Clarke et al. The QseC sensor kinase: A bacterial adrenergic receptor. in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jul 5; 103(27): 10420–10425[7]
The flhDC promoter can therefore be useful for immediate response in the case of a sudden surge in epinephrine during a panic attack.
BBa_K554001 Testing
The flhDC promoter BBa_K554001 from the 2011 UNICAMP-EMSE Brazil iGEM team was what we needed.
In order to test the promoter, we ligated the GFP reporter part, BBa_I13504 , downstream of the promoter, transformed it in DH5-α and measured the fluorescence on a plate reader after being induced with varying concentrations of epinephrine at OD=0.1.
Figure 2. Fluorescence of DH5-α cultures when flhDC promoter was induced at varying concentrations of (-)-epinephrine.
Fig. 2 shows that at after around OD = 1, fluorescence becomes higher in the cultures containing epinephrine compared to the culture with no epinephrine. On another note, no large increase in fluorescence was seen from increasing the concentration of epinephrine beyond "

Continued work on python code to calculate placement and size of pieces. A substrate grid was implemented to investigate the mycelium development dependent on substrate availability or depletion. Statistical modeling was implemented based on the DOE for both the replicated and unreplicated design. So far a Gamma model or a random effect model is seemingly the best choices.

CFPS activity of systems prepared as above were tested by expression of 1.7 μg pSB1C3-J23100-sfGFP (Figure 2). Firstly, enough CFPS master mix was prepared for 7 reactions by mixing 112 μL cell extract, 70 μL CFPS supplement premix, and 21 μL amino acid solution in a 1.5 mL tube and stored on ice. A further six 1.5 mL tubes were put on ice; 21 μL of nuclease free water was added to three tubes, and 1.7 μg pSB1C3-J23100-sfGFP plasmid DNA from the same stock solution was added to the remaining three. Tubes containing DNA were made up to 21 μL with nuclease-free water. CFPS master mix (29 μL) was then added to all tubes, which were vortexed and transferred to a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated in a BMG Labtech Fluostar Optima at 370C for 4.25 hours with fluorescence readings (excitation: 485 nm, emission: 510 nm) every 15 mins. Figure 3 shows that over time, fluorescence intensity increased in systems with DNA encoding for sfGFP compared to systems with no DNA. Hence, the system had CFPS activity.

Design Stage 1
Previous research has shown that the concentration of certain salts in the CFPS supplement premix are crucial for maximal protein synthesis activity (Yang et al. 2012). A Design of Experiments approach was used to determine which of the four salts (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate) are the most important using the JMP software. A classical screening design was created with all four salts as continuous factors and CFPS activity as the response to be maximised. A concentration of ‘0’ was used as the lower limit for each factor, and the concentration used normally in CFPS supplement premixes was used as the upper limit. The main effects screening design was then used to generate"

Content of Registry of Standard Parts
57% of participants agree that the number of parts registered      in the Registry of Standard Parts is not enough for their projects.
55% of participants think that there are enough and      useful parts distributed in iGEM Plates that we can use in our projects.
Even though most agree the number of parts in the registry is impressive,     still they find it limited when it comes to design different devices     for diverse applications especially in different species other than     E. Coli. Participants believe that if there are more functional standardized     parts, especially protein coding sequences and promoter-RBS , they can     design devices according to the needs of the community instead of designing     what can simply be assembled into a device.
Encouraging development of vectors and standards for new species     and new standardized parts in different research areas is suggested.
Enforcing submission of right DNA sequences and working conditions     for each part is suggested.
Few recommend expanding iGEM into a collaborative effort rather     than an undergraduate tournament, which will increase the number and     the diversity of the parts designed and submitted all throughout the     year.
Submission to the Parts Registry
52% of participants said that they have not encountered      difficulties during submitting parts. Even though participants      are satisfied with the web interface of the registry, most complains      about the pSB1C3 as the new standard plasmid to submit DNA.
71% of participants are like minded with our team's      opinion, which is that The nomenclature of part IDs such as construct,      device, composite parts, protein generator, is confusing as there      is no consensus on how to use them correctly.
Terminology and categorization used on iGEM’s Parts Registry should     be re-described and correct use of terminology should be enforced during     the submission process.
75% of participants agree that different, specified      submission interfaces should be designed for contructs, promoter,      RBS, CDS and terminals is needed during Registry of Standard Parts. But, there are very strong and valid arguments against it such as,      losing the flexibility of the registry will not allow future submission      of unclassified parts.
We suggest keeping the parts submission interface as is, until     these concerns are addressed.
75% of participants agree that Out-dated, un-available      and not-characterized parts in the Registry of Standard Parts should      be removed to an archive after the consent of the designer.

GREAT NEWS: Dr. Reidl of the University of Graz returned our correspondence and is going to be extremely generous with us. He will send us his K139 cholera phage that we asked for AND biofilm-producing cholera AND more, including a o-antigen knockout strain of cholera that Reidl’s lab engineered. Exciting!
-KP Today when we showed up at the lab, our beautifully plated e. coli infused with IG78 were not quite as beautiful as we had anticipated. Yes, something was growing, but unfortunately not what we had anticipated. So, with Jordan’s help, we re-did the transformation and hopefully we have what we need show up on Monday. I did some research and found that T1-T7 bacteriophage are lytic bacteriophage. We unfortunately need lysogenic bacteriophage to incorporate into our e. coli, because we want to to stay dormant in the host genome until cholera is sensed. The sensing of cholera will set off the chain of events leading to the expression and creation of the bacteriophage, so it has to be lysogenic bacteriophage that we use. I will do more research to see if there are any examples of one of the T# phages being used as lysogenic phages, because that will help us to connect with the phage group and contribute to an overall better presentation and iGEM project. We have our presentation on Monday and I will be giving a background of lytic and lysogenic phases of bacteriophage and why that is important to our project.

Combined Device
Even though evaluation of the measurements have been performed in two separate device, it is fairly well possible to put everything into one casing. All you need to do is choosing another lid, and connect a second light to frequency sensor to your Arduino. Right at the bottom we present you the differences in wiring things up. Building the combined device is straight forward and very similar to the single device. You will need a slightly larger connector, a different lid for your case, and some more cables. The corresponding fritzing-layout is presented below.
Our novel biosensor approach
Expression of the TEV protease is induced by HSL. The protease cleaves the GFP-REACh fusion protein to elecit a fluorescence response.
Construction Steps
First we want to assemble the casing. Once you have all the cut parts, you can start to assemble them. For cutting, we really recommend using a laser cutter.
Attach the cuvette-holder holders such that the cuvette holder is placed directly under the opening hole.
Next build the lid of the device. At this stage you can already mount the button. We recommend to glue any parts.
Your lid finally should look like this.
Next we want to assemble the cuvette holders. On the side with the square hole attach the light-to-frequency sensor with glue. For the OD case place the orange LED opposite, or for fluorescence, the LED in the hole in the bottom. Make sure to close any remaining open hole! Please attach a piece of filter foil (approx. $7 \times 7 mm^2$) from the inside in front of the light to frequency converter. Forceps is highly recommended.
Your final assembly should then look like this. Now place the correct filter into the cuvette holder, directly in front of the sensor. Make sure that the filter does not degrade due to the glue!
As the case can be used for both, fluorescence and OD measurement, we use a combined plug. Just three header rows (7 pins, 9pins for combined) and connect them as we did.
Now we're doing the wiring. Connect the Arduino 5V and GND such that you have one 5V and one GND line on your breadboard.
Then connect the button to 5V on the one side, and to GND via a resistor on the other side. Connect this side also to port __ on your Arduino. This will sense the blank. Next connect the display to the Arduino and our connector. See the Fritzing diagram at the bottom for a detailed information.

Project Overview
Our project is currently one step in a larger endeavor.
Last year we were successfully able to take the nif cluster from a cynobacteria and get it to function in E. Coli. Unfortunately,  the amount of Nitrogen produced was minimal. This year we are dedicated to tweaking E. Coli so that it better promotes Nitrogen fixa tion.
In doing such, we hope to create a system for nitrogen fixation that operates exclusively in the absence of light in preparation for transformation into a photosynthetic system. After we come to a greater understanding of how the system works and perfect it, we can move on to working in a more complex organism, such as a cyanobacteria likeSynecosystis spp. 6803.
The end goal is to create plants that can fix their own nitrogen by moving from the cyanobacteria into the chloroplast of the plant. Endosymbiotic theory postulates that cyanobacteria are the ancestors to chloroplasts, so this is the natural progression.
Last summer, we were successful in transforming E. coli with the nif cluster from Cyanothece 51142, and ran an Acetylene Reduction Assay in order to test for the strains ability to fix nitrogen. For more information, please consult our Nitrogenase page.

PART DESIGN
Fig.12 Double plasmid to meet different requirements for each element. Equip the high copy number plasmid PUC19 with sgRNA targeting site on genome and donor fragment with homologous arms. The low copy number plasmid are equipped with expression cassette of cas9 protein and λ-Red recombinase.
Difference between the two methods above: Traditional way use the resistance gene as a selection marker, while the CRISPR coupled way introduce a double-strand break (DSB) into the strain with no recombination occurred.
Application:
In our project, we tried both the two ways to test the integration efficiency. However, the CRISPR coupled way are deleted from our plan list due to the failure of cas9 and λ-Red plasmid construction.
We tried the traditional way with the pKD46 plasmid provided by Chun Li's lab and got the positive results. [results for recombination]
Two main factors will influence the recombination efficiency: the target site on genome and the length of homologous arms between donor fragment. [recombination protocol]
Promoter mutation
For inductive promoters, two kinds of region are significant to its transcription strength. One is common -10 and -35 region which can firmly bind to RNA polymerase, the other is operon region binding with regulatory factors like inhibitor proteins. [see mutation mechanisms]
Aim:
(1) To adjust threshold through changing in-promoter's strength
(2) Tied to specific promoter like PTet, build a mutants library and improve the existing part by measuring the strength through RFP
Part Design

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html,"IM, the soda industry could have its whole playing field changed. Modern diet soda drinks have frequently been subject to discussions concerning the possible ill effects of ingesting artificial sweeteners that have been implemented to substitute the processed sugar otherwise used to sweeten the diet drinks. By using SLIM in soda products, the manufacturers would be able to reduce the amount of regular processed sugar that would otherwise be obtained by the body. This implementation of SLIM could make way for great competitive strategic advantages in the industry and has the theoretical possibility of taking over a part of the massive diet soda market by being adopted as a new diet soda alternative or standard. SLIM could be licensed for use to different consumer food manufactures and incorporated into their food products in close cooperation with the SLIM development team. Focusing on licensing, as the preferred way of marketing, could enable the SLIM entity to be streamlined in a manner benefiting the client manufacturers in their whole product life cycle.
Referring to the value chain above, the most important primary activities for the SLIM entity would involve contact and negotiation of the SLIM sales and marketing force and securing total supply chain awareness to and from clients through inbound/outbound logistic activities. Concerning support activities technology and development and human resource management would be crucial aspects of focus. Technology development including research and development is of importance because the SLIM entity would be forced to differentiate its product to different customer needs. This fact derives the importance of human resource management, so that hiring the best employees, not only those excelling in their technical field but also the ones able to conquer the challenge of ever changing product specifications, would be of paramount importance. Instead of developing a consumer product in-house, licensing SLIM and thereby staying in the business-to-business arena, would enable the SLIM entity in providing a greater flexibility when cooperating with manufacturers who are interested in implementing SLIM in their products. Staying in this area of business the SLIM entity would have the ideal opportunity to engage in collaborative relationships and move away from those characterized by a more transactional nature.
In conjunction with the main primary and secondary activities, because of the nature of the SLIM product and market-for-implementation, the most natural strategy to pursue would be one focusing on differentiation. This choice of strategy is justified by the SLIM entity’s need of tailoring its SLIM product to different industries. A differentiation strategy should utilize the already unique competencies of the SLIM entity and product, while securing a broad market scope through the search and development of future possible customers and markets. Recognizing the need for a differentiation strategy and focusing on the aforementioned primary and secondary activities could develop the advantages necessary"

Optimizing L-tert-leucine synthesis by changing the promoter is an alternative method. Promoter is also an important factor of translation process. So the second method is changing different promoters and finding out the optimal promoter. However, the parts of different ribosome binding sites and promoters which we got from the iGEM authority cannot meet our demands, because these parts are not continuously adjustable. That means we may not be able to get optimal RBS or promoter for leudh. However, we were illuminated by the project did by Peking University in 2011. We get the idea that we could use genetic rheostats as RBS regulators. Then, we could get the excellent RBS efficiency and use RBS calculators to edit the RBSs' sequence to a suitable efficiency(Figure 3) [3,4].

System
By designing a genetic device that shifts the dominantly expressed protein among GFP, RFP and CFP every cell cycle, our system can realize E. coli that in turn gives out green, red, blue (and green again) fluorescence. To understand how it works, let’s first take a look at the individual components we used. These include Toehold Switch, sigma factors, Pnrd, and PBAD.
Genes are shown in the diagram below, where left represents the upstream.
Toehold Switch
The Toehold Switch is a translational regulation system which takes advantage of the bonding between specific transcripts. Genes downstream of the Toehold Switch on a mRNA cannot be translated without the existence of specific trigger RNA.
Ribosomes cannot bind to the toehold RBS under normal conditions. Therefore, proteins cannot be made because mRNAs cannot be translated even when the gene is transcribed. For a ribosome to bind to a toehold RBS, the existence of a specific short RNA named trigger RNA is  necessary.
The previous gene which  the toehold RBS stops transcription comes to the state below under the existence of the trigger RNA, and will be translated. Functioning DNA is represented as yellow one.
Why ribosome cannot bind to toehold RBS?
Specific sequences, called ribosome binding site (RBS) to which ribosome binds exists on mRNAs . Inserted with specific complementary sequences on both upstream and downstream of RBS, mRNA forms a hairpin structure that encloses the RBS. Ribosome therefore cannot bind to toehold RBS and thus genes downstream unable to be translated. This kind of RNA is called switch RNA. However, the hairpin structure of a switch RNA can be broken by what is called the trigger RNA, which includes partially complementary sequence with the switch RNA and thus makes the translation of downstream genes possible.
Figure  1 [1]
Sigma Factor
The promoter below (sigma promoter) works only under the existence of sigma-factor, which binds to and then activates the promoter. However, anti-sigma factors also bind to sigma factors, which competitively inhibit sigma factors"

To estimate the time needed for equilibration, we need to estimate the volume of the column. Expansion is   reported to be 2-3 BV, therefore an expansion of 2.5 BV was chosen for calculations. Thus the column should   be able to contain approximately 3 L. A column with a diameter of 50 [mm] is deemed to be appropriate for   this process. To transfer this flowrate to a volumetric, it is calculated how large the volume is per cm, which   is approximately 0.02[L]. This corresponds to a volumetric flowrate of 6 [L/h]. Now the time of application   can be calculated to be 2 [h] and the height of the column to be 1.5 [m]. Reference: NEB-impact

The benefit of the EBA is, that the fluidization leaves space between the beads for particulate matter to  pass through. Rendering the solid separation steps of traditional product recovery unnecessary.   This type of chromatography has been reported to be a one-step purification. Another benefit is the time reduction before the protein  is bound to the beads, further reducing the residence time.. Reference: Pharmacia. Introduction to Expanded Bed Adsorption.

The bed is fluidized by controlling the density of the beads, and thereby the downward force of sedimentation, and the upward force created by the flow. The sedimentation velocity is controlled by the   design of the beads. In a stable bed the beads follow a Gaussian distribution. This is obtained by varying the   density of the beads. Therefore the ordinary agarose beads are fitted with inert cores of varying diameters.  An unstable bed leads to risk of turbulence or   channelling, which will say that the feed does not have sufficient contact with the beads to bind the"

Figure 1. Two colour image of βHACdH homodimer with labelled N- and C-Termini (arrows)
Introduction
Our model of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways highlighted several key enzymes that could be altered to produce palm oil, including Delta 9, Delta 12 and β-hydroxy acyl-ACP dehydrase (βHACdH), which agrees with previous publications on these enzymes. Delta 9 and Delta 12 are involved in linear pathways, meaning that there are obvious reactants and products, so the overexpression of them can be measured directly via LC-MS and other techniques. However, βHACdH which is expressed from fabA is a β-Hydroxydecanoyl Thiol Ester Dehydrase involved in a cyclic pathway[1] specifically the conversion of β-hydroxy acyl-ACP to Enol acyl-ACP as part of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway[2]. Therefore characterising any specific change due to βHACdH overexpression will be challenging, as any products will automatically be involved in the proceeding stage of the cycle and it would therefore be difficult to determine the effect of overexpression. An alternative to measure the overexpression of βHACdH, would be through the addition of His-tags to either the N-terminal and or the C-terminal of βHACdH. However, depending on the structure of βHACdH, the addition of His-tags could potentially interfere with expression, protein folding, enzymatic functions and interactions[3][4][5][6][7]. These problems are particularly applicable to βHACdH, as it forms a homodimer, as shown by Leesong et al., 1996[1]. Therefore, the addition of His-tag could potentially interfere with the interaction domain and thus the formation of a homodimer, which would be"

Enzyme overexpression
We were able to overexpress the enzymes pabA, pabB and pabC with our construct. We showed this with an SDS-gel compared to a WT sample. We clearly see a band of the size 22 kDa (pabA) and 71 kDa (pabB/C) which is bigger compared to the WT.
PABA overproduction
We used high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the amount of PABA in our cells. We performed a standard curve with pure PABA. PABA was dissolved as well as the samples in acteonitril and applied to the HPLC.

Additionally, another module may be implemented to further optimize the platform for terpenoid production. P. pastoris utilizes a great part of the molecules produced in the mevalonate pathway to feed its sterol pathway, starting with the production of squalene. Silencing the squalene synthase gene, ERG9, would enable the use of precursors for terpenoid production.  Although P. pastoris has no known RNAi mechanism, it has been shown that introducing genes for Dicer and Argonaute from Saccharomyces castellii successfully provides S. cerevisiae with the silencing mechanism. Introducing the AGO1 and DCR1 genes, together with an antisense sequence for the ERG9 gene, a separate module for the platform is generated.

Modelling the gene regulatory network
The GRN is too complicated to conducted biological experiments. Thus dynamic simulation of the GRN by mathematical modelling is particularly important. Before the wet experiments were conducted, mathematical models were built to predict the behavior of our heat regulating engine. Such bottom-up design of synthetic gene circuit will not only speed up the biology research, but provide us a valuable insight into the system as well. We want to know:
In a particular state which genes were expressed?
What’s the influence of the gene product on cell physiological activities?
To provide a guidance on the design of experiments by further analysis of the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks.
Noise in the cell
The cellular environment is abuzz with noise. A key source of this “intrinsic” noise is the randomness that characterizes the motion of cellular constituents at the molecular level. Cellular noise not only results in random ﬂuctuations (over time) within individual cells, but it is also a source of phenotypic variability among clonal cellular populations. Researchers are just now beginning to understand that the richness of stochastic phenomena in biology depends directly upon the interactions of dynamics and noise and upon the mechanisms through which these interactions occur.
Quorum Control system
The quorum control system was composed of 3 device.
Goals:
We want a better understanding of the process of gene regulation by analyzing the dynamical properties of the gene regulatory networks.
Assumption:
In this project, the simulation was performed in only a single cell.

User Interface:
We introduced a new user interface. The beautiful new interface is based on the Bootstrap framework, however, which is highly customized. We disabled the built-in module Glyphicons and replace it by font-awesome. We coordinated our color schemes and our logo to make a nicer look. Short animations during transitions were added to provide better experience.
Structure
To improve the user experience, we build Biohub 2.0 as a single page application (or short for SPA), using the advanced MVVM framework Vue.js. Vue.js relies on webpack (not forcibly, but recommended) for pre-compiling, which encapsulating everything into a single file. This is inconvinient for a website with a plugin system, so we analyzed the code generated by webpack and developed an approach to load components dynamically. It is the theoretical basis of Biohub 2.0's plugin system. You can refer to Main.vue to see such mechanism.
Backend
Plugin
Last year, Biohub introduced a concept called the Plugin System, with which new functions can be integrated into the platform and accessed by other users easily. However, it had several deficiencies:
The framework is static, which means the list of plugins are validated and loaded before the server starts up, and cannot be mutated during runtime. This will lower the performance if plugins are frequently installed or removed.
The framework is not friendly to developers. Neither assistant tools nor documantations are provided for target developers.
The framework does not consider the cooperation with frontend. In fact, Biohub's frontend has no awareness of the plugin mechanism. The names of the plugins and the links to them are actually hard-coded into its navigation bar.
Such flaws are fixed or improved in Biohub 2.0. The new plugin system are designed as hot-reloadable, as you can read in our demostration page, which allows plugin list mutations during runtime. A command-line tool biohub-cli.py and brief guidance as well as multiple utilities are provided to simplify the developing workflow. Based on MVVM framework Vue.js, we develop a customized mechanism to load plugins dynamically.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

    For double-period oscillation, we need to find another substance that can be compared with hydrogen peroxide molecules, which requires our further efforts.
(3)Microfludic
    When using hydrogen peroxide as diffusion molecule in oscillation system, we need to modify the microfluidics device. H2O2 can penetrate PDMS material freely. And on a PDMS chip, we need to distinguish different encryption units because each unit has its own oscillation state. So, we have to take measures to block H2O2 from diffusion to different units. We are going to use vertical bonded silicon sheets to achieve this target.     We will increase the number of traps to realize the encryption of those longer plain text.
(4)Logic gate
    Promoter leak is still existing. In the combination of arabinose promoter and lactose promoter, lactose promoter leak seriously. So we will do the following experiments for further optimization of the system.                 1.Change the position of Pbad and Plac, to explore the influences on PT7 caused by T7ptag and tRNA.                 2.Replace current promoters with promoters of low leak values, for example, to use salicylate promoter.                 3.Add a weaker RBS before T7ptag, for example, J61100.                 4.Use computer to simulate the position of T7ptag amber mutation, and find the best mutant site to inhibit the expression of T7ptag completely.                 5.Add input and output on plasmids of different copy numbers in order to make our logic gate more precise.

Our Models
For our project, we built three types of models. The first was an agent-based model which simulated our multicellular biosensor framework. This model gave insight into the optimal ratio of cell-types to have in the system. This information was used during experimental characterisation to optimise our system.
Our second model was a statistical, multifactorial Design of Experiments (DoE) approach towards optimising Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) systems. This statistical model was used to generate an experimental design to gather data on the importance of certain supplements in CFPS systems, and then use the experimental data to optimise CFPS systems.
Our third model was an agent-based model designed to replicate the functions of a digital microfluidic chip and schedule the tasks for the device. The final piece of software controls agents which are the microfluidic droplets and moves them around the simulated chip according to predefined movement plans which can be read from either the program itself or custom external files. This provides a quicker, more inexpensive means of testing the chip than repeated real-world experiments.

We formed three different groups of people to work with: youngsters (app. twelve years old), student of several universities and seniors. Uitgeverij Cascade NV. (EOS, Scientific American, Psyche & Brein) agreed to sponsor us by giving us 200 magazines which we can use as promotional material!
Week 3
This week, we’ve worked on our debate. The organization of this event is not going smoothly but we will not give up! Genzyme announced that they will be a Silver Sponsor of the K.U.Leuven iGEM team!
Week 4
ULB agreed to collaborate with us!! The debate is starting to take shape! On Tuesday, Jeroen and Tom first went to Antwerp to collect the 200 magazines of 'Uitgeverij Cascade NV.' and afterwards they drove towards Gosselies, next to Charleroi. There, they received DG1 competent cells and promotional material from Philippe Gabant of Delphi Genetics. Thrombogenics announced that they will be a Jamboree Sponsor of the K.U.Leuven iGEM team! On Friday we had contact with the Edinburgh iGEM team and hopefully we will send them the INP-gene in the beginning of next week! After the weekly team meeting, Tom went to Genzyme in Geel, to collect 100 bags and 100 gimmicks, Thanks Genzyme =]
Week 5
On Tuesday, Raf Roelands provided us with tons of gimmicks from Eurogentec: 100 pens and lots of mints. Our goodiebags are finally starting to take shape. We also applied to be featured in the BBC documentary about synthetic biology, which would be an honour if we would be the chosen one! Our wetlab team faced major problems with the INP gene, but we will soon receive a plasmid containing the INP from Professor Steven E. Lindlow from the University of California, Berkeley and from Professor Gregory Gloor from the University of Western Ontario, for which we are very grateful. We will also send this plasmid to the Edinburgh team (or make sure that the labs also send it to them) because they also have problems with the INP gene.

Anaerobic Testing of the FNR Promoter
Abstract
When the bacteria have reached the tumor zone, the CEST contrast proteins should be expressed. A characteristic of tumorous areas is the low oxygen concentration, so when the proteins can be expressed if they sense a hypoxic environment, tumors can be visualized. Hereto production of the contrast generating proteins chosen for this experiment will be induced by triggering an FNR promoter, making use of hypoxic conditions. The chosen proteins are all Arginine and Lysine rich, which will ensure that CEST contrast becomes visible upon measurement with MRI machines, making bacterial protein expression a possible tumor imaging mechanism. Testing the promoter under hypoxic conditions it was revealed that no proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria, but EGFP was produced in the XL-1 Blue and MG1655 strains. The XL1-Blue E.coli strain appears to be the best strain for the anaerobically induction of CEST protein expression, due to an increase in activity seen during the promoter experiments.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

USTC-China,2014,Team:USTC-China#modeling#motion_-_-_TEXT.html," we can develop a method to measure the value of $D$. Firstly we use micro camera to record the motion of bacteria. And then we focus on several bacteria's movement locus to count $Ave(x^2)$ with time $t$. Using these statistic data we can plot the relation between $Ave(x^2)$ and $2t$, and  the slope of the plot is what we want, the value of D.
Results
We use Mathematics to simulate 500-step movements of 5 bacteria, the image above shows their locus (in different color). ALl the bacteria ""moved"" randomly to different directions. Than we calculate square of the distance from original point, plot it with steps $ n $
From the figure we can conclude that different diffusion coefficients correspond to different slopes of the fitting line. So we can develop a experimental method to evaluate the parameter of the system.
When we get the value of diffusion coefficients before and after we gave the signal STOP, we can compare them to see how our paths woke. What's more, with D, we can estimate how far a bacterium can move in a particular period of time, and predict how clear our image would be.
From a quantitative perspective, this work upholds the idea of using C.crescentus  instead of E. Coli as chassis to make the image more clear.
This work is chiefly done by Hongda Jiang, with the assistance of Fangming Xie.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human Legal_-_-_TEXT.html," practices of the indigenous populace need to be taken into account when implementing a project.
We have tried to take this into consideration when we drafted the implementation plan to our project. For many cultures, certain plants can hold a religious or cultural significance, and we would likely cause offense if we began planting them as a barrier to desertification or suggesting their use for economic purposes. While we are planning to plant native trees, we will also make sure that the planting of these does not interfere with cultural beliefs and practices.
Since many dryland areas are in less economically developed countries, and the indigenous populace are often poor farmers, it is very important that we find an effective method of informing the people about what our project seeks to accomplish and how it does so. We consulted two of the founders of the Berkeley Reafforestation Trust who also advised us that building trust with the local population is one of the most important aspects of charity work in less economically developed countries. We are planning to take this sound advice very seriously and ensure that the project, at its final implementation stage, will be driven as much as possible by local communities themselves with as little foreign intervention as we can possibly manage.
The Cartagena protocol on biosafety
This is an international agreement on biosafety that seeks to protect biodiversity from the potential risks from released GMOs, specifically LMOs. The Cartagena Protocol is especially relevant to our project as it includes guidelines for the transboundary transport of LMOs, which we will require to take our system to where it is most needed.
Figure 3: Product testing at Syngenta. (Picture by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011)
Article 7 - Advance informed agreement
This is a procedure that applies to the first time that an organism is imported into an environment. As the name suggests, the agreement is to be reached in advance of the specified organism being transported. This is to give both the exporting party and the importing party the opportunity to independently evaluate the scientific information before reaching an agreement. The importing party may, at any time, change its decision in the event that new scientific evidence comes to light. The import of the LMO is still subject to the domestic legislation however, so we would need to research the regulations for each particular nation to which our system is exported.
Article 17 - Unintentional transboundary movements and emergency measures

To introduce and facilitate future use of the novel chassis Marchantia polymorpha, we computationally analysed its genome to:
find out the most efficient codon usage in order to optimise our Marchantia specific registry parts and facilitate all future synthetic biology work on Marchantia;
submit a small library of Marchantia promoters to the iGEM registry, in particular looking for those which are strong, inducible, tissue-specific or expressed in an early development stage.
Codon usage optimisation
Our start point was the Marchantia genome and the mRNA transcriptome predicted with Geneious software ( http://www.geneious.com/ ). The data was given to us from Jim's lab by Bernardo. 99 000 ORFs were predicted, which seems too large to be a realistic number of genes expressed by this small liverwort. Half of these were only 100 amino acids long. We set the threshold for candidate genes among these at 300 amino acids, obtaining the expected normal distribution of lengths.
Using BLAST software ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ), we compared the proteins coded by these candidate genes to the proteins present in Arabidopsis thaliana, given on Araport ( www.araport.org ). Some of the sequences showed incomplete matches, indicated that our predicted ORFs should be regarded with some vigilance. The longest sequence showed a 40% match, a small number as expected.
The relevant DNA sequences from the candidate mRNAs using the BLAST output. Then the different codons were counted in these genes, in order to obtain a codon table for Marchantia. While the table is not strikingly similar to Arabidopsis', we can note a similarity in the slight preference for C over other bases at the end of codons and that for G-p-C sites.
A .xls version of this table with relevant filters can be"

Due to the popularity of fast food and accelerated urbanization nowadays, the number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) is rising in Asia. In addition, patients with IBD have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer(CRC). Therefore, NEU China A aim to design a biological system against IBD and potential CRC by using engineered probiotics this year. To put out the fire in the gut, E. coli Nissle 1917 is selected as our firemen. We empower it with an anti-inflammatory device, which includes a sensor to detect the inflammatory signal, an amplifier to enhance the work ability through positive-feedback loop and an effector to secret anti-inflammatory part. Besides, we should watch out the bad guys such as cancer cells or invasive bacterial.

So, we choose Saccharomyces boulardii to be our policemen. It is armed with a constitutively expressed myrosinase to turn the glucosinolates, a natural component of cruciferous vegetables, to sulphoraphane which is an organic molecule with known anticancer activity. We also equip our E. coli with this module since the sulphoraphane can inhibit the oxidative stress. In other"
