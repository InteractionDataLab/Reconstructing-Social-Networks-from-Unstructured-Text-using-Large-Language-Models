Procedure
Colony PCR
Colony PCR was performed according to standard method in order to check if transformed cells which grew on medium contain desired insert in pZA21 plasmid.  The colonies were chosen from agar plate to be checked.  Names and numbers of colonies as well as plates names and primers are:
HAO 1-6 in pZA21 USER, primers 28a, 28b
AMO 1-9 in pZA21 USER, primers 29a, 29b
PCR programms based on standard PCR programm with annealing temperatures 52C for HAO and 56C for AMO and extension time 3:00 mins.
Colony PCR for Nir
In order to extract Nir from Pseudomonas we used primers which do not contain uracil and new PCR programm (touch-down PCR). Phusion polymerase was used.
Names of samples are as follows:

Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Cooperation
Traditionally, many iGEM teams have been composed of a large majority of people with a biological background. However, SpaceMoss is an interdisciplinary team, with members from a wide range of different academic disciplines like Astrophysics, Molecular Biology, Social Sciences and Business. We want to promote interdisciplinary collaboration, as it can open up to cool projects that might not otherwise be feasible. In our project, Biology and Astrophysics are closely intertwined, and as such both disciplines are needed to successfully apply Synthetic Biology to a Mars expedition. We feel that different backgrounds all bring something of value to the table, which is greater than the sum of its parts. Collaboration with other iGEM teams, universities and media has also been one of our focus points. Collaboration with other iGEM helps us make team SpaceMoss better, due to feedback, workshops and interesting discussions, and for that we want to thank all our collaborators. We have actively been in touch with media, in order to spread the idea of Synthetic Biology to the general public, which is a large part of what makes this competition important. Lastly, we also do collaborations because it is fun! The days of lonely scientists tinkering away in the lab during the wee hours of night are long gone. Collaborations is not only necessary to produce a sound and interesting project, but it is also an essential way to tie all our visions together through outreach and lab work. Without collaborations, there simply would be no iGEM or SpaceMoss!

Inspiring the Public
The project is keenly focused on raising awareness about the following issues: Ethics regarding the colonization of Mars and genetics, the benefits of interdisciplinary research and international collaboration and inspiring young people to participate in scientific research. This has been done through: presentations in both Denmark and Sweden and for different academic levels. To better communicate to the general public we had our project description turned into a, comic strips and made several short films . Lastly we were very succesfull in our media effort and experienced an enourmous exposure in danish media . Below is a picture from one of our presentations held in"

Result
The strategy for the function testing of engineered CEN.PK2-1C stains △far1 +△sst2, △sst and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 were divided into the following parts;
(1). Test of the inhibitive effects on the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C whose cellular period can be stopped at the G1 stage by  α factor.
(2). Expression and identification of Pfus+RFP+cyc1t+PRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2.
Zone of inhibition
Plan and method
The growth of CEN.PK2-1C can be inhibited by α factor, we want to  test the function of △sst2, △far1+△sst2 and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 by comparing with CEN.PK2-1C .
(1) Explore the influence of the growth of each strains cultured with different concentrations of α factor in the solid plate medium.
(2) Observe the growth situation of these strains and compare the differences among them. Analyze the functions of these strains cultured with different concentrations of α factor in the solid plate medium.
Results and discussion
(1) The strain CEN.PK2-1C stops growing at the phase G1 due to the effects of the α factor and zone of inhibition appears in the solid plate medium.
Fig.1 inhibition zone of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
(2) The strain △sst2 is more sensitive to α factor. Meanwhile the larger zone of inhibition will appear when the concentration of α factor increased.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Put less-likely-to-bind helices into a zif268 backbone
Backbones
Maybe revert to a more targeted approach: pick backbones that we know are transcription factors (TFs), that we know bind to DNA
OR research the ZFs from the phylogenetic tree
Pick clades to research, see if one looks better than the other
Why did OPEN cover so many helices, without changing the backbone, but still yield predominantly GNNs?
If we have an idea of how the backbone might affect binding, maybe we could look into some sort of low-level modeling, etc. so that we wouldn't be grasping? Could Vatsan help with this?
See 2000 Wolfe paper [17]
Backbones could affect interactions between fingers
Theory: energy penalty to ZF binding-- unravels DNA when binds to it
We have 12 target sequences
2 per 4 diseases, 4 for the 5th disease
If we want to be more conservative, we could throw out Type III, but it could be something cool
We should have mostly Type I (CoDA argument, if this is an F2)
Proposed: 3 diseases, 6 sequences
4 Type I (F3 and F2 known, F1 novel)
1 Type II (GNN, ANN, GNN)
1 Type III (All unknown, e.g., TNN, ANN, TNN;max 1)
Or, for 3 diseases:
Type I's
Type I, Type II
Type I, Type III
Clinical Targets
Colorblindness (Type I's)
Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) (1 in 500)
Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
Tay Sachs
KRAS- (oncogene/cancer)
Main goal of project: to build outside of what is already known
If we wanted to cure a disease only, we could just use existing ZFs (i.e., find GNN binding locations)
Also, we lend a level of specificity for insertion/deletion
There is the possibility that there might be some area where specificity might demand ANN codons
Current decision on chip design:
We will have 6 target sequences, 2 each from colorblindness, FH, and KRAS.  All are ""Type I"" targets (only F1 is novel) with the middle finger chosen from the CODA paper (either GNN or TNN)
N.B.: the CB and FH sequences make up full ZF nuclease cut sites. The KRAS sites, due to the small"

SYNTHESIZED
— where synthetic life meets experimental music —
New York University Shanghai
This project translates the color and positions of bacteria colonies on a plate into sound composition. Integrating the unpredictable nature of genetically modified life with hardware and digital art, we aim to explore the meaning and implications of synthesized bodies and introduce new forms of bio-data into the sound domain.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
There are three main components to the bacterial music generator: (1) bacteria colonies (2) tube rack (3) button control. We engineered bacteria to express different colors and lights through chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins, luciferase, and oscillating amounts of luciferase. We then translated bacterial colonies on a plate into a step sequencer, which creates patterned expressions of sound. The tube rack and button control add extra layers of interaction and control, making the user the coolest DJ ever.

Mr.D -who will cure leukemia-
Leukemia is a serious disease and its remedy has been never found yet. People are afraid of it not only because it is incurable but also it is unpredictable what will happen and when it will happen. Patients have to put up with both of them.
Here we propose the convenient testing kit for leukemia which makes its symptom visible. To accomplish this we are developing leukemia disease models in Drosophila. The usefulness of this kit will be evaluated by characterizing the Drosophila model. This kit may provide a guideline to overcome fear and pain which have not been immeasurable and relieve the fear for leukemia.
Our team, KIT-Kyoto challenges making a leukemia disease model in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is being used as many hereditary disease model because over 70% of known human disease genes have similarities to Drosophila genes.
This year, we focus on a leukemia in which the etiology and the therapy have not been established. We therefore decided to make a leukemia disease model in Drosophila. We insert human leukemia genes into Drosophila genome and also fuse a green fluorescent protein(GFP) with a leukemic protein to monitor its expression in E. coli or Drosophila. We expect that establishing a leukemia disease model in Drosophila will be a first step to determine the etiology and to establish the method of therapy in the future.

You can relax at any time, but not today.
Shiyang is a senior majoring in both chemistry and computer sciences at UCAS.
He greatly appreciates all those understanding and encouragement from his wonderful teammates and instructors. He have made great progress in website techniques, experimental operations and communication skills in this year. All of these make his iGEM journey a precious and memorable experience in his life.
He participated in topic selection, devoted all his summer to wiki programs, and assisted other teammates in modeling and hardware design. He used to be a piano player, outdoors amateur and movie fan, but now he only enjoys sweet sleeping after overnight debugging.
Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Shiyang WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2017. This idea was then modified and improved by Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG. Our investigators Prof. Xien-en ZHANG, Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leaders, Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG, separately responsible for the sensor part and degradation part, designed and monitored our experiments. They also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI gave their suggestion on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Ruiling CAI, Jianyi HUANG, Shubo YUAN, Jiang WU, Jingnan YE, Yi WU, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU, Yuqing LEI.
Hardware:
Our hardware was designed by Ruiling CAI, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU,"
Sheffield,2016,Team:Sheffield#project#device#microfluids_-_-_TEXT.html," the inlet chamber entered the well and sank to the bottom. When the well was eventually filled, the yellow dye at the top of the well was pushed out into the channel (figure 8). Thus, while mixing did occur at the bottom of the well, the liquid going out of the well was completely yellow. Furthermore, when the well was covered by the top layer of PDMS, an air bubble was formed on top of the well, preventing the blue dye from entering the well. This was mitigated by punching a hole in the top layer to release the air.
Figure 8. Results of mixing design 2 with a 4 mm yellow well. The blue dye sank to the bottom of the well and pushed the yellow dye out into the channel. The top two photos show the results from the top  and side views; the bottom image is a diagram that represents the results.
Since the blue dye seemed to be denser than the yellow dye, as indicated by how it sank to the bottom of the well, we tested what would happen if the dye in the well was denser instead (Fig.9). The two dyes were able to mix as shown by the green solution flowing out of the well. The green solution also managed to flow back towards the start chamber. However, this would not pose a problem as what matters is that a green solution reaches the end chamber.
Figure 9. Results of mixing design 2 with a 4 mm blue well. As the yellow dye was less dense than the blue dye, it was able to mix with the blue dye.
As blood is denser than the stock solution, it would be better to place the blood in the well rather than in the start chamber. Punching a hole in the top PDMS layer above the well to prevent an air bubble from forming has also helped in allowing blood to be deposited in the well.
It would be preferable for the well to hold the stock solution instead, as that would allow the stock solution to be transported with the chip instead of separately. Hence, we tested what would happen if we reduced the diameter of the well while using the same design (top view of Fig.5). As predicted from earlier experiments, the blue dye sank to the bottom of the well due to its higher density. The blue dye also managed to flow in the channel around the well so that both the yellow and blue dye were in the main channel. Mixing did occur, as shown by the green solution in between the yellow and blue dyes. However, the blue dye reached the end chamber before the green solution and there is no way of knowing how much"

Introduction
In our iGEM project we tried to create an Escherichia coli cell which is capable to sense capsaicin in a complex sample and report the concentration with a luciferase light signal. We combined a native receptor system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the readout system of the firefly luciferase. The native receptor senses the phenolic compound acetosyringone. For this reason we used directed evolution to modify the binding region of the native receptor to generate a new capsaicin receptor because of the chemical similarities of acetosyringone and capsaicin. We established a screening system based on antibiotic concentration gradients to screen the newly generated receptors. In our E. coli acetosyringone sensing system several parts derived from different organisms were assembled. The read"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2017,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the Biochemistry section of the 10-day Summer Boot Camp of NSA, where they held lectures and a workshop. The scholars expanded their knowledge on genetic engineering and were introduced to the concepts of synbio, including applications, such as biosensors. Realising the substantial scope of CRISPR-Cas9, we introduced the school children to its principles and recent discoveries. Scholars even had the chance to conduct an experiment using CRISPR-Cas9 themselves. As all of the lectures were directly related to genetic modification and engineering of new generation creatures, the pupils were engaged in a discussion about biosafety and bioethics. Asked to imagine possible prospective scenarios of reckless science, they were encouraged to carry out responsible research in the future.
This was the most demanding and extensive, yet the most engaging course that our team held for the school children. NSA allowed us not only to truly educate the scholars, but also to spark major interest in life sciences and raise awareness on biosafety and biosecurity as well.
Lab Training
We welcomed two highly motivated highschool students into our team to observe, learn and contribute to the iGEM project.
Several school students reached out to us feeling eager to join our team and experience the scientific work firsthand. We were delighted by their enthusiasm and happily welcomed them into our team.
Sharing our knowledge was a fulfilling experience for us as well. We not only had the possibility to teach them, but also received valuable insights and ideas for our work, especially for educational activities of Human Practices. Here is the experience of our students:
Agne Cepaite
""My name is Agne Cepaite and I am a 10th grade student. I was given an opportunity to engage with the Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2017 team's work, to observe, help out and, most importantly, learn. This has been an incredible experience, I had a chance to work in a laboratory and help with the InterLab project, as well as engage in activities of Human Practices. I enjoyed both, however I am very interested in the subject of biological sciences, therefore the laboratory work was probably the most mesmerizing, since I have never worked in a lab before. It was definitely challenging, since my knowledge did not extend as far as I wanted, however with a very accepting and teaching team, I have learned many new things about molecular and synthetic biology.""

NYC_Wetware,2011,Team:NYC Wetware#Food Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the milk in the cheese making process. It makes no difference whether the rennet comes from a non-Kosher species, a non-ritually slaughtered or an improperly slaughtered Kosher species. If rennet comes from such an animal, the cheese made from this rennet is not Kosher.""
Modern cheesemakers have overcome this kosher obstacle by resorting to harvesting rennet from transgenic bacteria, cloned to contain the bovine or ovine rennet-producing genes. The fact that the genetic material used and the final rennet product is dramatically unlike the original animal source is a major factor in the decision to consider the microbial, genetically engineered rennet completely kosher. One proviso is stipulated, however: that the processing equipment has not been used for non-kosher ingredients (or if it was, that it be cleaned under strict standards), and that the fermentation medium that feeds the bacteria be a kosher mixture. If a method for growing in vitro meat could be devised that sufficiently resembled that of producing microbial rennet, there might be a way to cultivate kosher in vitro meat of any kind. Seemingly, if the cell line was started using a sample from a kosher, ritually slaughtered animal, and grown in a kosher medium there would be no kosher-problem at all with the laboratory-grown meat. A question that would remain, however is whether, like gelatin, the lab-grown meat would be considered a non-meat product. This would represent a major change in the culinary options for Jews as there would now be a very real meat substitute that could be used with dairy. Behold, the kosher cheeseburger! The question of in vitro meat that is grown from non-kosher animal cells represents a legal middle ground between the two landmark cases of gelatin and rennet. On the one hand, like pork bones in gelatin, the parent cell line from which the culture is started is a direct and important ingredient in the final food product. This makes the granting of kosher-status to such a product very unlikely. Unlike gelatin, however, the final product is not merely a mixture of ingredients, but a mixture of ingredients that gives rise to a completely new entity. The transformation of culture medium into new cells is not analogous to the distribution of animal collagen throughout a gelatin medium because of the ongoing cell growth that gives rise to new materials.
The comparison to rennet is also two-sided. Like rennet, the final food product is the result of in vitro cell growth, a process totally divorced from the original animal. Unlike rennet, the final product resembles the meat of animal, and, furthermore,"

Frameworks
There is a lot of literature on ethical issues in synthetic biology. A road map to illustrate the main concerns is shown in Figure 1. This road map (based on a paper of Parens, 2009 ) is generally applicable for emerging technologies, but is currently designed to focus on synthetic biology. The ethical concerns that are mainly addressed in literature are ""physical harms"" and concerns gained by researchers ""closest to action"" in synthetic biology. The first concerns on bio-safety and bio-security, where the latter involves matters such as intellectual property rights and transparency.
Unfortunately the scientific community lacks an appropriate attitude towards themselves and the rest of the world. An under valuated but nevertheless important subject in synthetic biology is the fact that we might change the perception of life when we try to (re)engineer life or even try to create it from scratch (Craig Venter's minimal genome project ). The reductionist approach (a method of understanding complex systems by analyzing the subsystems that it is composed of) has brought a lot of benefits in understanding physics and chemistry, and has definitely helped in understanding biological systems. But now we have come to the point that we are designing living systems. Some even believe we are at the brink of defining and even creating life. The concerns and consequences of this progression should be described and discussed elaborately.
Figure 1. Road map that illustrates the main concerns in emerging technologies.
Parens et al. also describes a framework that distinguishes two groups responding differently to questions concerning physical harms. The pro-actionary people think more of the benefits of the research than its possible implications. The pre-cautionary community is concerned about safety and security instead of rather thinking about the opportunities. As it comes to regulation and policies, the enthusiasts would keep the authority to themselves, whereas the critics would rather see external regulation on safety and security issues.

Concerns
The concerns in synthetic biology that typically appear in literature include bio-safety, bio-security, transparency and intellectual property rights. Topics concerning the attitude towards life, reductionism and public involvement that are relatively hard to address but nonetheless important, do not obtain the attention they deserve. A list of the ethical concerns:
Bio-safety (Regulations for working in synthetic biology)
Bio-security (Consequences of synthetic biology, e.g. bio-terrorism)

Not needed right now---- Why co-cultures suit space exploration better than monocultures.
Bioproduction in space generally offers a much needed method of production in space that could lower the requirements to spacecraft cargo, both in terms of diversity and volume, allowing for longer and more elaborate space mission. Basically, the more you can produce in space from extraterrestrial resources, the less you have to bring with you. For instance, bioproduction and synthetic biology could be used to produce fuel, medicine, plastic, food and nutritional supplements from very scarce or simple resources like sunlight and CO2. But bioproduction comes with a cost, modern production facilities utilizing monocultures often require large and costly equipments which are simply impractical to bring along with you in space. Furthermore, one would have to bring several bioreactors along with you to allow for continuous production.
 
By utilizing two organisms instead of one, we envision that astronauts can use a single bioreactor to produce a plethora of useful end products, either in parallel or one after the other.
 
-Furthermore, by selecting bacillus over other industrial bioprocessors (like E.coli), we open the possibility of utilizing the inherent ability of bacillus to form endospores. Endospores are the product of two sister cells engaging in packing of one cell into a tough, radiation-resistant coat in response to starvation (REF 1). This ability would then be utilized to transport a library of transformed bacillus trains from earth into space, where a given “manufacturer” strain can be reactivated through germination, when the compound it produces is needed by the astronauts. We believe that such a system would make transportation less expensive, avoiding the need of cryogenic storage"

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", we realized that this were not easy knock-outs since they are compromising the survival of the cell because polyamines are completely necessary for living. For this reason, we decided to buy polyamine auxotrophic bacteria, in concrete the Escherichia Coli strain MA255 from Yale, which is the most used strain to analyze polyamines behaviour in bacteria. Since we really liked the name PACO, our new Yale bacteria was baptized with this same name few days from their arrival to our lab.
With the chromosomic knock-outs, the bacteria would be quite polyamine hungry, so we needed to implement a system to degrade the concentration excess of the own bacteria or otherwise they could end up killing themselves. For this, we reengineered E. Coli again by introducing some specific genes, codifying for enzymes capable of destroying all polyamines (from putrescine, which is the smallest with molecular weight, up to spermine, which bacterias do not usually degrade). Those enzymes in particular were the putrescine aminotransferase (PatA) from E. Coli K-12 and a polyamine oxidase (FMS1) from Yeast.
PatA catalytic activity:
.
FMS1 catalytic activity (reactions with more relevance according to our project):
Using E. Coli is a proof of concept since the initial idea was to create a probiotic that could consist of 8 different bacterias, all with different beneficials to our body and that in addition, could act as a colon cancer preventive treatment. These bacterias were selected from the VSL3 probiotic, which is already commercialized and that gives many good results with the users. Having so much troubles to clone just one bacteria, we are very happy we took the decision to reduce the number and complexity of the bacterias we wanted to modify. Still, this is a proof of concept of how our bacterias could be able to degrade polyamines, and thus reduce the probability of having colorectal cancer. The main objective is that our future bacteria (ones that are usually used in probiotics) are capable of modifying the human microbiome.
Polyamines can be found all around our body, however, they are higher in the colon. One challenge of all the probiotics is the delivery of the bacteria, since they must go through the entire digestive tract. In order to sort out this issue, ideally, they would be ingested in a lipid capsule, so that they do not die in the stomach due to the extreme acid medium to which they are exposed. Thus, we aim at creating a capsule that"

Synchronizing the oscillations at a population level
In order to make our system easier to observe, we need to extend and synchronize the oscillations at a population scale. The best way to do so is to insert a check-point that can be overcome only if the major part of the population has reached it. The phenomenon of quorum-sensing is the way bacteria synchronize the expression of genes when the density of bacteria is important enough.

The Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with Vibrio fischeri
Presentation of the phenomenon of quorum-sensing : intercellular communication in bacterias
The phenomenon of quorum sensing was first discovered in Vibrio fischeri. This bacteria only expresses luciferase when the density of bacteria is very high (1011bact/mL). Typically, the bacteria does not express bioluminescence when they are free living in the ocean. At the contrary, they express luciferase when they are highly concentrated in the photophore of Hawaiian bobtail squid.

The genetic cascade
In this system, LuxI and LuxR control the expression of luciferase operon luxICDABE, necessary to produce bioluminescence. LuxI synthesize small diffusible molecules called Acyl Homoserin Lactone (AHL). LuxR is the intracellular receptor to AHL.
The AHL freely diffuses into the extracellular medium. Its concentration increases as the population gets more dense. When the concentration reaches a critical level, those small molecules bind to their receptor. LuxR bound to AHL and the complex activate the operon that code for luc"

Summary
While the iGEM team from Darmstadt has developed the project they quickly realized that the degradation of PET and the recovery of resources are a topic for the entire population. The question was how to inform the whole people, and how to reach them best. For this reason, the iGEM team decided to separate the people into five broad areas. To do so, the team has participated in events, which cover many areas of the society or they organized these events on themselves. At these events it became clear that Synthetic Biology was not a well known topic or was highly controversial discussed. The team took on the task of eliminating the misinformation and to discuss the impact and safety assessment.
The team has organized a student laboratory, in which the students themselves can experience Molecular Biology. Students should learn that DNA and proteins are ordinary tools of biologists. The students have seen"

Count the colonies on each plate with fewer than 300 colonies. Multiple the colony count by the Final Dilution Factor on each plate
Results
OD600 Reference Point
According to the Reference OD600, We calculate the final result:
OD600/Abs600=3.818
All cell density readings using this instrument with the same settings and volume can be converted to OD600, so that we can use this ratio to convert subsequent experimental data.
Particle Standard Curve
We prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the Abs600 in plate reader. The size and optical characteristics of these microspheres are similar to cells, and there is a known amount of particles per volume. This measurement allows us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
The final result:
mean of med-high levels=6.24E+08
Fluorescein Standard Curve
We prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in plate reader. By measuring these we generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. We will be able to use this to convert our cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration.
Final results:
Mean µM fluorescein / a.u.=3.60E-05
MEFL / a.u.=2.17E+08

Galectin-3
We are committed to constantly improve our detection methods. While the current method uses the quorum sensing system, it is thus limited to bacteria that secrete autoinducers. Hence, we present an alternative approach for the detection of pathogens. In our alternative detection system, biomolecules are tagged with a fluorescent reporter that bind to the surface of the cell and reveal its presence.

Natural Functions of Galectin-3
Galectins are proteins of the lectin family, which possess carbohydrate recognition domains binding specifically to β-galactoside sugar residues. In humans, 10 different galantines have been identified, among which is galectin-3.  Galectin-3 has a size of about 31 kDA and is encoded by a single gene, LGALS3. It is found to have many physiological functions, such as cell adhesion, cell growth and differentiation, and contributes to the development of cancer, inflammation, fibrosis and others.
Human galectin-3 is a protein of the lectin-family that was shown to bind the LPS of multiple human pathogens. Some of them, including P. aeruginosa protect themselves against the human immune system by mimicking the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present on human erythrocytes. By making fusion proteins of galectin-3 with fluorescent reporter proteins, pathogens can be labelled and made visible by fluorescence-microscopy.

Experimental Results
Testing of Or as a Promoter
The backbone of the radiation sensor in our project relies on part BBa_K648029. This part includes the operating region Or and two promoters, one on each end of Or. In order to test the functional ability of the of the pr promoter we attached a part called mcherry, which has rfp controlled by the promoter. We used the TECAN in our lab to measure the fluorescence of our samples over time. The data collected while the samples were in exponential growth was used to determine a rate of expression of the rfp. Compared to the control, the rate of fluorescence was much higher in our test subject, about 4227 compared to 418 (fu/OD600nm). This suggests that the promoter on Or is functional.
Future Testing
As part of our reporter project focused on improving the part developed by Imperial College London iGEM 2010 (BBa_K316007) we began by characterizing their test part K316009 . The data for this test, using the standard catechol assay described by their team here is show below.
This data shows that, while their part is capable of extremely fast conversion of catachol to 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde, it is also subject to extreme input sensitivity that leads to significant results of color production seen from both induced and un-induced cells.
Much of the additional work for our project that expands on this data is still underway and due to time constraints cannot be posted before wiki freeze deadline. More characterization and testing of all the parts we are actively building is on the way and should be accomplished by the Jamboree.See our project pages for more information.

(2) Acetic acid breakdown of carbonate rock will be achieved through the production of acetic acid by E. coli. Upon treatment with acetic acid, the carbonate will become more porous and the production of CO2 will cause an increase in pressure, making the oil deposits more accessible. To produce large amounts of acetic acid, we will build a synthetic production construct with the E. coli acetogenesis enzymes PTA and ACK and the acetic acid efflux protein Aata from A. aceti13,14. We will optimize the expression of these enzymes and co-localize them with an RNA-protein scaffold19,20 to increase production and secretion of acetic acid from the cells (Fig. 3). Due to the multimeric nature of PTA and ACK, Gibson assembly will be used to rapidly assemble multiple BioBricks with different control elements (i.e. promoters and ribosomal binding sites) so to better control expression levels of the proteins used in the construct. We will characterize acetic acid production by using spectrophotometric methods to monitor cell growth in minimal media and performing pH titrations to determine acetic acid concentration in the media. Acetic acid production will be compared between cells expressing Aata and the scaffold system and cells expressing only Aata or the scaffold system. By co-localizing acetogenesis enzymes with Aata using the scaffold, the bacteria should produce larger amounts of acetic acid with limited growth effects. Although the common laboratory strain E. coli DH5α lacks certain acid tolerance mechanisms21, preliminary results show that the bacteria produce 340 mM acid on its own when grown under standard conditions. To improve acid tolerance, we will separately test the effectiveness of Aata at conferring acetic acid resistance by growing cultures of Aata-expressing cells in increasing concentrations of acetic acid to determine the inhibitory concentration of acetic acid. For industrial applications, the acetic acid secreted from the cells will be removed from the media and condensed for application to the carbonate rock, eliminating the need for direct application of bacteria to the oil deposits. The CO2 produced from the reaction of acetic acid and carbonate will be recycled by carbon fixation to continue fuelling the system.

EXECUTION
YAKULT FACTORY VISIT
Yakult yogurts (Image from here )
Based on our survey results, we found that the general public preferred to have treatment delivered through probiotics. To learn more about common probiotic strains used in foods, the culturing process of lactic acid bacteria, how the final probiotic products are manufactured, and how safety is ensured, we visited a major yogurt manufacturer, Yakult.
Yakult uses Lactobacillus casei (L. casei). Not only are there more than a hundred peer-reviewed publications involving human studies with L. casei, but Yakult was also awarded Food for Specified Health Use (FOSHU) status in Japan in 1998 (Yakult, n.d.). “FOSHU is the only type of food product (not ingredients) that can carry health claims and is composed of functional ingredients that affect the structure/function (physiological functions) of the body” (Saito, 2007).
After our visit and learning more about Yakult’s culturing and use of L. casei, we hoped to also use L. casei as a potential chassis for delivery. We obtained a pure strain of L. casei from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC) and we were able to cultured it in lab, but our attempts to transform L. casei by electroporation were unsuccessful.

At the Asia-Pacific iGEM conference, we presented our project to a group of professors and over 20 other iGEM teams.
There, we received helpful feedback about our project, and more importantly, we were able to get into contact with an expert in the field of probiotics, Dr. Ying Chieh Tsai.
Dr. Tsai is a molecular biology professor at National Yang Ming University, founder of Taiwan Association of Lactic Acid Bacteria, and former president of Asian Federation of Societies for Lactic Acid Bacteria. Prior to meeting Dr. Tsai, we were having trouble transforming L. casei. He helped us troubleshoot our transformation process, but also told us that electroporation of L. casei is uncommon in Taiwan. Instead, Dr. Tsai suggested using two other probiotic strains, Escherichia coli (E. coli) Nissle 191"

Collaboration with team Aachen
While we were working on our project, we had connected with several other iGEM teams. We  worked really well with a student team from Aachen, Germany. They had a similar topic as us, so  collaboration was easier due to common ground. Firstly, we had a few conference calls with them  and after exchanging our experience with already conducted research and preparations for iGEM, we  worked on possible ways to solve the problems we all pointed out. Furthermore we discussed other  ways of collaboration.  We helped them with their Human Practises by filling out their questionnaire  on lab organisation and also conducted several tests for them.
They were investigating the degree of GMO pollution in the laboratories we worked in, which is  indeed a valuable problem to explore. When dealing with something with such power to transform  the world as synthetic biology has, safety is very important, both in the outside world when we try to  apply our ideas to everyday lives and in the lab as well. GMO pollution in the lab is an important  question because it concerns our safety and the safety of other people we interact with, so we were  glad to be able to participate in their study.
We conducted several swab tests on different surfaces with agar chips by placing 3 on each selected  surface for 5 seconds and then placed them in petri dishes.  They were incubated at 37°C and after  24 hours we received the following results:

•prepare 250 ml of LB medium with 2% Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast  extract, 5 g Agar),
•sterilize the black chip-mould by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol,
•fill the mould with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes,
•use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings,

This is the translational unit of the 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI) from Bacillus methanolicus MGA3. It is codon optimized for E. coli.
Catalysed reaction by Phi
D-arabino-hex-3-ulose 6-phosphate → D-fructose 6-phosphate.
K1585213
This is the translational unit for the D-Xylulose-5-phosphate-phosphoketolase (Xpk). It derives from Bifidobacterium adolescentis and is codon optimized for E. coli.
Catalysed reaction by Xpk
D-Xylulose-5-phosphate + phosphate → Acetyl-phosphate + D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
K1585310
This is the translational unit of GlgA (Glycogen synthase), codon-optimized for E.coli. The enzyme elongates linear glycogen chains by using ADP-glucose units and forming α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Through autophosphorylation, GlgA is also the starting point of glycogen synthesis in bacteria.
Usage and Biology
The construct was confirmed by sequencing. Moreover, the expression of glgA was tested by a SDS-PAGE. In the picture below, you can see that glgA is expressed in strains containing BBa_K1585310 in a pSB1K30 expression vector.
SDS-PAGE of GlgA in comparison to mRFP
After induction with IPTG at OD=0.6, glgA was expressed. Samples were taken 6 and 18.5 hours after induction. The small arrows indicates the expected bands for GlgA. mRFP in pSB1K30 (T7 promoter) was used as the negative control.
On top of that, the function of the construct was proven by an iodine staining with BL21 Gold (DE3) and BL21 Gold (DE3) expressing glgA in pSB1K30. The iodine staining is performed with Lugol's iodine which dyes glycogen resulting in a"

So far, we have 18 amplified genes of interest, six of which are      cloned in yeast and the rest is still in the sequencing stage. After      the first round of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have found some      peptides that potentially bind the six genes cloned in yeast, which      will be further tested for confirmation. We have also constructed a      new peptide library.We presented these results at the symposium      of the Goettingen Center for Molecular Biosciences and received      feedback from the researchers of the institute.Now we are      organizing the SynBio Day in our city on the 15th of August,      following what was discussed at the team meetup held in Munich:      we will have a boot in the city center of Goettingen where we will      talk to pedestrians and answer the questions they may have about      synthetic biology. We will also have some activities where people      can win some prices from one of our sponsors.
Many biochemical and biological events can take place when two      molecules interact with each other. Our screening method is,      generally speaking, a way to find new molecules with potential      biological applications. This pipeline should allow other researchers      to select novel biological parts that interact with their protein(s) of      interest, and which can be further refined to increase specificity      and modified to add functionalities.In our project, the selected      peptides will be attached to a fluorescent tag and submitted to      the biological part registry. However, the modifications are not      restricted to a fluorescent tag: radioactively labeled compounds,      attachment of different functional groups and immunoactive tags,      among others, are also options that can be explored.

BCCS-Bristol,2009,Team:BCCS-Bristol#BSim_-_-_TEXT.html," an important part in many biological systems. BSim allows the user to specify an arbitrary chemical field and use this to realistically interact with the bacterial behaviour. It is also possible to simulate the diffusion of larger molecules as particle fields, as well as allowing bacteria to move along a chememotactic gradient.
Growth and Replication
BSim features a basic model of bacterial growth where bacteria grow according to a surface area parameter. Bacteria in the simulations can be defined to replicate when reaching a set threshold radius.
Multiple populations
Multiple bacteria or other particles can be defined in one simulation. This is done by defining a list for each different particle type, this allows for defining custom behaviours for the different populations.
GRN modelling
BSim allows the user to specify complex GRNS based on ODEs and apply these to individual bacteria to analyse GRN effects on a population level. It is now possible to analyse the effects of individual GRNs on a population level, all within the same context.
Robust, modular components
BSim 2009 has been designed to allow maximum flexibility in simulation design while keeping the deep coding behind-the-scenes. All components can be used individually or in arbitrary combinations allowing the end user to quickly create advanced simulations without necessarily having previous Java programming experience. The source code is freely available and extensively referenced and commented, so new modules can quickly be addded if necessary for a specific simulation.
Versatile, customisable logging and visual output
Everything that can be specified by the user within a simulation can be logged to a file readable by MATLAB, Excel and other numerical analysis packages. The user can specify time intervals, formatting and what to output for all types of loggers. In addition, visual output is available, both directly to the screen and to image/movie files.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html," 2014, and also to generate data and compare affinity of the GFP-CBD and the future proteins that we will fuse with CBD in our project.
Kombucha growing protocol
We got some old Kombucha from Juan Manuel García Arcos (iGEM team from 2014 and manager of the Open Science School).
We grew the kombucha as it follows:
800mL of ddH2O heated up
Add 100g of brown sugar and let dissolve
Add 3 sachets of green tea and let them infuse until it cools down (under 30ºC!)
Add 100mL of cider vinegar
Add 200mL of starter culture (commercial kombucha in juice)
Add a big piece of kombucha culture
Grow at 30ºC without shacking!
Preparation of the crude lysate for phusion protein assays
The first thing was to grow a 20ml inocule of the strain carrying the GFP-CBD protein, in our case it was the strain FS_S2, which is transformed with the part BBa_K1321357, submitted by the Imperial College team in 2014. Chloramphenicol (Crm) was added, since the plasmid carrying this part has Cm resistance.
Following we used the 20ml of such preculture as inocule of 1L of media, and let them grow overnight.
The cells grown overnight were collected by centrifuging at 4000rpm during 20min. They were then resuspended in 10ml of PBS, and collected again to remove all the residual media.
The remaining cells were resuspended in B-PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent, from Thermo Scientific. 4ml per gram of cells.
Incubated for 15mins and centrifuged 5minuetes at 15000rpm.
The supernatant was recovered and the GFP-CBD detected in it by looking at the fluorescence of the sample.
Then the cell lysates were stored at 4C until the day of the assay.
Week 1st-7th August
Preparation of the 96-well plates
The 96 wells plates where we will measure the fluorescence of the GFP-CBD have to treated with cellulose in order to retain the CBDs and carry out the experiment.
In order to do that we mixed 6.4g of pure cellulose (435236-250G, Sigma-Aldrich) in 40ml of distilled water, to fill two 96 wells plates (with black plates for fluorescence measurement). Since the cellul"

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

This week, we began to think about our thesis again. Whew. A few of us began reorganizing the information we needed to write about to make the paper more clear. We also had a meeting at the end of the week about expectations for writing during the coming week.
After finding out about the IRB, we applied for exemption. We then found out that we would have to revise our questionnaires. Appropriate changes were made and the application was submitted again (this happens several more times in the next week or so).
Some of us considered different design and selectable marker options to test integration of genes into the yeast genome. We learned that one of our steps lacks a reliable selectable marker test, but that replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty.
Our several lab groups worked tirelessly to make more media, to check for deletions in plasmids, and to design primers that actually work.
Now that we have lox-URA3-lox, linearized pUC19, and amplified homologous arms, we are able to begin Gibson Assembly. We did two gibsons this week. The first Gibson includes the parts mentioned above and the second is our linearized pXRL2 along with several gene fragments: ADR, FDX, Delta7H, p450SCC, and 3BH. After combining the neccessary components with the Gibson Master Mix, we put it in the PCR machine for an hour and then stored it on ice. The following day we inoculated the gibson products on high copy LB-AMP plates. The pUC19 plate grew normally but the pXRL2 plate lawned.
We then picked colonies from the pUC19 plate and transformed it in liquid cultures. We then performed colony PCR to check if our Gibson assembly was successful. It likely did not work. The gel showed very bright bands in the wrong areas but a faint band where our desired product would be. With this information, we made streak plates of the potential successful colonies in hopes to isolate what we believe to be our desired gibson product and threw the rest of the cultures out.
Once we created a gel with clear, distinct bands for DNA extraction, we tried using the Bioline Isolate II PCR and Gel kit to retrieve the DNA from our agarose gel. At first we used a different binding buffer than the one provided in the kit, but the final extraction had a high salt concentration"

Mag-receiver
Qingdian Mu did PCR identification of pQE-L*H, pQE-HL, pSB-ftnA and pSB-HL, no target bands. The sequencing of pQE-ftnA shows that the result sequence doesn‘t match the correct one.
Circuits 1 to 6 was under construction by Cun Wei and Qingdian Mu, the main problems were that more than one bands appeared after amplificating Gibson product, ligation was failed even with gel extraction.
Renjie Shang succeed in ferritin purification, proved by SDS-PAGE. To achieve an optimal induction concentration for Pet28a harboring ftnA, Jie Lian designed more IPTG concentration gradient from 0.1mM to 1mM. Considering the expression quantity and toxic damage to cell, we decided the final induction concentration as 0.8mM.
Jie Lian examined the supernate and purification product with Prussian blue staining and native-page. There was no color change for the concentration of samples was low.
Thermo-regulator
Zhuo Pan did PCR to get seg 1 to seg 5 fragments. Xihan Zhang did the agarose gel electrophoresis of five fragments and digested pSB1C3 to estimate the concentrations. Five fragment and the backbone were assembled by Gibson assembly. Xihan Zhang did the transformation and the bacterium were spread out on the plate with arabinose. The colony turned green on the plate. However, there no target bands on the gel after PCR identification. Besides, we transformed the plasmid into DH10B, the strain doesn’t turn green anymore. We failed to construct the T7 platform. We thought that there was incomplete plasmid containing GFP in E.coli, that’s why the strains turned green.

When the aptamer (ligand-binding) region of the fluoride riboswitch interacts with fluoride, the terminator is not formed allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and transcribe the downstream gene.
Figure 2: Schematic of a transcriptional riboswitch
2015 Exeter iGEM Team, RNA Riboswitches
The riboswitch we used is from the previously characterized B. cereus. In Figure 3 we have displayed the crystal structure of the aptamer of this riboswitch. We tested two variations of this riboswitch, which we labeled FRS1 and FRS2. Figure 4a shows the predicted folding structure of FRS1, and Figure 4b shows the predicted folding structure of FRS2. We were interested in determining how the predicted folding structure may influence the binding ability of this riboswitch to fluoride.
In nature, this riboswitch regulates the expression of genes that are able to pump high levels of fluoride out of the cell. The crcB gene in E.coli bacteria encodes the fluoride efflux channel, which is capable of pumping fluoride out of the cell so that it is no longer toxic. In our experiments, we used a modified crcB E.coli strain so that fluoride may accumulate in the cell.

Our Design
We modified the previously developed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP) by the 2017 East Chapel Hill iGem. We used Gibson overhangs with homology to pSB1A3 so we could clone the operon into the pSB1A3 vector. This operon was designed so that future users may easily test a library of promoters and riboswitches simply by cutting with restriction enzyme HindIII. One may even test the expression of a new gene by using the XhoI restriction enzyme.

The Adventure of Baxter Bacteria
Overview
Changing the world starts  with little things. Even little people. That was our idea in teaching youngsters about Synthetic Biology. We wanted to dispel myths and stigmas along with fears about what people think Synthetic Biology is. Since the unknown is what is the most likely to scare, we wanted to educate the children in our neighborhood about what Synthetic Biology is, why it's not scary and why we think it's REALLY COOL.
At the Orem Public Library, we taught 5-10 year olds the basics of biology. What is a virus? What is a plasmid? What is bacteria? We showed them what they are and how we can use them to do amazing things.
Since we were at a Public Library, we of course had to read a book! Our fun story about Baxter Bacteria and his adventures reinforced the principles that we had taught them. They laughed when the plasmid gave Baxter ""powers"" and cheered when Baxter made it home safe.
By the end of the book reading, the kids were ready to make their very own projects. With the aid of one of our team members, ten groups of children made their way to the stage to show off the projects they thought of with the poster they drew themselves. All the presentations were very exciting, as no idea was a bad one.

Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us,"

Collaborations
Waterloo collaboration
This year, we had the opportunity to collaborate with the iGEM team from the University of Waterloo. We were asked to aid in the  construction of three large DNA cassettes into one plasmid.
In order to do so, the uOttawa iGEM team designed a set of primers (6 total) to amplify out each of the DNA cassettes, with overhangs to be used for our labs version of overlap extension PCR. A protocol was written for the uWaterloo team. We also were able to discuss and advise its design and construction.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," we believe that the use of a keratinase-expressing bacterial system will be a more effective way of dealing with keratin waste, as well as a more environmentally friendly option. One of the benefits for our construct opposed to other methods is how environmentally friendly it is. Methods like incineration and burial on site both contribute to to the growing greenhouse gas emissions problem. Not only does burial of waste aid in the release of greenhouse gases, it can also result in leachate. Unfortunately, these procedures only aim to remove keratin waste and don’t consider the detrimental impacts it has on the environment. Not only do we believe that our project will offer an environmentally conscious approach to degrading hair, but our team plans to take its use one step further through the creation of a useful protein product. Within the bioreactors, a sludge is formed as a byproduct of the degradation, and from our research throughout the year, we discovered that the sludge is formed by the same elements that make up fertilizers and animal feed. Once we completed our research on sludge, we finalized our integrative plan to collect the sludge inside a bioreactor and then ship it off to be created into useful protein products. After careful consideration, our team has come to the conclusion that the best way to collect the sludge would be through a skimming method. In contrast to the current processing, the implementation of our construct focuses on the recycling of material opposed to its removal. This aspect of our project is very important to our team because we wanted to not only develop a process that bypasses the harmful environmental effects, but also creates a nutrient-rich high-quality protein-product.

Motivation
In the universe observed by human, the Earth is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful planets, but the land on which we live is gradually dying.Soil, as a resource that is difficult to regenerate, its importance is irreplaceable and self-evident. As the main area of human activities on the surface of the earth and natural filtration devices, land naturally bears most of the pollutants. In China, more than one-tenth of the cultivated land is polluted. Soil pollution has seriously affected the sustainable development of food safety and agriculture, and has become a major obstacle to solving the world food problem.
According to China's demonstration project, the average cost of conventional restoration methods for cultivated land restoration is 75 million yuan/km sup>2, and the minimum cost is 45 million yuan/km2[1] . The repair cycle is based on 15 years, and it is conservatively estimated to be governed by 2020. The capital requirement for repairing 6667 km 2 of cultivated land is 66.7 billion yuan [2] .
Conventional repair methods are costly, so the application of synthetic biology methods gives microbes good degradation characteristics, making bioremediation an economical and effective option. We want to apply our expertise to protect this planet.
However, in the existing research,
E. coli
is the main research substrate. The
E.coli
is an animal-inhabited bacteria that is difficult to proliferate in a natural environment with varying conditions [3] . Therefore, we intend to transform a new microorganism as a site for environmental restoration,
Pseudomonas fluorescens pf-5
.
Why we chose
P. fluorescens pf-5
First, it belongs to the genus Pseudomonas.The members of the genus demonstrate a great deal of metabolic diversity and consequently are able to colonize a wide range of niches. These give it an incredible ability of biosynthesis and bioremediation [4] .
P. fluorescens Pf-5
has this unparalleled advantage in heterologous expression.
Second, many of the representatives of the genus Pseudomonas are pathogenic [5] , such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Explore the MARS Repository
When the team began designing the MARS Repository, we wanted to base it on the principles behind most complex synthetic biology protocols.
We began by generalizing synthetic biology protocols into three key stages:
Isolation: Acquiring the desired genetic material
Modification: Manipulated or processing genetic material
Quantification: Measuring the success of the previous two stages
These stages “fit” together to form the entirety of the protocols that are carried out everyday in synthetic biology labs.
In the existing fields of microfluidics, each of these stages is taken care of on individual chips. However, when it comes time to replicate a full synbio procedure using these chips - it becomes difficult to “fit” them together realistically. This is due to the fact that most chips:
Fabrication using different and complicated techniques such as soft lithography
Operated using varying hardware
Lack thorough documentation required to run them
Do not have easily accessible design files
Furthermore, the majority of these chips are highly specialised to specific experimental protocols. As a result, they are not relevant in the context of day-to-day procedures in most synthetic biology labs.
After consultation with researchers at BU’s Biological Design Center, we were able to identify nine essential synthetic biology protocols and generalize them into these three categories. After confirming that this chip selection was relevant with an iGEM team poll, we moved on to designing and iterating on chips. The resulting design files, fabrication instructions and usage protocols are housed here - easily accessible to synbiologists and structured in a standardised workflow.

Pour notre modélisation, on considère le sang comme un ‘’’fluide newtonien possédant une vitesse Vmax constante au cours du temps’’’.  On néglige ici, les à-coups cardiaques et les flux turbulents liés aux cavités de l’épithélium sanguin.
Le vecteur cellulaire se déplace selon deux axes. Un axe X dans le sens du flux sanguin et un axe Y, orthogonal à l’axe X.
