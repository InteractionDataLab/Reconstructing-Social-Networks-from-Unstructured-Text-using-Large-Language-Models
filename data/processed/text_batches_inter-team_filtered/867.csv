UCL,2018,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," our “Intein Passenger”. We also had a discussion with Dr. Chris Myers about his research in genetic circuits. He brought up the importance of modularity in Synthetic Biology, which further encouraged us to change the direction of our project. Together with Yelena Petrovskaya, a UCL psychology student, the data from the psychological study was analysed using ANOVA.
Wet Lab Overview
Based on our discussion with Bolt Threads, we focused our effort into our intein RFP and GFP constructs. We tried different methods simultaneously. As it can be seen from our gel, our initial Gibson Assembly gave very smeared bands. The bands were excised however they resulted in very low DNA concentrations which could not be used. We also attempted a cell-free expression of RFP which did not work.
Week 22 (September 17 - September 21)
Dry Lab Overview
We went to Open Cell to approach some start-ups. The ones which inspired us, and were most relevant, included WASE-tech and IndiCo. WASE is working on water filtration, they told us about their vision to use bacterial biofilms in the future to clean water in a natural manner. Alternatively, IndiCo was developing bacterial patterning of clothing. The pigment was patterned onto the textiles, this made us wonder about whether chromoproteins could be used to functionalise spider silk and apply colour directly.
As we are having some issues integrating our animations into the Wiki format we contacted Florin, team member of UCL’s2017 iGEM team, to help us.  This week we also had our great London collaboration with other universities. We troubleshooted with King’s College, Imperial College and Westminster.
Wet Lab Overview
Gibson Assembly of RFP, GFP and Intein Passenger were successful! They were transformed into DH5α, mini-prepped, digested with BsaI and the results can be seen below. The bands correspond to the correct sizes of our GFP, RPF and Intein Passenger constructs and the samples were sent for sequencing. The sequencing results for RFP and Intein Passenger came back positive, however GFP contains an additional sequence in between part 1 and 2.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," constructed utilizing PCR and synthesized using In vitro transcription and translation kit and their catalytic activity towards N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate were tested. The reaction kinetics were measured using the spectrophotometer as a decrease of absorbance. Figure 4 displays the relative hydrolysis speed of each mutant generated. As seen from these results, a variety of mutants, showing different catalysis speeds were produced. Some of the amino acids changes affected the activity drastically, for example Trp224 to Tyr, Lys227 to Arg or Glu509 to Lys. Other, in silico designed mutations only modulated the activity Asn107 to Asp or Glu194 to Ala. Additionally, large 8 amino acid deletion at position Pro348-Hy356 caused only a moderate decrease in enzymes activity. These results conclude, that a control library of various activity esterase mutants were generated which we can now use to test the viability of overall CAT-Seq system and can be employed for screening of various strength regulatory.
Regulatory sequence library
In order to prove the viability of CAT-Seq approach as a method for highthroutput regulatory sequence screening and orthogonality measurements a mock library, consisting of 4 ribosomes binding sites (BBa_B0030, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0034, BBa_K2621038) and 9 toehold riboswitch variants based on Green et al., 2014 were designed.
Ribosome binding sites
To investigate the potential of CAT-Seq regulatory sequence screening, 4 ribosome binding sites have been utilized upstream of the esterase gene.  The strength of each ribosome binding site was investigated by expressing the esterase enzyme using the In vitro transcription and translation kit and spectrophotometrically measuring the as a decrease of absorbance due to the hydrolysis of substrate nucleotides.
Figure 5. Relative activity esterase enzyme expressed using different RBS sites.      CAT-Seq esterase mutant sequences were placed under 4 different RBS control. The enzyme was synthesised using cell free expression system and catalytic activity of each generated variant was measured spectrophotometrically as a decrease of substrate absorbance at 310 nm. The shown data is normalized to Bba_B0034 RBS activity.
The figure 5 displays the relative hydrolysis speed (normalized to BBa_B0034) of CAT-Seq esterase expressed using 4 different ribosome binding sites. Based on the fact that the same enzyme and substrate nucleotide concentration are used, the difference in"

Dominican Republic Trip | March 30 - April 6, 2018
Summary Points
Would our project be relevant in real-life situations?
How can we improve our project to address critical needs in developing nations?
How dire is the water crisis?
Is there a detection mechanism already available? Is it specific? Is it inexpensive?
Impact of drinking water from contaminated sources.
Several Lambert iGEM alumni and current members traveled to the Dominican Republic, specifically the city of Hato Mayor, to work on a water filtration project.
We met with Dr. Rainyer from the Ministry of Health; Dr. Rainyer emphasized the lack of practical mechanisms available to detect waterborne diseases in contaminated water sources. According to Dr. Rainyer, there is no proactive treatment mechanism available for waterborne diseases in the city of Hato Mayor. After informing him about our project, Dr. Rainyer stated that having an efficient, inexpensive detection tool would be extremely useful for field testing. As a result, we decided to focus on using frugal science as a means to address the funding issues for non-government organizations.
A majority of the residents living in Hato Mayor did not have access to clean, drinking water and buying bottled water was a financial burden. While installing water filters, iGEM members had the opportunity to speak to the residents living in Hato Mayor.
Buying bottled water cost on average 60% of a families annual income, a financial burden. Since many of the residents did not have access to transportation, they would have to pay for the costly trip.
Megan Hong, Lambert iGEM member describes her experience: When we traveled to the village by Hato Mayor, we were instantly surprised by the amount of trash filling the streets, homes, and water sources. Without direct access to clean drinking water, the residents of the village had to travel about 20 miles out of their way to the city in order to obtain bottled water. We installed 12 water filters throughout the area, which would help to serve over 50 people. While we implemented these systems and taught the locals how to use and clean the filter, the residents talked about how much the clean water would impact their lives in a positive way.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html,".  This will most likely be designed as a closed environment in order to eliminate other sources of light that could potentially trigger the sensor.  The concept of light dependent resistors was also discussed, however after further research it was discovered that the level of sensitivity of these components may not be at the level necessary for the device.  Although we do not yet have specific numbers on how luminescence the reporter is, we are not currently pursuing this proposed option.  We are planning on purchasing an Arduino Uno and several light sensors to begin testing and quantifying the effectiveness of the different components.  In the next week we are hoping that the proposed reporter will be ready to test that aspect of the system and determine which sensor and process will be the most effective to determine if the signal is present.  Additionally the modelling team prepared a presentation on light emission and importance that it could have on our project and how we are planning on designing the higher level device with a light sensor and a digitized device.  In parallel to ourresearch regarding the reporter and the light sensors, we have been continuing to explore Maya and Matlab ensuring our skills will be ready in time for when data from our system becomes available to model.
Week 8: June 23rd - June 27th
This week we continued extensive research regarding filters and light sensors along with any other necessary components we need to purchase such as the Arduino microcontroller.  We have also begun designing experimental conditions for testing the brightness of the chosen reporter and the sensitivity of the light sensor itself.  After this testing occurs to determine the ideal brightness of the reporter and the sensitivity is determined, we will be able to optimize the device and the amount of reporter that is necessary to trigger the light sensor and consequential voltage.  We continued to research different options of sensors, and what we would additionally need for our device circuit including resistors and other circuit elements.  The option of using light filters was also explored and we looked into the three main types (used in robots): the coloured gel filter, interference filter, and dichroic filter.
Coloured gel filter is made by mixing dyes into a plastic base. Depending on what dye is used, only a certain band of wavelengths can pass through the filter. It is the cheapest out of the three, but the least accurate one. Interference filter is made of several chemical layers. Each layer blocks a certain range of wavelengths so only a very small range of wavelengths can pass through. It is more accurate than gel filter (because the range of wavelengths allowed through can be made really small), but expensive. Dichroic filter is made of organic d"

Furthermore they explored our idea by thinking about the development of a chip that could be put inside an animal to constantly monitor the presence of certain diseases.
Discussing the rol of synthetic biology in society
After the discussions in smaller groups, we opened a general discussion about the use of synthetic biology in society. Thereby we asked them what they would think is necessary to bridge the gap between the researcher and the society.  One of the solutions that was opted, further explored the concept of transparency. People proposed to make schooling of the public (and government) better on one side, and suggested to make explanation and openness better at the end of the researcher. Thereby they saw a critical role for the media. They supported eduction via the use of newspapers and renown television shows in the Netherlands such as 'De Wereld Draait Door'.
Another conclusion was that it makes a big difference how the device is presented to the public. They stated that the term “genetical enhancement” sounds much less repelling than “genetical manipulation”. Also the focus may be shifted from only risks to a more general view that also emphasizes the benefits of using genetically engineered organisms. The researcher should make the consumer feel safe to use a product. This could, for example, be done through extensive testing and the addition of a safety system.
Thereby they affirmed that the debate about this topic should be kept going.  We should not force anybody to accept the use of GMOs, but people should also not hinder development in this area because they don’t like it. Either side should respect each other’s opinion.
Human Outreach: Approaching the future generation
Debating ethics and synthetic biology with future biomedical engineering students
To approach the next generation of chemical biologists, we presented about iGEM on the matchings-days of the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e). Therefore we prepared a talk about first of all synthetic biology, but also about what the iGEM-competition encompasses. We presented several projects that have been done in the iGEM-competition the last couple of years (Groningen 2012, Münich 2013 and Wageningen 2014). Also we introduced them to last year’s project of the TU/e and described to them how we will take this project as a starting point for our own project.
Ethics forms an important aspect of our project and therefore we encouraged the students to take part in a discussion about the use of GMOs in the human body. Therefore we posed them several"

The diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured in triplicate. Green corresponds to pBBRBB::gfp, blue to pBBRBB::merRTPAB, and red to pBBRBB::merΔmerA. Individual constructs range from highest resistance in the following order: merRTPAB > vector control >merΔmerA.  Our results show that both the recombinant E. coli and Pseudomonas putida containing the pBBRBB::mer plasmid were able to grow significantly closer to the HgCl2 disc than the negative control (pBBRBB::GFP). The E.coli strain containing the merA deletion plasmid could not survive as close to the heavy metal spotted disc as the negative control. This is likely due to the fact that it still contains the transport proteins MerP and MerT, and therefore transports the toxic mercury ions into the cell without remediating it due to the lack of MerA, causing cell death. On the other hand, the pBBRBB::GFP control was not able to take up any mercury ions.
Methylmercury Results
Methylmercury degradation rates were measured for ‘’E.coli K12’’ strains carrying the pBBRBB::’’mer'' plasmid compared to a vector control (pBBRBB::’’gfp’’), abiotic encapsulation beads, and abiotic medium. Negative controls were included to determine the amount of methylmercury absorbed by the beads and abiotic degradation rate of methyl mercury. Methylmercury chloride was added to all tubes at a final concentration of 1 mg/L. Methylmercury concentrations were measured over a period of 24 hours. At each time point the samples were diluted a million-fold before taking measurements with a Tekran model 2700 Automated Methyl Mercury Analyzer. ’’E.coli K12’’ strains carrying the pBBRBB::’’mer'' plasmid degraded methylmercury to levels below detection of the Tekran Analyzer after approximately 4 hours while the vector control showed only a slight decrease (similar to that for abiotic beads). Low amounts of degradation in abiotic medium are likely due to photolysis of the organomercury.

We also were interested in whether these laboratories use living cells for their measurements.             Some measurements are performed with living cells, so our biological approach could indeed be used in medical laboratories.
Regarding Dr. Josef van Helden, the best solution for a melatonin measurement would be a device that could be placed in the doctor's office.             The point of care diagnostic is a growing market, but there is no device yet, that allows to instantaneous measurements of melatonin.
Dr. Acuña Castroviejo
Prof. Dr. Dario Acuña
Talking with the expert in melatonin research
Prof. Dr. Dario Acuña works at the University of Granada in Spain and is the leading scientist in the field of melatonin research.             He was the first researcher who investigated melatonin and its effects in the 1980s. During our research,             we read many of his scientific papers. Therefore, we wanted to interview him.
Due to the interview, we decided to use saliva samples for melatonin measurement.             Moreover, it marked the start of our hardware project.
First of all, we discussed current melatonin measurement methods.             The most common methods are ELISA, HPLC and UPLC combined with mass spectrometry.             Depending on the sample fluid (blood, saliva or urine) each method has its benefits and drawbacks.             Whereas ELISA works perfectly for melatonin metabolites in urine, it is not as specific in blood or saliva.             There again, HPCL is often used for high levels of melatonin in blood. These high levels, however, only occur rarely.             Dr. Acuña stated that mass spectrometry is the most accurate technique but is yet very expensive compared to ELISA and HPLC.             Mass spectrometry is not a standard detection method and therefore only few laboratories can use this sensitive technique.
Accordingly, we asked about the best fluid to measure the melatonin level.             He explained that saliva would be the best one, as it contains about 30% of the melatonin concentration in blood.             Using saliva instead of blood is better for the patients as it is non-invasive. Urine only contains metabolites of melatonin             and is not as accurate.
Furthermore, we learned about the process of measuring the melatonin levels.             Usually, Dr. Acuna takes six samples of saliva of one patient and uses five assays of ELISA.             It takes about one to two days from taking the samples to having the results."

UCSF_UCB,2014,Team:UCSF UCB#project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," another behavior pattern, bimodal response, which means when stimulated, the whole cell group differentiates into two subgroups - one of them activated while the other one remains in OFF state.
Circuit Design: This is the circuit we designed to achieve bimodal response. Based on the primary secrete-sense circuit, we add a positive feedback, and a degradation factor Bar1. The strength of positive feedback can be tuned by doxycycline concentration, and the strength of degradation factor can be tuned by changing pTEF promoter in front of Bar1, which we characterized experimentally.
Modeling Formula: In order to describe the dynamic of extracellular alpha factor concentration, we build a deterministic model based on this formula.
The first two terms represents generation of alpha factor: the first is the basal synthesis, and the second describes the positive feedback for generating alpha factor. We use sigmoidal form based on our pre-experiment results. The last two terms represents degradation of alpha factor. In this circuit, Bar1 is constitutively expressed, and the degradation of alpha factor by Bar1 is of first-order. The last term is natural degradation.
If we define this formula as the driving force, then the negative value of its integration can be defined as potential.
Modeling Results: Assuming the basal synthesis of alpha factor is zero, we plot the secretion term and degradation term against concentration of alpha factor respectively.
Tuning the parameters to change the strength of positive feedback and degradation term, when extracellular alpha factor concentration stops changing at last, there are three fixed points – among which two are stable and one is unstable judged from Jacobian matrix. By calculating the potential (defined above), we correspond two of fixpoints to the two potential barriers where cells may gather. Thus a bimodal response appears.
Parameter Tuning: In this model, the strength of positive feedback changes by tuning V, while the strength of Bar1 degradation changes by tuning deltaBar1. So, we set a range for these two parameters to see under which condition bimodal response appears. This figure shows tuning deltaBar1, the slope of the degradation line. For different values, the pattern is distinctive. Along with its decrease, the potential difference between the barrier and that of the well decreases, which means cells may have a bigger probability to jump out of the well by stochastic events, causing the bimodal pattern to collapse.
This figure shows the results of tuning V, the highest value of secretion curve. Also, along with its decrease, the trend is similar with changing deltaBar1, resulting in difficulty maintaining bimodal response within a cell"
Waterloo,2018,Team:Waterloo#Societal Considerations_-_-_TEXT.html,"lose is metabolized by E.coli, it produces acetate which perturbs the growth of E.coli, but acts as the carbon source for S. cerevisiae. This interdependence between the two organisms limits the ratios that the two exist at, which directly affects the proportions of intermediates and products produced. The use of our optogenetic system provides a solution to this issue, as it gives dynamic control over the ratios between the two bacterium and can maximize the efficiency of this process. In addition, the dynamic capabilities of our system allows for quick and simple correction of population levels when one step is either falling behind or speeding up.

Application: Industrial Hydrogen Production
    Hydrogen could be the clean energy source that powers the future. The first commercial hydrogen-powered trains have just begun to work in Germany, and liquid hydrogen is often used as a propellant for rockets. Driving production costs down could help realize this future, and co-cultures could help us attain lower costs. Multiple studies have shown that hydrogen can be produced using renewable resources by microbes, and co-cultures often dramatically increase production rates across a multitude of microbial pairings. Like any co-culture system, maintaining a balance between populations is incredibly difficult, and the implementation of our system could help this industry overcome a major hurdle in the attempt to scale. This application may be restricted if innovation of new products that demand hydrogen does not occur, but even the existing expanding market is reason enough to drive production costs down"
Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"We divided the questionnaire into three parts: the first one collected information about the participant's profile; the second part asked the participant about his reaction to air pollution and his knowledge of the different pollutants and sources of pollution; and the last one finally focused on the knowledge of the subject on synthetic biology and its acceptance of solutions using this branch of biology.
Spread of the survey
We have used the following method to spread the questionnaire around the world.
We began by sharing the questionnaire on social networks (facebook, twitter), but we soon realized that this method would be insufficient to obtain representative results. Indeed, after 500 responses, we had 90% of responses from young people (18-26 years) in Europe.
Participants profile
We obtained the following participants profiles:

Design of a representative sample in Europe
After discussions with our partners from UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team, we concluded that our results had a problem of representativeness, particularly about the age repartition. But our survey had the advantage of having many participants. So, we decided to extract a subsample of our survey, that would be representative of the European population.
According to Eurostat, whose main responsibilities are to provide statistical information to the institutions of the European Union (EU) and to promote the harmonisation of statistical methods across its member states, we had the following repartition of the European population in 2016.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," A special type of bomb is particularly susceptible to spontaneous detonation. These are bombs designed to not explode on impact, but up to 144 hours afterwards. These were mostly used in WWII on industrial areas like the Ruhr Area. On impact, an ampoule filled with acetone is broken, which slowly degrades a piece of celluloid which holds a needle in place. This needle will hit the detonation mechanism when released, causing the explosion.  However, this often has not worked as planned, and the bombs remain unexploded, with the risk of the needle coming off and causing detonating at a random moment.
Besides discussing the work of Mr. Lenz, we also discussed the TNT-sensing module of our project. Since land mines are not a real issue anymore in Europe (except from former Yugoslavia) and therefore not in the field of expertise of Mr. Lenz, we mostly discussed the detection of unexploded bombs. This kind of bombs is hermetically closed to keep water out, so Mr. Lenz was skeptical of the chances of TNT leaking out of the bombs, which is a necessity for our project. The types of bombs Mr. Lenz usually encounters have very thick metal casings (6 mm and thicker) and although they rust, it is very rare that corrosion forms spots where TNT can leak out. However, he mentioned that “a free lying bomb might emit some gaseous TNT, which can be detected, although it has very low concentration.” Another opportunity for TNT to leak out is through cracks in the bomb shell, which can arise when the bomb is dropped on a hard surface. Unfortunately for us, this is quite exceptional. Yet another way of the bomb emitting TNT is under stress our partial explosion, but this is very rare.
We can conclude from this that our TNT-sensing module will probably not be very suitable for the detection of unexploded ordnance. However, there are still possibilities for the detection of other kinds of explosives, which are not sealed that well.

BIT-China,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Logic Gate, as an essential part of Synthetic biological circuit, is an application of synthetic biology where biological parts are designed to perform logical functions mimicking those in electronic networks. For example, we can refer to the state “Active” as binary number “1”, while the state “Inhibit” as “0”.We can switch those different states by adding a measurable element so that a gene circuit can be accomplished. By constructing layered logic gates, we can design a genetic lock simulating electronic ones to protect strains. The truth table for an AND gate is shown in Fig.1-1.
We designed a transcriptional 2-input AND gate, in which one input promoter drives the expression of an activator and the second input promoter drives the expression of a chaperone protein. The chaperone is required by the activator to turn on the output promoter. The protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions is shown in Fig.1-2.
1.2 IDEA AND DESIGN
We all understand that logic gates must meet our requirements. Thus we used some clever ways to construct them. First, the gate must contain various parts in order to build multiple orthogonal gates. Second, the inputs and outputs of the gate should have a common signal carrier that enables them to be layered (the former output are expected to be the latter input). In transcriptional circuits, the inputs and the outputs are promoters. We have designed a transcriptional double-input AND gate, in which one input promoter drives the expression of an activator while the other input promoter drives the expression of a chaperone protein. The chaperone is demanded when the activator turns on the output promoter. Output promoter is active only when both input promoters are expressed. In other words, if one want to keep transcription factor active, both gate should be activated, too.
Pathway of the layered logic gate system is shown in Fig.1-3.The system is a multilayer logic gates composed by a variety of signaling molecules, which can simulate digital locks or electronic locks. This system consists of three Sensors, an integrated circuit and a reporter gene.
Firstly, We artificially synthesised the genes of ipgC( BBa_K1325000 ),mxiE( BBa_K1325001 ),sicA*( BBa_K1325002 ),invF( BBa_K1325003 ),pipaH*( BBa_K1325004 ) and psicA ( BBa_K1325005 ). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of gene ipgC, mxiE, sicA*, invF, pipaH*"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Recombinant_-_-_TEXT.html,"), 50 µl of ABTS substrate (0.5 mg/ ml in ABTS-bufer from Roche) and 50 µl of laccase, diluted 1:100, were incubated. The absorbance at 405 nm was then recorded over the time in a 96-well plate.  The change in absorbance over time is shown for every condition as the average of three measurements with standard deviation. The resulting plot shows that there is an optimum for the pH which is around 5. This matches the acidic conditions present in the apoplast of the plant, which is mainly between pH 5 and pH 6.5, so localizing the enzyme in the interspace between cell wall and membrane is theoretically possible.
Figure 16: Reaction of Laccase with ABTS in different pH buffers. Absorbance curve with laccase on the left; control with PBS on the right
Influence of ionic strength
Beside the substrate dependence and the influence of the pH value, the dependence of the Laccase on the ionic strength of the media was of interest for our project as well as is is for further users of this BioBrick. We thus incubated the recombinant laccase (1:100 dilution) with ABTS substrate and various concentrations of sodium chloride. This was done in triplicates and for a control without the enzyme with PBS instead.
Figure 17: Reaction of laccase with ABTS at different salt concentrations. Absorbance curve with laccase on the left; control with PBS on the right
As it can clearly be seen the enzymatic activity is increasing with decreasing salt concentration. For a detailed analysis of the results please look at our enzyme modelling page .
Influence of the temperature
Figure 18: Reaction of laccase with ABTS at different temperatures
To analyze the temperature dependency of the laccase we determined the katalytic activity with a 1:100 enzyme dilution and 0.12 mM of the substrate ABTS. The enzymatic conversion could be followed by the absorbance of the resulting product at 405 nm. The enzyme and substrate were both incubated at the specific temperatures for half an hour before starting the reaction.  As expected the enzymes efficiency is increasing with temperature, but it is also acceptable at lake and river temperatures which are about 10 to 15 °C.

Therefore Tobias left the valve fully open. Most of the liquid was driven out of the cuvettes and spread out inside the housing. It short-circuited several pins of the Arduino, causing the program to crash. Consequently we adapted the protocol and the program so that the airflow could be regulated correctly prior to fermentation.

Hackerspace: Biologigaragen
Being quite confident about our prototype, we took it to Biologigaragen a DIY Biohackerspace in Copenhagen. We showed our result to Keenan, who just build a photobioreactor for their lab. After introducing him to the main features and our considerations, we gave him a chance to take it apart and ask questions.
He was very positive about the interface and agreed that all the materials used would be available for them. He agreed with Tobias that we should make the next version bigger, so that the cuvettes can be moved in and out more easily. Besides he had a lot of suggestions, e.g. on upgrades for fed-batch fermentations and temperature control. Therefore he was happy to hear that all source code is available.

Proof of Concept
The figure shows two distinct exponential phases, representing the diauxic growth of S. cerevisiae. Based on the data recorded by the Arduino, we were able to compute the growth rates, shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 10: Growth curve of S. cerevisiae. The green and the blue line show the slope of the two exponential phases. The values are given next to the lines.
During the development , we gradually expanded our prototype, testing all the changes on the way. After going through the protocol with Tobias, we ran a final test to prove that the overall concept is working now. The final prototype was successful at measuring growth of Escherichia. coli, as evident from the results shown in Figure 11.

The pTet-pBad-RFP or pBad-pTet-RFP expressing E. coli strains were cultured in LB with kanamycin plus the additives indicated overnight at 37°C overnight with shaking. 20µL samples of each culture were dropped onto microscope slides and allowed to air dry.  Slides were then fixed in methanol for 10 minutes, dried, and wet mounted with a coverslip in a 50% glycerol solution. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss AxioVert microscope with an 100x oil immersion lens, and imaged with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. Images were acquired using Zen software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop. All images were exposed for 2 seconds. Brightness and contrast adjustments made during processing were applied equally to all panels within the figure.

Micrographs showing the expression of RFP and GFP at different small molecule concentrations for pBAD+pTet+RFP
Arabinose is clearly inducing RFP induction but aTc induction is weak at best. This may have been due to a mix up in the media we gave them. Likewise, the presence of GFP in some of the cells suggests we may have gave them a mixed culture since we didn't see GFP for the same constructs when we ran flow cytometry analysis. The change in RFP under arabinose suggests that there are cells with the correct construct growing in the culture. For a more detailed result analysis, click here .

CPU_CHINA,2017,Team:CPU CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," exchange
At the Life Science Building Conference room in Nanjing University, the two leaders talked about the progress on their own subjects and the status quo of the team. Yu Zhou, the leader of Nanjing University team, told us about their recent sessions of the iGEM, and explained some important time node, like human practice attention points, the contents of the two co-operation and other issues. Also, he showed our team members around their labs. After talking with them, we have gained some knowledge of iGEM competition, which gave us a lot of help in participating in iGEM competition. (figure21).
Figure 21. Our team is listening to the introduction of NJU iGEMer
2. Inviting NJU-CHINA to attend academic debate
In order to enhance the exchange between two teams, we invited the iGEM team of Nanjing University to attend the academic debate (Figure22). Two teams conducted a debate on whether changes in epigenetic modification can determine tumorigenesis at the China Pharmaceutical University Conference Center:
Proposition: CPU_CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications can determine tumorigenesis
Counter: NJU-CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications cannot determine tumorigenesis
The two sides held different arguments, and cited frontier knowledge of self-argument and deduction to express their views. Also, two teams obtained a lot of gains during the debate, and made a further exchange on the issue of respective topics.

3. Participating in experience sharing meeting at Nanjing Agricultural University
Invited by the iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University, we participated in experience exchanging meeting (Figure 23). The meeting invited Haoqian Zhang, the predecessor of Peking University iGEM team, to share his experience. According to his previous experience, all the notes on the formation of the team and participation in the Giant Jamboree have been described in details and shared with us about the personal experience of participating in the iGEM competition. Besides, we actively communicated with other teams to share different ideas and projects processing. It inspired us a lot and we avoided a lot of problems that may happen in our experiment.

Collaborations
This year is the first time for Jiangnan team to participate in the iGEM competition. Therefore, we know the importance of cooperation and communication with the external world. We have established cooperation with the outside world in many ways, including academic exchange, biosafety disscussion, industrial production, and human practice. These interactions are of great significance to the smooth progression of our projects.
Academic collaboration
Collaboration with UESTC-China
This year, UESTC-China aims at using a biofunctional enzyme, xyn10D-fae1A, to directly break down the lignin-polysaccharide crosslink between straws and convert them into useful chemical materials.
They introduced a group of cellulases (cex, cenA, xyl3A) to convert the cellulose produced by straw degradation into glucose, and then designed two pathways to ferment glucose to produce butanol and hydrogen, respectively.
However, there is a problem that when the conventional Escherichia coli BW25113 is used as a chassis organism for butanol fermentation, the yield is very low, so they hope to replace the chassis cells to try to increase the yield of butanol.
Through the discussions between our two teams, we offered UESTC-China our Escherichia coli B0016-050 from our laboratory as a new chassis cell and we hope that it could help them further increase the yield of butanol.
Collaboration
with
XJTLU-China
We held a mini meet-up in our university in April. Both teams shared the project introduction, and discussed the background of the topic and details of the experimental plan. XJTLU-China also shared lots of experience that helped us run our project more smoothly.
Collaboration
with
NUS_Singapore-A(NUSGEM)
Our team and NUS_Singapore-A iGEM team (NUSGEM) held a meet-up in National University of Singapore to discuss various problems encountered during project progression. Their project focused on developing a novel biomanufacturing platform for engineered bacteria, and they produced natural dyes using that platform. We also highlighted the principles and experimental design of our project to produce vaccine. We exchanged suggestions to each other on problems encountered in experiments, modeling"

Goal
To develop a simple Perl program to search a desired tag protein sequence in a query proteome.
Background
When working with proteases, it is essential to make sure that these proteases are going to degrade only their target proteins, so previous studies must be carried out to get rid of possible unwanted endogenous protease targets. In our case, before starting the web lab experiments, we checked that E.coli’s proteome (our model organism) did not show any of the protease ClpXP degradation tags.
Strategy
Perl is an open source programming language which is used extensively in Bioinformatics. We wrote a Perl program to search in E.coli’s proteome all the known ClpXP protease degradation tags. By using this software, the user can choose which ClpXP protease known degradation tag wants to search in a desired proteome. The software comes with all the proteomes of the currently used organisms in synthetic biology downloaded from the NCBI .

To propagate the phages, 4 ml E. coli culture (Stock ID: 47) was cultivated to an OD600 of 0.6 (in LB media + 25 mM glucose + amp) and infected with 4 µl of the phage supernatant. Culture was shaked at 37 °C overnight. On the next morning, culture was centrifuged at 6000 xg for 5 min and supernatant, which contains the phages, was stored at 4 °C. A Blue Plaque Assay was performed to determine the phage titer of the supernatant. 143 plaques were counted at the 10-10 dilution, which leads to a phage titer of 1.43*1015 PFU/ml. A plaque of this plate was picked to infect a 4 ml E. coli culture (Stock ID: 47) with an OD600 of 0.4. This culture was cultivated for two hours shaking at 37 °C and was subsequently transferred to 100 ml fresh 2xYT medium. After 1 hour carbenicillin (1000x) was add. On the next day, culture was centrifuged at 3640 xg for 20 min. Supernatant was stored at 4 °C. A Blue Plaque Assay was performed to determine the phage titer of the supernatant. The monoclonal Dickinson phage target_133_N-term_T7-C exhibited a phage titer of 1.85*109 PFU/ml.

Generation of datasets for 427-classes and 299 classes
In order to further simplify the problem of having a high amount of weakly represented classes we generated two additional datasets:
427 EC classes with a minimum sample size of 100, and 299 EC classes with a minimum samplesize of 200.
Implementation of first generative Model
To reach the lowest hanging fruit in generative modeling, we switched DeeProtein to the generative mode. Generative modes take an input (or noise input) and return a modified version of the inout maximizing the class probability for the target class. In the context of protein sequences, generative modeling could for instance generate new funcitonalities by ""shifting"" a sequence in the multidimensional featurespace aling the direction of the target class.
The easiest way to achieve functionality is by just ""training"" the input of the network"

We not only devote to research the cure of dental caries just in library, during the practice, we got the data about how people are troubled by the teeth disease. We believe the activity do help the participants to prevent dental caries, and individuals who just asked questions to us then took leaflets may also got the basic knowledge about the disease. Considering normal people's attitude about dental health, we will try our best to make our program more meaningful and practicable.

One essential part in designing new BioBricks is the characterization and thus the estimation of the resources consumed by that BioBrick. For that reason, we wanted to genomically integrate a GFP coding gene into the genome of E.coli For the measurement of the metabolic burden caused by a BioBrick one can transform the cells with that BioBrick. After inducing said BioBrick one can estimate the metabolic Burden by the decrease in constitutively expressed GFP. To make this kind of measurement possible we assembled this BioBrick, which is composed of the λ‑attp‑Site, a J23101 Promoter from the Anderson Promoter Series, a RBS and a coded GFP with an added LVA‑Tag and two bidirectional terminators. The two key parts of this Brick are the λ‑attp‑Site, which is necessary for the genomic integration of the Plasmid. The integration follows the λ‑bacteriophage integration mechanism combining the attachment site plasmid (attP) with the attachment site bacteria (attB). The second part is the constitutively expressed GFP with an LVA‑Tag which makes the measurement of the metabolic burden possible and easily achievable. For introducing an easy and reliable method for measuring the metabolic burden caused by different BioBricks we think that this part is worthy of being awarded the price for the Best Composite Part.

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," of adults have never heard anything about synthetic biology, while 28% have heard ""a little"" about it, 22% have heard something about the field and 5% have heard a lot about the field [9]. Importantly, only 18% believed that the benefits of synthetic biology will outweigh the risks. Perceptions have since been influenced by the recent work of  Venter, et al. in which they engineered bacteria from a ""synthetic"" chromosome [10]. This research propelled synthetic biology to the forefront of national discourse for the first time in 2010, resulting in widespread shifts in perception about synthetic biology and an increase in awareness. Discussions emerged about whether synthetic biologists were ""playing God,"" which has had a negative impact on public opinion of the synthetic biology because this type of discourse has not been accompanied by public education on the reality of the field [11]. In addition, the distinction between genetic engineering and synthetic biology is often not well understood by the public, and the negative perceptions of genetically modified organisms (roughly half of the US population opposes GMOs [12]) can thus spill over to synthetic biology. Given this current opinion landscape, it is reasonable to assume that even if a synthetic bacterial therapeutic was shown to be safe and effective, it may encounter public resistance. The development of engineered bacterial therapeutics may also be hindered by an eventual decline in public interest in the field and parallel decreases in public and private funding. Since government research funding is largely dependent on public priorities, high interest and awareness of a field is generally beneficial to researchers in that field. Synthetic biology has recently been enjoying a rapid rise in awareness, which has been accompanied by a spike in research funding [13]. Some of this funding has already resulted in the development of novel proof-of-concept synthetic bacterial therapeutics [14,15] which may develop into new treatments with time. However, like many other fields before it (most notably nanotechnology), synthetic biology is likely to experience a drop in public interest in the near future.
Beating the Hype
The Gartner Hype Cycle [16] is a model which describes the public awareness of emerging technologies. It predicts that in the early onset of a new technology (""technology trigger""), expectations of its potential become inflated and the public gains considerable interest in it. This has arguably been occurring recently with synthetic biology, as evidenced by widespread claims that artificial life has been created and that the field can create designer organisms from scratch. These claims have greatly increased interest in the field, but in the near future the public will have to come to the realization that synthetic biology has limitations and is very far"

Conclusions
Human Practices
The aim of our human practices work was to spread the word about synthetic biology and to consider our work in ethical and environmental aspects. We also wanted to get valuable feedback from people outside of the team, both experts and the general public, in order to further develop the project. For outreach, we got interviewed by the local newspaper Göteborgs-Posten, held presentations about our project at the university and kept our social media up-to-date. To put our product in a societal context, we investigated current treatment and detection methods and Swedish laws and regulations concerning genetically modified drugs. We had meetings with several experts and used their feedback to change our path during the course of the summer. We met with the oncology professor Mef Nilbert that gave us advice regarding our project idea. Mef Nilbert made us consider alternative detection methods and broadened our perspective on the potential uses of our product. We also met with Mike Vega, Vice President of Business Development & Sales at Verasonics and collaborator with Shapiro's lab, the lab that wrote the paper about acoustic reporter genes (Bourdeau et al., 2018). Mike Vega gave us information regarding transducers that guided us in our ultrasound experiments. We designed an experimental survey based on the advice from the philosophy professor Karl de Fine Licht. The survey helped us to evaluate our product from a patient point of view and to understand how to best reach out with our project to society. Carl Johan Franzén, professor in bioreaction engineering, gave us guidance regarding ethical and environmental issues. Based on his guidance, we evaluated the effects that our yeast could have on patient health and the environment. In turn, this made us consider how we could avoid possible negative effects caused by our product. Below, we describe our human practices journey in more detail.

Current Methods and Research
In order to evaluate the need"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"

If the zipper pair has no binding interaction, then the prey zipper will remain in the cytosol.  Effectively, in the event of no interaction, the yeast cell will have diffuse red fluorescent protein in the cytosol.
In the event of a medium level interaction between the bait and prey zippers, both red punctate in the peroxisomes and diffuse red fluorescent protein in the cytosol should be observed. The proportion of localized red (peroxisome to cytosol) is dependent on the strength of interaction.
This assay was tested using zipper pairs of binding affinity characterized by yeast two hybrid systems courtesy of the Keating Lab at MIT (figure shown below, found in Thompson, et. al 2012 ). The following zipper pairs were used: 20+2 (strong), 20+6 (medium), 20+13 (weak).
Cell fluorescence as a measure of MAPK pathway modulation by SYNZIP parts. Interaction pairs are
ordered, left to right, by the relative mean cell fluorescence induced.
The following microscope images were obtained using these protein interaction pairs in our leucine zipper assay:
Strong interaction.
Medium interaction.
Weak interaction.
As it is shown in the figures above, the yeast strain with the strong zipper interaction showed red punctate in the peroxisomes of the yeast cells. The medium interaction strain gave diffuse RFP in the cytosol along with some concentrated red in the peroxisomes. The weak interaction strain gave only diffuse RFP in the cytosol.
Our computational team conducted an analysis of the zipper data from the images shown above. Our metric for gauging zipper-interaction was amount of protein in peroxisome divided by amount of protein in cytosol. This ratio was calculated for each cell in each population using the cell segmentation software described in the automation section and an additional program that the computational team developed for identifying and analyzing peroxisomes. Based on this analysis the interaction strengths in the table below were found.
The MATLAB analysis allows us to assign quantitative values to the qualitative
interactions strengths we observe in the microscopy images. We found that the
MATLAB analysis agreed well with the ""eye-ball"" interaction test shown above.
In order to test the MiCode application for the leucine zipper assay we created two MiCodes- one for the known strong binding pair (20+2) and one for the know weak binding pair (20+"

Introduction of the meeting about entrepreneurship which SCUT-Champion-Park participated
Innovation & Entrepreneurship Fair for College Students in Shenzhen
In recent years, with the increasing varieties and the widespread use, antibiotics has become one of the most commonly used drugs in China. Irrational use of antibiotics or even abuse is threatening human health. The food containing antibiotic residues, the intestinal flora in body will gradually have resistance to antibiotics, which will causes the poor effect when use the antibiotics. As students of biology major, we also hope to contribute to solving this problem relying on our own efforts. So when we have a chance to participate in IGEM competition, we choose to focus on the food safety, hoping to improve the food safety in China with our efforts. Finally, we determine to develop an effective and simple antibiotics detector, which will not only provide a new method for the detection mechanisms, but also will help the consumers detect their food easily. To a certain extent, it can ensure their food security.
At first, We set the goal to sold our product in the market. At the same time, through our promotion, it can also make more people focus on their food safety and know the important of rational use of antibiotics. In order to successfully achieve the goal, we find some venture capital firms to talk about cooperation, also participate in Innovation & Entrepreneurship Fair for College Students in Shenzhen. There are a lot of start-up companies in this fair, to our surprise, there are many life and health start-up companies. We exchange ideas and products at the fair and I think in the future there will be more technological companies in the field of life and health, they will provide better services for human health. In addition, many invest-                   ment firms participated in the fair. We communicate and exchange information with them, and some express the intention to cooperate.
Through this fair, I deeply felt that the life and health field is a focus of society. That strengthens our beliefs to struggle for human life and health.

The story focuses on the spread of Lantana, a plant introduced by the British as an ornamental plant, is said to be one of the world's most invasive weeds, now dominating up to 60% of the forest floor in some places. A production by ART - a Bangalore-based theatre group in collaboration with TheatreScience, a UK-based organisation.
""Lantana, said to be one of the world’s most invasive weeds, lurks in the background as a character in this play, set in the forests of South India. The behaviour of floral invasive species has parallels with that of human invaders, and ‘The Clearing’ is a play about invasions, intended or otherwise. Ramesh is a scientist studying lantana, who needs to do lengthy fieldwork in the forest. His wife, Vinita, accompanies him and finds, to her interest, an NGO that teaches forest dwellers to make furniture from lantana. Being a graphic designer, she has her own ideas about designs and marketing, which unsettles Roshni, her former schoolmate and an NGO worker. The two tribal forest dwellers, Marappa and his daughter Shanti, have big dreams, but there’s so much that’s out of their control.""

GFP just fluroscence on its own. For FRET two things (nanoparticles or FPs) acting as donor / acceptor are required; when they are close enough and an external source provides excitement, the donor transfer light received to acceptor which emits a different light.(Piston & Kremers, 2007) BRET is similar to FRET in that donor / acceptor pair is required, but BRET need not external source, rather it is powered by oxidation of substrates.(Pfleger & Eidne, 2006) It seems that for our purposes FRET and BRET are too complicated and doesn't offer good enough signal to noise ratio in our application to justify the use of them. Instead we should focus on simple biochemical reporters, i.e. those enzymes mentioned above.
Thus I have started working on the kinetics of those reporter enzymes.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The focus of this week has been the kinetics of those enzyme based reporter genes. There are two approaches to their kinetics, one based on chemical kinetics uses coupled ODEs and another using the results of enzyme kinetics reporting values such as Km and V. I was not trained in enzyme kinetics so I found a textbook by Cornish-Bowden to learn the techniques. (Cornish-Bowden, 2012) This took up most of the week.
The kinetics of horseradish peroxidase in the context of being used for waste water treatment can be found by the work of Carvalho et al. (Carvalho et al., 2006) Even though we intend to use horseradish peroxidase in the context of reporter gene, but we believe the catalytic activities will be the same, so the reaction pathways for pehnols in that paper can be readily adopted for our causes. On the other hand the kinetics of fluorescence of beta-galactosidase has been studied by Huang. (Huang, 1991) However the kinetics presented is very simple compared to work done by Metelkin et al. (Metelkin, Lebedeva, Goryanin, & Demin, 2009) We need to decide whatever the detailed model will give us better results to justify their complexity.
Week 7: June 10 - June 14

#4: Look for the ACT Label
The ACT Label is a label which assesses eco-friendly manufacturing and use of lab consumables, chemicals, and equipment, audited and verified by myGreenLab. [ 3 ] The ACT label scores products from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest score. A database of chemicals, consumables, and equipment assessed by their ACT score is hosted on myGreenLab's website.
#5: Dispose of all reagents safely
Make sure that all reagents are disposed of safely. This includes separating into appropriate waste streams to avoid cross-contamination or unwanted chemical reactions. For example, most growth media can be poured down a sink, but cells must be killed with bleach before being disposed of. Safe waste processing prevents environmental damage from contamination, and helps avoid incurring extra costs for hazardous waste disposal .

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"Invitation to join the association in the next monthly beekeepers’ reunion in Cuauhtémoc
Detailed Description
Viana and Ana Laura had the opportunity to travel to Cuauhtémoc, a city specialized in fruit growing; production and exportation of apples, peaches, strawberries, walnuts, among many others.1 Thanks to Viana, who is native from this city, we were able to get to contact this beekeeper. Mr. Rodríguez is the president of the association of beekeepers in the city and we saw an enormous opportunity in talking to him. This was our very first direct approach with the beekeeper’s community! We were very excited to start getting to know them. What would they think about our ideas? Would they be interested in our project? How many things would they have to tell us? Our project was about to begin its transformation path.
This enriching talk lasted approximately 1 hour 15 minutes and different topics were discussed. We learned many general characteristics of bees' lives thanks to the great experience of the beekeeper: The different varieties of bees that exist, specific tasks of each type of bee and the joint work bees and beekeepers do to ensure pollination.
Regarding the existing methods against Foulbrood, Mr. Rodríguez mentioned how SAGARPA (National Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing, and Food) does not allow the usage of chemical contaminants in beehives because wastes may end up in honey flows. Mr. Rodríguez mentioned how beekeepers sometimes use extracts of rosemary or oregano against Foulbrood, but it is always difficult for them to know what dose to add and ensure it is adequate for fighting the diseases and at the same time does not destabilize the hive. On another hand, he mentioned that the method of burning beehives results very expensive for them. Currently, in Cuauhtémoc, there is almost no presence of American Foulbrood, since, in the past, many sick hives were exposed to this burning method, then the disease decreased. On the other hand, European foulbrood is most commonly found in Cuauhtemoc.
The beekeeper emphasized how a natural product against Foulbrood is needed, so there are not left residues in the honey and he also highlighted how beekeeping varies around the world and sometimes there are specific necessities for each region.
Thanks to the sharing we made with the beekeeper of our project, he was able to have a new panorama of beekeeping, and how emerging technologies, in this case, synthetic"

Summary
Important information we found out:
Prof. R. Sommaruga and Prof. S. Churio proposed to use nitrogen-enriched media.
Our first intention was to test our strains under the UV light exposure to prove the presence of UV-absorbing compounds and to choose the strains with the highest yield.          Prof. S. Churio proposed us to use not only UV but also visible light to favor MAAs biosynthesis.
Dr. K. P. Lawrence suggested us in the interview to apply some other types of environmental stress to induce shinorine and porphyra-334, such as osmotic stress, thermal stress or enhanced salinity.
In order to increase the effectiveness of the sunscreen, the possibility of incorporation of more diverse MAAs with distinct spectral characteristics can be considered. It was also recommended by the researchers in the field (Dr. K. P. Lawrence, Prof. R. Sommaruga, Dr. R. Garcesa). Although, this will require a thorough investigation of the information available since the genes of the enzymes for the biosynthesis of many MAAs are not yet identified.
All the proposals mentioned above were taken into consideration while developing our project.

Do you think that production of yeast extract enriched with MAA would be a valuable combination?
Yes, I think that this is possible as yeast is an excellent system for the expression of recombinant eukaryotic proteins.
What can be the possible difficulties in producing MAA in yeast? What do you think how we can overcome them?
You might need to work on some codon modification to optimise the expression process.
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
I would try the same principle: yeast exposure to higher UV level. See this article:  Mycosporine‐glutaminol‐glucoside, a UV‐absorbing compound of two Rhodotorula yeast species. https://febs.onlinelibrary.w"

S&T Week
A-P Conference
Alpha Version Trial
Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. In addition, we distributed questionnaires to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.
Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Cheng Kung University from August 8th to 14th 2016. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.
We are so grateful to be invited and glad to have a chance to communicate with other teams in Taiwan.
Alpha Version Trial for Schoolmates
Before we have collected our data of questionnaires form the Science and Technology Week, we did not come up that a simulator should be programmed into our software. However, the result of the survey showed that over 40% of participants both were in the major of biology and wanted to have a program to analyze the concentrations of several interacting substances in a biological reaction. Some participants told us that solving them manually was often a harsh job and there might probably be miscalculations in the result, which was a huge"

Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four"

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html,"? Artificial life and intellectual property issues need to be considered, but also general genetic engineering related ethical issues.
The engineering approach of synthetic biology (biological engineering in stead of only metabolic engineering) may give rise to numerous applications. It comprises a big technological field that will probably involve the whole world. This also means that a thorough discussion on ethical issues, regulation and control is necessary to determine the boundary conditions, in both a social and a legal perspective. Still, whether synthetic biology will prove to be a hype with only loose promises, only the future will tell.
3.8 Intellectual property rights: usefulness or commercialization?
Besides the implications of synthetic biology, the terminology and the scientific advantages and disadvantages, another issue needs to be considered in the field of synthetic biology from an engineering point of view. As synthetic biology applications begin to emerge, the applications are also starting to be patented. In our society, scientific research on patented applications is possible without licences, which means in practice that all patented ideas can be researched without financial consequences. Licence fees have to be paid, however, when an investigated application is subsequently commercialized. This has some practical limitations for synthetic biology research: some ideas may already have been patented, without the application being demonstrated to work properly in the lab. This also means that any combination of BioBricks (a “device”) can also be patented (of course under the patent requirements that apply), which makes commercialization of certain applications impossible.
One can wonder whether the constructing side of synthetic biology with increasing levels of artificialness is then only meant to be useful and to prove principles in biology, or whether actual applications can also be commercialized without being limited by patent registrations. But besides intellectual property considerations of open source technology, also more specific concerns regarding the iGEM competition can be considered. These will be discussed in the next paragraph.
3.9 iGEM, open source technology and the intellectual property: impossible or naïve?
Within the iGEM competition, the idea is that BioBricks are added to a database in a completely open source setting. Everyone should be able to use these BioBricks to make a certain application. However, in this approach, there are several things that have to be considered, on which we could elaborate into very much detail. However, these issues will be mentioned and explained below briefly.
Open source and the role of capitalism in science. Perhaps ideally, all academic science would be open source; financing for universities comes from a central (national) government, all scientific findings are published and progress is made because everyone has access to the latest scientific developments. Unfortunately, this is currently not the case"

We used microscopic counting to quantify the binding effect. The same procedure was used to the cells with plasmid having different promoters. (Result here)
Gas vesicles
Two proteins, GvpA and GvpC are needed to form a protein complex to help the E.coli cells float. GvpA, a hydrophobic protein with the size of 7.4 kDa, is assembled as the framework of the protein complex, which is later stabilized by the hydrophilic protein GvpC, a larger protein consisting of 193 residues. GvpA and GvpC can assemble into a low-density protein cylinder in assistance of floating (see Fig. 8). Gas fills space inside the protein complex by diffusion while water is rejected outside.
Figure 8.
Floating cells regulate the proportion of GvpA and GvpC by having different ORF copies in the gvp cluster. On average, the molar ration of GvpA and GvpC is around 30:1 in one cell. Considering this, we inserted gvpA and gvpC gene into pSB1C3 and pSB4A5 vector respectively to get the wanted expression results. The OUC-China iGEM team used this design in 2012 and we continued to adopt this strategy in our project this year. The gene cluster was also kindly give by the OUC-China iGEM team.

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2014,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#trehalose production_-_-_TEXT.html," compared with our BioBrick part encoding OtsB (BBa_K1339001). Promoter (medium constitutive promoter or low constitutive promoter) and double terminator was ligated to otsB, and inserted into pSB1A2 vector by 3A or standard assembly.
Escherichia coli strain TOP10 transformed with the constructed vectors were cultured in LB medium containing 600 mM NaCl and 2% Glucose at 150 rpm and 37 ℃ for 20 hours. The transformants were harvested and washed with phosphate buffered saline containing 600 mM NaCl and then, resuspended with SPB buffer. Cells were fractured by sonication and then centrifugated at 8,000 g for 15 min. Trehalose 6-phosphate, which is a precursor of trehalose was added to the supernatant and incubated at 37℃ overnight. The supernatant was concentrated by freeze-drying and subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to detect trehalose (Fig. 7). Moreover, the expression of otsB was confirmed by SDS-PAGE using the cell pellet (Fig. 8).
TLC
The result of TLC is shown in FIg.7. As standard sample, trehalose and trehalose-6-hosphate were spotted.    We confirmed that the spot of E. coli/Pmedium -otsB was located almost the same height as standard sample of trehalose.  So, we concluded that trehalose  was produced from trehalose-6-hosphate by OtsB.

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," was also determined with pCERI in both E.coli BL21 and Nissle 1917. In a first try none of the tested samples showed to be able to induce violacein expression in C. violaceum, not even our positive controls, where we spotted purified HSLs alongside the reporter strain. As the experiment did not seem to work properly with the current parameters, we tried to lower the incubation temperature from 37°C to 30°C. In this setup our positive controls were able to induce violacein expression (Fig.1, 2).
Figure 1 C. violaceum induced with different concentrations of octanoyl-homoserine lactone and grown over night at 30°C. A minimum of 100 µM C8-HSL is needed for violacein induction. C.v.: Chromobacterium violaceum CV026
Figure 2 C. violaceum induced with different concentrations of 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone and grown over night at 30°C. A minimum of 1 mM 3OC6-HSL is needed for violacein induction. C.v.: Chromobacterium violaceum CV026
The results of this experiment showed, that only BBa_K1670004 seems to be functional in both, E.coli BL21 and E.coli Nissle 1917, however activity in Nissle 1917 is much weaker compared to BL21, which can probably explained by protease activities in Nissle 1917 (Fig.3).
BBa_K1670000 showed no activity in both E.coli strains. This result might indicate, that either BBa_K1670000 is not functional or the synthesized octanoyl-homoserine lactone concentration is too low to induce violacein expression in C. violaceum .
E.coli BL21 pCERI, which encodes for BBa_K1670000 and BBa_K1670004 , induced violacein expression strongly (Fig. 4). Interestingly even though BBa_K1670004 was able to induce violacein expression when transformed in E.coli Nissle 1917 individually, E.coli Nissle 1917 pCERI did not show any activity (Fig.4).

She confirmed us that in legal term, it was impossible to free our modified microalgae in seawater, according to the law in effect in France. Indeed, the legislations that regulates the use of GMO are very strict in the European Union. She highlighted the fact that the use of GMOs have to be proven completely risk free for the environment to be accepted. However, when it comes to use of living material, there is always a risk no matter how small.
What we learnt and how we used it:
This raised the question of scientific uncertainty. From this interview, we kept working on finding other safety systems for our photobioreactor and started to think about potential alternatives for a better use of our microalgae.
Anne-Sophie Lepeuple
Anne-Sophie Lepeuple: Head of the applied biotechnology department at Veolia. Veolia is a french multinational industry involved in environment protection.
Interview:
Mrs Lepeuple told us that microalgae brought an added value only for the production of some specific molecules. Indeed, she explained us how difficult it was to develop new processes for inexpensive and effective extraction and collection of some molecules in algae. This is the reason why algae are generally not used to produce biofuel or sugar for instance.  Besides, she thinks the means to avoid the spread of our algae or of the molecules they can export in the environment would be too expensive.
What we learnt and how we used it:
We started considering to produce other types of molecules than sugar into our Chlamydomonas. We had therefore to focus more on our retrotransposon’s development for our microalgae to be a chassis for a wider range of application.

The following pictures are our partial results.
Click here to see the full results.
Through the survey, we realize that a majority of people have noticed recent severe plastics pollution and are not satisfied with extant disposal methods. They look forward to a better way to control the ‘white pollution’. Besides, in terms of technology of ‘white pollution’ control, most people have knew something about biological plastics degradation and think highly of it. They hope that scientists will do further research. From the survey we also notice the public consciousness of ‘white pollution’ and how urgent and necessary we should fix this problem. At the same time, it reinforces our confidence and enthusiasm to solve it using biological method. We will definitely make great efforts to explore and figure out something meaningful to live up to public expectation.
Summary
Briefly speaking, we team iGEM Tianjin gave lectures to students in Baitangkou primary school, Dagang No.1 middle school and TUST respectively. In addition, we held a debate in our school with respect to synthetic biology. And also, we visited the TEDA green technology exhibition hall to exchange ideas about waste disposal. We presented our project, PET bio-degradation to them and took a deep and meticulous look at TEDA’s green technologies. Finally, we conducted two questionnaire surveys about synthetic biology and plastic pollution by scattering them by social media. In conclusion, I think our human practice work has provoked a considerable number of people engaged in our project and we are definitely eligible for this prize this year."

Brief Summary of Results
Following transient expression of pJAB1489 and pJAB1504, there appeared to be little to no expression of GFP compared to the background level of expression. There also appeared to be no expression of the BS3 construct either. As neither construct showed expression, future experiments should be focused on validating the system in Nicotiana benthamiana, optimizing the gene transfer method.
Future Directions
Following validation, the system may be adapted to create an inducible toxin recognition system. As described by Tsinghua 2017, the single chain variable fragments can be attached to the activating and binding domains of Gal4 to enhance expression"

Researcher Safety
To ensure the safety of our researchers in the lab, we will wear gloves, labcoats, and goggles at any time that bacteria are in use. Also, no food or drink are allowed in the lab at any time. Before leaving the lab every day, we will wash our hands thoroughly. And, of course, any general laboratory safety procedures and precautions will be used.
Public Safety
Because we are using non-pathogenic lab E. coli, there is no risk to the general public that would arise from our research. We are still, however, taking precautions in that the windows of the lab remain closed, all waste is autoclaved, and any disposal is disposed of in a bio-hazard waste container.
Environmental Safety
Again, because we are using non-pathogenic lab bacteria, there is little to no risk to the environment. The only advantage we are providing our bacteria with is AMP resistance for selection. Although that gives little risk, we are still considering containment a priority.
Lab Biosafety
There is no biosafety at our college. Our guidelines are consistent with the Biosafety Levely 1 (BSL1) and cGLP.

Stony_Brook,2017,Team:Stony Brook#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," in cow eyes dissections. We would like to thank both principals for allowing us the opportunity to talk to their students and show them a tiny glimpse into the world of synthetic biology.
LaValle Movie Night
Our team went to the LaValle Movie Night held in Stony Brook University’s LaValle stadium where a showing of the movie “Beauty and the Beast” was organized. There, we promoted our Chipotle fundraiser and talked to interested moviegoers about synthetic biology and about our project. We displayed our poster that contained information on iGEM, Synthetic Biology, and our project, and many students, particularly freshmen, approached us and were very eager in the iGEM program at Stony Brook University. Our team enjoyed meeting with the community and enjoyed some team bonding while watching “Beauty and the Beast”.
Stony Brook University Summer Programs
Our team had the pleasure of hosting tours of our lab for summer programs such as EOP/AIM, Museum of Natural History summer program, and Stony Brook College of Arts and Sciences pre-college summer program. The programs consisted of students who were either incoming first year students or high school seniors and juniors. We discussed a wide variety of topics with the students such as synthetic biology, iGEM, engaging in research in college, and a brief overview of our project.  Our team was happy to help them with their queries about the subjects we discussed. The incoming freshmen were also curious about the world they were going to step into this fall, so we gave them some advice and told them of some tips and tricks they should keep in mind for transitioning from high school into college. We strongly encourage every student to participate in research when they enter college to earn a truly insightful and stimulating experience.
Our team also collaborated with iGEM Cornell and iGEM Columbia to analyze the perceptions of people within a large sample population regarding synthetic biology and the willingness to receive treatment or products that are bacteria-regulated or have some component of genetic engineering. We also reached out health professional and pediatric specialist at Stony Brook Hospital, Dr. Sharon Nachman, who gave her insight regarding ways to improve upon our project, so that our bacteriocins and hybrids can be applied as a therapeutic. Her concern was that often times, infected MRSA patients may also have other strains of S. aureus in  their body, thus we should consider testing whether our hybrids are only specific to MRSA or other S. aureus strains as well.

Dr. Yaa spoke of GMO as an important step forward. The positive effects of GMOs related to farmers and the general population of Ghana were among others the following:
Farmers:
Reduction of chemicals in farming
Improvement of health
Saving time for the farmers
Saving tractor fuel, in relation to Green House Gasses.
General population:
Nutritional balance
Prevention of children suffering from malnutrition
Improvement of health
Reduction of intolerance. As an example lactose intolerance was given, where GMO could be accommodated by producing milk containing lactase, which is an enzyme one lacks when  lactose intolerant Source: Swallow, D.M.: Genetics of Lactase Persistence and Lactoseintolerance. Annu.Rev.Genet,2003.37:197-219. (Link)
There is much focus on the fact that child mortality has decreased due to improvement in child health.

Source: World Health Organization, 2014: Country Cooperation Strategy at a glance. (Link)
By introducing GMOs this issue could potentially be reduced. However, the ethical aspects of introducing  GMOs as relief-aid for hunger or malnutrition must be subject to consideration, according to Dr.  Yaa. Personally, Dr. Yaa did not think of GMO as unethical if the purpose was relief of hunger or  malnutrition. However, it would be necessary to educate the population so that they would have a foundation for decisions regarding the use of GMOs as a nutrition source. Dr. Yaa mentioned the importance of considering indications producing genetically modified organism. The hypothetical GMO should have relevance in a way that promises improvement of lifestyle or  brings good quality to something. Furthermore, it would be necessary to demonstrate the safety of the GMO. This would include risk  assessments such as inspection of the organism when separated from its natural surroundings. It would  additionally be crucial that the commercial releases were informative so that the consumers would receive  the essential information.
According to Dr Yaa the objections to GMOs seen from a religious point of view could be a problem in the beginning but it would not persist. Consequently, development of GMOs would entail that the genes, which  were used to modify the organisms, should be picked with concern. For instance, genes from a pig would  cause a revolt coming from the religious community.

We felt that the issues brought up by her were quite interesting and that a greater dialogue should be had about the rules and regulations regarding sending a recombinant organism. Should you have to become certified to mail them or is that unnecessary? What classification system should you use to label the gene?  The University of Georgia iGEM team hopes to learn more about these processes and that work with another organization to change public policy in this arena."
Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is that our survey is based on social networks and this certain population of people is more likely to have chances to use the social network and answer the questions. Besides, it can also be considered as people with these characteristics are more interested in allergy and allergen testing.
Popularity of Allergen Testing
In the questionnaire, we designed a question used to investigate the allergy frequency of people. The answer '1' means respondents are never allergy while '5' means they face allergy issues all the time. From the charts, it is clear that people never allergy only make of 30% while who frequently allergy occupied over 12.2%. People who have ever get allergy take up a majority parts of sample, which indicates that the snowball sampling is worked and help us to target to the expect population.
However, the result of another question that 'Would you seek medical advice for allergy' is a bit negative. Only half of the respondents will seek medical help even if they are allergic, which means that they probably have not attached adequate importance to allergy.
Meanwhile, the patients who choose to take an allergen testing occupy only a quarter. It is a hint that the allergy testing is not as popular as we think in China.
Views On Allergen Testing
In this part of the investigation, we mainly focus on what kinds of the allergen testing methods are popular and how respondents think about it.
The first result is about the popularity of various allergen testing methods. From the bar chart, it is obvious that the skin test is absolutely the mainstream, which is known by almost 90 percent of respondents. The detection of food intolerance is also popular as food intolerance often happens in China.
Skin test is known by most people.
Besides, as the recall of respondents who have ever done an allergy testing, the allergy test they take are mostly skin test. In addition, it is noticeable that approximate 15% of respondents do not know the allergy testing method they experienced, which implies us that the popularity of allergen testing may not be done well even in hospital.
Skin test is the most popular method.
Another fact that we are interested in is the price of allergy testing, so we designed a question that ask for expect price as respondent's wish. And about 83% of respondents choose the answer that the price of it should be under 300 RMB, which is equal to approximate 45 US dollar. As we know, the expectation price in hospital is far higher than this.
Most people expect lower price.
And we also collect views of the public on the popularity of allergen testing and the privacy of personal allergen information."

The bees were transported to the University of Lethbridge and stored at room temperature until 8:00. Prior to experimentation, the tubes were supplemented with a sugar water solution to ensure that the bees would not starve. Following feeding, 2ml of each treatment were added to the 5ml tubes containing the bees and set horizontally along the bench. The abdomen of each bee was immersed in the treatment no matter what orientation the bee took. The bees were observed for 1 hour and subsequently euthanized in 70% EtOH.

Table 1. Observations of the bees following 60 minutes of exposure.
Discussion:The bees showed that they could survive well in concentrations of oxalic acid that were above the point where E.coli would die. Further tests must be done to determine the exact contact toxicity. Additionally, the contact toxicity to mites will need to be addressed.
Conclusion:The bees will be able to survive all of the oxalic acid that the E.coli can produce.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.
