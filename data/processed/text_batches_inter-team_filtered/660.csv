Major achivements
In order to make the combination of drylab and wetlab, we collaborated with
1.SYSU-CHINA; our software evaluated the grade of their devices and it was also meaningful for them to evaluate the circuits with software.
2.SJTU-BioX-Shanghai; we evaluated their biobricks; worked together with our brother team in their verification part.
3.China-Tongji; we helped their team find the similar biobricks which could indicate their biobricks with hidden function in the database.
It can be seen from the result that our score is positively correlated to their experiment satisfaction.
According to this result, the comparison of our software score and their experiment results, our software successfully test the parallel experiment and it is also meaningful for them to evaluate the circuits with software, which would be beneficial to improve their future experiments.
This year, SYSU-CHINA develops a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up a living clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, microbes with the system inserted acquire the concept of life span so that some dangerous bacterias will come to death in time before they cause any biohazard.
We cooperate with SYSU on the project of experiment grading and result predicting. We would evaluate multiple parallel experiment groups in the construction and testing of inverted components from their team. These groups are comparable between our designs and results, which would become one of the pivotal parts of SYSU project, and the data extracted from which would meet our needs.
Through our cooperation, we got 5 biobricks which were evaluated by their experiment experience; according to our software, each biobricks also got a score. Here are the results.

Protocol
Day 1
1) Prepare M9 minimal media by carefully weighing out the required chemicals except MgSO4, and dissolve them in 1000mL of sterile H2O.
1. Weigh out 11.28g of M9 minimal powder and 2g of casamino acid in 1000ml of sterile H2O
2. Send for autoclave (ie before 12.30pm)
3. Dissolve MgSO4 as per formal weight to form 1M MgSO4.  Dissolve CaCl2 as per formal weight to form 0.1M CaCl2
4. Filter sterilise into the M9 media using Minisart® 0.20µm syringe filter
5. Add 1mL of antibiotic strep to the media.
6. If no carbon source specified, make up 0.5% Glucose.  If carbon source specified, make up 0.5% of secondary carbon source and 0.05% Glucose.
2) Prepare secondary carbon source stock solution
1. Dissolve carbon source in 10ml sterile H2O to form 10 or 20% stock solutions as per above.  (using idea that 1% = 1g in 100ml H2O).  Important note: Add half the sterile H2O first, then add in carbon source powder slowly while vortexing.  Finally add in all the sterile H2O.
2. Filter sterilise into new 15ml falcon tubes using Minisart® 0.20µm syringe filter.  Label new tubes as filtered stock solutions.
3) Using a loop, pick out a single colony of Top-10 cells from a Top-10 Strep plate (in cold room).  Innoculate the  cells on LB broth (with Strep)  and grow them overnight at 37 °C
Day 2
1) Before noon, check that the starter culture of Top-10 in LB has grown (ie. Turned cloudy).  Take out and transfer to cold room
2) At 3pm, dilute cells 1:50 (cells: media) into 10ml of supplemented M9 media.  Grow them overnight at 37 °C
Day 3
1) Prepare 6 x 50ml falcon tubes and 1x eppendorf tube.

CRISPR and Magnesium Chelatase plasmid
In the chloroplast of photosynthetic organisms, the enzyme magnesium chelatase catalyses the conversion of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to Magnesium protoporphyrin IX – a precursor of chlorophyll a. The enzyme is a hexameric motor complex made up of 3 different proteins – ChlI1, ChlD and ChlI2. ChlH and GUN4 proteins assist the binding of PPIX to magnesium chelatase and in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, Mg-PPIX is formed.
The assembly of our magnesium chelatase plasmid [BBa_K1998000] allows E. coli to produce the hexameric complex along with its two substrates GUN4 and ChlH. Since E. coli produces PPIX (as precursor of heme), it is theoretically possible to engineer E. coli to produce Mg-PPIX and subsequently induce the production of chlorophyll a with the MgPPIX - chlorophyll a plasmid [BBa_K1998013] . However, Mg-PPIX production would be limited in E. coli as it competes with the biosynthesis of heme. To overcome this, we have integrated CRISPR into our project to produce hemH deficient mutants of E. coli. By disrupting the hemH gene, there is subsequently more PPIX available for the magnesium chelatase plasmid to produce Mg-PPIX. The hemeH mutants would need to be grown in media containing glucose for survival.
Our team have successfully constructed the Magnesium chelatase plasmid and have also produced functional in vivo assays of the plasmid. Efforts to develop CRISPR-Cas9 Δheme mutants were successful. According to the literature, a fluorescences excitation and emission spectra should peaks at 418nm and 592nm respectively.
The assembly of this complex requires millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP to assemble. The substrate complex also requires micromolar concentrations of Protop"
Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," depending on the strain and conditions of the host [3]. In order to be health protective, we want a negative result to mean that there is less than 10³ bacterium ingested per person from a water source. Therefore, our threshold is 10³ bacterium per two liters of water, the average water intake per day. For our biosensor, a 100 ml water sample is taken, so for a positive test, there must be 50 bacterium in the sample, with some variability due to the uneven spread of cholera in a water source.
Then to determine the relative percentage value for a positive test, we will carry out our biosensor protocol on water samples with known concentrations of Cholera. The samples would be triplicates of concentrations of 0, 25,40, 50, 60 and 100 cholera cells per 100ml to see the change in the relative percentage value with differing concentrations. After using our software, we would average the relative percentage value for the samples with a concentration of 40, 50, 60 cholera cells to receive a threshold value. If a sample in the field meets or exceeds the value determined, it would be a positive sample.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Sensitivity and specificity give insight into the accuracy of disease detection tests. Sensitivity is defined as the percentage of positive test results where it is confirmed that Cholera is present (true positives) out of all of the positive samples, true positives and false negatives [1]. Specificity is the percentage of negative test results that are confirmed to have no Cholera present (true negatives) out of all the negative samples, true negatives and false positives [1]. To find these percentages, we must have another reliable detection method that we will compare our results to. According to the CDC, growing a culture of the sample is the gold standard for Cholera detection [2]. Therefore, we will culture the water sample as well as test our biosensor cells and compare the results to find our test’s accuracy. The results from the culture will be the ‘truth’ of whether the sample really has Cholera or not. Therefore, if the culture is positive and our test’s results are positive, it is a true positive, but if the culture is negative and our results are positive, it is a false positive, and it is the same for true negatives and false negatives.

Her mysteries abound; ‘tis all I’ve gleaned.
Jonlin Chen
The shining light of the grand Lighthouse of Alexandria pierced through the ebony Arabian night, guiding the royal ships of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus to the safety of the Pharos shore. After departing the Eastern Desert with crates of spices, linen, and gold, Egyptian sailors bowed to the mercy of the Great Sea and endured Her thrashing waves and whipping rain on their way home. The darkness often consumed faith in reaching Great Alexandria, that is until the fire-burning Lighthouse parted the night sky and illuminated the secure Nile Delta and familiar shores. Jonlin Chen, although human and not 120 meters tall, is Cornell iGEM's guiding light and source of all hope during times of darkness. While we, less-skilled iGEM members, are literally drowning in incomplete minipreps and restriction digests and utterly clueless on where to begin, Jonlin is the one person we can count on to show us the way. Whether it is a frantic phone call in the morning before class or a 2am Groupme message of desperation, Jonlin is always ready to help. Her fire-burning passion for bioengineering and iGEM fuels our team and shines through the often gloomy labspace during exam weeks and consecutive weeks of unsuccessful transformations, and is an inspiration to us all.
Grace Livermore
Beyond the isles of man, in the shaded grove where the heavens gently caress the Earth sits the very heart of nature itself.  It is here that the land retains its pristine landscape, unfettered and untainted by the influences of mankind’s expansion.  The very natural order was under siege, and Mother Nature required a vanguard to fight on her behalf.  Using primitive arcane energies that shaped the Earth itself, the very essence of nature was harnessed, coalescing into a single being.  Thus, Grace came into being, so aptly named to be the saving grace of nature’s purity.
But where to start?  The damage done is great, but like all great heroes, small steps come before giant bounds, and Grace knew the perfect place to start.  She now works tirelessly on Cornell’s iGEM team, conducting research that can rectify the contamination that grips this planet.  Despite all her continuing dedication to the team, she never fails to forget the roots from which she came.  An avid rock climber, she enjoys scaling the formidable walls to att"

After we tried so many times, we found the results had very high false positive rate. When we looked for reasons why we can not make it , we found something in wiki of Team: Washington.   https://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Magnetosomes/GibsonVectors The pSB standard BioBrick vectors available in iGEM are not suit for efficient multiple-insert cloning beyond three fragments. The primary problem with a standard pSB is the self-ligation of the two NotI sequences located on both the BioBrick prefix and suffix. These cohesive ends prevent fragments from being incorporated efficiently and correctly.

It's smart to take part
Knowing how important it is to collaborate with other iGEM teams, sharing knowledge and helping improve each other, throughout the year we ""AFCM Egypt"" team filled in the surveys of many teams ,which helped the other teams get more accurate results, and had several video calls with three teams and we helped each other with different aspects of our projects exchanging ideas about the our proposals and discussing the hypotheses , study designs, the novelty of the ideas and most important of them all how to apply the idea in real life and how it impacts our communities. It was so fruitful. We enjoyed a lot, but the most funny part of our collaborations was the selfies we took every time by the end of our calls ^_^
First collaboration was with the Swedish team ""Lund "". As each team explained their project to the other. And we helped Lund with the methods of characterization as by providing suggestions on how they'll characterize the part they use in their project.
The second team we collaborated with was the French team "" iGEM IONIS "". It was a great team; as we know iGEM is not only about science, we had so much fun during our calls even while we were explaining our projects and the hard steps that faced us during our work and helping each other to find solutions for the problems. We also helped Franconia with their survey as our team members translated it into Arabic and also asked our colleagues at the college and other non-medical individuals from different educational institutions in Egypt to fill-in the translated survey for them. We're preparing to exchange online lectures as we will give a lecture via video conference to the students in their college speaking about our project and lab work in exchange with a lecture they give to our college students in the same way. They also sent us the name of an RNA modeling server which helped us modeling our protein parts.We really enjoyed our time with that team.
Last but not least was the German team ""iGEM Franconia"". The most innovative team we ever met. As usual we started our calls by explaining our projects. Then we discussed the modeling part as we offered them"

Our team consisted of one biologist, two biochemists, one natural scientist, one computer scientist, two mathematicians and three physicists.  Therefore our interdisciplinary team combines the different knowledge and skill sets of our members. We had a week of 'bootcamp' training in the Easter holidays where individuals were taught the basics of lab work and concepts we could employ in our project. Our project idea was decided during within the first few weeks of July after a lot of brainstorming and discussions with academics. The project lab work started following the completion of the interlab study in July. Unless otherwise stated, all the content documented on our Wiki was done by us.

Approaching Our Project From Another Perspective
During the development of our technology it became clear that a variety of hurdles would have to be overcome for our product to reach market.  These included areas surrounding safety of our technology to the public, perception of our technology by key decision makers and end-users, and the protection of the platform from competitors who would be interested in expanding into our market space.
A Composite Approach To ""Human Practices"" From a Company
What is Human Practices? More importantly, what relevance does it have to the formation of a company? How can we develop our ideas in an ethical, safe, and environmentally conscious ways to better the world?  Our human practice initiatives aimed at providing answers to these questions within the context of our companies target market: the oil and gas industry.
To achieve these aims we worked closely with our end-users and networked extensively with groups to gain important insight into the development of our product.  We worked to analyze and predict the appropriate safety and containment solutions that would be required to not only provide a safe environment to our end-users, but also to prevent our end-user or other competitors from developing our ideas. Finally, we aimed to share our experiences and learning with new iGEM groups.
Networking Events
We attended a variety of events over the last year to create contacts within the business and synthetic biology communities. Through this we have met individuals involved in a vast number of different industries with a wide array of backgrounds. These meetings are summarized in the table below.

Tufts,2015,Team:Tufts#app scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," been a pressing issue for small biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Over the past decade there has been an increasing number of “patent trolls”; companies which patent ideas for the sole purpose of suing other corporations for infringing on their intellectual property. To curb the number of patent trolls, Congress passed the America Innovates Act in 2012 creating the inter partes review (IPR). IPR simplifies the court system so that if a patent troll were to sue a company, a judge would look over the case and determine if the suit is just a patent troll being frivolous, or if there is a legitimate case to be heard. The case is then settled in a quick, timely manner which is cost effective for the company being sued. The IPR system, however, has benefited some industries more than it has benefitted others. High technology companies have hundreds or thousands of patents, so if a patent troll sues them they still have many other patents they can depend on for revenue. biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies on the other hand, often invest millions of dollars into a single drug, rendering themselves more vulnerable to a lawsuits. Even though IPR reform was poised to help both industries, hedge funds have found a loophole to manipulate the system. Hedge funds sue biotech or pharma companies (whose profits depend on few patents), buy their stock after the price drops with the lawsuit --  lowering the company’s ability to make a profit -- and then dropping the suit: short selling the stock.
  Patent issues do not always negatively impact biotechnology companies. In the Supreme Court case, Bowman v. Monsanto Co: Monsanto, a large chemical and agribusiness, sued Vernon Bowman, a farmer in Indiana, on the grounds that patented seeds cannot be saved and planted in the next growing season without permission of the patent owner. The Supreme Court sided with Monsanto, holding that farmers must buy new seeds each year to avoid patent infringement [2]. The greater implication of the case is that it established a standard that it is legal to hold a patent over living organisms and their genetic code. This ruling protects the biotechnology industry by ensuring that inventors maintain ownership over their products and their products progeny if initial product can self-replicate, however it raises many ethical concerns:
        Can large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies abuse these patent rights? Monsanto, for example, has filed over 140 patent infringement cases over farmers, including cases in which a farmer’s crop is accidentally contaminated with Monsanto’s seeds [2]. Legal suits have forced private farms and small businesses into using the company’s products -- or worse driving them bankrupt.

Seminar & Conference
This summer, our team has participated in two Meet-ups to have a seminar with other iGEM teams. We have been to Taiwan to talk with team Chang Gung University and NCTU-Formosa. We have also held a small Meet-up for south China iGEM teams and talked with undergraduate team SYSU-China, SYSU-Software and high school team SKLBC-China, SKLBC-GDSYZX and so on. Every seminar, we all aimed at one topic such as team building, connection the “Dry” and “Wet”. We have made great achievements and summary plenty of useful tips for new iGEM teams to learn and follow. Also，we attended the 6th China Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Forum to interview some specialists about synthetic biology and our project.
(Talk with Team Chang Gung University )
A.Meet-up with iGEMers in Taiwan
Our team member Roderick paid a visit to Hsinchu in Taiwan in July 2015 for an academic exchange with iGEMers from NCTU. The agenda is about the talent education of NCTU-Formosa.
(Pose with Prof. Chen and Team NCTU-Formosa)
In the aspect of team building, we can learn much from the method practiced in NCTU-Formosa’s recruiting and selecting talents. Generally speaking, there are three steps in their team building.
1.Every fall semester, Department of Biology offers the course “Introduction to Synthetic Biology”. Before the course is open to the students, the professors will inform them of the knowledge and the iGEM to draw attention of the students.
2.At the beginning of the course, the class will be divided into many groups. The professors will teach the basic knowledge and practice of Synthetic Biology meanwhile the teaching assistants will teach the method of literatures searching and reading. During the course, the students will be required to read the former projects and present what they have learned.
3.At the end of the semester, every group will be asked to do a final report and present it. The format is that every group should put forward their creative idea and primary plan. Afterwards, some best students will be selected according to their academic performance.

When the gene is inserted it will be controlled by the same T7 promoter. This plasmid is one of the six prototypes we are developing, the comparison of these plasmids will identify the best system for the developing of this technology.
For this experiment we needed a bacteria lineage with the Plug&Play prototype plasmid. So we transformed electrocompetent E. coli (Bl21(DE3)) cells with 1 uL (80 ng) of the Plug&Play prototype. Then, we prepared electrocompetent cells using this transformed bacteria, producing a Plug&Play Machine ready to receive the kanamycin resistance gene.
We transformed the electrocompetent Plug&Play Machine cells with a gradient of our purified PCR-product (kanamycin resistance gene flanked by a loxP and a lox66): 10 ng, 100 ng and 1000 ng. These concentrations were chosen using the mathematical model that the group already had developed. After transformation, the cells (50 ul) were left for 40 min in 1 mL LB medium without antibiotic, for recovering from the transformation stress.
The LB medium (1 mL) where the bacteria were recovering was equally divided in three LB solid plates. One plate had ampicillin (100 ug/mL) and IPTG (1 mM), the second had kanamycin (50 ug/mL) and IPTG (1 mM) and the last one had both antibiotics (ampicillin (100 ug/mL) and kanamycin (50 ug/mL)) and IPTG (1 mM). The plates were left in incubation for 15 h at 37°C. As a control, the pET15b (25 ng) commercial plasmid was used for an independent transformation of the E. coli (Bl21(DE3)) lineage and plated in the same three kind of plates. The pET15b plasmid has a gene that confers resistance to ampicillin.
Our control worked as expected, the bacteria grew in the ampicillin plate but no in the kanamycin plate nor the plate with both antibiotics (Fig. 1). For the bacteria transformed with 10 ng of PCR-product, we found growth just in the ampicillin plate, which means that the bacteria had the Plug&Play plasmid, but no recombination had happened (Fig. 2).
For the bacteria transformed with 100 ng and 1000 ng of PCR-products we found colonies in the three plates. Find colonies in the plate with both antibiotics (Fig. 3 and Fig."

darwin
Program Description
Version control systems sych as git and svn focus on differences between lines. Since most DNA file formats split DNA to fixed-length lines, many lines are changed at once, for example, when inserting a single new line. darwin does away with that by producing a formatted file representing each ORF on its own line of text, making each edit only modify a single line of the output text.
Genes can be very long. To combat this, darwin will sample a section of every newly inserted ORF and compare it to nearby ORFs; if the new ORF is similar to another ORF, it is counted as “edited,” and darwin only records the character-by-character changes required to transform the old ORF into the new ORF.
Finally, darwin uses concurrency to help speed up the process. File I/O is typically extremely slow, much slower than processing a file data already in memory. Splitting the processing concurrently helps to open up that speed bottleneck.

Relative fluorescence intensity was calculated with normalization of the OD600 value. For Relative FI ratios, relative fluorescence intensity of each control group was set arbitrarily at 1.0, and the levels of the other groups were adjusted correspondingly. This experiment was run in three parallel reactions, and the data represent results obtained from at least three independent experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.01.
Collectively, this is an elaborate part for an optimal split-GFP reporting system, which was easy to be edit as a functional protein-protein interaction system.

Notice:Except for specially mentioned, all the following vectors were constructed by In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (produced by Clontech). To be brief, every fragment of desired DNA was linearized by primers designed following the protocol provided by Takara infusion cloning guide to ensure accurately 15 base pair (bp) overlap homology with each adjacent fragments. The gel-purified fragments were mixed with 2uL infusion cloning kit Premix solution and ddH2O was used to adjust the mixture to 10uL. The amount of the added fragments was based on the Takara infusion cloning guide.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today the project overview will be discussed during our general meeting with Dr. Kosuri.  Fasih will then help us take our glycerol stock from Dr. Yeates and plate them to select for making a starter culture tomorrow.
Meetng notes:  site direct mutagenesis with whole plasmid.  Need DpnI
Try Gibson assembly:  Need Gibson and PCR enzymes, DpnI (cuts methylated GATC to remove old plasmid)
Conclusions:  Upon retrieving the clones, it was realized that they were in the -20 degree fridge instead of the -80 degree fridge.  The entirety of the tube was used to plate the cells on an agar plate with ampicillin, with the help of Tristan.  He did not work over a flame. Conclusions:  If colonies grow, we will make a starter culture tomorrow, and the large culture Friday.  Hopefully something grows on our plates :(
Intro: researched protocols for glycerol stock replating. Lab-wide meeting with Sri. Watched Tristan plate our glycerol stock (-80 is in 7718, -20 is in 7736). Further reading of Yeates' methods. Looked at dynamic light scattering and native page for size analyses of cage with and without thrombin cleavage. I think we could get away with doing a normal sds-page to see if thrombin cleaves the cage. However, we will first need to verify proper cage structure with another method (dls?).
Glycerol Protocols: Addgene looks like a good place for protocols. Streaking pattern is good to know. https://www.addgene.org/plasmid-protocols/create-glycerol-stock/
Lab Meeting Pertinent Notes: Sri said normal site directed mutagenesis could work and is worth a shot (primer anneals both 20 bp regions flanking insert nucleotides). We would need DpnI.
Glycerol Plating: Use a flame ("

Overview
Biolink did not progress only in the lab or the office, it was driven by countless known and unknown factors, actors and events, mingled together in a network. With our policy and practice efforts we try to identify some of these influencing entities and position our project within the network. In the following sections, you can have a glimpse at decisive factors that drove our project in it’s progress, and continue to influence the progress of Biofilm technologies in the future.

Week 1: April 9th to April 15th
The summer semester  begins and the biological experiment comes, so this week we mainly focus on  acquiring the basic experimental skills. As we are green-hands in the field of  synthetic biology, everyone feels very disturbed, One of our advisor Wu Xin  cheers us up and teaches us how to transform, the protocol of plasmid  extraction, how to run on a gel for restriction analysis, how to recover the  DNA and ligate two target fragment.
Monday,  April 9th
We learn how to  isolate the plasmids and how to run on a gel for restriction analysis.  Everything is new for us!!!
Tuesday,  April 10th
Today we complete  the inoculation of BL21, K176003, lysis, RBS1.0
Wednesday,  April 11th
The task today is  as follow:
Inoculate K176003,  RBS 1.0.
Transfer PBAD into competence BL21.
Make media for two  sleeves of plates, one sleeve with Kan antibiotic added, the other with Amp.
Thursday,  April 12th
Today we pick one  colony to a new culture medium, isolate the plasmid K176003, RBS1.0 on the morning  and isolate the plasmid PBAD at night.
Friday, April 13th
Saturday,  April 14th
Everyone is busy,  so there is no experimental plan.
Sunday,  April 15th
To make us more  skilled at the experimental manipulation, we inoculate K176003, RBS1.0 PBAD"

4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMMs?
6. What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
This document can be viewed on the Manchester iGEM team’s page. We used this document to assist in the formulation of our business plan (particularly our distribution strategy) and our safety protocols.
Other Collaborations
Pedestal
With help from Mr Michael Rampe and Mr Peter Reeves from Pedestal our team designed a 3D rendering of our prototype, H2GEM, which will soon be available on their website. With this rendering, our team was able to conceptualise our design in the physical space for its potential use in marketing H2GEM.
The Australasian iGEM Social
During the proceedings of the Synthetic Biology Australasia Conference, our team met up with our colleagues from Melbourne, Auckland and University of Sydney in Kirribilli, and presented our projects together during the iGEM session of the conference. The two days of the conference were capped off with social drinks and an impromptu trip to Luna Park, which was kindly organised by our iGEM Representative, Abigail Sison.
Team Franconia Game Contribution
“There has been an incident at the iGEM Giant Jamboree 2017 in Boston and numerous young scientists have been contaminated with some of the most dangerous viruses of our time!” Team Franconia developed an app that will run an augmented reality game, for which the Macquarie Australia iGEM team, H2ydroGEM, will contribute by attaching a small QR-code (approx. 4 by 4 centimeters/1.5 by 1.5 inches) on our station, for players to partake in the game, as well as attract our iGEM family to our station.
Rate My Gel
H2ydroGEM is contributing to this game developed by the team from the University of Sydney, adding to the thrill of the iGEM spirit.
Methane Emissions
The H2ydroGEM team helped the 2017 UNebraska-Lincoln team in providing an Australian perspective to the issue of methane production.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", riboflavin (RF) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) enhance EET more than five times, with much lower concentrations than those needed for anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) shuttling. So we choose flavins as one entry point to enhance the electricity output of MFCs. [9]
Figure 9. Comparison of co-factor EET model(a) and diffusion EET model(b), (b) also reveals the electron pathway by endogenous flavins
In EET model, outward current ﬂows from interior of cells to outer membrane (OM) and extracellular anodes through a metal-reducing conduit (Mtr pathway), where electrons (from NADH, the intracellular electron carrier) ﬂow through the menaquinol pool, CymA (inner membrane [IM] tetraheme c-type cytochromes [c-Cyts]), MtrA (periplasmic decaheme c-Cyts), MtrB (β-barrel trans-OM protein) and ﬁnally to MtrC and OmcA (two OM decaheme c-Cyts). However, the principle of how flavins function still remains controversial. [10]
Traditional model demonstrates that flavins carry the electrons from OM c-Cyts to electrode by diffusion, which has been in debate due to thermodynamic disproof. Recently, another interfacial EET model was proposed, where flavin may serve as a co-factor binding to OmcA or MtrC to dictate EET. Fully oxidized flavin (Ox) accepts one electron from reduced heme of OM c-Cyts, and binds to OM c-Cyts as a cofactor in the semiquinone (Sq) form with shifted potential. Ox/Sq redox cycling in OM c-Cyts donates electrons to electrodes in a one electron reaction mode via direct contact.[10]
Figure 10. Pathway for engineered riboflavin and FMN production E. coli.
Although Shewanella uses endogenous flavins to mediate electrons, the amount of its production is deficient and multi-tasks brought by self-engineering may also reduce the transfer efficiency. As a consequence, we had two strategies to construct the zymophyte and further improve the production. Firstly, we introduced flavin producing genes using the E.coli as chassis. Secondly, we get an engineered B.subtilis strain from the lab of Dr. Tao Chen [11]("

According to a European study  done in 2008 called Mapping the maze,getting women to the top in research., only 15% of women occupy top research position in Europe. However, the number of SB P.I. should be analyzed through the filter of history. In a new field, it would be expected in a world where bias would not be present anymore to have way more women at those positions.

Speakers at SB Conferences : effects of an active gender policy
   SBX.0 conferences accompanied the development of synthetic biology. They provide a great way to investigate the evolution of gender ratio since the birth of synthetic biology. Moreover, the presence/absence of women as speakers is a known indicator of gender bias and specially of active gender policy. Indeed, several social mechanisms are in place lead to fewer female speakers that could be expected: self censorship, unconscious stereotypes, unconscious choice of only male speakers... However, having female speakers at conference is a key point. It allows women, to gain confidence but also to act as role model for women attending the conference.
To study SB conferences, available programs online were downloaded. Data referring to the number of speakers but also to posters were recorded. The data-set could not be completed for certain years due to the impossibility of finding the data online.
The sex ratio of the speakers have followed a very interesting evolution. It has been multiplied by 3 from SB1 to SB5. This could indicate a change of policy considering speakers. Most likely, the first conferences invited speakers without taking into consideration the gender dimension. Might it be due to some complaints or the raise in awareness of the conferences organizers, the numbers went up. This example is interesting because it clearly show an interest in the subject by the involved community.
Two main conclusions can be drawn on posters. First, the sex ratio of authors in posters has changed throughout the years. Secondly, this number is not as high as the sex ratio in labs. The question is why? The points described above could be underlying reasons, however it is very difficult to truly go beyond this with only those numbers.

Leaflet 4: This leaflet also explains synthetic biology, heredity and provides some examples and possibilities. However they also gave an example about plant breeding. They mention the advantage of accurately create a tomato plant with better properties like an enlargement of the fruit. In the end they sum up some pros and cons of the recent developments in synthetic biology.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling Stability Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"osome binding sites (RBS), would cause the system to be unstable. Therefore, we performed stability analysis to assess the conditions and constraints that the system gives three stable states.
Here we focus on examining the equilibrium points, at which all species-of-interest i.e. repressor proteins reach equilibrium and that their concentrations do not change with time (i.e. $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dz}{dt}=0$). Then, we can determine whether the equilibrium points are stable or unstable. A stable point is defined as: given a slight perturbation to an equilibrium point, the system automatically returns to the original point subsequently; while an unstable point is an equilibrium point where the system changes dramatically upon any perturbation. Moreover, parameters, such as relative efficiency of the promoter and binding affinity of the repressors to DNA, are known to have great influence on the stability of the equilibrium points. Therefore, in order to achieve a stable system, it is crucial to investigate the suitable numerical range of the parameters and accordingly, this will provide insights on the selection of proper combinations of parts in the circuits.
(I) Poincare-Perron Theorem
Poincare-Perron Theorem was employed for the stability analysis.
For the ODE system
Suppose $\overrightarrow{p_e}$ denotes an equilibrium concentration of the repressor proteins. Then $\overrightarrow{p_e}$ is stable or unstable as follows:
If the eigenvalues of $\overrightarrow{f'}$($\overrightarrow{p_e}$) all have negative real part, then $\overrightarrow{y_e}$ is asymptoticallystable;
If any of the eigenvalues of $\overrightarrow{f'}$($\overrightarrow{p_e}$) has positive real part, then $\overrightarrow{y_e}$ is unstable.
In order to obtain the equilibrium concentrations of the three repressor proteins, we have to solve $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dz}{dt}=0$, such that:
Where $x_s$, $y_s$ and $z_s$ denote the equilibrium concentration of the repressor proteins. However, solving a nonlinear ODE system analytically is hard and the solution is expected to be too lengthy and complex. We therefore employed piecewise-linear functions (Jutta,Gebert & Nicole,Radde & Gerhard-Wilhelm,Weber, 2007; Polynikis, Hogan, & Di Bernardo, 2009) to approximate the Hill’s term in the equation as follow:

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," coffee addict: he is the first to arrive in the morning, to turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet and… the coffee-maker. He can do all kinds of stuff, either in the wet lab or on his laptop. He realized a collaboration with the Eindhoven team, but his biggest work was with our biobricks. Indeed, he is the part submission responsible, and took care of the biobricks validity. He filled the register and sent all the parts to iGEM. If you want to see him, he will present our project during the Giant Jamboree.
Benoît Pons
Benoît is the youngest of the team, and is partner in crime with Thomas on the bad jokes. He is a jack of all trades in the lab: autoclave, mediums, cloning, culture… they hold no secrets to him. Besides his hyperactivity, he took care of all the communication, being the link between the press and us. Moreover he is a great speaker, and will present our project in Boston with Alexandre and Blandine.
Marine Pons
Marine is our mister freeze addict. She is the iGEM association president, but mostly a great scientist with strong knowledge in bacterial genetics: she is the leader for the wet lab, managing all the experiments to do. She has huge responsibilities and leads this project with skill. She had the idea to use a circadian regulation and designed all the genetic regulation of ApiColi.
Mélany Tanchon
Melany is our bioinformatics specialist, author of all the modeling done in this project. Without this real asset, we could not compare experimental results with theory, and have an idea of its feasibility. She developed a modeling collaboration with Leuven team, but also created our wiki with Louise. Finally she teamed up with Thomas to clone on the butyrate pathway.
Blandine Trouche
Blandine is an essential member of the team because of her role: indeed, she is the iGEM treasurer and manages our finances which are limited. She gave her help where it was needed in the experiments, she also realized a collaboration with Ankara team and was our very own French/English  translator and reviewer. She represented us during the meetup France in Bordeaux, and will continue to defend the project in Boston, presenting it alongside Alexandre and Benoît.

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
Probably combinations of UV (UVA and /or UVB) and visible light work better.       It is not clear which kind of photoreceptors are relevant for MAAs synthesis and       the action spectrum may depend on the biological species. This issue should be explored in your system.
Would you please suggest anything to increase the yield of porphyra-334 compared to shinorine? Do you think whether the change in serine/threonine proportion would have an effect on the ratio porphyra-334/shinorine?
The effect of variations in the proportion of amino acids is worth to be tested         as a control parameter of the porphyra-334/shinorine biosynthesis ratio.         From the chemical point of view, these two MAAs are very similar and there is little         to be done in order to promote preferential accumulation of any of them.
In your opinion, do we need to add some additional compounds to our sunscreens to increase photostability of MAAs. If yes, what compounds we can use?
MAAs are very photostable in aqueous solution. Even so, the photodecomposition         quantum yields are lower in the presence of direct micelles, mainly for         cationic ones (see Orallo et al. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2017, 16, 1117–1125).         In the case you obtain oxo-MAAs you should prevent them from oxidation;         imino-MAAs are more resistant in terms of redox reactions. Under extreme pH values,         MAAs tend to decompose via hydrolysis of the amino acid moieties.
How do you think, is the combination of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 reasonable for sunscreens?
It is optimal from the stability point of view. However, combination         with other filters may be necessary to extend the protection within         the whole UV-B and UV-A ranges. In this case, the stability of the mixture          should be verified.  On the other side, the poor partition of these MAAs in          nonpolar media should be considered in the design of formulations for topical         sunscreens containing them.

Kai:
Would you think that for example our diagnostic device would be helpful to reduce the burden in such areas? Especially the financial burden? Because the major point is that it is affordable.
Dr. Courtright:
A little bit of history here. The ITI has supported the Carter Center to set up a laboratory facility [...] in order to run a whole bunch of laboratory tests to look at infection in that setting. It’s taken years and years and years to get it set up and I think it is operational now. However, we don’t have any real data coming up from it. To me that’s an indication of if you have overly technologically reliance systems that really require a lot of stuff and a lot of well-trained people and a good management system. If there is too much technical and management support that is needed. That things don’t really run well. We need systems and I’m hoping what you are talking about be something that is much easier to implement in the place like Ethiopia without having a huge overlay of technical backstopping and also a huge overlay of management backstopping.
Daniel C.:
That’s exactly the point of our project, which we hope is successful.
Dr. Courtright:
I do see there is a role for better tools for diagnosis of infection, particularly in settings where we are unclear as to what is going on. And Ethiopia stands out as the primary place for trying to figure out what is going on.
Daniel C.:
Can you give us rough outline of how that looks like in the field. I mean do you do general screenings of the population or do you do small samples? What’s the range of statistics that you gather?
Dr. Courtright:
Well it’s not that I’ve gathered. I mean the Carter Center with support from ITI has actually taken both approaches. Some initial small studies in focal areas but they have also, as part of their programs, collected specimens [...]. The initial challenge has been that the specimens have been stored for quite a while and as you might imagine there has been a breakdown in the composition of the specimen. So at the end of the day, when they run these specimens: Are we actually getting a correct reading or have the specimens been degraded so much that they are useless? How would one asses that? There’s a lot of data there, how meaningful the data is, how it can be used is completely open for question. So new tools in my mind would be most welcome.
Daniel C.:
When you were talking about specimens I just want to clarify what did you mean by that?

Synthetic DNA as an information storage system:
Synthetic biologists engineer nature to create                                         solutions to real-world problems. We decided to incorporate some synthetic                                         biology into our DNA information storage workshop to expand the general                                         population knowledge about that field. If DNA is able to compact such a large                                         amount of data in a very small volume, why not use it as an information storage                                         system? - would a synthetic biology scientist think. Furthermore, digital                                         information is being generated at an increasing rate and the storage of this                                         information requires a huge amount of servers which take up a lot of space. So                                         why not using DNA to store digital data?
A single DNA base contains more information than one                                         bit. DNA is made from a combination of four different nucleotide residues                                         (A,T,C,G), while one bit can only take up to two values (0 or 1 in binary                                         code). So one DNA base pair could contain two binary code bits of information                                         (i.e. A=00, T=01, C=10, G=11). Therefore, theoretically, information is much                                         more condensed in DNA than in bits.
Actually, there are still several factors making DNA                                         information storage not as practical as current systems. However, the increase                                         in efficiency and the drop in the cost of DNA synthesis and sequencing has                                         dramatically increased the likelihood of using DNA as an information storage                                         system. For this reason, Church et al, 2012 encoded multiple copies of the book                                         he wrote, Regenesis, in DNA and then used next-generation sequencing to read                                         it. Instead of using the maximum compaction system that DNA offers (2 bits per                                         base), the authors used one bit per base (A or C for 0, G or T for 1). This has                                         multiple advantages, one of it being avoiding extreme GC content.
To integrate synthetic biology in our DNA storage                                         workshop we reproduced the work done by Church et al, 2012 to write our own DNA                                         messages . While the authors considered secondary structure, designed a block                                         system to order their data from DNA and encoded words, images, and a javascript                                         file, our system only considered GC content to write messages of a few words or                                         mp3 files in binary code. However, our system was perfectly usable for our                                         purpose. We created a bash script which takes a text input message and converts                                         it to binary by the ASCII code using the xxd command. Then,"

For further collaboration in this and next year , our six universities in Beijing and Tianjin (BNU NKU THU TJU TUST UCAS) had this meet-up together in  China institute of biophysics on September 16, In this conference we talked about our experiental plans and HP cooperations in the future. At last we all agree that there should be more relationship among us , we can find more oppotunities in spreading synthetic biology knowledge to senior and junior high schools and use others experimental facilities in next year's experimental part.

Wiki Construction
Rik, Teresa and Tjaša learned how to design a wiki in one summer. Combining everyone’s skills we managed to construct an interactive and user friendly wiki, giving the right importance to the layout as well as to the content. Alba Ramos Álvarez , a Fine Arts student, and Wen supported the Wiki-team with their illustration skills. Also, Sophia, the team captain of XMU-China 2012 helped us a lot with the design and coding of the wiki. All icons used in this wiki page were made by Icons8 from www.flaticon.com licensed by CC BY 3.0 .
Finances
The sponsoring team consisted of Kevin, Rik, Walter, Marlène and Wen. The sponsor team was involved in finding and contacting our sponsors . Kevin, supported by Rik, was our treasurer, and together they regulated money flow.
Safety
Tjaša, together with Miguel's help, was responsible for safety within the lab and safety regulations by the government. Marlène was in charge of providing all data for the GMO-permit extension, which was needed for the greenhouse experiment.
Other Team Roles
Wen was the Captain of BananaGuard. Teresa acted as the secretary and Michiel functioned as vice secretary. Marlène arranged our amazing team clothes and she also organized the trip to the Jamboree .
Supervisors
Christian Fleck was the head of the whole team. Kees van der Ark, Marnix Vlot, Nico Claassens and Stamatios Damalas were the supervisors of all the subprojects involving experimental work in the laboratory, while Robert Smith and Ruben van Heck supervised the modelling part. Gert Kema and Fernando Garcia Bastidas from Plant Research International supervised the greenhouse and Fusarium oxysporum experiments.

Week 9:  19/06/2017-25/06/2017
Wet lab:
•Erica and Emaleen did plasmid preps on JM109 cells which contained our     expression vector pET15b.
•Jamie and Steph digested the pET15b stock and ran it on an agarose gel in     order to quantify the concentration.
Human practices:
•Fortnightly Skype meeting with Open Insulin Team! We were getting excited     to show them our first results.
Week 10:  26/06/2017-02/07/2017
Wet lab:
•Our gBlocks finally arrived!!!
•Alex and Jamie digested our pSB1C3 stock and ligated the cytoplasmic and     Ecotin-tagged gBlocks into them.
•Erica, Courtney and Grace transformed these vectors into TOP10 E.coli     cells – colonies grew for each of the transformations.
Week 11:  03/07/2017-9/07/2017
This was the start of our winter break – however, the team took advantage     of the break and planned to get a lot of lab work done.
Wet lab:
•Grace and Emaleen performed a screening colony PCR on the transformations     from last week for verification.
•Ruby and Courtney ligated our Bacillus secretion gBlocks (YncM tagged)     into pSB1C3.
•Before transforming these vectors into TOP10 E.coli, we had to make a new     batch of these cells competent. Alex was in charge of this.
Week 12:  10/07/2017-16/07/2017
Wet lab:
•Jamie redid the colony screening PCR on the TOP10 E.coli transformed with     our cloned pSB1C3 vectors from last week in order to get a clearer gel. The     results showed that Cytoplasmic Winsulin, Ecotin Winsulin and Ecotin     Proinsulin in pSB1C3 need to be retransformed into TOP10 E.coli.
•Steph transformed the pSB1C3 vectors with the YncM gBlocks inserted last     week into TOP10 E.coli. These transformations did not work and we believe     that it is due to a problem with the ligation of the gBlock into pSB1C3.

    In the project, we discovered a new effective acid tolerance gene—msmK，which can improve the survival rate of Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 by 213.67 times at pH 4.0. And we constructed a promising food-safe grade chassis microorganism Lactococcus lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmK-cspD2, which can provide more solutions to the acid and cold stress problems in fermentation industry. Besides, we also obtained two patents in the industrial application of Lactic acid bacteria.       (Patent number: 201811026830.6 & 201811042938.4)

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of integration via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination [22] . They found that gene disruption in these regions did not affect the growth rate of Y. lipolytica, which made us consider using them to integrate our genes of interest.
Gene integration via CRISPR could cause gene drive, which occurs when a particular set of genes spreads rapidly throughout the population of an organism [23] . The use of gene drive violates the iGEM competition rules, so we will not use it in this project. To avoid gene drive, our mentor, Dr. David Bernick, suggested that we use microinjection of the Cas9 protein. However, micropipettes cannot penetrate the cell wall of Y. lipolytica, which makes this technique unusable [24] . The authors of Riveline and Nurse (2009) offered an alternative method that employs microfabricated channels to hold individual yeast cells while a piezoelectric unit shears them [24] . With the limited timeframe of our project, this option seemed too complex, so we abandoned CRISPR/Cas9 as our method of gene integration.
We also considered using homologous recombination (HR) to integrate our genes of interest. HR requires that our gene cassette be flanked by 1 kilobase (kb) regions homologous with a location in the Y. lipolytica genome. When a double-strand break naturally occurs within the cell, the cell can repair the break using homologous pieces, known as homology arms (HAs). HAs neighboring our genes of interest will signal the cell to repair the break and integrate our genes into the genome. Although HR is a great option for genomic integration, Y. lipolytica performs NHEJ more often than HR. In a typical strain of Y. lipolytica, using HR dramatically increases the time needed for our genes of interest to incorporate into the genome. Fortunately, Verbeke et al. (2013) showed that HR rates in Y. lipolytica increased by 56% when they knocked out the KU70 gene [25] . The KU70 gene regulates the NHEJ pathway in Y. lipolytica, and eliminating it forces the yeast to repair breaks using HR. We chose a strain that has KU70 knocked out for this reason, so HR is a viable option for us.
Cre-lox site-specific recombination is another method we explored for genomic integration. This technique uses a recombination enzyme native to bacteriophage P1, Cre recombinase, and lox sites that the"

About USTC_Software
A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

Saturday
Made a culture of XL1-Blue cells with 250mL LB medium, growing cells to an optimal OD of 0.6 to transform. Looks like this will be going overnight, as growth is slow. Yesterday’s transformation products finally worked without incident: making them into overnight cultures  so that we can have stocks in case of temporary incompetence.
Week 6 7/21 - 7/25
Monday
We are spending the week attempting to clone our mutators into our IPTG-inducible promoter+GFP plasmid. We used up some of the fragment isolated mutators we had, so we gel purified more from wild type. The mutators and IPTG+GFP were appropriately digested (mutators with XbaI and PstI and IPTG+GFP with SpeI and PstI). We also performed a cell competency test on our cells (which are probably not competent, knowing our luck).
Tuesday
At the suggestion of our advisors, we are now dephosphorylating our plasmids before cloning to decrease background (which was a problem with our previous digestions). This should help a lot yay!! We dephosphorylated IPTG+GFP/S+P and gel purified the dephosphorylated digest. We cloned the mutators into IPTG+GFP using a ratio of 3:1 insert:vector in a 10uL reaction with 25ug of vector. We also submitted IPTG+GFP, mCherry+AroF, promoter+TyrR for sequencing. (We also made a ton of cam plates so no one freaks out the next time they’re transforming something and realizes there are no plates). This was a super late day--at lab past midnight=fun, fun, fun :)
Wednesday
Our SOB is contaminated and an aliquot of SOC that was never used before contaminated. What is this madness?!?! More SOB was made. We also colony PCRed IPTG+GFP, mCherry+AroF, and promoter+TyrR in preparation for negative sequencing results (Always be prepared is one of our many mottos. We stole it from the Boy Scouts.). We also got Tyrosine!!!!
Thursday
Well, our sequencing results came back, and it appears we have MAJOR issues with mislabelling. While we do have IPTG+GFP confirmed, aroF and Tyr"

For research: Find out about how to make our project safer, how to incorporate the encryption project into the lactose project, probiotics background information, how to improve the encapsulation process from Imperial College London.
6-7 to 6-11 Summary
During this week:
The Lactobacillus neotype strain has not arrived yet in Steele's lab. Wes has some MRS broth we can use to culture the strains.
Contacted Steele for lactobacillus plasmids and expression strain to express the plasmid iGEM constructs
Received primers on 6-7 and I helped elute the primers. We followed the formula: [(Amount of nm) x 1000pm/1nm] / 60pm total dilution. This gave us how much RNase free water to use for elution. After elution then we made 3x 30uL aliquots of the primers, except for the two sequencing primers.
6-08: Miniprep 2 pellets of pBAD18BB, 2 pellets of pBAD33BB, 2 pellets of YgiV, and 2 pellets of RcsB. Used the new Miniprep kit (6-08) and documented concentrations from the Nanodrop. Got the MRS premix broth from Wes.
6-09: The RcsB transformations Sarah and Hannah plated had about 10 colonies with the control plate with one colony. The YgiV transformation had no colonies on it. So Yue Wu and I re-did the ligation and transformation. We also ran a gel of the ligation Sarah did.
Bile promoter research:
The Lactobacillus acidophilus neotype arrived today and will pick up 6-10. Need to make plates and broth to make freezer stocks of the culture.
Lactobacillus bile promoter primers?

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Hardware
Designing the XY-Plane
In order for TERRA to select for specific locations to dispense fluids, we needed a method of either moving the output tube or the vessel, such as a 96-well plate. We ultimately decided to move the vessel, as that would minimize the length of and amount of dead volume in the output tube. Our team designed an active XY-plane, which would allow us to move the platform in the X- and Y-direction to target a specific location. This XY-plane needed to have the following functions and features: the ability for translational motion; a homing system; a control system; a manufacturing method; material; and motors.
The following morphological chart illustrates our potential means of accomplishing each function or feature and the chosen options are written in green.

Translational Motion: We chose to use a system of timing belts and pulleys as it is more accurate and creates less backlash than threaded rods. The timing belts and pulleys are also more cost effective, as they are as accurate as higher-end threaded rods, which would be necessary for smooth translational motion. The pulleys are also easier to mount and integrate into the design of the XY-plane than threaded rods.
Homing: Our team chose to utilize contact switches in order to home our system as they were the easiest to integrate into the existing design of TERRA and were low-cost. We had briefly considered manual, user-controlled homing, but realized that it would result in a great amount of human error, as the user would need to approximate the distance from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Templates#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," M9 minimal media. Following an incubation time of 12 hours (OD600=0.6) cells were induced with IPTG (1 mM).
To assess product levels over time, 7.5 ml samples were taken at several time points (8.5 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 48 hrs). Each sample was spun down for 45 minutes at 3750 rpm and 4°C, and supernatant was separated from pellet.
Pellet was resolubilzed in 500 µl 1x PBS and lysed by ultra-sonification (3x20 seconds; on ice). Finally the sample has been centrifuged and supernatant decanted to 1.5 ml tubes. Frozen with nitrogen the sample was handed over for mass spectrometry.
Supernatant was frozen with nitrogen and lyophilized for 12 hours ( at ~-45°C and ~0,1 mbar) to remove liquid residues. The lyophilisate was resuspended in 500 microliters methanol and vortexed. Supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube, which was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The sample was then handed over to mass spectrometry for further analysis.
Data Acquisition
Sampling
Two empty 3.2 mm die-cut sheets were prepared from Whatman 903 filter paper. Afterwards, 5 µl of the sample were pipetted on the sheets and dried in the fridge overnight.
Sample preparation
The dried sheets were extracted for ca. 20 min with 100 μl solution 1. Then the polypropylen microtiter plates were centrifuged for ca. 2 minutes at 4000 rpm. Supernatant was vaporized at 55°C for 30 minutes at the blowing station until all liquid residues were removed. Subsequently the plate was warmed up for 1 minute at a cabinet dryer (65°C).
After drying 60 μl of solution 2 were added and the mircotiter plate tightly closed with micromates. The plate was shaken gently and heated up again for ca. 15 minutes at the cabinet dryer (65°C). Micromates were drawn off and supernatant vaporated on heating plates (55°C surface temperature) with a constant air stream. Again no liquid residues should be remaining. Samples were heated up for 1 minute in the cabinet dryer (65°C).
Finally 100 μl solution 3 were added (it is possible to dilute the sample up to factor 3 with solution 3). To"

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

Biohub 2.0
What is Biohub 2.0?
Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval and more convenient biological ideas sharing. It is constructed on the basis of iGEM's official database. The parts inside are filtered and ordered intelligently, and presented to users in a friendly way. Users can grade the parts they've used, or post critical articles under them and exchange ideas with other users. All the data collected in the community will be used for more accurate ordering.
More than a community, Biohub 2.0 is also a flexible plugin system, which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform. Plugins will have full access to the community's data, so plugin developers can make further analysis of the parts. It's also welcome to deploy plugins that implement useful synthetic biological algorithms. With this mechanism, new tools and algorithms can be acquainted by other scientists more quickly.
How to use it?
You may visit biohub.technology to have a try, or simply clone down our repository and run it locally. For more details, Please refer to our demonstration or installation guidance.
Motivation
The numerous parts provided by iGEM Parts Registry are precious to the biologists, but unfortunately displayed in a terrible way. For synthetic biologists with little or no knowledge about programming, the only approach to access the parts is by submitting the search box on the official pages, which is however too crude to use. The default matching algorithm defies multi-dimensional searching, and the default ordering is just wasting users' time. It's hopeless to get anything useful via this tool. Thus, a software to mine high-quality parts accurately is urgently needed.
With the data dumped from iGEM Parts Registry, which contains information like sample status or used times, the parts can be roughly ranked. But further ranking can only be accomplished after experiments are done, which requires the assistance from the whole community. Such feedback mechanism does exist in iGEM Parts Registry, which is called Experiences, but is seldom used probably because of its hard-to-use interface. We think a user-friendly forum centred on Biobricks is necessary, where users can grade the parts they've used, or share experiences with other"

The results from iGEM Stockholm team 2016 thus suggest that ThuricinS and the hybrid Laterusporulin-ThuricinS are potent inhibitors of the growth of E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa, respectively. However as the MIC tests were performed using cell lysates a clear conclusion cannot be drawn.
We purified our bacteriocins in order to specify the effect of our bacteriocins as single acting proteins. To assay the effect of our purified bacteriocins we performed a MIC test . The bacteriocins were dissolved in water from added to wells A-G, having the largest concentration possible at column A. The maximal concentration used is the half of the calculated concentration of the bacteriocin (Tabel 1). We used different MRSA strains to test the effect of the bacteriocins in order to investigate the possibility for the bacteriocins as substitutes for traditional antibiotic of which the bacteria have evolved resistance. The following strains where tested:
MRSA:CC398 – a methicillin and tetracyclin resistant S. aureus isolated from a patient, which have gained it from a pig. The MRSA:CC398 is called pig-MRSA, which is found in many pigs in Scandinavia. It is a huge contributor to the resistance development.
Hetero - VISA – a S. aureus strain. The strain is capable of growing at vancomycin concentration of >4 mg/L and have thereby gained relative vancomycin resistance. This is due to thickened walls of the strain, which is suggested to catch the vancomycin before entry Conly, J. M., & Johnston, B. L. (2002).

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Toxicity Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,"transferase catalyzes the formation of phytochelatin out of the precursor glutathione in plants and fungi (Grill et al., 1989). The enzyme transfers γ-Glu-Cys moieties of glutathione to glutathione or (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly, ultimately producing (γ-Glu-Cys)n+1-Gly peptides with n in the range from 2 to 10 (Figure 4). The phytochelatin synthase plays a crucial role in the metal detoxification process. There are reports (Heiss et al., 2003) that PCS is activated by heavy metal ions such as cadmium and copper in Arabidopsis thaliana cells. We think that heterologous expression of this enzyme in E. coli helps the bacterium to better endure the toxicity of the imported copper ions. The phytochelatin synthase is activated by heavy metal ions such as cadmium which can be seen in figure 4.
Figure 4: A: Schematic illustration of the phytochelatin synthase functioning. The C-terminal domain works as a local sensor of heavy metal ions, such as cadmium (Cd). Cysteine residues (C) bind Cd ions which are transferred to the activation site in the N-terminal catalytic domain. The activated domain catalyses the relocation of the γ-Glu-Cys moiety of a glutathione (GSH; γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) molecule onto a second glutathione molecule or an existing PCn molecule to form a PCn+1 product (Cobbett, 1999). B: Catalyzed reaction by phytochelatin synthase. The transpeptidase uses glutathione as a substrate and transfers γ-Glu-Cys moieties on glutathione or (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly to form phytochelatins ((γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly with n between 2 and 10).
In order to increase the cell’s resistance to oxidative stress a sophisticated approach is needed. An overexpression of the oxidative stress dependent regulators soxR and oxyR should improve the cell’s ability to cope with an elevated number of ROS. Various combinations of the defense mechanisms are tested in order to determine the ideal defense against oxidative stress in order to maximize the longevity in presence of heavy metals. Agents like phytochelatin which are rich in cysteine and/or histidine residues are meant to bind free metal ions to lower the potential for Fenton and/or Haber-Weiss reactions"

First meeting on Coli Rulez
In the last five weeks, we have been deciding on a project for our iGEM team this year. Finally, we came up with the idea of building a cellular automaton that will follow the rules 90, 110 and maybe 30.
The rules firstly described by Wolfram correspond to a deterministic model of cellular automaton. The spatial domain is divided into a fixed lattice. Each lattice is either in the on or off state. The next state of a lattice is determined by the state of its neighbours. Here, each line of a square grid is considered to represent the system state at time t. The next line state is determined thanks to its three neighbors from above.
Some rules particularly retained our attention:
the rule 30 whose emerging pattern seems random, without any sign of regularity.
the rule 90, also called Sierpinski triangles, with its nested pattern.
the rule 110, with localized structures, known to be a Turing-complete machine. The proof of this property has been made by Matthew Cook, professor at the Institue of Neuroinformatics in Zürich.
The genetic design of the rules was discussed. For the three rules chosen, they consist of combination of logical gates. Those logical gates will be implemented using recombinases.
As we are working with bacteria on a fixed grid, it is necessary to implement this organization with a spatial structure. This can be done with beads and a microfluidic chip. As the feasibility of such a device are not yet well-defined for the team members, we also"

I'm working as a post-doc with Prof. Blank at RWTH Aachen University. In my Ph.D. I worked under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Schmid (2008-2012) at TU Dortmund, and Prof. Matthias Reuss (2009-2011) at the University of Stuttgart, with a focus on elucidating the link between the central and aromatic metabolism of P. putida using a systems biology approach.
I'm fascinated about understanding the collective behavior of microorganisms and their metabolic potential in different niches. In my research, I use tools in metabolic engineering & systems biology such as metabolomics, fast sampling, kinetic/dynamic modeling and metabolic flux analysis.
In iGEM, I enjoy working with a group of young scientists from Aachen to achieve our common goal of detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa on hard surfaces. Besides science, I try to get myself involved in adventurous sports...but honestly... I just like to relax my day with a delicious meal and a good sci-fi movie!
Dr. rer. nat. Ljubica Vojcic
I am working as a Subgroup Leader in Prof. Schwaneberg research group at the Institute of Biotechnology, RWTH Aachen.  The research area of the Schwaneberg group focuses on directed protein evolution by developing novel methods for generating diversity at the gene level, analyzing consequences of mutational biases on the protein level and developing novel high-throughput screening systems that will lead to improved biocatalysts for prominent applications in industry. In particular, my core expertise is development of high throughput screening systems for different enzyme classes in order to redefine the screening step no longer as bottleneck in directed evolution.
In iGEM, I enjoyed very much to work with highly motivated and ambitious young scientists from RWTH Aachen University. I truly believe that our collaboration has just started and that we will enjoy jointly solving the scientific challenges in the near future.

Our collaboration with iGEM Marburg involved them sending us a petri dish with Vibrio Natriegens bacteria and a protocol for making a growth curve for their bacteria. Since nobody had previously worked with V.natriegens at the Department of Biotechnology and Food Science here at NTNU, we had to get safety approval before starting our work in the laboratory. We asked Marburg to provide us with safety information regarding V.natriegens, which we then sent to the Department of Biotechnology and Food Science. Getting approval was unproblematic since V.natriegens is a risk group 1 organism without any intrinsic safety risks.
General lab safety
Cotton lab coats were worn inside the lab at all times. Whenever we had to go another lab we left our lab coat behind in our student lab and borrowed a vacant lab coat at the entrance to the faculties labs. As a general rule, we did our work in fume hoods, ensuring the safest possible work environment for us and the people around. Whenever handling chemicals or bacteria we wore fitting nitrile gloves, changing them frequently for optimal effect. Our beakers and tubes were marked with their specific contents to ensure that they were handled correctly and that there would be no confusion regarding their content. When leaving the lab, we washed our hands with soap and cleaned our workspace with 70% ethanol. Whenever handling the autoclave or taking bacteria from the freezer we wore thermal and cryo-resistant gloves, respectively. Safety goggles were worn whenever handling acetic acid and methanol. All of our personal equipment, such as backpacks, jackets, and food were kept outside the lab at all times. Since people switched tasks every week, we made sure to have at least 1 student from the previous week present at the lab to ensure that the newcomers followed the same procedures and safety measures surrounding the different parts of our project, such as biofilm measurement and biobrick ligation.

Conclusion
The major safety hazards in our project were Crystal Violet and recombinant E.coli DH5α and TG1 bacteria. As long as safety protocols are being followed, we believe that our project is safe for both researchers and the environment."

As for Best Model:
In terms of our project, modeling part is performed at the same time with the wet lab, which is different from simple prediction or verification. Through analysis of the biological process, two oscillators are respectively built in E.coli and computer. To reach our goal, mixed-reality state, we divide it into three stages, the former two of which have been completed. We have achieved the coupling of virtual and virtual system, and even the coupling of real and virtual part through interface devices. It’s an excited moment to witness the coupling simulation result in Video 1 and 2.
As for the Best Information Processing Project:
The life system in the real world and the virtual world is thought to be entirely independent. The gap between them appears to be hard broken down. However, we choose an oscillator to stand for the life system of both real and virtual and the light is regarded as the medium to connect them together. This ingenious design leads to the data exchanging between them be accessible. This is truly an unprecedented attempt. Till now, we have completed a perfect loop to make the information flowed and have confirmed it is effective.

SynBio Workshop: The Principles on Engineering Life @NTUA, Athens, Greece
Apart from our overall presence in our respective university communities and the discussions we held from time to time with classmates, we wanted to take the discussion one step further. Thus, with the encouragement of Dr. Kostas Vavitsas and in collaboration with iGEM Thessaloniki , we hosted a Synthetic Biology Workshop in our university, the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
The workshop addressed university students of various backgrounds and specialties, as we sought to demonstrate that Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary field. The response to our call for participation was beyond any expectations and, in the end out of more than 50 applicants, 34 university students joined us on July 5th in NTUA.
The workshop was divided in 4 main sections. In the first section, the keynote speakers section, Dr. Kostas Vavitsas of Queensland University in Australia and Prof. Fragiskos Kolissis of NTUA presented and discussed with the audience on the topics of Synthetic and Systems Biology.
The second session was dedicated to greek iGEM teams. iGEM Greece 2017, iGEM Thessaloniki 2018 and our own team, iGEM Athens 2018 presented their projects and answered the audience’s questions.
The third session was the scientific and technical session, where we presented the principles of synthetic biology, as presented below in the SynBio Engineering Cycle and the SynBio Checklist (found on our report ). The main point of this presentation was to give insight on the way of thinking and the top-down problem solving approach that is adopted when dealing with a SynBio project. On the same session, the basic tools of synthetic biology were presented, a table of which is presented on our report .
In the final session, an idea we shared and developed with iGEM Thessaloniki, students were divided into 7 teams of 4-6 members, selected a problem and attempted to tackle it using the tools of synthetic biology. The teams were provided the following 4 problems that they could choose from, including relevant information that would help them approach the issue:
Design of a biosensor for Cow Milk Allergy Diagnosis - Diagnostics
Reforestation and Soil Remediation following forest fires - Environmental
Speeding-up Wound Healing - Therapeutics
Reduction of Hangover Symptoms - Nutrition & Quality"

Our team chose to write a white paper to showcase our direction of research from our preliminary research to our final edited project. The paper reflects our progress and the direction of where our project was going. The white paper is an iterative process which allowed us to brainstorm ideas and frequently edit them into tangible work that our current project includes. The paper has helped us organize our ideas into categories where team members were able to tackle on the research efficiency with hard deadlines.
Our working paper is divided into 5 headings: Biosensor Design, Business, Ethics, Geology, and Malaria, all which surround the subject of gold and mining. Not only has our essay helped P&P members organize our researched information but the paper has also enabled other group members to track our work and keep up to date with any changes we encountered in our project planning. The summary of our work hopes to engage readers in our journey towards our completed project and showcase our growth as activate learners and researchers.
The paper can be found here .
Education
Another part of human practices is having outreach educational programs, which P&P have dedicated members for.
Members initiated a working draft of an undergraduate synthetic biology course syllabus  as part of a long-term iGEM policy project where this course will eventually be introduced into universities, specifically U of T. This project is not yet complete, but our draft syllabus is available to view for the public. We welcome any constructive criticism and additions!

But occasionally, an opaque thread will come out at very high speed
It looks like the gel in the barrel
It will travel down into the beaker, then disintegrate
At higher alcohol concentrations, the ""thread"" does appear to coagulate and bunch up near the tip (as the literature says it would)
I think that the dope is too dilute.
But also, the fact that it's gelling in the barrel is disconcerting."

BBEP equips high school science teachers with the resources to educate their students on sustainability and biologically-based industrial processes.
Our presentation encompassed the use of synthetic biology as a tool for monitoring byproducts of industrial processes and providing safer alternatives for sustainable development. We pass this information to teachers in the hope that they will inspire their students to think deeply about synthetic biology as a legitimate asset in facing the forthcoming economic and environmental issues of the day.
CIBT High School Teachers
The Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers (CIBT) is an annual workshop that allows current high school biology teachers to delve into lab techniques and new advances in biotechnology, and then take that experience back to the classroom. We contributed to this mission by giving a presentation and lab tour, introducing the teachers to synthetic biology, its applications to the real world, and resources available to further explore and develop interest in synthetic biology.
The combination of knowledge, enthusiasm, and experience that characterizes high school biology teachers renders them the perfect audience for critically assessing synthetic biology ideas, evaluating human practices concerns, and fostering a chain of lasting impacts upon future scientists and engineers. By targeting teachers, we hope to disseminate knowledge of and interest in synthetic biology to the coming generations.
