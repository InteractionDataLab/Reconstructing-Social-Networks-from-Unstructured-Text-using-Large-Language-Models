BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#SmallPhage#Summerexp#8.16 Modeling phage plaque size_-_-_TEXT.html,"1mL E coli B and 4mL of LB with 10uL of stock phage. Complete clearage was observed in two days before purification via centrifuge (3000rpm for 5min) and chloroform (100uL of chloroform to 1mL of lysis). This stock of T1 is labeled T1P.
Dilution series -2 through -12 was performed for T1P. 5uL of each dilution sample was spotted onto plates overlaid with 0.5mL of E coli B and 5mL of x1 agar.
3) Spot test for T2 from stock (8.20)
Dilution series -2 through -7 was performed for T2 from stock. 5uL of each dilution sample was spotted onto plates overlaid with 0.5mL of E coli B and 5mL of x1 agar.
4) Preliminary Titer (9.8)
Based on results from spot test for T1P and T2, titer was performed for T1P at -6, -7, and -8; and T2 at -2, -3, and -4. Specifically, 0.5mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight was infected with 20uL of respective phage sample. After 15 minutes of incubation, 5mL of x1 top agar (not precise) was added to each test tube, and the content was plated. The plates were incubated at 37 Celsius for 20 hours.
5) Repeated plating for T1 and T2 (9.9)
Preliminary titer revealed that T1P at -7 and T2 at -4 have adequate concentrations for plating. Plating procedures were the same as those recorded on 8.16. The only difference is the initial OD 600 reading of E coli B liquid culture overnight and subsequent dilutions: the average between two OD 600 readings was 0.513, but dilution was performed right after to adjust it to 0.5.
V) Results
1) Plating
T1 plates had obvious contamination. Results need to be repeated.
T2 still formed larger than expected plaques.

KCL_UK,2018,Team:KCL UK#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," elderly’s experiences of antibiotic administration and whether they see the use of antibiotics in animal farming as a factor in their shopping habits.
Throughout our project, antibiotics have, in one way or another, become the ‘bad guy’- we use them too much; they are the cause of hospital deaths- but one man’s tale truly brought the reality of antibiotics to us. His son’s leg was due to be amputated earlier this year due to sepsis, and after requesting a second opinion, he was transferred to an Oxford hospital where he was treated with two antibiotics in combination.  Quick thinking doctors saved his leg. It was a story that highlighted the importance of our project, from a previously unseen angle. Over tea and iGEM-themed cakes, it was fun and refreshing to get a new perspective on the personal medical experiences of these people, and to be able to educate them about the science behind synthetic biology.  They were genuinely interested in our project and had lots to say about antibiotic use and how we can begin to solve the problem of antibiotic resistance."

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," and will show visible fluorescence when the culture reaches medically useful levels.
We need to engineer the riboswitch into the genome so consumers can always have a visual representation of when their culture is ready for use. Cory Schwartz from UC Irvine donated the pHR-D17-hrGFP plasmid to us, which has homology arms to the Y. lipolytica genome. The plasmid can integrate into the D17 pseudogene of the Y. lipolytica genome by homologous recombination and has a constitutive expression of GFP (Schwartz et al., 2017). We will add our short riboswitch sequence (219-222 bp, depending on the specific aptamer) in the 3’ UTR of the hrGFP reporter of the plasmid; this creates a one-gene reporter system contained within a  plasmid with ampR and ura3 selectable markers and an hrGFP reporter linked to a progesterone-specific riboswitch.
FUTURE WORK
Progesterone's direct precursor, pregnenolone, also has many beneficial aspects. It is the precursor to all steroid hormones in the body, such as cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol and aldosterone are adrenal cortex steroid hormones. Cortisol regulates carbohydrate metabolism and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Aldosterone plays a huge role in cardiovascular health, and helps maintain blood pressure and regulates the salt and water balance in the body. The pathway design we have created allows for the future creation of many beneficial steroid drugs by simply adding a few more genes.
Future optimizations for PoPPY-switch could include changing the location of our riboswitch so that high progesterone concentrations directly inhibit the progesterone production pathway creating an innate dosage-control mechanism. Another avenue of improve- ment would be to use the same riboswitch system, but with a constitutively inactive cleavage that shuts down the production of a survival-necessary gene upon binding to progesterone. The resulting system would then use senescence as an off-switch for progesterone production."

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Motivation 
During our last time’s meet-up with NCTU, we told them our plan to consult FDA about Lactobacillus manufacturing. Professor Chen, the leading professor of NCTU IGEM team, said that FDA is an institute offering expertise related to regulations and examination processes. He suggested that we may get what we need from FIRDI (Food Industry Research and Development Institute). After doing some researches and preparations, we successfully reached Dr. Chu in FIRDI. 
Highlight :
The above are some advice he gave us:
You would do well to use E. coli without a plasmid.
Make sure whether E. coli is able to survive in the intestine.
Remain balanced nutrients when growing lactobacillus instead of just adding sugar. 
Conclusion 
After Doctor Zhu’s detailed introduction, we found that it seems too late for us to know what FIRDI is. We solved the difficulties we faced in our experiment in the end, but if we had discussed with Doctor Zhu earlier, the progress of our experiment might have been faster and more efficient. Thanks to this interview, we realized our insufficient, knowing we still have a lot to improve as well. Here, we appreciate all the instructions Doctor Zhu gave us and professor Chen for recommending us visit FIRDI.    
FDA - Record
Records 
We: We want to know the current situation of the obesity problem in Taiwan.
FDA: I suppose the question could be more probably answered by the Health Promotion Administration. The point is that the public shall be more aware of the negative effects of consuming too much sugar. Therefore, we have started to take notice of the amount of refined sugar consist in health supplements six years ago. In order to avoid people who aim to have a healthy life from consuming too much sugar, we have required more than 30 manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar added to their products. 
We: So, what’s the point of regulating calorie from refined to 10% of daily sugar intake?
FDA: The institution is based on the reference from WHO. For we normally eat many other kinds of food every day, we regulate that refined sugar added in items that can be called “heath food” should not exceed 50 grams, which is half of daily sugar intake for adults. Also, if a product contains over 1/3 of the limited amount mentioned, it should be labeled. 
We: What examination do we need to go through if we are to commercialize our product? 
FDA: If it is positioned to a kind of common"

The other project teams on campus allowed me to build cars, submarines, airplanes etc. These are things that engineers have been doing for ages. Plus, those fields were already heavily developed and there wasn't as much room for creativity or new ideas. iGEM on the other hand, was a new competition with lots of room to be creative. It also allowed me to combine my interests in biology and engineering at the same time which was great. In short, I joined iGEM because it was a novel competition that allowed me to explore my interests in biology and engineering.""
Cornell University | Ithaca, NY
What has been your favorite or most memorable experience in iGEM so far?
""For me, nothing beats working in the lab alone, either because you're working at some ungodly hour or there's just simply no one around. It's a truly blissful experience; time ceases to exist and you are isolated with nothing but you and your science. And then the music... the music would pour through your soul and fill the gaps in between. Not just any music but your favorite kind of music that you can blast because no one else is there to listen. That's definitely an experience worth having again and again.""
Geiranger, Norway
What do you think is the biggest accomplishment that iGEM has achieved?
""I believe that iGEM’s greatest accomplishment has been introducing synthetic biology to thousands of undergraduates and giving them experience they cannot usually obtain in an ordinary research lab. Participating in iGEM gives students the opportunity to take a project from conception to completion with full control over its direction and management. iGEM offers a unique experience in the world of biology that accelerates the rate of research and discovery to allow teams to make a real impact with their projects in only a single year.""
Cornell University | Ithaca, NY
What does synthetic biology and iGEM mean to you?
""To me, synthetic biology is the ability to reengineer life to achieve beyond the capabilities it was given by nature. The possibilities here are truly limitless. It gives us the opportunity to detect human diseases, produce more efficient consumer products, and develop new technologies. Synthetic biology is also what brings the entire Cornell iGEM team together, and for that I'm grateful!""

ATP Electricity
Contemporary society's energy source is electricity.
On the other hand, an organism's energy source is ATP.
Such as bio-mass, organism used energy sources researches how chemical energy makes electric energy.
Especially, Making electricity using bio-mass uses method of rolling turbun. But this method are inefficient.
So, from ATP, we can make charge gradient, to use this we can make electric energy. In this case, we don't use living cells.
Just we need ATPase.

HylA signal sequence
HylR, HylC, IS1 : Front flanking sequence
HylB, HylD : Rear flanking sequence
tolC : channel protein
HylA is secretion inducing sequence, and the others are induced by HylA and make channel to pump proteins to outside of the cell.
It is different from liposome production.
So we need to check another way for liposome based secretion.
Bacterial Secretory Vesicle

Cancer diagnosis marker
I couldn’t find thesis about cancer diagnosis by bacterial method in NCBI.
It can be both good and bad news.
Attached file is a paper of Prof. Park published in PLoS ONE.
It says that antibody detects surface marker of cancer tissue.
It seems like detecting it by 4 kinds of color reaction.
Maybe we could find another marker from another paper by prof.Lee Do Hyun, for example.
The general concept is to transfer the system to bacteria.

This decrease is lessened as we decrease the amount of TALE A β-lactamase fusion. We can also show that in our negatives with no TALE A β-lactamase fusion we do not have a decrease in absorbance.  We have demonstrated the reporter activity both qualitatively (Figure 10 & 11) and quantitatively (Figure 12).
Figure 11.Change in pH catalyzed by TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) using benzylpenicillin. Bromothymol blue was used to keep track of this colour change. Absorbance readings were taken at 616 nm every 30 seconds. Different amounts of TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) were tested. Commercial β-lactamase was used as a positive control. Negative controls included were bovine serum albumin, β-lactamase without the substrate and the substrate by itself.

In order to demonstrate that we can successfully capture target DNA with two TALEs we did a capture TALE assay (Figure 13). TALE B was incubated with DNA containing target sites for TALE A and TALE B and blotted on nitrocellulose. After blocking and washing, TALE A β-lactamase fusion ( BBa_K1189031 ) was added to the nitrocellulose strips. The strips were transferred into a 96 well plate to which a benzylpenicillin substrate solution with phenol red was added. If the TALE A β-lactamase fusion bound to the target site for TALE A then the solution will change colour from pink to clear. If TALE A β-lactamase fusion   was not present, the solution will remain pink.  We can show that the first four samples which have TALE"

Start from Here
After the preliminary investigation and the massive work on building our two systems, there comes the most exciting part of our project----the verification part. We conducted several verification experiments to test our hypothesis.
Pro Priontein System
Experiment Design
For the Pro Priontein system we conducted experiments to measure the fluorescence intensity of the split sfGFP in both Escherichia coli(E. coli) and Saccharomyces cerevisiaes(S. cerevisiaes). In E. Coli, the gene for sfGFP 1-10 was expressed in BL21 on a pSB1A3 vector and the gene for sfGFP 1-10 was on a pSB1C3 vector. In S.cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), sfGFP 1-10 was placed on YeWGAP and sfGFP11 was placed on YeUGAP.(YeWGAP and YeUGAP are two kinds of yeast plasmids which enable the transformant of yeast cells to grow on a medium lacking tryptophan and uracil respectively. )
Firstly, we compared the fluorescence intensity of the E. coli respectively containing sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11 with that of the E. coli in which sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11 are coexpressed to see whether or not our spilt sfGFP system can work as an effective indicator in real condition.
What we expected is that the E. coli can produce much brighter fluorescence when the two separate part of sfGFP protein (sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11) are expressed in the same bacteria.
And then we changed our chassis to S. cerevisiae to verify the function of the kill switch"

MOOC
MOOC has also been a means of communicating to society, reaching out for those who do not know SynBio yet. By integrating iGEM and online courses, we made our own MOOC videos where our team members are the speakers. The videos include the introduction of IGEM competition, the knowledge about synthetic biology, our project outline and lab safety. This year, there have been 73,639 learners who joined us by learning our MOOC.
Our courses consist of seven major sections—iGEM’s introduction, modern molecular biology, synthetic biology, bioinformatics, current protocols, wiki web making and iGEM’s information search. We have created a comprehensive course system which is good at deepening students’ understanding of our courses.
Our MOOC videos consist of iGEM’s introduction, basics of synthetic biology and design of WIKI making with the view of letting more people be involved in iGEM by learning our online courses!
iGEM was founded by MIT in 2003. It is a top international academic competition in the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology aims to re-design the current natural biological system and build artificial biological parts and system to create a new biological system. The design and making of WIKI has given us the most humanistic vision experience and offered us an optimal project display platform with the interaction of science and humanity.
Besides our teaching materials, we have also made our teaching videos to help people get to know more about our project. Some relevant questions have also been given to assist students to strengthen what they’ve learned.

Surface display design
Several surface display systems exist for the yeast S. cerevisiae. In the context of cancer immunotherapy, whole yeast cells has been coated with several layers of cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 with a chemical conjugation (27) and this system was able to cross-prime naive CD8+ T cells in vitro. Antigen was also linked chemically to the surface of a capsular yeast shell instead of the whole yeast (28). The advantage of chemical conjugation is the ability to reach a high antigen loading. However, this technique is limited to soluble antigens and most antigens are not soluble, leading us to reject this solution in order to broaden our system to any tumor antigen. In addition, chemical conjugation requires a purified antigen, increasing therapeutic application costs.
We selected the surface display system based on the mating adhesion receptor Aga2p and Aga1p. This system is widely used for antibody affinity studies and was used to anchor the antibody ScFv DEC205 fused to the ovalbumin tumor antigen to the yeast surface. Aga1p was expressed separately and aga2p fused in C-terminal to our displayed protein.
To establish a proof of concept, our system was tested in vivo on C57BL/6 mice injected with the melanoma cell line B16-OVA expressing the ovalbumin antigen. We also tested the system in vitro on hybridoma B3Z T-cells specific for SIINFEKL. The tumor antigen cloned in our vector was OVA1 corresponding to the sequence QLESIINFEKLTEW, class I (Kb)-restricted peptide epitope of ovalbumin (OVA) plus 3 amino acids around the epitope to allow better digestion by the proteasome. It is presented by the class I MHC molecule H-2Kb (29).

Each year, the UCSC iGEM team presents to the Bioethics class during the second Summer Session. A few team members diligently prepared a presentation about our questionnaires and project for that purpose. Several of us attended the presentation, and afterwards broke into small groups with students in the class to ask and answer questions about our ethics. Because of this presentation, we learned about the IRB at UCSC and how we needed to get our questionnaires approved, since we were technically working with “human subjects” if we sent it out.
Another small group designed a poster to be displayed at the Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. This poster included details about our three parallel experiments, our research, and our outreach. Three team members presented the information to interested audiences at the Symposium.
After successfully linearizing pUC19 and pXRL2, we repeated the same experiment with larger volumes to get more product for future use. Using this product, we performed several DPN1s and clean and concentrate experiments. The first four tests were failures. We used both our advisor’s reagents and Zymo’s reagents. Our solution that eventually worked was to prewarm the 30 uL water we were using as the elution buffer and let it sit for several minutes, in the final step. On the fifth experiment, the clean and concentrate worked but still not very well. We tried one more time using only 10 uL water to elute and got sufficient concentrations for our Gibson reactions.
This was the week in which we discovered our collective error in the PCR protocol we had used up until this point. This was a lesson to us and the rest of the team about blindly following protocols without questioning them. Upon redoing our PCR experiment with the corrected protocol in a 10uL reaction, our gel showed bands indicating a successful linearization. We also went through the protocol for the creation of chemicompetent yeast cells in anticipation for our transformation into Y. lipolytica. Protocol was successful and yielded 2.5 mL of gly"

The cotransformation was successful, but we have not been able to see the blue shifting glowing phenotype yet, it is still green-blue. Its possible that the wavelenght shift is being correctly done but with our vision we can't see the change, so that we have to use a sensible measuremente device to detect it. We tried with an spectrophotometer but it doesn't detect any RLU (relative light emmission unit), even the bioluminescence is visible to naked eye in the dark room. We hope to use a CCD camera for this measurment.

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#project#biological construction#logic gates_-_-_TEXT.html," but not the two together.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
The second XOR gate has the same design than the second AND gate: the ouput gene  has been put between the two pairs of recombination sites. (PhiC31 and FimE). The output protein can be translated only if the gene is in the right direction, meaning having been switched by either one of the recombinases but not the two simultaneously.
.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
These gates (XOR and AND) can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements.
Resetting these gates to their basal states requires a series of excisases capable of switching back the sequences to their native state. For instance, KAIST Korea iGEM team has described in 2012 a part which could flip back into the original DNA sequence: Bxb1 gp47 ( BBa_K907002 )
The OR gate
The OR gate is implicit in our adder. An OR gate functions (gives an output signal) with one input or both. The OR gate uses as input signals the product of the two AND gates. If for both gates the output gene is the same, we have an implicit OR gate: either on of the entries (or both) produce the same output signal.
Riboregulation System
Our design is based on a permanent switch of the logic gates. Contrarily of transcriptionally regulated logic gates, once the gate has switched, there is no possibility to switch back to the previous state, and this was a strict requirement when we though of a binary adder (if the calculator responses switched over time, we would have some trouble... :-)). The expression level of the recombinases is therefore highly critical and very small amounts of recombinases can switch the gates. A zero expression level is needed and the control of the expression of the recombinases was designed with a riboregulation system.
How does it work ?
This is the basic system: Two inductible promoters each followed by a RNA sequence
The blue and the red regions code for little RNA sequences.
When the promoter P2 is activated but not P1, the red sequence will be transcribed. This red sequence is partly similar to the rbs sequence (in red). When transcribed, the red sequence will block the rbs by promoting a secondary RNA structure and prevent the recombinase from being translated.
When both promoters are activated, both sequences (the blue and the red one) are"

Assembly
3A assembly is designed to use three-way ligation and both positive and negative selection to minimise incorrect assemblies.  3A assembly stands for three antibiotic assembly, as the three starting plasmids all have different antibiotic resistance markers.  The construction vector (red) contains ccdB (black block arrow) and the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites.  The blue plasmid contains the prefix part (pink), and the green plasmid contains the suffix part (yellow).  These two plasmids can have the same or different resistance markers, as long as they are distinct from the construction vector.  All these BioBrick parts are standardised to contain these restriction sites and an antibiotic resistance marker making this an appropriate method for the whole project.  There are also an assortment of construction vectors with different antibiotic resistance markers enabling simple changes from part to part as only up to three antibiotics will be necessary at one time.
EcoRI (E) and PstI (P) are used to cut the construction vector, removing the ccdB gene and leaving E and P open ends.  EcoRI (E) and SpeI (S) are used to cut the prefix plasmid, and XbaI (X) and PstI (P) are used to cut the suffix plasmid.  These pieces of DNA can then be ligated together and transformed.  A mixed site (M) is left between the combined parts.  A plate supplemented with the red antibiotic is used to grow the transformed cells.  For the red vector, a ccdB resistant strain such as DB3.1 must be used.

Market Analysis
This year, the final goal of iGEM_Bit team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB—essentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections—to ordinary communities.  Our plan is to commercialize JACOB to provide warnings for potential disease and develop a self-sustaining facility for production and further research. From market analysis, we concluded the prominent advantages of JACOB and focused on those to provide more competitive products; from direct interaction with commercial industries, we optimized JACOB's operability and compatibility with the market.

May 14 – 20, 2012
The Distribution Kit 2012 arrived! Now we have a lot of new parts!
We prepared for second time samples of B2+ & B3+ to observe in the epifluorescence microscope the effect of time in the samples.
This time B2+ & B3+ presented much more fluorescence, and it persisted over time (at least 1 hour with no significant variation).
Additionally, we began to amplify the spider silk monomer ADF-3 from the plasmid that Christopher Voigt gave to us. But the amplicon was barely visible in the electrophoresis. We will have to try it again, or maybe try another technic like touch-down PCR. Or the primers are designed for repetitive areas?
May 21 – 27, 2012
We received the results of the DNA sequencing of Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid. Fortunately, these results are coherent with our designs. Great news!
Also, we went to the confocal microscope
May 28 – June 3, 2012
For second time we tried to amplify the spider silk monomer ADF-3 from the plasmid that Christopher Voigt gave to us. This time we believe that the PCR worked!
June 4 – 10, 2012
On Tuesday Bernardo presented all the advances of iGEM team UC Chile 2012 to professor Rodrigo Gutierrez and the Plant Systems Biology Lab members. We received many useful recommendations.
June 11 – 17, 2012
We did another experiment to investigate the interactions between our bacteria B2+ and B3, but this time with a serious protocol and recording the data for later analysis.
We expected that our results were coherent with our theory. [1] . Protease K should also be able to cut the HIV cleavage site, releasing the sfGFP.

This year's Wageningen iGEM team has been working hard and while doing so has kept the medal requirements in mind. Below each medal, a list can be found which completes the criteria that have to be met to earn the medals.
Advanced models were created and used to get insight into the quorum sensing and reporter system parts of our project.
Integrated Human Practices:
We consulted with experts from the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), the corporate Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics in Belgium, workers of the Médecines sans Frontières (MSF/Doctors without Borders) organization, a philosophy professor and many more. With the insights gained from experts in the field of diagnostics and people from MSF in Africa and Brazil we were able to improve the diagnostic device to suit the requirements of such a device. We were also able to take the biosafety aspect of our project into account and even consider the ethical dillemma's that arise when implementing a new diagnostic device.
We improved BioBricks BBa_I715022 & BBa_I715023 by changing the incorrect split site AA155 to the correct split site AA168 BBa_K2387055 .
During our project we demonstrated that Mantis is viable in blood serum dilutions, and that fluorescence can indeed be measured in blood serum.        Furthermore, we performed experiments to consistently air-dry our cells, and we combined several wet-lab project to perfect the functionality of Mantis.
Validated the functionality of the following submitted BioBricks:

     When it comes to the issue of biosafety, instructions are necessary.  For the iGEM competition, safety manual should be sent to all the teams together with standard parts.  Also, online courses on laboratory safety issues should be provided.  Teams registered should be required to read the safety manual and take the online courses before they conduct their project.

K343004
The FlhDC operon is the master regulator of flagella synthesis. A more detailed description of the operon can be found here
In our system the purpose of the composite part is to hyperflagellate our cells so that a grater force can be generated in the microtubes. The FlhDC operon is naturally found in the genome of E. coli strain MG1655. We extracted the operon and introduced a silent mutation (T to C) at position 822 in the coding sequence because without the mutation this site is a Pst1 digestion site and it would therefore constitute problems when assembling the composite part.
We have made three FlhDC parts:
K343100 is the coding sequence of the native FlhDC operon containing the Pst1 digestion site
K343000 is the coding sequence of the mutated FlhDC operon
K343004 is the composite part containing the TetR repressed promoter (constitutive when no TetR is present) + RBS (J13002), the K343000 part and the double terminator (B0015).
The composite part is characterized firstly by using a motility assay and secondly by measuring plasmid stability and cell growth.
Motility assay
The purpose of this experiment is to test the motility of the transformed cells containing either pSB1C3-K343004 or pSB3K3-K343004. We also want to test if it makes a difference in the motility whether the bacteria contain low- medium or high-copy plasmids.
For the motility assays we added 5µl of an overnight culture to petridishes containing motility agar (LB media with 0.3% agar) instead of regular LA (Luria agar). This semi-solid media lets"

Since the experimental results showed that the first two methods were somewhat less efficient than the third one, we finally used the yeast homologous recombination method for plasmids assembly.  (Table 1) Taking KaiC-SasA couple as an example, we first used PCR to add corresponding homology arms to the ends of ten gene fragments including TEF1P (the promoter of TEF1, kaiA, TEF1T（the terminator of TEF1）, PGK1P (the promoter of PGK1), kaiB, PGK1T (the terminator of PGK1), TDH3P (the promoter of TDH3), AD, kaiC and ADH1T(the terminator of ADH1, then we introduced the ten gene fragments into the yeast together with the pRS413 plasmid cut by EcoRI and NotI to construct three gene expression cassettes of KaiA(TEF1P-kaiA-TEF1T), KaiB(PGK1P-kaiB-PGK1T), AD-KaiC(TDH3P-AD-kaiC-ADH1T. The right strains containing the recombinant plasmid were screened by nutrition labeling,  verified by PCR tag and then the recombinant plasmid was amplified in Escherichia Coli to obtain a large amount. Similarly, a sufficient number of recombinant pRS415 plasmids were obtained using the same way. Finally, we transformed the two kinds of plasmids into the final chassis cell,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, to complete the construction of the KaiABC system.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html," regeneration process is relatively slow.
Together, these assumptions reduce the time it takes to do one simulation from 4.5 hours to just about 30 minutes, which is enough for us to conduct our preliminary simulations.
We first examined the how the initial concentration of tubulin dimers $C_m$ affects the microtubule dynamics. The results are as follows.
Figure 1 The change of terminal average length (left) and terminal number (right) of microtubules as initial tubulin dimer concentration increases. $k_{ptp}=k_{pdp}=8.9{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{stp}=44s^{-1}$, $k_{sdp}=899s^{-1}$, $k_n=5{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_s=5s^{-1}$.
From Figure 1 we can see that the terminal average length and the terminal number of microtubules rise with the increase of initial tubulin dimer concentration in similar trends. This is consistent with experimental results obtained by Walker et al. (1991) and Voter et al. (1991). After $C_m=10\mu M$, both of them reach a plateau. A higher concentration of tubulin dimers does not promote further polymerization, which is as we expected, since depolymerization will eventually limit the extent of microtubule assembly. The experiment done by Walker et al. (1998) showed that at $C_m=5 pM$, the polymerization and depolymerization rate are virtually the same, and microtubules can barely grow, which is in accordance with our simulation results.
We also analyzed the relationship between terminal number and the rate of GTP hydrolysis, which is controlled by $k_h$. The result is as follows.
Figure 2 The change of terminal number of microtubules as the GTP hydrolysis rate constant increases.
$k_{ptp}=k_{pdp}=8.9{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $k_{stp}=44s^{-1}$, $k_{sdp}=899s^{-1}$, $k_n=5{\mu}M^{-1}s^{-1}$, $C_m=20{\mu}M$.
From Figure 2 we can see that the terminal number of microtubules decreases almost linearly as GTP hydrolysis accelerates. Faster GTP hydrolysis shifts the equilibrium state towards depolymerization. Here the terminal average"

Craig McCormick is a Professor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Dalhousie University, where he studies the interactions between viruses and cells. In his first year as an iGEM faculty mentor, he worked closely with the team to promote iGEM as an innovative model of student-led, interdisciplinary undergraduate training. His vision is that Dalhousie iGEM will gain a reputation as a magnet for talented, ambitious students, who will gain leadership and communication skills that will prepare them to lead the synthetic biology revolution.
Dr. Craig McCormick
Primary PI
Dr. Rohde is a geneticist who founded the Dalhousie iGEM team in 2015. He received his training in genetics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems at institutions that include University of British Columbia, Duke Medical Center and Institut Pasteur. His interest in synthetic biology arose from discussions in the Dalhousie classrooms where he teaches microbial genetics.
Dr. John Rohde
Secondary PI
Lois Murray is a Senior Instructor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology. This is her second year working with Dalhousie’s iGEM team: she got involved because she enjoys working with students and doing research that employs molecular and cell biology as tools. Identifying, cloning and expressing genes has been a career-long interest of hers and seeing students using these techniques for a synthetic biology application is such fun. Attending the Jamboree last year with the Dal team was a real thrill as it opened her eyes to the wide, wild world of applications for synthetic biology. She is very impressed with all of the work done by the 2017 team.

The next day, all cultures were heavily grown indicating a contamination in our medium.
Week 12: August 4 - August 10, 2013
This week was overshadowed by contaminated medium interfering with our experiments. We managed to transform the final Prhl inducible construct in E. coli Top10F’. As the promoter seemed to be not leaky in this strain we successfully conducted a growth curve experiment showing a difference in growth between induced and non-induced cultures. We are still missing our final Plas inducible construct.

Investigators: Kevin, Anna, Melanie
The successful cloning of our final Prhl inducible construct was finally confirmed via colony PCR. Unfortunately the liquid cultures for the minipreps were contaminated. We decided to repeat the entire colony PCR as last PCR’s replated colonies showed almost no coloration.
We also adapted a new cloning strategy for our Plas inducible construct by swapping vector and insert. As we discovered later, the insert was extremely hard to recover via gel extraction because of almost identical band sizes. We still tried it and proceeded with ligation.
We prepared liquid cultures for a miniprep of the final Prhl inducible construct, the N-butyryl-HSL synthase RhlI with amilGFP reporter cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015) and the eCFP cassette (J23100- E0420). These were, again, contaminated the next day.
In order to find a setup where our promotors are not leaky, we conducted an experiment with liquid cultures of cells bearing the Prhl inducible ampicillin resistance with RhlR transcription factor cassette (R0071-B0032-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0071) and the Plas inducible construct ampicillin resistance"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

Plasmid isolation (Promega, protocol (4)) of ∆csgB, and I13522. Different in this protocol were the facts that we did not use elution buffer but Milli-Q at 50°C (even if we work with small plasmids). The plasmid concentration was determined with the nanodrop machine. A restriction of these four plasmids was performed at 37°C for 2 hours. To check the restriction products, an agarose gel was performed.
Transformation was performed with Top10 cells prepared by Ilja. The normal protocol of transformation was followed (2) for transforming and pUC19 (as a control). For the transformation 1 µl of DNA was added.
03/07/2015
A gel purification(Promega (7)) and a ligation of ∆csgB and I13522 (to obtain the csgA_GFP construct) were performed. Then, transformation of Ligation product csgA-GFP; Control TOP10 strain; was performed. Cells were plated in duplo and also one control.
06/07/2015
Results of the transformation (csgA-GFP)
1. Empty plasmid control (also growth, 100 colonies);
2. TOP10 + CsgA+GFP (growth, 43 colonies, big).
After the checking the plates, a small culture of 5 mL was made using a single colony from the obtained plates, the following cultures were made:  TOP10 + csgA-GFP.
The antibiotics were added in a ratio of 1:1000 (thus in 5 mL, we have added 5µl). After cloning, we put the 50 mL tubes at 37°C at 200 rpm.
Besides that we made LB and LB-agar.
- 2 x 200 mL LB (4 g LB powder and 200 mL MQ-water);
- 1 x 400 mL LB (8 g LB powder and 400 mL MQ-water);
- 2 x 400 mL LB agar, 14.24 LB agar powder and 400 mL MQ-water);
- 1x 900 mL LB agar, 32.05 LB agar powder and 900 mL MQ-water);
Then the materials were autoclaved in the kitchen.
The backbone for our own construct is pSB4K5. For the transformation, we did use the protocol (2). Then we have grown the cells on the plates, I13504 and pUC19 on"

Hey! My name is Martyna and I study Biomedical Sciences specializing in Molecular Biology at the University of Aberdeen. Although I started off with        Medicine, I soon discovered that it is the science behind medicine that fascinates me the most. Although my main field of interest is cancer and stem cells,        I decided to participate in iGEM as I like the interdisciplinary aspect of the competition. I think synthetic biology is a very interesting field which in        the future may answer a lot of questions we struggle with nowadays. Plus hey, what's better than spending your holidays in the lab! ;) My role in the team        was to engineer Ag43 autotransporter in order to allow easy insertion of foreign peptide sequences for expression on the cell surface of E.coli. I also took        active part in organizing public outreach activities. In my free time, I enjoy aggressive roller-skating, rock music and long walks with my German shepherd.        I am looking forward to meeting everyone at the Gigant Jamboree at MIT!​

Overview
Proper communication has been a cornerstone of the scientific method since its birth. From the first letter on his heliocentric model of the solar system that Copernicus dedicated to Pope Paul III, the target was clear: Communicating your findings and educating people on them is key to make science work.
We therefore dedicated our human practices on education and communication, on different levels of the population:
The general public, through our questionnaire on the streets
People interested in science, through our participation in the Basel Science Slam
Reaching a regional audience, through the publication of two newspaper articles
Discussed how we could affect education on a global level, through the ideas developed at an SDG workshop
Additionally to eductating other people, we sat down with three experts that helped us understand IBD better, define new goals for our project and design an alternative circuits.
Public study on IBD, synthetic biology and ethical issues
Synthetic biology still remains cryptic to the general public who often has a negative opinion on GMOs. Our goal was to inform people about scientific progress, and sensitize them to IBD. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire that would allow us to see how informed the general public is about IBD and educate them on the main issues with IBD, such as the increasing incidence rate in western Nations and the lower life expectancy of the people affected. Additionally, we wanted to educate the public on what is known about the general role of the gut microbiome and how it affects the disease.
We then moved on to tell them about our project and how we want to develop an investigation tool for the disease. This does not come without ethical baggage, therefore we asked people whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified bacteria inside humans for investigating diseases.
Moreover, we tried to convey that biologists are doing everything to keep genetically engineered bacteria from being released into the environment and provide them with an ecological disadvantage. Nevertheless, such a release might be inevitable. How does this information change their opinion on the use of genetically engineered bacteria?
In the Netherlands in 2006, genetically engineered"

We met as a team and presented our project plans in detail today. In our discussions with the rest of the team we decided that we want to try to characterize cholera’s biofilm, as this hasn’t really been done before. We will research articles on characterizing other biofilms and see if we can adapt their procedure for our cholera biofilms. The article, Molecular Achitecture and Assembly Principles of V. cholera Biofilms, was suggested to us as a starting point.
We also found a research group that has worked with Subtilisin Savinase so we can contact them and see if they can send us a sample of Bacillus lentus:

rIgem Xuzhou Communication Meeting
    At the beginning of the meeting, the four universities (Dalian university of technology, Lanzhou university, Jiangnan university, Zhejiang university of technology) publicized the igem related situation to the students present and answered everyone's questions. Since the meeting was in the third quarter of the National Undergraduate Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, it achieved good publicity. Next, the four universities introduced their projects in turn, accepted questions from everyone, and explained the bottlenecks of the project, hoping to get inspiration through discussion.
    Our team's project has aroused great interest from the teachers and students present. Everyone said that the project is novel, practical, and cleverly designed, but at the same time it also put forward many opinions. First of all, because our products have to enter the human body, the lethal system is essential, and how to maintain it in the body is controllable and effective is also an extremely important problem; secondly, how do we penetrate the intestinal wall to act on the blood; finally, respond in vivo What is the threshold value of uric acid and can be sensed before the minimum value. We answered the above questions one by one.
    This exchange will be very rewarding, not only learning the advantages of other teams, but also discovering their own shortcomings. And with the help of some teams, Jiangnan University expressed its willingness to provide E. coli exocrine system. Zhejiang University of Technology expressed its willingness to exchange experience in mathematical modeling and learned that Beijing University of Technology has a signal amplification system."

Weigh a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for each DNA fragment to be isolated, and record the weight
Visualize the DNA in the agarose gel using a long-wavelength UV lamp and an intercalating dye (Ethidium bromide). Irradiate the gel the minimum possible time to reduce nicking
Excise the DNA fragment of interest in a minimal volume of agarose using a clean scalpel or razor blade. Transfer the gel slice to a weighted 1.5 mL tube and record the weight, again. Subtract the previously measured tube weight to obtain               the weight of the gel slice containing the DNA fragment
Add Membrane Binding Solution at a ratio of 10 µL of solution per 10 mg of agarose gel slice
Vortex the mixture and incubate at 50-65ºC for 10 minutes, or until the gel slice is completely dissolve in the liquid. You can vortex the tube every few minutes to increase the rate of agarose melting
Centrifuge the tube briefly at room temperature to ensure the contents are at the bottom of the tube. Once the agarose gel is melted, the gel will not re-solidify at room temperature
Place one SV Minicolumn in a Collection Tube for each dissolved gel slice
Transfer the dissolved gel mixture to the SV minicolumn assembly and incubate for 1 minute at room temperature
Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly in a microcentrifuge at max speed for 1 minute. Remove the SV Minicolumn from the Spin Column assembly and discard the liquid in the Collection Tube. Return the SV Minicolumn to the Collection Tube afterwards
Wash the column by adding 700 µL of Membrane Wash Solution, previously diluted with 95% ethanol to the SV Minicolumn. Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly for 1 minute at maximum speed
Empty the Collection Tube as before, and place the SV Minicolumn back in the Collection Tube. Repeat the wash with 500 µL of Membrane Wash Solution, and centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly for 5 minutes at maximum speed
Remove the SV Minicolumn assembly from the centrifuge (not wetting the bottom of the column with the supernatant). Empty the Collection Tube and centrifuge the assembly for 1 minute with the microcentrifuge lid open (or off) to allow ethanol               evaporation

Starting Conditions
In order to examine the effects of higher initial mass of BamA RNA 6 different values were screened over. The guidance for the PURE system [1] suggests addition of RNA between 1 and 5 ug. Using the masses of sense and anti-sense strands of BamA RNA in kDA [15] (830.382 and 820.8 respectively) and conversion 1 ug = 6.022*1020 kDa the number of RNA molecules added can be calculated using the formula (ug added *(6.022*1020)/((830.382 + 820.8)/2)))) as seen below in table 2:

Results
The primary aim of this model is to identify parameters leading to fast and consistently high levels of BamA under conditions of co-expression of BamA, OmpA and lgA. In order to identify those particular parameters leading to these conditions it is first prudent to examine some general trends. Figure 2 displays the minimum, maximum and average levels of mRNAs and protein for BamA, OmpA and lgA. The value at each time point was obtained from the range of values at the same time point across each run of the model.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," phosphorus reclamation module that allows them to uptake luxury amounts of not just phosphorus but other compounds that have increased value when concentrated from the environment.
Our business plan would have three levels to allow flexibility on our part and on the part of those wanting to implement this system. The first level of this model would involve our company directly owning and operating the system. This would allow us to collect the phosphorus to sell without competing interest from a stakeholder. This could be implemented in high phosphorus areas (where phosphorus could be easily collected and resold) or as a pilot program for cities or environmental groups to demonstrate how our system would work. The second level would allow us to rent out the reclamation module along with the organisms to cities, farmers, or homeowners. This would allow these stakeholders to benefit from the collected phosphorus by selling it to us or on the open market. We would be selling replacement parts and packaged bacteria to allow refills once the filters become less efficient. This second level would benefit from those who might not want to directly manage their system but view it as an investment where they can profit from the waste phosphors they may generate or have access to. The third level of our business plan would involve the leasing of the whole system, with propagation and encapsulation methods. This would allow groups to have complete control over the process to fit their specific needs. The phosphorus they accumulate could be sold back to our business for wholesale or could be sold on the open market.
Public Engagement
From the outset of our project, we understood that we would receive pushback regarding the use of E. coli in water. Because of this we talked with professors on campus about strategies we could employ to communicate our science. Based on advice we received, we made posters to explain our project and set up a booth at the Wabash River Festival in West Lafayette to discuss the phosphorus problem, our solution, and what it means with people at the festival. We also set up a station for children to pipette water with food coloring into eppendorf tubes to simulate lab experiments. Candy DNA was also provided (that the kids could build). We used this opportunity to explain to both the children and adults how we do genetic recombination.
Product Design
We wanted to design a system that would be effective and industrially competitive, and so we met with experts from the USDA, Purdue Foundry, and biocontainment experts on campus to establish our design criteria. We iterated on the design through more meetings and ultimately built a prototype

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Safety
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/permits/inspection/index-eng.php)
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge are equipped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eyewash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services. (http://www.uleth.ca/risk-and-safety-services/)
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.(http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/index-eng.php)"

Each culture was then diluted 100-fold (300µl added to 30ml fresh L-broth) in broth containing Cm, and then was incubated (37oC in a shaking rack at 225 rpm) for a period of 3 hours. During this period, cell growth was measured every hour by optical density (OD), using a spectrophotometer (600nm wavelength). Once each culture reached a pre-induction (Pre) OD of roughly 0.5, an aliquot was removed and kept for analysis during SDS-PAGE as samples showing pre-induction cell protein expression. IPTG was added to induce protein expression in the remaining culture. The cells were then incubated (37oC in a shaking rack at 225 rpm) for another 3 hours, recording the post induction (Post) OD of A, B and C.
Following protein expression, 1ml of cultures A, B and C were transferred to a 1.5ml eppendorf tube and spun down (13,000rpm for 5 minutes). The supernatant was then pipetted off, and the cells were resuspended in laemmli loading buffer (950µl 5X laemmli sample buffer + 50µl 0.5M dithriotheitol (DTT)). The proportion of buffer added to each culture was normalised to the culture with the highest OD, where that culture received 1ml of laemmli buffer (Table 1).
Table 1 - Cell-culture preparation for SDS-PAGE: The optical density was measured using a 600nm spectrophotometer, and represents the amount of bacterial mass present in the culture. The volume of dye added was normalised to the culture with the highest OD.
The gel used was a 10-well Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel. 25µl of each of the 6 samples (PreABC and PostABC) were loaded on the gel, along with 20µl of protein marker (Biorad Precision All-Blue Molecular Weight Marker ladder). 25µl of dye was also added to the remaining wells to avoid protein running at an angle. The gel was run until the bands reached the green reference line on the SDS-PAGE kit. The gel was then removed from the precast cassette, and stained with Coomassie blue.

According to Figure 1., the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 rises steadily throughout the 8-hour period and peaks at 0.9AU at T=8
Figure 2. Growth curve of bacteria transformed with BBa_K2764002

Similarly, from Figure 2., the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764002 rises steadily, but not as rapidly as BBa_K2764001, and peaks at 0.7AU at T=8
Figure 3. Growth curve of bacteria transformed with BBa_K2764003
.
Meanwhile, from Figure 3., bacteria with BBa_K2764003 remains consistently low, eventually reaching 0.05AU at T=8 despite a jump at T=2 where it reached 0.1AU. However, the overall growth rate of BBa_K2764003 is still much lower than that of the other 2 parts.
Simply comparing the final absorbance of these 3 graphs, it can be safely said that the host cells with BBa_K2764001 has the strongest growth, followed by BBa_K2764002 and then by BBa_K2764003.
Then, when the 3 growth curves are compared with the control’s growth, the graph is as follows:
Figure 4. Growth curve of bacteria transformed with BBa_K2764001, BBa_K2764002, BBa_K2764003
.
From the graph, it can be seen that the control’s growth rate is higher than all 3 parts up until T=3. After which, the control has a slower growth rate than bacteria with BBa_K2764001 but still maintains a higher growth rate than bacteria with BBa_K2764002 and BBa_K2764004 respectively. Another thing to note is that from T=0 to T=2, the cell growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 is similar to that of both bacteria containing BBa_K2764002 and BBa_K2764003.
The higher growth rate of the control compared with that of the 3 parts in the first half of the experiment would indeed support the hypothesis that AlkL is the independent variable that affects host cell growth. It can be further ascertained that AlkL is toxic to the host and inhibits growth to a certain extent as the control has a higher growth rate initially. However, it is interesting to note that bacteria with BBa_K2764001, which has the highest promoter strength, could be able to have the highest growth rate compared"

Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work.
Experimental design
Verification of peroxisomal protein import was performed  by tagging the fluorescent protein mTurquoise with our designed PTS variants. Additionally, a peroxisomal membrane protein was used to ensure peroxisomal localization. For that reason, we chose the transmembrane domain of Pex13 tagged with the fluorescent protein mRuby.
Pex13−mRuby
We used the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13 as a fluorescent marker − by just using the transmembrane domain of Pex13 with a short linker, we make sure that it has no influence on the peroxisomal features. To obtain a higher differentiation from mTurquoise, which we use for another construct, we chose to work with mRuby. Literature research revealed that such constructs have been tested before − Erdmann et al. (2004) described a construct containing only Pex13200-310 with a C-terminal GFP.
Figure 1.3: Pex13 construct with C-terminal mRuby.
Pex5 variant
In order to achieve an orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery we used a Pex5 knockout yeast strain in which we transformed our artificial  Pex5 variant containing a modified PTS1 binding pocket. Our variation facilitates the detection of a non native PTS1 variant instead of the wild type PTS1. The construct contains a medium strength promoter, the Pex5 gene and a terminator. The remaining plasmid parts can be seen in the plasmid map below.
Figure 1.4: Pex5 gene variant.
mTurquoise−PTS
Our approach for import verification is based on the fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with our modeled PTS variants. After several promoter tests with different strengths, we decided to express this construct only in low amounts, since this was the most suitable possibility to detect potential mTurquoise localization.
Our construct is depicted in the figure below.
Figure 1.5: Fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with the PTS variant.
Combination of our constructs
To combine our constructs, we cloned our Pex5 and mTurquoise constructs into a level 2 plasmid portrayed below.

Subsequently,  co-transformation of the Pex13−mRuby plasmid and the level 2 plasmid was performed in order to verify peroxisomal col"
UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Teaml_-_-_TEXT.html," delighted to discover several shortcomings in my current understanding of Synthetic Biology over the course of teaching this project.
I also had the opportunity to learn new skills such as database construction, normalization, maintenance and accession.  I had never managed a database before.  This posed a special challenge to advising its construction.  Learning enough to advise is certainly more difficult but ultimately very rewarding.  I had the immediate enjoyment of learning something new followed promptly by the joy of sharing my understanding with an eager audience.
It was also interesting to managing a team of this size for the first time.  There were some pitfalls and lost time in the beginning but eventually my co-advisors and I learned enough about distributed management and collaborative infrastructure--mostly google docs--to effectively manage a team of 10 undergraduates.
I realize that I saw many professional benefits in my ongoing experience with iGEM, but all professionalism aside, I really enjoyed my time teaching, learning and leading this iGEM project.

After my first discussion with the graduate students, who were just about to launch an iGEM project at UCSD, my impression was that the aims of this project were extremely ambitious. This made me very curious and I was excited to be on board. It soon fleshed out what would be the precise goal of the project and which tasks should be done. The great organization and strict planing, the regular meetings and terrific support of the undergraduate students by their mentors finally made this project an ongoing success.
During the project, everybody could learn and experience a lot of new aspects of research in diverse fields, reaching from project planing, organization, and conduction on the one side through scientific disciplines bioinformatics, database management systems, software design, interactive graph drawing, data exchange formats and standardization, and synthetic biology to communication, writing, and presentation skills on the other side.

Abstract
PopQC, which is the abbreviation for population quality control, is a new approach designed for biosynthesis production enhancement based on the non-genetic cell-to-cell variation. Because of some nongenetic differences, different cells in a single colony will have considerable variations in protein and metabolite concentrations. Based on this, PopQC was designed as a plasmid-based gene circuit, which continuously selects high-producers to increase production.
We first use ordinary differential equations to demonstrate that the concentration of intracellular glutamate can vary in a wide range in different cells and stay stable because of two feedback suppression networks, which provides a theoretical basis for our experiment. We then use biophysical model to simulate the biosynthetic performance of our system based on the inhibition effect of promoter's occupation by RNA polymerase. In this link, we find that with tetracycline added to the medium, mRNA distribution of tetA is significantly different in different cells because the intracellular glutamate concentrations are different. This means our system has high sensitivity, and tetracycline can be used to achieve separation of high-producers and low-producers effectively. Finally, we use our model to simulate the production increase and predict the best initial condition to get the maximum production. The result demonstrates that precise regulation of tetracycline concentration is needed near the critical point of production increase in industrial production. Here we also designed an interactive part to show the result dynamically.
Intracellular Glutamate and GltC Concentration Simulated by ODEs
Figure 1: Pattern diagram of PopQC based on our design
In our project, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 was selected as the engineered strain introduced into the PopQC plasmid. In Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3, the intracellular glutamate concentration varies from 20 mM to 200 mM based on some nongenetic differences, which is from the result of our lab's previous work. We hope in the presence of PopQC, high glutamate strains can stay alive while low glutamate strains are unable to survive.
GltC combines with glutamate to form GltC-Glu complex. And it 's suggested that in the case of Bacillus amylolique"

Engineering a Metabolic Pathway
In this simulation, colored beads were poured through each set of clear tubes.  The beads represented chemicals or molecules entering a pathway which would alter them.  The tubes represented the pathways which consisted of different genes being expressed at different levels.  The first scenario represents a properly engineered pathway where the output of both genes is similar.  This model allowed the beads to flow through the tubes with a constant pace.  Our second scenario represented what can happen when a gene in the pathway is over-expressed.  Here, the first gene was expressing at almost double what the second gene could take in.  This caused the beads to build-up in the first tube while only allowing a small amount through the rest of the pathway.  The third scenario shows a missing gene or a gene knockout situation.  This pertains to the Biodexification project in how we are identifying the necessary genes for the HMF pathway to function in E. coli.  When beads were poured through, the bottom tube did not receive any as they were not ""metabolized"" and in the correct form due to the missing gene.
Assembling a Plasmid Activity
This activity explained individual parts needed to make a functional plasmid and how they are used in the processes of transcription and translation.  The group was given an handout of definitions of each part and, with our help, were able to put each part where it belongs.
Presentation to Science-U High School Students
A major question that we were faced with this summer was what to do to continue the outreach of previous Penn State iGEM teams. Presenting to SCIENCE U was one of the results of our efforts. This presentation  was to 30 high school students about genetic engineering. ScienceU is a program through the Eberly College of Science at Penn State and the goal is to reach out to kids in the community and provide a learning opportunity for them to spark ingenuity and a passion for science. The camp that we presented at was a week long program  called ""Science Leadership Camp"" where high school kids of different ethnic backgrounds were able to come together and learn about possible career paths in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," by researchers. These habits of scientists, in their ordering of biological materials or in their conceptions of necessary conditions of security, will determine their ethical discourses and recommendations. The other explanatory element I found in that article is the reassuring fact which can be found in the procedural, even bureaucratic, conditions to make synthetic biology. Thus, we can see here the expression of a “engineering mind”, expressed in rationality in that procedural form of the system of production and exchange in life science.
Biosafety stakes will have numerous effects on the way we will treat biosecurity problems. We won't take back all the containment proposals already mentioned and we will focus on new arguments, new discourses which are expressed when actors have to face “bioterror”. The proposals mentioned here also have to be considered as answers to some risks in biosecurity concerns.
3. Biosafety and biosecurity : a differentiated focus.
In reference to its institutional membership with the European Commission and in a strategic perspective, the Synbiosafe report relates an interesting element about the formulated ethical stakes in synthetic biology. The report draws a gap between American and European interests about ethical stakes about biosafety and biosecurity. Europe is said to be more interested in biosafety matters and that the USA is more concerned about biosecurity problems. The report asked, in that reflexion, the more strategical and political question of it : “Will synthetic biology deepen the transatlantic divide opened up during past biotech debates?”. We won't go deeper into that point but we can notice the geopolitical stakes of biotechnologies that can come with ethical questions. Governance and political strategies that occur with the precautionary approach has to alert us about different motivations of the ethical debates on biosafety and biosecurity.
B. Biosecurity
1. Overview
Vivagora refers to the democratization of access to synthetic biology as a cause of new risks. Thus the “important volume” and “low prices” of genetic elements are presented as possible causes of biosecurity risks. The internet, even if not directly mentioned, is considered as a new way of circulation for factors of risks, permitting visibility and large scale access to that genetic materials.
The question of internet (which will be more developed later) lead us to wonder about the nature of the goods of synthetic biology and about the risks it could contain. The immaterial nature of the goods of synthetic biology finds its origins in the field of genomics, discussed from an illuminating point of view in the works of Kaushik Sunder Rajan (Rajan 2006). He doesn't actually write about synthetic biology but about genomics"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

Clamping Down on Crosstalk:
Reducing Noise in Multi-Gene Synthetic Biology Circuits
About this Project
Building complex biological systems with many genes requires isolating genes. Active genes can cause nearby DNA to become supercoiled,
leading to unpredictable behavior of synthetic biology systems. We will test if DNA clamps (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between
genes can stop this interference. If this project succeeds, it will allow bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuits.
Watch our introduction video here.
What is the context of this research?
Programming cells often requires building ""circuits"" of several genes
together on the same piece of DNA. Bioengineers have observed that
when two genes are placed next to each other, they often unexpectedly interfere with each other's
expression in an unexpectedly orientation-dependent manner. Nobody knows with certainty what causes this genetic crosstalk, but one promising
theory involves DNA supercoiling. The transcription of DNA into RNA, the transcription process introduces supercoils, similar to kinks in a tightly-wound phone
cord. Supercoils directly affect the expression of genes, turning them on or off depending on the direction of the supercoil.
What is the significance of this project?
If successful, a DNA-binding, gene- isolating clamp could be used in any multi-gene circuit assembly, making multi-gene assemblies more predictable and their assembly much more efficient.
This is particularly relevant when engineering metabolic pathways to produce chemicals
like methanol, insulin, or antibiotics, where circuits of many genes are routinely constructed. The physical layout of these circuits can unpredictably affect production of
the desired output by several orders of magnitude, so large engineered metabolic pathways must typically be hand-tuned or have many configurations screened for activity. By
making gene expression more predictable, our results could greatly improve the predictability (and, therefore, designability)
of large gene circuits for metabolic engineering.
What are the goals of the project?
We will first build several plasmids (circular pieces of DNA) that
demonstrate cross-talk between genes. These plasmids
will consist of genes for two different fluorescent"

What recent or upcoming research projects in synthetic biology and genetic engineering are you most excited about? What would be your dream syn-bio project?
""I am very excited about the possibility of incorporating human cellular machinery in bacteria. There are significant post-translational modifications that have a strong impact on the function of proteins, such as folding and glycosylation. However, these processes are not necessarily conserved between humans and bacteria. Bridging that step and giving bacteria that functionality to create human proteins, post-translational modifications and all, is a big dream of mine. If I were given one syn-bio wish, it would be to be able to predict the structure of whatever functioning enzyme I wanted, and to be able to make it (is that two wishes?). The idea that we could manipulate biology at the molecular level might seem crazy, but it's something I have high hopes for future generations if not our own.""
Cornell University | Ithaca, NY
What upcoming research are you most excited to see happen in the field of syn-bio?
""If you were to ask me this question a year from now, my answer would probably be different. The pace at which researchers are pushing innovation in this field is absolutely incredible; a year from now, who knows how many discoveries will be published that will shape synthetic biology? For the moment though, I’m most excited to see what can still be accomplished with CRISPR: such precise DNA-editing tools will always have an enormous impact on synthetic biology and biology as a whole. We saw a similar effect many years ago with restriction enzymes; granting people the ability to reliably modify DNA evolved biology by leaps and bounds. CRISPR is still in its infancy yet has exploded on the scene. Just thinking about it excites me and makes me want to push the limits of this system.""

We tried again to miniprep yeast, this time washing the glass beads multiple times to get rid of residual isopropanol. The results were much better: a DNA curve.

The ACHEMA is the largest exhibition on Chemical Engineering, Environmental Protection and Biotechnology and offered the teams a wide range of interested audience during the presentation of their projects. At the booth of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the teams of Darmstadt, Frankfurt und Marburg were able to present their projects. The Darmstadt team could not only inspire the audience with posters, but also with a presentation as well as many flyers for their project. Laymen, scientists and companies could be convinced by the project ""Next Generation Recycling"" of the Technical University of Darmstadt. The contact to the other iGEM teams from Hessia was of course promoted and it was possible to replace the content and progress of the projects. The project offers in the area of environmental protection many approaches, so it was not surprising that the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) was interested in the project. Members of the DBU stayed a long time for intensive discussions at the booth. To conclude, the ACHEMA offered the team an exciting platform on which they could perform a ""reality check"" of their project. The interesting discussions with members of economy and science showed them the deep meaning of their project and point out that the iGEM Team of Darmstadt is on a good path.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"This year the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology’s (RHIT) team looked to control the aerobic respiration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by manipulating the expression of the mitochondrial protein mRPS12. In order to verify if their negative control ∆mRPS12 knockouts were successful, RHIT tagged the protein with a yeast-enhanced GFP so that under fluorescence microscopy they could easily see if their recombinants’ mitochondria were green or not.
Although RHIT did not have access to a fluorescence microscope on their home campus sufficiently powerful for that purpose, after a series of emails between RHIT and Purdue iGEM the logistics were laid for our teams to come together and tackle that problem in the early morning of August 10th, 2016.
After booking a time with Purdue’s Bioscience Imaging Facility Dr Andy Schaber our teams (or Rose-Hulman’s and Biomaker Barrett Davis) were able to meet up, verify the proper positional expression of yGFP in RHIT’s constructs, and still have time for lunch.
In return, RHIT contributed (like the University of Exeter’s team) to our team's past project database and provided feedback on our teams protocols for biosafety involving the sol-gel immobilization process.

Using such statistics is a common way to infer the current status of synthetic biology. In fact, lots of academic reviews of synthetic biology mention the iGEM competition to infer the current trend of synthetic biology in a particular country.
The number of participants in the iGEM competition has been increasing steadily every year. This trend holds true for some of the 5 Asian countries that we have investigated. For example, among the 5 countries, China has the most significant increase in the iGEM competition participation. In 2007, it only had 4 teams, but in 2012, there were 26 Chinese teams in the competition. The number of participants from Japan generally increased from 2006 to 2012, but this increase is not as great as that of China. For Hong Kong and Korea, the numbers of participants are nearly steady. For instance, from 2010 to 2012, Hong Kong steadily had 3 participants that had join the iGEM competition. In comparison with the number of participants from the United States, the number of participants from East Asian countries is still relatively small.
East Asian countries first participated in the iGEM competition in 2006. Korea and Japan were the first ones to join the competition. Ever since, the majority of the participants from Asia were from East Asia. For example, in 2011, out of 46 participants from Asia, only 5 were non-East Asian teams. The number of participants, however, from other regions is increasing, creating more diversity in the competition. Bogor Agricultural University has joined from Indonesia in 2012. In 2013, two teams from Indonesia have registered for the iGEM competition.  To do comparison between different countries it is necessary to get relative values of participation because the number of universities in each of these countries is different. The total number of universities in each of the countries were searched online and compared as a percentage of the ratio of number of teams in the iGEM competition over total number of universities in that country.
The relative values calculated show very different result. If the ratio of number of iGEM teams over the total number of universities is considered, four of the countries/regions (Korea, Hong Kong, China, and Japan) actually have higher percentage of participation than that of the United States.
With this data we can understand why the recent increase in number of participants from Hong Kong and Korea was steady. It is because these two countries already have relatively higher percentage of participation"
