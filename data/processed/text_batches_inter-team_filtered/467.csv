If A cell is the traitor, it would not produce 3OC12-HSL that could help B cell, and in the meantime prevent production of toxic protein to itself.  We use tetA, a tetracycline transporter which could also transport toxic Nickel ion into cell as the toxic protein. The B cell has the same design except that it expresses enzyme LusI to produce a different AHL (3OC6-HSL) and senses the 3OC12-HSL.  The A cell can sense 3OC6-HSL and produce the antidote to zeo. The cell with more antidote protein and/or less toxic protein will grow faster, which in our system suffer less “jail time”.
The reason to use mathematic modeling
As a whole system, it is the mutual interest for both to cooperate. However if one chooses to cooperate, it may risk that other would enjoy its collaboration but defect it. It’s a complex problem that how our prisoners choose their strategies to ensure their survival. We would like to explore various strategies and the consequences using mathematic models so as to explain experimental data. We also want to find interesting alternative phenomena that do not exist in the classic prisoner’s dilemma.
the model
We model the density dynamics of the two cells over time based on the degree of their collaboration. Our model is consistent of ordinary differential equations for the densities of two cell types and two AHLs.  The detailed description of all the equations and parameters are described here
What's the difference?
Our E coli system does not entirely mimic the classic prisoner’s dilemma. Since a cell population can grow or die off, the AHL it produces could also vary independend of its cooperative spirit. There are some interesting alternative scenario.
So our prisoner have a chance to make a dynamic choice, they can decide to what level the collaboration will be put into effect. The degree of collaboration is also directly related to the well being of the cell, namely its concentration. This adds another level of collaboration without the cells themselves realized it. This important difference makes our system more close to the realistic.
The prisoners will never really die in a classic situation, but in ours there exist some possibility that one type of cell can actually die out which will result in a big crash of the entire population. This is what we should key our eyes on.
Numerical experiments
To confirm whether our simulations can work out a good result, we want test some important parameters to see whether our subsystem can work properly,

Figure 7. Plasmid dynamics over a lineage in presence of resistance and plasmid-dependent growth Introduction of a new feature to the system, a plasmid-dependent growth, cells shows loss of synchrony in growth, favouring cells keeping similar levels of both plasmids. Left picture shows the plasmid copy number over time and right picture shows the lineage tree as a chronogram.
This way to tune the plasmid levels is unable to make them equal, as depicted in the following picture. Also, there are variations in their growth rates.
Figure 8. Resistance-induced plasmid levels modulation (left) and doubling cell time (right) Resistance is able to equal the levels of both plasmids, even there was a difference in initial conditions, although there may be a small difference. This is achieved by decreasing the doubling time of cells with similar levels of each plasmid, obtaining a distribution in these times as shown in the right picture.
Approaches for less computational expensive
Although these simulations are powerful and helpful and yield informative results, they are computationally expensive. This could become an important pitfall when dealing with a huge number of cells or long times. We tried to bypass this problem by using an approach if we are working with populations as explained in [16].  We added a degradation process for each plasmid following the equations:
$$ \alpha_{P_i \rightarrow P_i-1} = \frac{log(2)}{\tau} \cdot P_i$$ This approach can be used to study cell dynamics in a population. With the system of equations, we capture the global dynamics for a cell population.  If there is no resistance, we find dynamical examples where a plasmid is lost.
Figure 9. Plasmid levels in cell lineages without resistance modulation using a less computational approach. Simulation of all features are time-consuming and computation expensive. However, simpler approaches can lead to similar results. In this particular example, the drift of a plasmid is shown.
Comparison with wet-lab data
The interaction between two plasmids in the same cell is still an uncharted territory. A relevant example is shown in [15], where the authors obtained an emergent behaviour as result of an unexpected relation between the bacterial physiology and plasmid dynamics. Using models in single plasmid dynamics, we switch between deterministic and stochastic models to learn about the unspecific interaction between two plasmids in a cell. There is an important variability, which drives the system away from orthogonality. Plasmids with"

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

SYSU-China,2014,Team:SYSU-China#file#HumanPractice#Newsletter.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. The interview with the glorious team: SYSU-China in 2013
The previous honor in 2013 of SYSU-China is an exhilarating memory, and their experience is interesting and inspiring not only for us, but perhaps all teams. In the Newsletter No.5, XMU-China interviewed the two previous leader and wiki designer of SYSU-China in 2013, who took the team to the finalist and get 2nd Runner Up and best wiki.

Fig-2: About the interview of SYSU-China 2013 in Newsletter
<p1> Up-left: Mengyi Sun, one of the previous captains, is giving a lecture; up-right, Yuchen Zhao, one of the previous leader, is perhaps having dinner; down: the home page of SYSU-China wiki last year. </p1>
To some degree, there is a consensus in every team that team-construction is a one of the key points (even maybe most important) to achieve great success in iGEM. Accordingly, XMU-China Designed several questions for Mengyi Sun (see Fig-2), the previous captain, which focus on member selection, team difficulty, and work efficiency.
The Answer, not unexpected for us, is simple but clear: interest of science of synthetic biology and enthusiasm on experimental work lay the foundation of success. Based on such gist, we believe that the member selection (if there is a selection for your school) might first consider whether this person is willing to contribute to the project with interest and enthusiasm, rather than skill and knowledge background. If most members are intrinsically engaged in the project, other problems will not be critical.
To our great surprise, the interview also invited Yuchen Zhao (see Fig-2), another previous captain, who wrote an open letter for current SYSU-China in Newsletter No.5, additional memoir. The letter recalled the memories we went through, and we were still somehow moved deeply by her words, even though one year was past and the team was brand-new.
Additionally, XMU-China released the readme of one of our previous wiki designers, whose brilliant work"

The analysis of results before(2014.10.12)
We have gotten a suitable concentration of protein by the modified Zhang’s protocol, but it is still a problem that the activity of protein after dialysis is too low. But it just have a little for us to upload our results, Asking the Professor Cong Yu, we decided to do two methods to  refold, Su use the dialysis, and it will be longer but will be more hopeful, Long use the Yu’s advice, he will do the refold when flow out through the Ni Column, it will be shorter and quicker.
Sixth try—not the last try(2014.10.13~2014.10.16)
Background
The more important thing changed to the how to refold the protein and make it active, Su will do the Zhang’s method and Long will do a new method that Prof.Yu told.
Protocol of Yu’s
Ni Column refolding, it’s easy. Just need to add the refolding buffer when we did the elution of Ni Column.
Results
What we did not think of is that the refolding buffer have made before have EDTA, the protein flow out with Ni and other things, but we collect all the buffer, and use the super filter (10kDa) to concentrate the solution. And without a test, we give it to the Hela cell group to test if it can do the transformation.

The Modular BioFactory
This project uses the yeast P. pastoris as a cellular factory to produce terpenoids. Terpenoids are hydrocarbon molecules that serve many purposes; they have anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, anti-malarial and anti-bacterial qualities and are also of use in the cosmetic and chemical industries. Most terpenoids come from plants and, usually, their yields are low. The goal is to increase the yield through the use of synthetic biology, making a bio-brick platform which could be suited to specific ends and further expanded and controlled.
Taking advantage of the existent Mevalonate pathway in P. pastoris (the metabolic route which provides the precursors to the terpenoid biosynthesis) -engineered to limit negative feedback loops- the terpenoids of interest will be produced by introducing the appropriate synthases. By means of siRNA silencing, the sterol pathway will be controlled to ensure that most of the substrates will be channeled to terpenoid production.

Solving the problem this way provokes several mutations in the bacteria's genome but it will stay alive because it maintains a functional DNA. Activation of the polymerases IV and V only occurs in advance stages of the response.The system comprises a negative regulator of the SOS response (LexA) and a positive regulator of the SOS response (RecA). The idea is that UV irradiation promotes LexA autocatalytic activity and RecA is activated. Then, LexA will not be able to bind to the promoters (SOS boxes or LexA boxes) and transcription will start (here is our construction with the protein we want). The process is relatively slow, reaching higher values of expression more than one hour later [3].
In our construction, we have picked out the LexA-binding site inside RecA promoter and then we have inserted a GFP sequence. Then, after irradiating we can see fluorescence… E. coli has accomplished our order!
How did we deal with this construction? We designed a UV-irradiation controlling device called Tordeitor 3000, so we could emit UV (254nm) without risk. After putting the plates, we irradiate different times in order to expose E. coli to different energies [4,5,6].

Set up growth assay - aliquot M9 Modified Media into smaller bottle and add thiamine and antibiotics appropriately. Wash LB interlab cultures using this supplemented M9 media, and grow in plate reader for appropriate duration. We only have access to the FluorStar overnight today.
Grow up cells of your choice in conical flasks in LB (under 1 hour if 1:5 dilution; if longer growth time desired dilute in 1:20, 1:50, or even 1:100 as necessary). Stop incubation of these cells at OD600 ~ 0.4 - 0.7, then wash with unsupplemented M9 salts to halt growth. These cells can then be used for microscopy and flow cytometry.
Microscopy: remember to book the microscope under the “confocal” sheet outside the door. Also, after completing session, consult Chris for demonstration on how to clean up microscope objective lens.
Flow cytometry: Consult Chris to arrange a time when George is also available, and work out how to use the flow cytometer properly.
Microscopy image analysis: If no one else has a laptop with MATLAB installed, grab Leon to learn microscopy image processing from Chris. Before that, get Leon to copy all the image files we’ve had thus far out of the microscopy PC.

Day 36
Tasks
Basically repeat as much of the Day 35 workflow as possible, briefly:
Wash overnight cultures in M9 media (unsupplemented) for single-read fluorescence and OD600
Wash overnight cultures in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for growth curve
Set up flasks of washed culture (appropriate dilution) in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for microscopy and flow cytometry.
Day 37
M9 salts haven't arrived, should start interlab from making M9 media. Same as usual, except please do catch GDubz for cytometry.
Wash overnight cultures in M9 media (unsupplemented) for single-read fluorescence and OD600
Wash overnight cultures in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for growth curve

Dangerous chemicals
We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which has been replaced by anthocyanin for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted the use of dangerous chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we are also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.

We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity.
Results
Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. Figure. illustrates the changing distribution of EBFP2 florescent intensity in response to Dox gradient. With higher concentration, the distribution shifts to the right till reaching saturation. (TRE-EBFP2N:IntN and TRE-EBFP2C:IntC group is displayed as an example)
The shift, however, is only intuitive. We need more accurate methods to study the quantitative properties. To do this, we plot transfer functions of each group. Transfer function demonstrates the relation between the input level (Dox concentration) and the output level (amount of florescent protein). Plot the function, and the shape of the curve is highly informative.
The transfer functions of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though"

Team's Message
We must be cautiously optimistic about DIYbio's potential. We cannot readily draw parallels to other success stories that started at the amateur level.
Unlike the other sciences, biology is dynamic and never at equilibrium. In other experiments, the results can be predicted in some sense, because they are governed intimately by the laws of physics. However, biological systems are inherently designed to adapt rapidly and unpredictably, to narrow down the most efficient options for survival.
As such, we cannot afford to take unnecessary chances because we cannot predict the outcome or the magnitude of our actions. So if you engage in DIYbio, have fun but act responsibly!

SyBRE
Past participation of ITESM’s teams on the iGEM competition has not been properly organized from an institutional angle. The first involvement, in 2010, was an entirely student-formed idea and, although it was supported by some school authorities and faculty members, it was not planned. With the experience gained, the second year partaking was more prepared, but it still lacked a formal structure with which to guide, support and fund the project.
For this edition of iGEM, the school division prepared an official elective class –Synthetic Biology- which students had to take in order to access the institution’s official support. This was a step forward, but it had a mayor disadvantage: the class was imparted in the January – May semester. Project proposals were elaborated and discussed during this time while the instructors gave feedback and suggestions. Before a panel of teachers, researchers and the division director, the selection was made at the end of the semester: out of the three final projects, two merged and the school decided to register two teams.
Having the ‘go-ahead’ at May, meant that –due to normal waiting times and some bureaucratic red-tape- the genetic constructs would be ordered in June and would not arrive until late July. Other reagents and materials would have to wait until the start of the August – December semester to be ordered along the usual academic laboratory requisitions. iGEM lab work is supposed to be made during the summer (or, even better, started previously), not frantically during the first two months of a school term.
In order to ensure that future teams from the school can compete in an ordered and productive manner, with plenty of time to spare, we decided to institutionalize the school’s participation in iGEM through an official student group. We already had the intention of setting up a group to form, coordinate and support student research teams in synthetic biology, so we included the organization of the iGEM participation into the work plan and filed all the appropriate papers. The group name is SyBRE (Synthetic Biology Research and Engineering). It was finally approved and sanctioned by AGE (the student group’s governing body) on September 24th.
SyBRE’s mission is to encourage research and engineering in synthetic biology amongst the students of ITESM’s Monterrey Campus. It will seek to include members from a cross-disciplinary background in order to broaden the scope and reach"

Week of August 6th: ITS Paper & Christine Loh Interview
Monday, 8/6:  Today, Linda, Casey, Consuelo, and I (the only ones left D:) worked together in creating demo videos for ITS, including a cute video of SynFlo and another video for the MoClo planner.  Also, we did some background research to help Orit with the ITS paper, including pulling together background information on the MoClo planner- I'm glad that the abstracts and things for the summer research poster are put to good use!
Tuesday, 8/7: Today, mainly Consuelo and I worked on preparing and perfecting a great demo video for ITS, as well as helping Orit with the MoClo and SynFlo papers for ITS.  A lot of proof-reading and editing papers today, but the papers got submitted!  Yay!
Wednesday, 8/8: Unfortunately I did not have a very productive day today- I had to upgrade my operating system to Mountain Lion, and that took a very long time.  The next things I have to work on are the abstracts for the IGEM website and the preliminary responses for the safety page.  I think our responses will be very interesting considering that we are a software team, but we designed our projects with wet-lab teams in mind.  I think I might have to go back and look at some recent articles and policies regarding safety in synthetic biology before I jump into this question.
Thursday, 8/9: Packing, and also writing....
Friday, 8/10: Today I did an interview with Christine Loh, who is a research technician at Sirtris over in Boston.  We had a very informative and interesting discussion regarding development of an electronic lab notebook, but also pertinent organization software tools used for collaboration and data-sharing in the lab.   We also talked extensively on biosafety and biosecurity.

We did it!
The title is obvious, but just to say it again because it feels so good: “We did it!” Pathomon got accepted by the App Store! On our very FIRST try! Since we expected one or more rejections and multiple days of bug fixing, this is a gigantic relief and may allow for some relaxation time before our flight to Boston.                     Now, there is only one thing left to say: Go download Pathomon and try it out. Its full potential will be unlocked at the Giant Jamboree, where the hunt for QR-Codes can begin, but downloading it now may provide you with a headstart and maybe you will be the first to achieve the final rank of Nobel laureate! We wish you a good virus hunting!

The website freeze is advancing rapidly and only a few hours are left to share the last status update of Pathomon with all our dear readers: And guys, we’ve done it! Well probably… When this post goes online, we will be right in the middle of the app store reviewing. If we pass it, Pathomon will published and open for all of you. If we fail… well let us not think about that!  I’m just kidding, we expect to fail the first time, because this is basically part of the development process. But after fixing hopefully minor stuff, we plan to be available in the store before the first day of the giant Jamboree!

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," contains a degradation tag (e.g. BBa_K1926013). This would allow a more dynamic system characterised by fast localisation of mCherry to the nucleus and consecutive degradation, returning the cell to its original state.
Finally, we incorporated a KpnI cutting site between PhoCl and mCherry and a BamHI cutting site between mCherry and the stop codon. These restriction sites allow easy exchange of the mCherry part with any other gene flanked by these sites in an iterative plug-and-play fashion (see Litcofsky et al. 2012 ). These two enzymes were chosen because they are not found in the iGEM submission plasmid pSB1C3 and therefore allow the plug-and-play method with a wide range of BioBricks.
dCas9-TF
The aim of the dCas9-TF design was to replicate the results of Nihongaki et al. 2015 with a dCas9-p65 fusion protein instead of a dCas9-CIB1 and CRY2-p65 heterodimerizing system. For this purpose we contacted Dr. Nihongaki who gave us the sequences for his constructs as a gift.
The dCas9-p65 is targeted towards an mCherry reporter via a gRNA that has 13 different binding sites upstream of the mCherry reporter.
Using pcDNA3.1 as the vector and Qiagen’s “SuperFect® Transfection Reagent” kit as the transfection method we aim to express exogenous mCherry as reference for the testing of our final siLACE construct.
The dCas9-p65 coding region has been flanked by a KpnI cutting site (5’-end, downstream of the start codon) and a BamHI cutting site (3’-end, upstream of the stop codon) for further usage.
siLACE system
After we produced and tested our two test constructs the final single-illumination light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector system (BBa_K2332317) is created by choosing the dCas9-p65 gene as the ‘cytosolic domain insert’ of the PMDS. Since the dCas9-p65 incorporates a 5’ KpnI and a 3’ BamHI site it is suitable for plug-and-play exchange with the mCherry from our test PMDS. PMDS is thereby modified to deliver the dCas9-p65 to the plasma membrane instead of mCherry.

Environment pH may also affect the rate degradation of PLGA. Strongly alkaline and acidic media leads to a faster degradation whilst less acidic and neutral media exhibits slower acceleration on the rate degradation.
Also, another important parameter is the amount of drug load. PLGA loaded with high drug concentrations increase the initial burst release.
Finally, in biological systems, the degradation may be influenced by enzymatic activity. However, there are not conclusive results in how the enzymes play a role in the degradation process.
Modeling
The model is based on the diffusion from the antimicrobial peptide in the interior of the PLGA nanoparticle to the exterior of it. Since our peptides will be delivered through PLGA 50:50 nanoencapsulation, we decided to use a simple Fickian diffusion model as suggested by previous research4, 5, 6.
The diffusion equation can be seen here:
Where:

Unitless, from 0 to 1
T

R

⍺
The initial burst, which is a normal behavior of PLGA-drug release systems where quantity of initial drug is released independently of time.
A fraction, in relation to the total amount of drug
We adapted this equation to our needs, adding a new variable ẟ that represents the remainder of dosage still within the nanocapsule such that ẟ at a given time is equal to the subtraction of the amount of peptide released at that time from the full load.
Since our capsules will travel through two stages, inside an adult bee and within royal jelly, we also established a delivery time (td) and expressed the diffusion equations in relation to this travel path.
Since programming to infinity would imply an infinite calculation time, it was also necessary to define the appropriate boundary conditions for the summation. Since this summation converges, we can find an n at which every new summation term is insignificant (adds an amount smaller than 0.00001).
Before receiving the data for the radii range in our nanoparticules, we picked boundary conditions based on a wide range of previously reported4 diffusion coefficients and radii, as well as time (from 0 to 35 days, far beyond what we need).

We suggested that the Montpellier team spend more time developing their final product since they had not considered dosage, ways to switch off production of the contraceptive, or a delivery method. We may also teach them about riboswitches or other regulation methods that might be applicable to their project.
iGEM TecCEM
The TecCEM iGEM team approached our team with an interesting proposal; their team wanted to create a fun iGEM-themed music video showcasing iGEM teams from around the world. They requested we take a brief video of our team dancing to the Maroon 5 song ""Moves like Jagger"" that they would turn into a fun parody called ""Moves like iGEM"". This collaboration was brief, but we had fun coordinating with other iGEM teams worldwide for a fun side-project.
iGEM ULaval
The ULaval iGEM team is working with S. cerevisiae to create adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine. They contacted us to discuss product isolation and quantification, since we are also working with yeast. Their team gave us a few tips to find an HPLC column and machine for our initial, in-lab quantification.

Gradient PCR 3
The primers were G00100_Alternative and K1319004_check_R and they worked well at all temperatures from 60-68°C. To our disappointment, the K1319008 template did not contain K1319004. It is unclear why the 5 bands of K1319008 and I746916 look different.
The results of these three PCRs are:
KAPA2G Fast ReadyMix worked well
all three primers work well at >65°C annealing temperature
K1319008 template contained I746916 instead of the intended K1319004 ORF
It was concluded that a similar check PCR with 65°C annealing temperature will be done on all plasmids and cryos of K1319008.

transformed several constructs into chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells.

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge_-_-_TEXT.html,"iferin, with light producing systems from Vibrio fischeri.  We believe we have created the first BioBrick to emit light in normal E. coli strains without the addition of any external substrate.
Tools
During our project we made extensive use of Gibson Assembly to manufacture our parts, and have submitted an RFC to the BioBricks Foundation to help future teams make best use of this technique.
Along with this, we also constructed a number of tools to assist the synthetic biologists of the future:
Gibthon Construct Designer allows the user to enter a series of BioBrick or GenBank IDs in a specific order and computes the appropriate primers for Gibson Assembly .
BioBrick → GenBank allows parts from the registry to be downloaded in .gb format, making them compatible with a wide range of biological software.
The Ligation Calculator is a small calculator to help you work out the proportions to use for ligation in BioBrick assembly without having to worry about units.
The E.glometer is a cheap, easily built, piece of electronics for measuring bioluminescence.  It allows scientists without access to expensive plate readers to measure bacterial light output and has potential applications in quantitative biosensors .

An Overview of Alberta Regional Team Meet-ups
CAMPUS FAIR: JUNE 6TH 2009
During the University of Calgary Campus Fair, we held three main activities:  making “biosaurs,” a pipetting competition, and guessing the number of tube caps in a bag. The “biosaurs” were crafted from sheets of foam, glitter, glue, and coloured pens and the kids seemed to be fascinated by the idea of bringing their bacteria to life by using different types of crafts.
For the pipetting competition, we provided kids with plastic pipettes, tubes, coloured water and pseudo-lab gear and had them compete by trying to fill the most tubes with water using pipettes. We were incredibly surprised at the number of kids wanting to participate in this competition and as such, we held multiple competitions to accommodate everyone. Everyone participating in the competition received some type of prize, including kind donations from one of our sponsors Alberta Ingenuity. After the competition, the pipettes and coloured water were left out so the kids could continue to play.  This activity was very well received as the kids loved “dressing up like mad scientists!”
Lastly, we prepared a bag full of tube caps and asked kids to guess how many they thought there were in the bag. It seemed that the prize “Totally Wacky Scientist” capt"

Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli. Our approach was to use both genome sequencing and molecular biology experiments. We were able to get at our answer by using RNA-seq to study the genetic correlations of species' radiation responses and by cloning genes from the literature.
Team Philosophy
Our diverse team is based at Weill Cornell Medical College, but consists of undergraduates from a wide variety of New York City universities.

This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to                         separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our                         team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of                         one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass                         production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of                         UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we                         included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense                         if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding                         enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually                         employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate                         Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us                         in refining our experiment and to give it a try.

Contact with Local Hospital and Patients
In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to                         discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to                         determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in                         the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term                         treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing                         effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.                         She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in                         dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing                         cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications                         include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant                         rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves                         symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.

The Missouri S&T iGEM Team saw this as a prime opportunity to reach out to the new students on campus.  While the book describes the story of Henrietta Lacks and the impact of her cells on her family and the medical research community, not much is explained about the research or how it is conducted.  Our team collaborated with the English and Technical Communication department to put together a seminar that describes how biological research is performed and how it can be applied.   We also gave students a chance to experience biology hands-on by showing them how to extract DNA from wheat germ.  At the end, students were entered to win cancer cell plush toys!  Overall, this event helped to reach out to the new student body while also educating students about the applications of biological research.
Biological Sciences Open Lab
Each semester the social group, Helix, in the Missouri S&T Department of Biological Sciences hosts an Open Lab where all of the biology research labs in the department gather to explain their research to interested students.  iGEM has commonly participated in this event to reach out to biology students interested in a student-run research group.
Celebration of Nations
The Missouri S&T Division of International Affairs hosts the Celebration of Nations every year in the Rolla, Missouri community.  The event consists of a parade through the downtown of Rolla that showcases the nationalities of students on the campus and ends with a fair full of international crafts, foods, games, and performances.  As the iGEM foundation consists of teams around the globe, the Missouri S&T iGEM team participates with other student organizations by marching in the parade.  This is one of the first large campus events of the fall semester, thus our team uses this event to not only show our Missouri S&T pride but also to get new members involved in a simple and fun team event.
Speak Up Speak Out
iGEM hosted a seminar that was part of the Speak Up, Speak Out series by the Cultural and Leadership Programs on the Missouri S&T campus.  At these events, students are invited to engage in facilitated discussions about controversial topics.  For our event, we discussed the ethics of genetic engineering, genetically modified organisms, and the applications of synthetic biology with interested students.  This was a great learning opportunity for students involved and many reported a better understanding of synthetic biology after the event.  It also allowed our team to gauge campus attitudes and misconceptions about genetic engineering, and it gave us a guide for how to approach future educational events.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," free RelE molecules in E. coli cells, after activation of the artificial RelE production, shown logarithmically. The condition for induced dormancy is an amount of free RelE molecules around tens of copies. The three highest levels of RelE production, correlating with the highest promoter strengths, show little difference in the time at which dormancy occurs. When the RelE production is set to 10.5 molecules per minute, dormancy is induced more slowly and stabilises at lower concentrations. The lowest RelE production value does not trigger dormancy, and has only little effect on the system.
RelB is Required for Activation of Bacteria after Dormant State
If RelB was not expressed, the bacteria remained dormant for hours after RelE production had ceased, making it clear, that production of the antitoxin RelB was necessary for activation. Considering the stability of RelE in non-growing conditions, it was not surprising to find that RelB production would be the primary element in sequestering free RelE.
Figure 2. The logarithmic plots shows that the decrease in free RelE in dormant bacteria is low without artificial expression of RelB. None of the simulated bacteria reentered an active state within the modelled time.
Appropriate Ratio of RelE and RelB Expression is Essential
Different expression rates of RelB were combined with production rates of RelE at 35 and 100 molecules per minute, corresponding to relatively medium and strong expression levels respectively. This revealed that variation in RelB had a higher impact on the time required before the dormant state was reached when the RelE production is lowered. Out of the established configurations, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration showed promising results. Compared to the RelB2:35-RelE:35 configuration, where only few bacteria reenter an active state within the modelled time set to 2.5 hours, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration revealed a high sensitivity to the expression level of RelB. This indicated a need for the expression of RelB to be higher than RelE, but as the best results were achieved at low production rates of RelE, it is important to stringently control the expression of RelB to ensure that the bacteria are able to enter dormancy.
Figure 3. The variation in time required for the bacteria to enter an active state for different expression levels of RelB is dependent on the level of RelE expression. All configurations achieve dormancy within the modelled time.

Therefore we developed a wiki, communicated our project in the media and taught primary and highschool students more about our project and synthetic biology in general. Above all, we organized an ethical debate because by discussion you get a deeper insight in different opinions. To realise all this in a structured manner, we need a cooperation between all team members and subteams. We want to keep you up to date by sharing our history and timeline.

Outreach
Our work is worth little if our results are not accepted or wanted by the public. Therefore learning about the perception of synthetic biology is crucial. Additionally, to gain the trust of the public a sound ethical foundation as a base for our work is necessary. In our survey we learned, that most people only accept synthetic biology if they feel educated about the subject. Therefore we went to schools to teach students some synthetic biology fundamentals. Finally to boost the impact of our project we collaborated with other teams to make our and their projects better.

The Project
Patterns are fascinating, from the veins of a leaf to the stripes of a zebra. They are everywhere in nature, but why and how they are formed is not entirely understood. The way cells of multicellular organisms interact to generate a specific pattern has triggered our curiosity. We, the KU Leuven 2015 iGEM team, engaged in a project on the regulatory mechanisms of arrangement formation. Our mission is to engineer bacteria able to communicate and influence each other’s behaviour resulting in the assembly of predictable visible patterns.

Symposium
On September the 7th, 2015 we organized the KU Leuven iGEM 2015 Symposium on Synthetic Biology, Cell Systems and Ethics in Biochemistry. Hosted guests included 4 neighbouring iGEM teams, academic staff, students, sponsors, and iGEM supporters from 6 different European countries. During this full-day event, the participants had a chance to attend the lectures by home speakers as well as by invited international keynote speakers from both the academia and the industry. The iGEM teams presented their research, and probably the most awaited part the debate on ethics in biochemistry took place in the afternoon.

Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Project#Components_-_-_TEXT.html,"avage activity can be modulated by the binding or absence of the ligand. In other words, when the ligand binds, it can promote or inhibit the cleavage activity by effecting a conformational change. In this way, the aptamer becomes an on or off switch for the ribozyme.
If the hammerhead-aptamer fusion is placed in between the GAL4 gene and a terminator, when switched off by the binding of its ligand of interest, it will stop cutting the poly-A tail off of the mRNA, resulting in increased gal4 expression. If the RNA fusion is configured differently, the binding of the ligand can alternatively become an on switch for the hammerhead ribozyme and therefore an off switch for GAL4.
Figure: Christina Smolke's example system for sensing theophylline in this manner.
Processing Modules
We focused as a team on the simplest of processing modules, one which simply amplifies the activation of the input module and passes on the signal to the output module. We achieved this by promoting the HAP1 gene with the GAL4 Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS) promoter, so that when GAL4 is expressed by the input module, the gal4 protein activates transcription of the HAP1 gene.
There is lots of scope for more ambitious future processing modules like the following:
Inverters
Day- or night-only logic gate
Pulse generator
Logic gates governing behaviour in response to several input modules
For our project however we focused on input and output modules.
Output Modules
These are how mösbi will let the user know that its input module has been activated. It can be anything that is detectable by human senses, be it a colour, a change in shape, a smell, or even a sound if an appropriate genetic system is found and a module designed.
We addressed the two easiest human senses to alert: Sight and smell. For visual alert, we engineered Marchantia polymorpha to express brightly coloured chromoproteins that are produced by corals and sea anemones and were brought to iGEM by Uppsala 2011.
We picked five chromoproteins:
AsPink
EforRed
TsPurple
AmilCP
AeBlue
then assembled two types of construct - one set with the N7 nuclear localisation tag (BBa_K1484104) attached, the others without.
The chromoproteins and chromoprotein fusions' expression was powered by the 35S promoter. To see how this went see our results page.

Team nitroGENIUS Reaches Out
Did you know that at the rate that agriculture is expanding and at the rate that the population is growing, we probably will reach a global food shortage in less than a century? Yeah, neither did we. Agriculture has a big job ahead of it, and unfortunately, the abundance and simultaneous lack of nitrogen in some places is a major stumbling block.
When brainstorming project ideas, our advisors set us on the path of genetic engineering as a way to solve this nitrogen problem in agriculture. As we started to develop and really flesh out our project, we realized that the majority of the GMO publicity on the internet was caustically negative and that most contributors did not have a proper understanding of what a GMO was or how it was created. Of course, people are completely entitled to avoid GMOs as a personal decision, but that personal decision should be based on accurate information, right? We knew at that moment that someone had to begin disseminating the facts via the same medium, and thus, the nitroGENIUS miniseries was born.
Comprising six short episodes explaining the agricultural dilemma and the industrial process of developing GMOs, our video series presents scientific information in a casual, colloquial manner with laughably amateur animations. Amassing more than 600 views on YouTube, our videos have been called ""probably one of the best lay explanation[s]...in regard to the process and planning involved [in GMO production]"" by academics and are even being used as teachers as a model for similar projects. While creating these videos, we have come to a greater understanding of the potential advances that genetic engineering can bring to the table (haha, agriculture, food, you get it). Additionally, we have determined that one of the best ways to inform people is to address them in a comfortable way--short videos with unintimidating graphics and straightforward language are relatable and effective. We hope that our videos continue to educate people about the nitrogen problem in agriculture and the true nature of GMOs and inspire our peers to employ similar method to educate the world about other important issues. Until then.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Design and Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 cumate operator, enablng the expression of the downstream gene. It should be noted that we have added two reporter proteins, RNA spinach aptamer and blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ). Moreover, we have introduced two compatible multiple cloning sites (MCS), surrounding BFP, facilitating the subcloning of a gene of interest in its place. Our aim is to characterize a fully functional composite BioBrick part which can be used by any iGEM team by simply introducing and having upon chemical regulation their gene of interest.
Figure 2. Cumate system with BFP before and after induction with cumate.
In our project, we are planning to remove BFP and introduce the toxin Colicin E2 once the system is adequately characterized. At last, we have added an additional MCS between the two gene regulation units in order to enable further subcloning.
Tryptophan system
Tryptophan operon , comprised of tryptophan promoter and operator, is regulated by a constitutively expressed tryptophan repressor ( TrpR ). However, the TrpR alone is unable to bind to the operator allowing expression of the downstream gene. Only upon addition of tryptophan does the TrpR associate with it and bind to the operator, disabling further gene expression. We placed a red fluorescent protein (RFP) downstream of the tryptophan operon as a reporter gene for characterization of the system. As in the cumate system, we have introduced MCS before and after the RFP sequence, facilitating further subcloning steps. Again, this composite BioBrick could potentially incorporate any gene of interest for future iGEM teams who  are interested in a chemical gene switch.
Figure 3. Tryptophan system with RFP before and after induction with tryptophan.
Our gene of interest is Im2, which would potentially be introduced in the place of RFP. Therefore, our goal is to develop a system in which the antitoxin will be expressed in the absence of tryptophan.
What is our ultimate goal?
The main objective is to fuse the two composites into one large BioBrick part and clone them into our workhorse (TOP10, BL21). Furthermore, we intend to integrate the whole system into the bacterial genome via the mini-Tn7 toolkit. It is imperative to determine whether the expression of the toxin is well-regulated in the absence of tryptophan and cumate, whilst the presence of the two chemicals induces cell death.
What are our limitations?
We should mention that our design is not"

The transformed colonies of Escherichia coli DH5α and RR1 with Biobrick Transformation Efficiency Kit as control and the diluted DNA from the 2013 DNA Part Kit (BBa_E0840) greeeew!!!!  Although we were not sure if we could trust in the results. We made an inoculum using  liquid LB medium from transformed cells (BBa_E0840 and Transformation Efficiency Kit) to make a miniprep  and check the electrophoretical profile of the transformation. To get more satisfactory results we are going to repeat the transformation process only with lineage RR1, shown next :
- Negative control - no DNA;
- Positive control from the Transformation Efficiency Kit;
- BBa_E0840 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
We followed iGEM’s Transformation Protocol.  LB plates – agar with 20ug/ml of chloranphenicol.

Collaborations
Collaboration is core values of iGEM, we devote ourselves to promote the knowledge of synthetic biology and to expand the impact of iGEM in China. We introduced the purpose and overview of iGEM competition the students of Guangdong Experimental High School and helped them to set up a team named GDSYZX-United for the iGEM competition. During this project, we could give some guidance to their project. We also provided some plasmids to them. And we also sent two teammates (Wang Rong and Lin Yunping) to Guangdong Experimental High School for several months to be their art and modeling advisor to help them build web page and design poster. We held a meeting to communicate about project progress and team construction, sharing experience and learning from each other.

Valencia_UPV,2018,Team:Valencia UPV#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". It is very important for all different disciplines to start hybridizing. Scientists should count a little bit more one creative people to give a fresh and a different point of view.
Ana is always into trying new things so she would love to use Printeria for exploring the idea of working with microorganisms.
Printeria should think about working out of the petri dish. Not just using colourful bacteria for painting but trying to mix them with different compounds. Or even, in the future, for synthesizing fibres or even textiles out of bacteria.
Printeria could be sold not as a product for our daily lives but for science schools or even to institutions that do fab lab. So, if anyone wants to use Printeria for an art project, you just go to some of these institutions, you pay a fee and you can use it for a given amount of time.
Safety by design
Paris-Bettencourt 2012 team was right when they said in their page ""How safe is safe enough?"": “Biosafety is an exciting design challenge, an essential enabling technology for synthetic biology, and a fundamental ethical obligation of all bioengineers”.
This sentence describes perfectly what we did with Printeria.  Printeria was designed to ensure safety for all audiences, to be safe enough for the world. In the next table you can see different safety problems we saw with our instructors help, and how we solved them.
Table 2. Safety problems solved in the design of Printeria.
Safety Problem
Solution
Sterilization of the PCB
How do we clean the PCB without damaging the metalic and plastic components? Well, we decided to do what Francisco Mojica recomended to us which is more or less what flow cabins do. We decided to use UV led lights. Furthermore we have programmed an especial reaction that use little droplets with HCl and ethanol to clean and ensure we have perfectly sterilized the PCB.
Sterilization of the microfluidic tubes
The reaction fluid is going to pass through microfluidic tubes and it will contaminate them, to reverse this situation we will use the same special program wich usses droplets with ethanol and HCl.
Protection of the user
We want the user to see what is happening inside Printeria but also we want them to be protected if something wrong happens inside. Thats why we thought that a metacrilate box that cover the machines would be a nice option. Besides, it is useful to pin up the elements which will be part of Printera.
Overheating of the PCB
As the PCB has a cold and a hot zone, it"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," well as our device.
Designs
We gave our testing device a name, ""Fang"". ""Fang"" in Chinese means ""Cubic"" which can describe our hardware's outlook vividly.
In general,Fang consists of four parts, namely the Microfluidic chip, the fluorescence detection apparatus, Raspberry Pi (RPi) and a mobile-phone application(Software). Among these four parts, Raspberry Pi is the main operating system of the entire device, and its functions include chip-driving controlling, image capturing and server-client data transmission.
At the beginning, the sample, which is added into our designed microfluidic chip based on ABCD system, will react to Cas12a and give out the fluorescence signal. Then RPi controlled camera captures the image that would be transmitted to App through Socket. In the meantime, the App will convert the image results into visual and readable analysis reports based on its internal machine learning sample database. Finally, App would also achieve Information Sharing between User and Doctor.
Figure 1. The draft of our hardware –Fang.
The overwhelming advantage of Fang is that it gives the best interpretation of POCT. Fang can overcome the drawback that some tumor/cancer detections could only be achieved in the big clinical laboratory by large and expensive equipment. It can be more widely used in the community hospitals, especially in remote areas which are short of necessary medical resources. In addition, Fang can also be used for risk-monitoring by people who have familial-hereditary disease at their home.
Figure 2. The physical figure of our hardware –Fang.
Microfluidic chips
According to the model of Aptamer Based Cell Free testing system(ABCD System), we put forward the following design using traditional material for hardware—PMMA as the layers.
There are two rooms and two pipelines in our microfluidic chips. The first room is Incubation Room, where we has already covered with BAS systems(Biotin-Avidin System). Inspired by the project of 2017 EPFL , we used ternary affinity coating(TERACOAT) method[1] to pre-treat our microfluidic chip, aiming to coat the aptamers which will compete with target protein. The second room is Detection Room, and we put Cas12a (Cfp1) and DNase Alert in advance to achieve it that we convert the protein signal to fluorescence signal. What's more, there is a pipeline we named Pneumatic Valve between Incubation Room and Detection Room. It could control liquid flow through changing the motor speed, which would generate differential air pressure caused by barometric pressure"

8. Introduction to Synthetic biology Course by  iGEM Guanajuato_MX & iGEM Calgary
    Team Guanajuato in collaboration with Team Calgary, designed a small introductory course on the basics of biological engineering, consisting of 8 lectures through the course with duration of 2 months. These lectures were aimed at first semester Biotechnology students from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education Campus Quéretaro.  The course was given by Uriel Eleazar Barboza Pérez (iGEM Guanajuato_MX), Tiffany Dang ( iGEM Calgary ), Aidee Rodriguez (iGEM Guanajuato_MX)  and Shalpinder Dhothar (iGEM Calgary)
WORKSHOPS
    We have worked in the design and performing of workshops related to life sciences. The specific goal of the workshops is sharing scientific knowledge with young students about microbiology, molecular biology, and structural biology.
    The first workshop called Bacteria in my life and in my lab was performed in collaboration with Jorge Rocha, a postdoc in Harvard, as a part of the program Clubes de Ciencia Mexico in Yucatan on July 28th. This workshop combined microbiological strategies with computational tools in order to assess evolutionary processes in bacteria.
    The second workshop was called Hacking a fluorescent bacteria; this workshop was performed in collaboration with Biohackademy in the Lab of Physicochemistry and Engineering of Proteins, UNAM, in Mexico City on August 27th. The goal was the teaching of basic tools of molecular biology such as bacteria transformation using Green Fluorescent Protein as a reporter gene.
    The third workshop was called 3D Biomolecules. It is an introduction to Structural Biology using software and 3D printing for the visualization and editing of proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites.This workshop was performed in Hacedores MakerSpace in collaboration with Biohackademy on August 29th.

The mutant TetR plasmids plated yesterday yielded only one colony, even the mutation control didn't work. Nadine plated the rest of transformed cells, but probably the cells in the mutagenesis kit are too old to be competent.
Alessandro took plates from the day before and about 20 colonies grew for Reporter-Lysis with BL-21 and less using DH5alfa cells; for Reporter-RFP just 1 colony grew; about 10 colonies for Pconst-TetR. Alessandro screened some of them with colony PCR. The results are available only for Vincent's plasmid (our positive control) and for the pSB3K1-Pconst-TetR and they are positive (but we cannot estimate the size since the ladder seems to be very degraded). For Vincent's plasmid, together with cells Alessandro also made the PCR with the purified plasmid (to check whether the primers are good).
The following day the results for the other plates will be available and Alessandro will make co-transformation with Vincent's plasmid and with psB3K1-Pconst-TetR in order to assess the expression of RFP, controlled by TetR.
Friday, 05 August 2011
Nadine checked the 2nd plating of the mutagenesis experiment, and again we had cells only for the 4th mutagenesis(about 10 colonies). She made liquid cultures from 5 of them, the miniprep will be done tomorrow.
Colony PCRs for the Reporter-lysis plasmid have been made but they failed... so we have to start over again from Gibson assembly. Only one sample for Reporter-RFP has been tested, and the colony PCR also failed.
Alessandro and Alina made Kanamicine plates and Kanamicine+Ampicillin plates. Alessandro transformed:
pSB3K1
Vincent's plasmid (J61002-Ptet-RFP)
pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR
the old Gibson assembly for Reporter-RFP
co-transformation with pSB3K1-Pconst-TetR and Vincent's plasmid
The transformation were performed for pSB3K1 because unexpectdely the liquid cultures for pSB3K1-P"

Und jetzt? Wie geht es weiter?
Für die Teilnahme an iGEM2015 stehen noch sehr viele Vorbereitungen an, momentan konzentrieren wir uns auf die Suche nach neuen Teammitgliedern.
Sobald sich ein neues Team zusammengefunden hat, ist natürlich die Findung eines neuen Projekts von größter Bedeutung. Bei dieser Projektsuche kannst auch du als neues Teammitglied auch aktiv mitwirken und so das iGEM2015-Projekt zu deinem Projekt machen.
Außerdem muss ein geeignetes Labor inklusive Ausstattung organisiert werden, wir benötigen dringend finanzielle Unterstützung durch Sponsoren und erste Grunddesigns des neuen Wikis (im Wiki wird das Projekt dokumentiert) sollten angefertigt werden. Im Verlauf des Jahres werden einige Teammitglieder vielleicht an SynBio-Konferenzen teilnehmen - dafür müssen wohl schon im Frühling erste Poster erstellt werden. iGEM ist daher nicht nur ein rein naturwissenschaftlicher Wettbewerb, sondern beinhaltet die komplette Organisation eines Labors inklusive Finanzplanung und PR-relevanten Aktionen (z.B. Website, Poster, Präsentationen). Aufgrund der Vielseitigkeit der anstehenden Aufgaben sind auch Studentinnen und Studenten aus nicht-naturwissenschaftlichen Fachbereichen (z.B. Mediendesign, Medieninformatik, BWL,...) herzlich in unserem Team willkommen!
Sobald Projektskizze und Finanzierung stehen, kann mit der Laborarbeit begonnen werden. Der Hauptteil der Laborarbeit wird dabei ab Juli/August durchgeführt werden. Der Wettbewerb endet dieses Jahr Ende September / Anfang Oktober mit einer großen internationalen Abschlusskonferenz in Boston, MA, USA.

Aiming to build a Tristable Switch which could successfully show three main features: distinct and steady signal outputs with rapid state-switching ability, we carried out the characterisation of our prototype to see if the construct could fulfil all our needs. This could also provide us with some intuitions in the way of fine tuning the whole construct in order to ameliorate the"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-N_-_-_TEXT.html," our drafted ideas into one cohesive overview of our work to-date. Each of us also wrote about our own contributions to the project and personal reflections describing our feelings towards the journey thus far.
Also, our two captains and our PI met Dean Wolf, Dean of Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Roger Trippel, Senior Director of Development and Individual Giving, and Abigail Kaun, Special Assistant to the Dean. We discussed the project to-date, our outreach efforts, and shared ideas for managing both our and future iGEM UCSC team’s funds.
Created first batch of YPD medium and also created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of our Y. lipolytica strain. We attempted to miniprep our pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli but we made a mistake by switching the order of wash buffers used from the Zyppy Miniprep Kit. The Nanodrop curve of the plasmid sample was ragged and thus we will need to attempt this again.

This week, the captains held check-ins with each individual on the team to hear concerns and alleviate worries, since we are now halfway through the summer. While the captains were busy with meetings, the rest of the team was working hard as always. Our modeling team started a growth curve for Yarrowia lipolytica so we can better understand the yeast’s growth rate, our riboswitch team began lab work, our plasmid team started linearizing plasmids, and our outreach team continued to update the wiki page and started creating a presentation for high schoolers.
Four of our team members and our PI took a vacation to Minneapolis that wasn’t much of a vacation at all. The small group toured Medtronic's Operational Headquarters, Physiological Research Laboratories, and the University of Minnesota's Visible Heart Lab. Almost every other second of the trip was spent on the BMES Coulter College Conference, which required teams to come up with a medical solution to a need. Our team focused on hypertension in resource-constrained settings and developed a solution in the form of a blood-pressure-monitoring phone case and app. Even after the conference, the fivesome was hard at work; they met with the University of Minnesota iGEM team, toured their lab, and gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising.
The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL"

Our logo is designed finally. It is a visual field through a microscope. You could see us in this microscope.
Our iGem is coming to the end. But our projet will continue.
Of course, we encountered many obstacles and difficulties such as financial problems, cooperation and communication problems of teammates, spirit pressure, time management and so on. But all the hardship turned out to be a precious experience that helped us grow up. Anyway, iGem is one of our most precious experiences and we will never forget these days and night in the lab and meeting room, all the laughs and tears. We have learned a lot in this project except the attending the competition itself.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," in the placenta, which might be an interesting side-topic for our application. They also said that the current antibody dipstick tests for HAT are of bad quality since confirmation tests are always needed. Furthermore, the interpretation of the result is subjective and depends on the researcher, hence there is a high chance of false positives or false negatives. One way to solve this is to quantify our results, making it more objective. In addition, a cold chain is currently needed while delivering the tests, and tests that can avoid the need for a cold-chain would be very beneficial. The delivery on site is very important, so the on-site test is definitely of value. A drawback in detecting antigens instead of antibodies is that we need to test for viruses in blood, which is difficult but not impossible. This is not so much a problem for HAT. An alternative application that they mentioned was sheep, where a virus (Cache Valley virus, CVV) causes abortion of the lamb. This can spread to humans so a new diagnostic would be valuable. Moreover, Trypanosoma is also a problem in cattle, which might also be an interesting side-story.
We also asked them about vector monitoring, regarding our previous decision of not making it our main story. They told us that for vector monitoring the rapid characteristics of our device is not needed. Furthermore, with PCR you can detect any virus you want whereas our system is specific for one virus. Hence, we made the right choice in focusing on human screening.
July 10
Dr. Philippe Büscher
Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.
HAT has been a problem in Africa for many decades. Even though this disease is long known, researchers have still not been able to develop a good diagnostic tool. However, alternatives are available, meaning viral diagnostics have higher priority. As a lot is known about HAT, it is a good example to prove that our device can be used in fighting parasitic diseases. In his opinion, our device should contain a positive control, and an LED-screen for quantitation of the result would be a good addition.

We will prepare a LB medium with different cadmium concentrations in a microtiter plate as shown in the diagram below, and see the change in OD660  and compare the differences between WT E.coli, E.coli expressing metallothionein, and E.coli expressing transporter.
 
 
3. Result
As Cd(II)  concentration goes up, growth of E. coli starts to slow down. At 270 µM , 300 µM and 400 µM Cd(II) concentration, there is no difference in the OD595 between E. coli WT and mutant expressing PduP1~18-fMT or PduP1~18-SmtA (Fig.7). However, at 240 µM Cd(II) medium, E. coli expressing PduP1~18-fMT showed a rise in its OD595 at around 6 hours. The difference becomes more significant as the Cd(II) concentration decreases, until it reaches a concentration of 120 µM where the growth between metallothionein expressing E. coli and the wild type becomes very similar.  Unfortunately we could not see SmtA to function as a metallothionein, as it showed a similar growth curve to the wild type E. coli. However, looking at the graphs showing growth curves at Cd(II) concentrations 150 µM, 180 mM and 210 mM, cells expressing fMT shows a significant growth when compared to the growth of wild type. This result suggests that fMT bound to Cd(II) taken up by the cell, and allowed them to resist Cd(II) better than the cells without metallothionein.  Our PduP1~18 fused fMT showed to maintain its function inside the E. coli.
The graphs in Fig.10 and Fig. 11 show growth of E. coli that makes SmtA in different concentrations of Cd(II). In the previous experiment, we could not observe the tolerance of E. coli expressing PduP1-18-SmtA in Cd(II) containing LB medium,  but when"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

As a social focus of our project, we are making an effort to create a community of all the iGEM teams working with light induction systems. To date, we have established contact with teams from Rutgers, Minnesota and Freigburg. We hope this to keep growing.
In order to make communication and  cooperation between teams easier, we created a Facebook group. It was called iGEM Lighters, and by this media we invite all the ""light-teams"" to join us. Here is the link: http://www.facebook.com/groups/164426413628518 We really hope you to be a part of it.
We believe this could be a great way of collaboration, as well as a good example to others teams that may inspire them to create networks with common objectives. The same way, this can be an opportunity for us to be known by researchers that could help us out with some of our doubts and problems; such as Dr. Jeff Tabor (well known by most of you, pioneer on this matters), who is already aware there are several teams working with light induction and has always been pleased to help us.

Overview
The expression of interacting genes depends on the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN). In order to figure out optimal biological networks that can particularly function reliably when faced with fluctuation of DNA template amount (copy number), it is important to do some simulations in advance to narrow the screening scope. Therefore, it would be easier for us to search for adaptive and robust networks in wet lab and theoretically discuss certain functional regulatory motifs that are significant in showing adaptation. In our project, we abstractly analyzed gene regulatory network topologies and computed all possible three-node network structures by enumeration. We modeled, synthesized, tested and made comparisons, and finally screened 3 optimal network structures out of 19683 network structures, which show great adaptation to copy number. In order to verify the correctness of our screening process, we introduced an optimal testing case and simulated to check the results. Based on our screening results, we analyzed and concluded 9 core motifs that may be essential to adaptation. We respectively simulated these motifs and tried to explain their characters via mathematical proof. Finally we figured out a general rule of artificially constructing an adaptive network by combining core motifs.
Construction of Networks And Description Mathematical Description -- ODE Equations
We based on the Michealis-Menten Equations to describe the kinetics of gene regulatory networks, and simulated some basic modules of regulatory edges such as Mutual-activation, Mutual-inhibition, Activation with negative feedback, Inhibition with positive feedback, Self-activation and Self-inhibition.

The big question of what leads to success in iGEM was therefore investigated using the database with a special focus on gender. In order to be able to get a general idea about iGEM team success, a point system was put in place.
Points were attributed the following way.
For the medal: 1 point for bronze medal, 2 points for silver medal, 3 points for gold medal. For the world jamboree qualified teams: 2 points for every team taking part in 2010 and before (before regional jamborees existed) , 6 points for team qualified for world final (after 2010). For special prices (Best ...): 6 points were attributed for each regional price earned (only after 2010), 13 points for each price earned in the world final (all price worth 13 points before regional jamborees existed). For the final place in world final: 15 points for the sixth team, 20 points for the fifth team, 25 points for the fourth team, 30 points for the third team, 35 points for the second team, 40 points for the firth team.
Figure 9: Gender balance and succes in iGEM. The proportion of women in teams that have won prizes in iGEM compared to the proportion in teams over all.  There is a significantly higher proportion of women in teams that win prizes (p=0.034).
The aim was to give each team a score that is proportional to the rewards it earned, taking in account that all teams were in world jamboree prior to 2011, without having to be qualified in regional jamborees.
Best score is for the Imperial College London team in 2011 (81 points).  All teams (all years) average is 7.41 points, considering teams with no points (due to withdrew).
Correlations studies between this number of points and other variables show that that for all teams, the main variables explaining success in iGEM is the number of years of existence and the size of the team. It would therefore seem that mixity would not be a factor. However, when looking at correlations between variables of teams who truly succeeded (points > 20) , the variables that have a significant correlation with the number of points become the sex ratio and the number of supervisors. Therefore it could be hypothesized that beginning iGEM teams have to face major challenges but when the team existed for a few years and general organization or funding problems have been dealt with , diversity could be a factor"

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," change the state of the terminator on its own, but only in combination with the identity site. So the challenge is to arrange and optimize these elementary building blocks thermodynamically, that a trigger site is only able to switch in combination with its respective identity site. This was done by in silico design using NUPACK , presented in section in silico design .
Putting it all together: the switching process
The basic structure of a switch (left) and a transmitter RNA (right). See text for details.
The functional principle of the designed switches is illustrated in the figure. The switch is positioned on DNA upstream of a desired output transmitter. So in the absence of a triggering transmitter molecule, transcription will be canceled by the formation of a RNA stem loop in the nascent RNA-chain. This will cause the RNA polymerase to stop transcription and fall off the DNA and consequently no output RNA will be produced. This process only relies on rho-independent termination .
On the other hand, in the presence of a input transmitter , this small functional RNA inhibits the stem loop formation by complementary base-pairing and hence avoids termination of transcription. In detail, the identity site (red part on transmitter) binds the recognition site (red part on switch) and serves as toehold , which will thermodynamically allow the trigger site (turquoise part on transmitter) to perform a strand displacement and open up the stem loop structure. Consequently the polymerase can read all the way through and form the output RNA.
Summing up, we use this concept to create a switch that can be toggled by a transmitter RNA molecule and in response, is able to produce another transmitter RNA.
From switches towards bioLOGICS logic gates
As described, each switch can be accessed by a specific RNA-transmitter molecule, representing the input. In turn, another RNA-transmitter molecule will be produced if the switch shifts its state. This output transmitter of one switch can serve as input transmitter for the next switch by meaningful selection and design of the respective recognition sites. This easily allows arranging several switches in specific sequences and faulty  wiring - the corner stone of a logical network.
To ease the building of logical networks we want to create a switch capable of Boolean logics, a common mathematical principle fundamental for computational science. Since AND/OR/NOT are basic logic operations which can be implemented with the presented switches, all remaining operations (such as XOR, NAND, ...) can be expressed by these three operators according to laws of boolean logics. Creating logic gates is achieved by combining two switches in two different ways, as illustrated below.

In the threshold device, we need to prove that the in-promoter will have different responses corresponding to different plasmid numbers. In our project, we use the inhibitor protein as the signal. We combined the wet experiment results and the mathematical model to prove our system can work in order. We divided it into two main goals:
(1) To prove that inhibitor’s concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
(2) To prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration

2. Found out the concentrations of inhibitor under different concentrations of arabinose and used the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit.
3. Employed plasmids with different copy numbers and simulated the concentrations of plasmids losing on different levels
4. Employed different RBS and promoters with different strengths to change the inhibitor concentration

1. Constructing the circuits.
We used PBAD promoters in all three circuits. All the circuits contain a B0034 and a B0015. [BBa_K2120303] [BBa_K2120304] [BBa_K2120304]
Fig. 1 Arabinose induced expression cassette of three kinds of inhibitors
We used the red fluorescent protein to replace the killer gene and constructed three circuits [BBa_K2120301] with different in-promoters (controlled by inhibitors). Two of them [BBa_I13521] [BBa_I6031] comes from DNA Distribution kit.
Fig. 2 In-promoter controlled expression cassette of RFP. RFP is used to replace killer gene.
And we separately assembled the two devices.
Fig. 3 Assembly of inhibitor and in-promoter. They can be used to test the minimum arabinose concentration which can totally repress the expression of RFP.
But when we added the arabinose, the RFP intensity increased, and it contradicted with expected results. We thought the terminator cannot completely isolate the two devices. So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. [BBa_K2120310] ["
