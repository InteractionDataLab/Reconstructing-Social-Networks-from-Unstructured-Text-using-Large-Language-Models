Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"2: As illustrated by the 2017 University of British Columbia iGEM Team, sites farther from the PAM sequence are less important to target recognition.
Software Module
The purpose of our software tool (CrisPy) is to provide a fast and accurate way for characterizing CRISPR on-target and off-target edits through Sanger sequencing. Software tools have attempted to numerically characterize Sanger traces in the past. Mark Crowe’s SeqDoc (Perl, 2005) provided functionality for normalizing and comparing two traces. More recently, Timothy Lu’s Sequalizer (Matlab, 2017) used these comparisons to estimate nucleotide mutation frequencies. Our system builds upon this previous work by incorporating modified versions of these algorithms in a concise and easy-to-use python module. Moreover, this module creates new functionality by predicting and ranking likely off-target sequences (using Gibbs free energy) and finding their mutation frequencies, for both the given traces and its reverse complement.
We used this tool to successfully collect all of our target mutation frequency data (see
results
). In the future we plan on fully characterizing the off target mutation frequencies in our CUTSCENE system.
The workflow for the tool is provided below. It is our hope that synthetic biologists can use this tool to quickly test for off-target mutation frequencies that exist in their system.

Cell lysis
The frozen pellets were allowed to thaw and resuspended in 10 mL of Tris-HCl binding buffer. The cells were lysed by probe-sonication at 60% amplitude with 2 minute cycles of 2 seconds on, 2 seconds off. The samples were kept on ice throughout the sonication process. The cell debris was pelleted by spinning and the supernatant removed for purification.
Purification with a Ni-NTA column:
The column was washed with Buffer A (10 mM imidazole, 40 mM Tris pH 8, and 400 mM NaCl) to equilibrate the resin. The samples are added and the column is washed with Buffer A, and then eluted with increasing concentrations of Buffer B (500 mM imidazole, 40 mM Tris pH 8 and 400 mM NaCl).
SDS PAGE:
Samples were prepared for SDS PAGE by adding 7 µL of SDS running buffer to 20 µL of the fractions of interest. 8-20 µL of each sample were run on a polyacrylamide gel against a molecular weight marker.
Concentration:
PHB depolymerase (phaZ 1) and PUR esterase (EstC2) were concentrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer.
Proteinase K kinetic activity assay
Tris-HCl buffer ingredients:
1 litre of millicule water  10.5 g of NaCl (180 mM) 0.65 g of CaCl2 (5 mM)  1.7g of imidazole (25 mM) 6 g of Tris base (50 mM) Add HCl to bring the pH to 7.4

Purdue,2009,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," push before the October 21st deadline.
October 3rd, 2009 We began co-culturing the microglia and glioblastoma cells to see if there is any natural attractiveness. We were  able to gain pictures at t3 due to having to wait 3 hours for the cells to settle. We did not want to create any reactions by jostling them. Migration was not able to be quantified, but we did learn that there is a natural attractiveness at t3. At t18, the attraction is slightly less. This may be due to a lack of chemotaxis coming from the stem-like cancer cells. Our designed construct was finally approved and sent to Genscript. Once we recieve it we hope to transfect and send it to MIT.
October 5th, 2009 We transformed the plasmid we recieved from Columbia to collect and purify the tat-p50-GFP fusion protein they provided us. We hope to use His-affinity columns to collect and then add it to the BV2 and GAMB1 to quantify uptake. This should contribute to our model and give us a better understanding of how the whole process will work. Currently waiting on the His column to come in. We have created a frozen stock.
October 8th, 2009 Worked on the model and maintained cell lines.
October 12th, 2009 Put the BV-2 and GAMB1 lines into a 3D pura matrix gel. This allowed us to see if the morphology of the GAMB1 would maintain a neuroshpere shape, and to redo the BV-2 experiment to make sure the first time was not a flook. We have t0 pictures as well. Due to scheduling conflicts we do not have fluorescent pictures, but we hope to have some for our power point presentation, as well, a co-culture in the 3D pura matirx.
October 17th, 2009 Brought up a new line of BV-2 from frozen stock to prepare them for transfection and maintained the GAMB1 line. No sign of the designed construct.
October 19th, 2009 No sign of construct or His-affinity columns. Have used this time to finish up the wiki and plan future experiments.
October 20th, 2009 Working on the wiki and have decided on our Halloween costume. Have been told that the construct will not be here until Friday :(

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," be cultured and re-used for a long period. Culturing the bacteria can be                             performed on a large scale. Costs of medium are very low. Overall, our living material can be                             produced very cost-efficiently and upscaling would further reduce cost. Before seeding our                             hydrogel with bacteria, they can be modified for expression of different proteins. By also                             culturing these bacteria that express infection-reducing enzymes, patches that fight infections                             can be created by a very modest increase in costs.
Conclusion
Although we use toxic chemicals for the synthesis of the hydrogel, they are removed by extensive                             dialysis of the methacrylated dextran resulting in a biocompatible end-result. Furthermore, a                             leakage test showed that no leakage occurs from the gels over a period of two weeks. This means                             that the chemicals do not yield any risk for users of the bandage. The use of a novel,                             radiation-based crosslinking method and alternative catalysts could reduce the toxicity of the                             synthesis and polymerization reactions, which would be beneficial for manufacturers. The gel is                             biodegradable, and its production is relatively cheap.
Patient safety
Problem: We should not only cure patients, but also avoid their infection with E. coli and inflammation of the patch.
Experts: Plasmacure, Maasstad Hospital , Dr. Edgar Peters, Dr. Jacques Neyens, M.D. Lesley Bouwer
Solution: Dextran is biocompatible, the used bacteriocins seem safe to humans (clinical trials still required). Our E. coli strain is harmless.
More information
To address this issue, we consulted several experts from the field of wound healing, diabetic wounds and burn wounds.                             The enzymes that will be secreted by our patch need to be safe in human systems. Lysostaphin is one of these enzymes.                             Lysostaphin efficacy has been extensively tested in murine and rabbit models, confirming its effectiveness against                             S. aureus causing several types of infections (e.g. nasal, orthopaedic implants, abscess lesions, aortic valve                             endocarditis) (9–11) . In those cases, lysostaphin treatment was reported to be non-toxic (11) . Clinical studies must                             be performed to confirm these statements. Therefore, clinical trials are necessary to show that lysostaphin causes                             no harm when it enters the body through the wound. Although most bacteriocins have no effect on human cells in low                             concentrations, less is known about higher concentrations. Besides lysostaphin, our E."

Absorbance calibration
Aim
To produce a calibration curve to aid in the normalising of absorbance values.  The relation of absorbance reading to number of cells varies with different cell strains. We are therefore doing one for Top-10.
Assay
Cultures of the E.coli with the relevant vector are grown to various cell densities. A sample of these cultures are taken and a dilution plate is carried out to work out approximate colony forming units per ml of culture. This data set is then combined with absorbance readings to create a graph relating the number of colony forming cells per ml to their absorbance measurements.
This curve then allows us to convert absorbance of a known volume of culture to colony forming units within the culture sample.

Public Science Education Cartoon of Gene
        We also made a catoon to illustrate what is gene and how transgenosis happen.
Set Up iGEM Club[2016.10]
        Students of our school has formed teams and participated in iGEM for six years, and                     we are going to carry the torch. As students have passion and favor, and with the support of our school,                     we established SCUT-iGEM club in the beginning of 2017.
Winter Training[2017.1]
        During the winter vacation, we had a short course on synthetic biology and invited                     professors to give lessons which enjoyed great welcome among the students. We also invited some senior                     students to share their experience about iGEM which interested the freshmen and inspired them to start                     a team to prepare the competition.
Weekly Presentation
        Many freshmen were potential members of the next year’s iGEM teams. They had amazingly                     great passion but also required the basic knowledge of synthetic biology and the understanding of iGEM.                     Thus, we instructed them to read academic reviews of synthetic biology as well as previous iGEM wikies                     and let them give presentations to share what they learn weekly. During the presentations and discussions,                     we would point out their sparkle and flaws, discuss with them and put up with solutions of their problems.
Mentor New Teams
        In May, some freshmen of our school began forming the team for next year’s iGEM.                     They were industrious, brilliant, creative and confident. We often had discussion with them and give                     some guidance to their ideas.
Science Center Teach-in[2017.3.5]
        In 5 th March, we participated in a seminar held by Guangdong Science Center, the largest science museum                     in Guangdong, China, to introduce our project to the public. We successfully raised public awareness                     of heavy metal pollution via this activity and told people the examples of using synthetic biology methods                     to solve the relevant pollutants problems.

     If you are interested in  performing the simple and rewarding DNA extraction we demoed at the Charleston  Farmer's market, or if you would like to host an event of your own, we have  provided a copy of the handout we distributed at the event. It gives  instructions for the setup and completion of the extraction. Click on the image  below for a larger version.
 
iGEM Surveys
     In addition to community  outreach, our team participated in three surveys hosted by other iGEM  teams.  Look below for a brief summary of  these surveys, and please follow the links to learn more about these teams and their  human practice projects:
Mexico-UNAM-CINESTAV  circulated a survey focused on the legal issues at the heart synthetic  biology.  Engineering in a space where  nature has provided many of the tools is a unique legal challenge, and the  questions of intellectual property and patent rights have yet to be  decided.  UNAM Mexico is working to  address these questions.  
METU_TURKEY_SOFTWARE designed  an intra-iGEM survey to determine user's opinions of the Registry of Standard  Biological Parts, with the aim of improving and updating the means by which  teams acquire and submit parts. .

The first of the three (Castor) is the same for both pathways and brings the reaction to the  intermediate 3-(R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.  After that the reaction can proceed as shown above or  with the enzyme Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase or PhaC the intermediate can be used to make  PHB.  Castor can be ligated together with either of the other two constructs to create a useful  pathway for one of our products.
Method
The amino acid sequences used for the enzymes were converted back into nucleotide  sequences and then optimized for use in plants, or more specifically Physcomitrella patens.  The  sequences were then optimized into ~500 base pair gBlocks final constructs were then built using Gibson Assembly or CBAR.  Then the constructs were  ligated into our vectors; which were Ti-plasmids.   TM which were synthesized.  The
The entire pathway was broken into two distinct pieces, each of which gives us  one of our two final desired products.  The first half of both constructs brings us to 3-(R)- hydroxybutyryl-CoA and is referred to as Castor.  This can then be converted into either butanol  or PHB depending on the following enzyme(s) in the pathway.  The first construct consists of the  preliminary pathway and an additional four enzymes in a construct referred to as Pollux which  converts 3-(R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA into butanol.  The other is a single enzyme after the first  half that gives us PHB.  The construct containing the single enzyme is named after the enzyme:  PhaC.
Results

After transfection with Agrobacterium of the Castor and PhaC constructs into Nicotiana, the  transiently transformed leaf segments were excised and stained. The leaf segments and control leaf  cuttings were examined with spinning disk confocal microscopy for the presence of Polyhydroxybutyrate  (PHB) granules. The preliminary staining results were inconclusive.
Expected Results:
Given ideal staining and PHB production in the cell cytoplasm, we expect to see granules of PHB  within the cells. These are expected to be well deﬁned against the background ﬂuorescence of the  stomata, tricomes, and cell walls. It is also expected that GC-MS should be able to detect the PHB from  the leaf cuttings.

Yale,2015,Team:Yale#practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s presentation was focused on showcasing the applications and implications of genetic engineering and Synthetic Biology in a relaxed and non-technical way. This way, even laypeople were able to understand and attend the event. This presentation was an adapted version of the SSRI presentation, with a similar outline but leaving out the ethical considerations section for time’s sake. During the presentation, Dan gave a quick summary of the history of genetic engineering, and then proceeded to delve into three important applications of genetic engineering: Golden Rice, Artemisinin, and Algal Biofuels. In talking about Golden Rice and Artemisinin, Dan made sure to highlight two common themes among the problems, Vitamin A deficiency and Malaria respectively, which Golden Rice and Synthetic Artemisinin aim to solve: prohibitive cost of a cure, and lack of sufficient infrastructure for a non-biology-based solution. For example, providing Vitamin A pills to Vitamin-A-deficient people in Southeast Asia is impossible due to the cost and logistics of distribution in third-world countries. In discussing biofuels, Dan showed how much more viable algal biofuels were than corn or grain ethanol, and why companies are investing millions of dollars into the technology. The presentation was around 40 minutes long, and included members of the Yale Community.
LGBTQ Survey
In August, Yale iGEM sent out an anonymous survey to the iGEM community to gauge how open and welcoming the iGEM community is to LGBTQ individuals. iGEM is an ideal organization to survey as it is a small community with members who come from various backgrounds. The results of the survey show a large distribution in how members perceived their work environment. While the number of respondents (n = 13) is not enough for the data analysis to be significant, the responses still point to a general desire to improve the iGEM community in terms of its treatment of LGBTQ members.
The questions asked where the following:
1. I consider my sexual orientation or gender identity to be an important aspect of who I am.
2. I would prefer to be open about my sexual orientation or gender identity to my team.
3. I have felt uncomfortable disclosing my sexual orientation or gender identity to members of my team.
4. I feel like my team is supportive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ members.
5. iGEM provides a safe environment for LGBTQ+ identified participants.
6. iGEM adequately addresses the needs of LGBTQ+ identified participants.
7. iGEM can improve its dialogue on marginalized identities, including race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status.

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," local feedback loop of the final product's cGMP level is a regulator of sGC desensitization. In the hypothesis that cGMP may not be a direct inhibitor of sGC activity, it may be the second messenger that generates negative feedback. We assume that NO separated from sGC and D2 becoming D1 are cGMP mediated processes. In our model, the rate constant of D2 returning to D1 can be expressed as:
k4=K4[cGMP]m
K4 is constant. Here, we assume that k4 is mth order of cGMP concentration, where m is the feedback strength of cGMP.
Summarizing the analysis of sGC kinetics above, we using differential equation to describe the whole process:
Let D1=[D1]/[D0], D3=[D3]/[D0], D2=[D2]/[D0]. Meanwhile, we assume that the total concentration of sGC is constant, that is to say D1+D3+D2=1.
We suppose that the NO is immediately consumed when NO is separated from the D2 or leaves the sGC, and generate other substances that make NO no longer free but produce other biochemical components. Thus the result of NO-sGC interaction is that NO have a net loss. The total consumption rate of NO including NO binding sGC can be approximated as a first order kinetic equation:
Here, Lno is the total amount of NO in cells and in the outside, which represens the available amount NO in physiological or experimental conditions, t is time; Kno express the total consumption rate constant of NO, which reflects the bioactivity of NO.
2.2 cGMP's synthesis and degratation
Since the synthesis of cGMP is after sGC(D2)'s forming which has catalytic activity, we assume the yield of cGMP generated from GTP mainly depends on the degree of D2’s activity. cGMP's life is determined by PDE5A's multiple subtypes. PDE5A can be hydrolyzed to GMP. The process of production and degradation can be modeled by Michealis equation:
Supposing that GTP is abundant, the yield of cGMP mainly depend on the concentration of sGC. Studies suggested PDE5A with different substrate affinity、subcellular's position and kinetic properties can catalysis cGMP's hydrolysis. cGMP's balance equation is:
d[cGMP]/dt = VsGC,maxD2- VPDE,max[cGMP"

Campus Activity
Since a great number of senior students have large interest in biology, we design activities of this part with a lot of easy understood examples and knowledge to describe synthetic biology. And drug resistance is known but not familiar to them. They asked us so many questions about drug resistance, especially showing their worries about antibiotics abuse in China. We introduced our project to them in the simplest possible terms, and they understood that synthetic biology might be utilized to solve the problems of drug resistance in China. By the way, some students feel excited when learning genetic engineering in university, which was familiar to them in high school learning. They then discuss with us about whether we can create ideal lives.
Public Outreach
No matter what subjects are, only the ones popularize research results to public affect people’s lives. Therefore, we took our projects out of labs to Guangdong Science Center, which is the biggest popular science education base in Asia. The number of people visiting Guangdong Center just during the National day holiday amazingly exceeds 180 thousand. People of all ages are attracted to our exhibition, which is of novel form. A great many visitors were interested in examples we gave, and interestingly some of them even asked whether it means human can fly if we utilize synthetic biology to joint features of birds and human. Besides, they also question us about the security problems of genetically modified food. Except for answering these questions, we also meet some molecular biological specialists bringing their kids to visit. After the visit, they raised some professional questions about our projects and we discussed about the problems we had met in experimental stage, from which we benefited a lot. By the way, we invite visitors to sign on our scroll as support, and fill in our questionnaires about drug resistance for us to know their"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," relevant communities seeking stimulating dialogues and bi-directional learning. We engaged conversation with Engineer Sóstenes Rafael Rodríguez Dehaibes, CEO of COMVERMIEL and national and international speaker in beekeeping pathology topics in Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. Mr. Sóstenes shared with us some of the studies made for honey exportation and stressed the importance of surveillance plans for this product, which means it must be defined which parameters should be analyzed and at which intervals. This way, there is a minimization of risks, and the cost-benefit is optimized.
Honey needs to meet specific criteria concerning quality, labeling, residues of treatments for bees and pollutants from the environment. It is imperative that honey is processed protecting its nutritional components. Some examples of residues evaluated in honey exportation are sulfonamides, streptomycin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, and phenol pesticides.1 Above all, the analysis of residues requires sensitive methods. He stressed that for antimicrobial peptides, studies had not been done yet.
We brought two posters to the forum, one of them was the
first draft of our Giant Jamborees' poster and the other one was an explanation about what is synthetic biology and its applications. We were visited in our posters by the state delegate of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (For its acronym in Spanish: SAGARPA), Isaac Zepeda Romero, who congratulated us for our work and encouraged us to continue working hard.  Also, we reunited once again with MVZ Ernesto Tanús who introduced us to other more beekeepers, Dr. José Luis Reyes Carrillo was also present.
During this forum, we talked with many beekeepers, between the topics we were discussing they mentioned all wild pollinators are scarce. They told us in Germany when researchers went to the field looking for bumblebees, they did not find any, they realized that their cars had no insects that had hit their windows on the road, there is a degree of desertification of insects.
A research done in 2017 has documented a dramatic decline in average airborne insect biomass of 76% (up to 82% in midsummer) in just 27 years for protected nature areas in Germany. This considerably exceeds the estimated decline of 58% in global abundance of wild vertebrates over a 42-year period to 2012. Their results demonstrate that recently reported declines in several taxa such as butterflies, wild bees and moths,"

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Sequencing of the pSB1C3 plasmid with bhal(T7)_His was ok. In conflict to our reference sequence there was a point mutation in the DNA sequence but this mutation doesn’t lead to another amino acid. So..next BioBrick (<partinfo>BBa_K863020</partinfo>) is ready to use!
The sequenced plasmid bpul(T7)_His showed again the same mutation in the laccase ORF compared to the reference sequence. We concluded that probably the PCR amplification caused the point mutation. So we did the digest  of bpul(T7)_His PCR products from a new PCR, ligated it in pSB1C3 backbone and transformed it in competent KRX cells. Additionally we did the digest tthl(T7)_His and the ligation in pSB1C3 backbone again.
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases:
The whole week we were looking for different sources of the laccase sequences and the corresponding strain, we find an interessting study of the Federal Environmental Agency (Umwelt-Bundes-Amt Germany). In this study they analysed the oppurtunities to synthesis different chemical compounds with the aid of different laccase of Tramtetes versicolor. In this document we found a working group from the Institute of Biochemistry, Dept. of Biotechnology & Enzyme Catalysis at Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University in Greifswald (Germany) who have isolated four sequences of different laccases of Trametes versicolor and the sequence of one Pycnoporus cinnabarinus. We have send a request for the plasmids containing cDNA sequences of five different laccases from Trametes versicolor and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus .

Educative Surveys
MOOC
Banning Plastics
To degrade or not
Silver
Gold
For Human Practices, we started with investigation on issues related to plastic and bioplastic consumption by two approaches: a public survey and a report on plastic legislation. This investigation made emerge questions and necessities, which led us to perform a practical part to cover them, consisting on a MOOC. We also did a degradation experiment given some controversies. They also made us rethink about our project and give further insights, on the scaling perspective, taking them into account.
Initial investigation
By getting involved on the PLA idea, we got to know more about bioplastics and we felt more involved on the plastic waste problem. We aimed to discover how much other people knew about the topic and we conducted a survey.
Besides, we noted that globally, public policies tend to gradually ban plastic consumptions. We wondered bioplastic industry could be affected by restrictive legislations directed at petroleum-based plastics.
On the need of public awareness
After conducting a survey on our project, it appeared that people would prefer resorting to bioplastics in their daily life rather than petroleum-based equivalents. Yet the consumption of bioplastics remains lower. Therefore, we decided to focus on solutions to tackle this paradox.
We first noted that people don’t know much about PLA, and even less about synthetic biology. Thus, the first step required is to carry out a pedagogic communicative approach to arise interest on synthetic biology, and then on PLA. That is why we decided to focus on MOOCs as an effective tool to spread knowledge on this topic.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," goes around the DNA in circles it produces long strands of RNA molecules. Within those long molecules were the repeating small units of microRNA. They coined this method Rolling Circle Transcription (RCT).
Following this discovery, we have figured out we can apply RCT in order to fix the current fundamental issues with biomolecule expression from single DNA templates in the field of droplet microtechnologies. As we are already circularizing DNA molecules in order to perform the MDA reaction in later steps, all that is left to do is to remove the transcription terminator from the catalytic biomolecule library members. Such removal of the terminator highly increases the mRNA concentration from a single template. Therefore, enzymes can then be efficiently synthesized using a single template of DNA.
2. Cells: catalytic biomolecules can also be provided into droplets in the form of cells, which have the DNA library transformed into them (one library variant per cell on average). In turn, the cells may produce the protein of interest. After cells are encapsulated into droplets, cell-specific reagents can lyse the cells. After the cell lysis, an enzyme of interest is released into the droplet together with DNA molecules that encoded it.
Proof of concept
After the esterase mutant DNA library and Substrate Nucleotides are encapsulated together with protein expression reagents the droplets are incubated in order for protein expression to occur.
4. Catalysis of Substrate Conversion
General description
At this stage, each droplet contains produced catalytic biomolecules. These catalytic biomolecules can now act on Substrate Nucleotides. After the chain of catalyzed chemical reactions is over, some of the nucleotides have their substrates removed - they are now Product Nucleotides. Depending on the catalytic biomolecule activity in each droplet, there can be a different amount of product nucleotides depending on the activity of the biomolecule variant.
Proof of concept
In each droplet esterase mutants are synthesized. Depending on their activities, they will remove different amount of substrates from the Substrate Cytidines in different droplets.
Does the design choice of removing substrate  limit the different class of biomolecules we can analyse?
Not at all! CAT-Seq allows to screen biomolecules catalyzing numerous of distinct reactions. Please head to the Substrate Nucleotide design page for more information and examples!

Caltech,2010,Team:Caltech#Human Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA sequence degenerate to an already existing one, then, should not lead to a copyright. Modifying a car engine design does not lead to the patentability of all cars with that engine design, only that of the engine design proper; thus, whole organisms with novel genes should not be patentable in their entirety; the significant changes made, however, are the property of the person responsible and are patentable.
What are the expected effects of proprietary work on the public nature of iGEM? What sort of interface can we expect in general between private and public property with respect to biological systems?
Private use of public property may lead to more novel ideas because of larger incentive and identification with private projects. Take Unix/Linux, for instance: private companies for years have used Unix/Linux, an open-source, public platform, to develop proprietary software. The privatization of development has resulted in refined, successful products such as the Red Hat and Android operating systems, yet the development of those and related software products does not infringe upon the original public nature of Unix/Linux.
For iGEM in particular, the private development of biological systems will not affect the public nature of iGEM or the Registry – the people developing those systems have full right to release their product to the Registry (thus making the parts public) or keep them for their continued private use. The use of parts already in the Registry is equivalent to taking the code base of Linux to form a novel operating system: although the code base is public domain, individual novel contributions are counted as personal property and thus the incentive for private development remains intact.
What is a patent?
Patent Process. Taken from the US Patent and Trademark Office website.
A patent is an establishment of exclusive rights between an inventor or his assignee for a finite period of time in exchange for public disclosure of an invention or innovation. Functionally, a patent gives an inventor the time to profit off of his invention for a time period wherein his competitors cannot copy or use the patented idea legally without an arrangement with said inventor. Additionally, a patent serves as a record of new technologies invented by others, such that a person wanting to develop a product and compete in a market knows what has been invented, what ideas/technologies are currently in place, and where new inventions can be made.
How would one go about obtaining a patent?
The process of obtaining a patent can be found on the USPTO website .
Further questions about patents are answered on the USPTO FAQ .

Safety Procedures From Tianjin University
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
No, there are no safe threats towards our team members. Our working environment is under BSL-1 level and experimental materials we used strictly follow the safety rules of this level. The potential risks are eliminated by using standard, well-characterized bio-materials.
The strains we used for genetic operation (E coli.DH5a; E coli.TransT1) are not pathogenicity and remain so after engineering. The members of the team have received and passed the lab training of the standard safety protocols.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
Our engineered strains are non-pathogenicity and unable to wildly spread. The function of them is producing oil fuel which is pervasively used in daily life. The only potential risk is the introduction of the antibiotic resistances to wild strains. We adopt rigorous procedure of sterilization to eradicate the possibilities of synthetic gene leaking into the environment. Biohazard wastes are also disposed properly.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No. Our engineered bacteria produce oil fuel only under controllable, idealized environment created artificially, in which the amount of product of our cells still won't be significant enough to pose a threat of environmental pollution. Due to its poor adaptability, it can hardly disturb the syntaxial system of the nature.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
No, the strains we introduced for engineering are very common in the lab. Our final works, which produce oil, have no potential to be used for creating either biochemical weapon or ecocatast"

During these different experiments, we introduced one or the other (or both) DNA fragments (Figure 1) into plasma and amplified only one of the two regions directly in there so it can act as a ctDNA mimick for a neoantigen coding sequence.                       Finally a Cas12a assay was performed, which would enable us to detect these amplified fragments (more information is available in the Protocols ).
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the experiment design. We worked with two different DNA sequences ordered as gBlocks gene fragments. Two regions were the object of our study here. First, region 1 contained a point                           mutation that we introduced willingly on the BRAF mutated DNA sequence. This was done in order to test for the introduction of the PAM sequence efficacy. Secondly, region 2 harbors the BRAF V600E mutation (on the mutated template)                           and is already flanked by a PAM sequence. Also shown are the four crRNAs used in this study. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for each region is indicated in red. CrRNA-N where N represents here the SNP base pair is the crRNA                           complementary to the target strand (TS) of the region containing this SNP.
Achievements
Result 1: Characterisation of Cas12a/PCR cleavage specificity
According to recent studies ( Li et al., 2018 ), the Cas12a/PCR system yielded high cleavage specificity when crRNA guide sequences of reduced length (16-17 bp) were used,                       and they could demonstrate that even a single mismatch between the gRNA/target sequence (activator) resulted in more than two folds decrease in fluorescent signal when FQ reporter molecules were present in the solution.
Thus, we wanted to demonstrate that we can reproduce these results by first successfully amplifying our target sequences in plasma and use this afterwards as a DNA substrate for the Cas12a assay. In this set of experiments, we worked                       mainly with the second region (Figure 1), since it already contains the PAM sequence and we did not want to accumulate the sources of potential errors. Results of the amplification of 10 pM of either BRAF mutated fragment or the                       original one (region 2) is shown below.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

A user-friendly network-design platform is realized in our software with C# for the experimentalists. The interface is shown in Figure2.Users can input the requirement curves with uploading a data file. And the picture files for curves are also supported by our software. And the network can be designed by manually drawing the species and the interactions. The phenotypes of the designed networks will be shown with graphs that users can directly see the performances of the results and the deviation between the results and the requirement.
Algorithm
Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
The particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is employed to optimized the parameters in a fixed mathematic model. In past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in optimizing the parameters for nonlinear system. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. The most important reason we choose to implement this algorithm into our software is that it is easy to realize parallelization. Since the most time-consuming part in our scheme is the optimization of parameters for a given topological structure. If we cannot find a efficient optimizer, it is impossible to deal with systems contains more than five or six nodes. Parallelization of the optimization process will be implemented in our next version.
Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to search the best topologies and the best interaction forms. It is a powerful method for complex optimization problems. It realizes an essential evolution process in a computer. Under a fitness function, the members of the population will be improved from generation to generation. And the population will fit the pressure much better by the intraspecific competition. It is suitable for our problems; because it can be converged in a moderate generations and can give a population of best topologies, not only one by other algorithms.
Future
It is just the first step. We still have a lot to do to achieve the final goal. First, the link should be established between the interaction forms and the real particles, as the promoters, the proteins, the ligands and so on. We are trying to build a database to construct the links, but the experiments data now are far than enough. And there are still some problems in the measurement of the parameters. Second, the optimization space is too large for us to search. Our program should run for a long time to finish the whole job. The parallel computation is favorable here. So we will use the parallel computation to do the optimization in the next version. Third, the on-line version is also required as it will be more convenient to the users.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Visit to BioDetection Systems (BDS)
Summary: BDS is a company working in the field of traditional, fluorescence-based, whole-cell biosensors. They focus on optimizing their fluorescent output system and do not work on novel output systems. However, their Chief Scientific Officer, Mr.  Van Der Burg, was very enthusiastic about the ELECTRACE system on saw opportunities for a commercial product.
To learn more about the commercial development and application of biosensors, we visited Amsterdam-based biosensor company BioDetection Systems (BDS). Here we met with the Chief Scientific Officer, Mr.  Van Der Burg. With him, we discussed the activities of BDS, our project ELECTRACE and the biosensor industry.
The main focus of BDS is their sensing system CALUX. A range of CALUX systems exist, which all work according to a mechanism in which the compound to be detected binds to an intracellular receptor. This complex subsequently binds to a promoter in front of a luciferase gene. The luciferase which is then formed emits light and is in that way used to measure the compound of interest. Compounds which can be detected with CALUX include dioxins and several hormones.
The CALUX system is mainly applied to detect environmental and food contaminations which might be harmful for humans. “We aim to stay close to the physiology of our subject, so in this case this means that we have to use eukaryotic cells, in our case rat cells,” Van Der Burg tells. The use of eukaryotic cells however presents some problems. “For multicellular eukaryotes, there is a big step between contact with the contamination and uptake by a cell, which we have to model and simulate in our experiments. In bacteria you don’t have this problem. Next to that, eukaryotes are less robust and more complex than bacterial cells.” Upon asking why they did not work with bacteria, Van Der Burg tells us: “We are developing  a bacterial version of CALUX, but only for usage in areas where bacterial physiology is important, such as soil contamination or antibiotic detection.”
The activities of BDS mainly consist of measuring samples sent by other organizations whit their CALUX system and selling licenses and training to use the system. Their customers include pharmaceutical companies, food companies and (governmental) organizations involved in environmental issues. “We have customers from all over the world. We are currently working on a project in Vietnam to detect dioxins. The concentration"

Also I9-1, I9-2, I10-1 and I10-2 confirmed the preliminar results of the precious test, in fact GFP production was observe. At a preliminary analysis, it seems that GFP production is correlated to the srength of the promoter regulating luxI production!! :) Other culture (I7-1, I7-2, I7-4, I8-1, I8-2, I8-3) did not produce GFP, so they were thrown away. A furhter screening were performed on I7-3, I7-5, I8-4, I8-5, I9-1 and I10-1.
For this reason, MiniPrep was performed for the following colonies, with the following quantiications:

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," if any biological materials escaped from your lab:
Spider silk does not pose any safety or health risk to the environment if released. E. coli may have unpredictable impacts on the local ecosystem if released, but this is unlikely.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks?
We chose a very safe chassis organism to use, K12 and Bl21(DE3) E.coli. We are also wearing proper Personal Protective Equipment, such as lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses when handling biological materials. Additionally, any surfaces that have been potentially contaminated by bacterial species are thoroughly cleaned using ethanol and/or bleach.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
No safety risks would arise from the availability of our product or the knowledge of how to generate our product. There may be some impact to materials industries if the generation of genetically altered recombinant silk became commercially viable. For example, the natural silk industry may suffer if recombinant silk with altered properties became cheap.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks?
We did not utilize any design features to mitigate risks. Expressing our protein causes the chassis bacteria to be metabolically disadvantaged, and so it would likely not survive in the wild.
Standard Operating Procedures
While the biological materials that we were working with did not present any hazards, a few of our solvents and chemicals did. Lithium bromide and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) are used to solubilize natural and lyophilized silk, respectively. They were critical to our project, but due to their hazardous nature, we had to familiarize ourselves with how to safely and properly use them. We drafted the following Safe Operating Procedures for training and for reference:

Pyd1 yeast display vector expression and display of protein fusion
Grow untransformed EBY100, EBY100/pYD1, and EBY100/pYD1 containing your gene of interest as follows.
1. Inoculate a single yeast colony into 10 ml YNB-CAA containing 2% glucose and grow overnight at 30°C with shaking.
2. Read the absorbance of the cell culture at 600 nm. The OD600 should be between 2 and 5. If the OD600 is below 2 or over 5, refer to the table below.
If the OD600 is....
Then you may...
below 2,
either continue growing the cells until the OD600 reaches 2 or proceed to Step 3.
over 5,
proceed to Step 3.
Note: In general, OD600 readings less than 2 will decrease the number of cells displaying fusion proteins. OD600 readings greater than 5 will delay induction of expression of the displayed protein.
3. Centrifuge the cell culture at 3000-5000 x g for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
4. Resuspend the cell pellet in YNB-CAA medium containing 2% galactose to an OD600 of 0.5 to 1. This is to ensure that the cells continue to grow in log-phase. For example, if the OD600 is 2 from Step 2, resuspend the cells in 20 to 40 ml of medium.
5. Immediately remove a volume of cells equivalent to 2 OD600 units. For an OD600 of 0.5, remove 4 ml and place on"

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#HumanBody_-_-_TEXT.html," case study we made a new compartment between the intestine and the liver to represent the intestine tumor (figure 1).
Figure 1: The flowscheme used for our model
In our model we have used three different mass balance equations for an organ. The first mass balance describes the concentration of all the VLPs in the organ, this is to see the overall change in the VLP concentration. The second mass balance equation describes the concentration of the unbound VLPs. This is because the unbound particles can move freely into the body while the bound particles stays into the organ. The final mass balance equation is for the concentration of the medicine in the organ. With these three mass balance equations we’ve developed our model. At the botom of the page the model can be studied intensivly.
Case study: colorectal cancer
As our case study to use the human body model, we used colorectal cancer. Cancer as a disease is very destructive and is responsible for the deaths of millions. In 2007, 13% of all the deaths were cancer related [1]. We chose colorectal cancer because in Europe the 5 year survival the disease is less than 60% [2]. If our treatment shows a better treatment we can help the people to fight off the cancer.
Treatment of Colorectal cancer
The conventional way to treat colorectal cancer includes surgery and chemotherapy if the cancer is detected in an early stage, when it detected in a later stage treatment is often directed more at extending life and keeping people comfortable [2]. The agents used for chemotherapy are fluorouracil, capecitabine, UFT, leucovorin, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin. Side effects [3] of the agents are:
Acute central nervous system damage
Bone marrow suppression
Mucositis, inflammation of the mucus membranes of the GI track
Dermatitis, inflammation of the skin
Diarrhoea
Nausea
and many more
We believe, if we can focus the agents around the tumor we’ll able to reduce the side effect and create a better chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients.
Parameters
For the distribution of VLPs throughout the human body, used parameters were obtained from the documentation Slovenia 2012 or from literature sources [4]. The estimated parameters for the organs in table 1 are explained as followed: Blood-flow, the amount of blood in liters flushing throughout the organs, Volumes, the size of the organ, Receptor, the concentration of receptors in µM and the partition coefficient of the medicine that is packaged within"
Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," as their basic knowledge of modern biology, experience in laboratory, the understanding of iGEM and their current ideas. To our surprise, some had attended the John Hopkins Summer Camp and had the experience of PCR, Western Blot and etc. And some had learned pharmacodynamic evaluation, mice emergency immunization, flow cytometry, labeling fluorescent antibody and so on. And their ideas were also innovative concerning Chinese traditional herb, malaria, controlling blood pressure, and regulation of K+. As for the division of labor, they also have their considerations. Some prefer wet laboratory, and others would like to major in modeling or visual designing…… We not only shared basic knowledge of synthetic biology, lab skills and safety rules with them in our mini-class, but also achieved a lot from them- discussing ethic and law issues in regard to advanced technology. What impressed us most is their passion on practice with their own hands. The knowledge they’ve learnt in class inspired fantastic ideas, while we provide a stage to help them realize. Welcome, new iGEMers!
It’s a really successful try, and we did help our next generation not only know about iGEM and synthetic biology but assist them to become one of us, to make them enjoy the interest of it. Now, a promising iGEM team is coming into formation and we will also support them theoretically and practically. The world is changing.   Except this, we were also invited to Shanghai Shixi High School, a famous high school to deliver a lecture named Synthesis + Biology = Synthetic Biology to expand their view. University: iGEM club During our summer vacation, we attended a sharing meeting with BIOS (Biology Intensive Orientation Summer) students who were learning basic biological technique to discuss our project and absorb positive opinion to polish our STEP system. Despite their relatively poor experience in research, but their fancy thoughts did inspire us and make our project more charming.
In Fudan University, iGEM exists as a club. In this semester’s giant meeting of all clubs, iGEM has attracted much attention from students of all majors and some showed great interest in iGEM. Through our introduction, they had a deeper understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology and got deeply fascinated by the idea. It’s predictable that next year, there will be more students fond of synthetic biology taking part in iGEM to share the fun.

We invited 2 incredibly young and successful entrepreneurs to share their stories and inspire our public! Motivation is everything and they were able to convey this to our audience!
Thomas De Vlaam
Thomas had the ambition of becoming a neurosurgeon. He holds a bachelor’s degree in International Medicine and Global. Unfortunately after a diagnosis of Scheuermann’s disease, Thomas underwent significant spinal fusion surgery                 in 2011, forcing him to give up on his medical career.
Despite the physical challenges and long recovery periods, his dream of helping patients grew stronger and became an unstoppable driver. He joined ProQR – a biotech company in the Netherlands working on novel drugs to treat                 rare orphan disorders. He then invented and developed a completely new approach to treat Amyloid disorders.
At the age of 24, Thomas started his new company: Amylon.

Figure 2 Growth curve of Escherichia coli under different formaldehyde concentrations: (a) control group, (b) test group.
We can quantify the production of eRFP by means of measuring the fluorescence intensity under excitation wavelength of 575 nm. As shown in Figure 3a, with the extension of culture time, the fluorescence intensity of eRFP gradually increased which indicates that the expression level of eRFP in the medium gradually increased. In other words, the formaldehyde detection function of this working system was working normally. 
Besides, as shown in Figure 3b, when the formaldehyde concentration is between 0-1.6 mM, the fluorescence intensity of eRFP is positively correlated with the formaldehyde concentration after culturing for 8 hours. However, after culturing for same times, the fluorescence intensity of eRFP is negatively correlated with the formaldehyde concentration when the concentration exceeds 1.6 mM. It is proved that the formaldehyde degradation function of this working system was working as we expected.

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#TeamBITCHINA_-_-_TEXT.html," we notice that when the amount of probes are far more than the Hydrogen peroxide. The fluorescence intensity is probably proportion to the concentration of Hydrogen peroxide. Thus, we decided to construct a linear regression model based on the data that Team BIT-China provided to validate the potential linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and Hydrogen peroxide. Also, this model can be use as a standard for Hydrogen peroxide testing.
Linear regression analysis
Definition
$H_2O_2$: The concentration of $H_2O_2$, units in $mM$.
FOD: Florescence intensity / OD
Scatter Plot
The Scatter Plot of data are demonstrated below.
From the chart, it is clear that the FOD is in proportion to the $H_2O_2$, when the $H_2O_2$ is between 0-2.5 $mM.$ The data in the points that $H_2O_2$ is 5 are obviously not obey linear model. Thus, we consider to construct a linear model between 0 and 2.5$mM$ of  $H_2O_2$. The new Scatter Plot of this part of data are showed below.
The scatter plot witnessed a significant linearity of between FOD and $H_2O_2$, so we tend to use a linear model to predict and explain the results.
Model Construction
With the criteria of the least square, we construct following linear model
$$FOD_i=β_0+β_1  H_2O_{2i}+ϵ_i  ,ϵ_i~N(0,σ^2)$$
The property of the model are demonstrated below
It is obvious that the data fits linear model well and the parameters are following
$$FOD_i=4752+1214.48 H_2O_{2i}+ϵ_i,ϵ_i~N(0,425.9)$$
The data along with the fitted values of the model and the confidence interval are pictured below.
Residuals Analysis
We also run a residuals analysis to ensure this linear model is proper to fit the data. First, we draw histogram and QQ-plot of standard residuals.
From the histogram, the standard residuals equally drop in the two sides of zero, which means that the residuals are possibly independent. Also, the QQ-plot implies the significant normality of residuals.
Results and inspirations
The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of $H_2O_2$ and the"

-Impact: realized that most of the lobster shells were abandoned and were not put into industrial production.
2. Visit a factory that produces food with lobsters.
- Investigate how much lobster shells can be left after the rounds of production.
- Impact: more than 50% of the shells are left unused after the production. we confirmed that our project is applicable in reality for the useful resources of lobster shells (raw material) from different sources.
3. Visit pharmaceutical company in Xi’an
- Gain a more complete view of the chemical production of chitosan & the problems of the current treatment & interview the staffs, ask their opinions about our design.
- Impact: realized the deficiencies in chemical production (water pollution, energy cost, high demand of laborers, low efficiency)
4. Visit Biotechnology company in Suzhou
- To ask for feedback and instructions on solving a problem we encountered in the experiment.
- Impact: Introduced us with a new plasmid and QS system. Gave us instructions and suggestions on the conduction our experiment.
5. Second visit to the Biotechnology company
- Demo test to potential users & gain feedback from them
- Impact: We received positive comments and data from the users and gained inspiration to modify our machine according to realistic production.
6. After iGEM
- We are planning to revisit the company to show them our modified version of the machine, make further adjustments and put our machine into use in industry.

They answered us and offered their help. But their shipment never arrived. Anyway, later we realized that those parts are not fully suitable for our needs.
Also, some of us had the privilege to assist to a lecture of Andrew Hessel, an authority in Synthetic Biology from USA. Unexpectedly, he had a slide about us! (He found out about us in Internet). He said he was surprised that Chile had an iGEM team working in a forefront discipline such as Synthetic Biology.
But most importantly, we designed our first secretion constructs, consisting of a GFP Reporter Plasmid, a Protease Producer Plasmid (see section constructs for more information) and a working plasmid. This last plasmid is used as an intermediate plasmid to build the other two plasmids. We ordered the primers that we need (it takes about two weeks until they arrive!)

We met with Ignacio Ibarra, an undergraduate student of the group of Dr. Francisco Melo.  He is willing to advise us in the area of protein modeling. The problem is that spider silk proteins are semi-crystalline and is difficult to predict its structure. He recommended starting with a comparative protein analysis between our spider silk monomer of interest and other similar proteins that have its structure available in PDB.  The idea is that from the structure of those similar proteins we will have a reference of the most stable conformation of our monomer. Later we should be able to improve the self-assembling of the proteins or improve some mechanical properties, such as elasticity and tenacity. Nevertheless, we were warned: protein modeling is a complex and slow task.
Recommended software: -MOE: to add hydrogen atoms. -Autodock: a suite of automated docking tools. This should be useful to evaluate the self-assembly of our monomers. -Force Field: to calculate potentials between particles. Finally, something very important happened: Christopher A.

During his visit, Zhang joined our two teams in the brainstorm and provided valuable comments on the team members’ ideas in terms of feasibility, safety, originality. Zhang also gave us a brief introduction about his own iGEM projects from which we benefited greatly.
“That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” Zhang said when he reminisced about the difficulties he confronted during conducting his iGEM project.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html," on protein production, our cells show a specially high initial response, shown as an exponential function. This response maintains until the quantity of plasmids gets saturated and the protein production becomes then constant. Below we show a plot (figure 8) of the overall behaviour of the saturation of the plasmids on the cell.
As mentioned before, these results are in accordance with previous literature on the “fast/short-term” response of transcription factors YAP1P and SKN7 in OSR.
Discussion
The above presented model and simulations form a basis to a better understanding of the stress response mechanism in the cell via the Gpx3 increase and gene activation through transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7.
From the above simulation results we can make several observations:
The quantity of active genes depends on the quantity of the S(NO:SKN7) complex as well as the total number of promoter binding sites contained in each cell, in particular the minimum. Once the quantity of active genes reaches its maximum, protein production occurs at a constant rate and the amount of YFP increases linearly. We also observed that protein production will stop after Yap1p in the nucleus is degraded and the Yap1p production rate can’t insufficiently replace the lost transcription factors in the nucleus.
Our model confirms that Yap1p and Skn7p seem to play a crucial role in the immediate response of the cell against oxidative stress. In addition, Not4 plays an important role in the long-term stabilization of the quantity of oxidised Yap1p in the nucleus and therefore also in the cell’s long-term response to oxidative stress. Altering the Not4 degradation rate and the kinase binding rate has large effects on the overall protein production rate. The simulations run in this model, support the Yap1p degradation mechanism based on Not4 activity suggested in the literature.
In order to have a more accurate model of the response against oxidative stress in the cell and the fluorescence production, we need to include the transcription MSN2/4p in our numerical simulations and then to fit our parameters to experimental FACS data using COPASI’s parameter estimation function. This would enable us to make more accurate numerical predictions of the behaviour of the detection mechanism under various conditions. We could then model the promoter structure in a more detailed way and use the simulation results to guide the design of optimal promoters for our detection mechanism.

Background
We wanted to use a bacteriocin to design a new form of toxic that, unlike general antibiotics, only kills specific pathogenes, thereby leaving our gut flora intact. The goal was to express the bacteriocin colicin Fy in E. coli. Colicin Fy is specific against Yersinia enterocolitica, a gut pathogen. We also wanted to include an on and off system with a silencing sRNA together with the Sensing system.
System design
Two different constructs were needed to get the Killing system working. First the secretion tag, USP45, with the bacteriocin, colicin Fy, coupled to it. Secondly, we need a silencing sRNA system for inhibition of colicin Fy production when not in proximity to Y. enterocolitica.
Result
We managed to prove the existance of the bacteriocin, colicin Fy on an SDS-page. By adding lysate that contains the colicin Fy to living Y. enterocolitica cultures we could show that it works for killing the actual pathogen as well.

Aim of the experiment: Initial vector digestion was performed with NgoMiV and AgeI, producing complementary overhangs. Religated pSB1C3 (due to incomplete vector dephosphorylation) loses the AgeI recognition sequence. Therefore plasmids without insert should run in the supercoiled position at about 1.5 kb, plasmids with inserts should run in the linearised position at 3 kb. Single enzyme digestion was chosen, because the insert is too small to be solved on a gel.
Procedure:
analytic digestion: 3 µl of plasmid DNA P32 to P35 (about 300 ng) were digested with 0.3 µl AgeI-HF in 1 µl CutSmart Buffer and 5.7 µl H2O. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37°C.
5 µl digestion mix were loaded on a 1% agarose gel for electrophoresis, 1 kb ladder
Result:
P32 to P35 might carry the insert because they all appear in the linearized position at 3 kb
Therefore plasmid sequencing should confirm the result.

Anyone interested in accessing the raw sequencing files can contact us by email (igem2017@kuleuven.be) or social media. A picture of the blast of the sequencing results can be found on the registry page, as well as here .
We hope future teams will find this biobrick as as useful as we did, and look forward to seeing its future uses!
The first runner up: hERG
Our first runner up is the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene. This is not only because of its funny name: The hERG protein has been vital for building our oscillating system. Moreover, this protein has a lot of potential for future projects: Inhibition of hERG can lead to severe side-effects, and therefore it is a major antitarget in drug development. This biobrick could therefore be useful for any project related to pharmaceuticals.
During our project, we have used the wildtype hERG variant. However, we designed a biobrick compatible variant by removing illegal restriction sites and by lowering the GC content to allow synthesis as gBlock gene fragments. We have cloned this biobrick compatible variant in the pSB1C3 vector and provided it to the registry. However, due to issues caused by the size of this gene, and due to time constraints, we were not able to verify it using sequencing. However, we verified it by a restriction digestion and PCR.
Honorable mention: mHCN2
mHCN is a member of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) family of ion channels. Their peculiar behaviour causes oscillations in both the heart and in the HEKcite system.
We have designed a biobrick compatible version of the mHCN2 gene, by removing the illegal restriction sites and lowering the GC content. However, IDT has been unable to synthesise this gene, as long, GC-rich repeats remained in the sequence. Nonetheless, we have added the sequence to the registry, as it is already possible to order this biobrick as an artificial gene. However, the DNA synthesis techniques are constantly improving, and we expect that this biobrick can be synthesised as a gBlock in the future.
Honorable mention: α1G
The α1G calcium channel was vital in our project, in order to create the oscillating system. Furthermore, its functionality as a calcium channel allowed us to visualise a rhythm using calcium imaging in one of our earliest experiments.

Proof of concept
Five different plasmids were assembled with the Plug ‘n’ Play standard in order to verify that the system functions in mammalian cells. To demonstrate how fast any vector of choice for the expression in mammalian cells can be assembled, we designed a reporter system as proof of concept.
The plasmids for proof of concept in mammalian cells were constructed with the strong constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor , the BGH terminator , the hygromycin marker cassette , and the plasmid backbone pMam .  Different genes encoding fluorescent proteins were used as the gene of interest, and the reporter system can easily be modified to be used for gene expression analysis. All transient transfections were performed in the human derived cell line U-2 OS, kindly provided by the Danish Cancer Society. For microscopy the transfected U-2 OS cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde, and VECTASHIELD was added to prevent rapid loss of fluorescence while examining the cells with the confocal microscope.
We have proved that the Plug ‘n’ Play assembly standard can easily be applied for construction of mammalian expression vectors. Transfections and expression of the fluorescent proteins GFP, mCherry, YFP, and CFP were successfully conducted in U-2 OS cells. Furthermore, expression of GFP targeted to the peroxisomes of U-2 OS cells succeeded. Lastly it was shown that mammalian cells can be transfected with different fluorescent proteins simultaneously.

  The Main work to deal with first is the database . We get nothing but a file with the format of ‘xml’. It may be very easy work for someone who is professional . But for a beginner like me, the only thing I can do is Google , Google and Google... Fortunately, eventually I finished it.
  
  Core Data is a very useful part of iOS developing . The built-in Sqlite function is the one with which I can set up a built-in database.
  
  the next thing we should overcome is transfer xml to Sqlite. Thankfully there is NSXmlParser Method with which we can finish this work.
  
  why we choose sqlite?
  
  because it provide the function we needed . Network independent, very efficient , and it can store what you search in cache therefore you can get the same search result faster next time.

Mix the ingredients of the running gel and pour the solution quickly (gel starts to polymerize once TEMED has been added) into the gap between the glass plates. Leave enough room for the stacking gel – appr. 1 cm below the bottom of the comb´s teeth. After a minute you can overlay the solution with iso-propanol or ethanol. This excludes the access of oxygen and plane the surface
After polymerization, pour off the iso-propanol and rinse with distilled water. Mix the reagents for the stacking gel and pour it on top of the running gel till the space is completely full. Then insert the comb. No alcohol overlay is needed due to the comb.
After polymerization clamp the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with running buffer. Remove the comb carefully and use a pipette or syringe to wash the wells with running buffer.
The protein samples (up to 15 µl) are mixed with SDS loading buffer (2.5 µl) and incubated for 10 min at 95°C.
After heating briefly centrifuge the samples to spin down the condensed water.
Then you can apply the samples on a SDS PAGE with a pipette or Hamilton microliter syringe. Do not forget to add molecular weight marker in one lane.
Run the gel at 80 V until the front has moved into the running gel. Then you can increase the voltage to 120 V. Run the gel until the running front has reached the bottom of the running gel.
Pry the plates apart by using a gel spacer. The gel can then be stained (Coomassie staining, method 56 or Silver staining, method 57) to visualize the separated proteins or processed further (Western Blotting, method 58).

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," device, we have run a multiplate reader for 12 hours to compare the growth of Yale cells with and without our device with a gradient of polyamines. From the literature, we decided that the reliable range of polyamine concentration would be between 0mM to 2mM, since these molecules are harmful, even for bacteria, when in high amounts.
Several conclusions can be extracted from the pictures
First, the cells with the device experience a significant overall reduction in growth rate and total optical density. This is certainly produced by the expression of two constitutive genes, which is a metabolic burden for the cell that reduces its reproductive capacities.
We can verify that, indeed, the double mutant cells require polyamines for their reproduction, since the group without polyamines is not able to grow neither with or without the device. We can appreciate a certain growth during the first hours, probably because of the intracelular reservoirs of polyamines, that are exhausted soon.
We can verify that an excess in polyamines (2mM) ends up being lethal for the cells in both cases. Moreover, the degradation of polyamines by the device group produces peroxide, which is toxic for cells when above 1μM and accelerates the death of the cells further.
The device group with low to medium concentration of polyamines experiences a sudden delay in their growth between hours 4 and 5. This can be explained by the fact that they are polyamine auxotroph but still degrade their own vital compound. This leads to a critical point where there are not enough polyamines for the expanding population of cells and their growth is stopped.
The above effect is less significant in the cases with polyamine concentrations 0.5 and 1μM, since the reservoir of these molecules in the medium is large enough for the cells to live even if they are degrading it.
We foresaw the peroxide problem and anticipated possible solutions to it. We designed a system composed by a constitutive OxyR gene, that would bind once translated to reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which is molecule that participates in a mechanism of bacteria to maintain several homeostasis levels. The 2013 team of NYMU-Taipei characterized this mechanism and included some parts in the registry. The second part of the system is an OxyR-induced promoter upstream of a peroxidase gene (KatG). With this device, when the concentration of peroxide increased in the cell, then peroxidases would be transcribed thus reducing the levels of this compound. Unfortunately, KatG had a very large nucleotide sequence that we had to break"

Figure 18. The effect of EPO concentration on marrow transit time. The injection 141 billion copies of the EPO cDNA in adenoviruses occurs at day 0. The infected cells produce extra EPO leading to a maximum concentration of EPO of 31.3 mU/ml (3.2 times more that the steady state EPO concentration of 9.8 mU/ml). As EPO concentration in the blood increases, the marrow transit time will decrease, shifting the boundary between marrow reticulocytes and circulating red blood cells to the left. A decrease in EPO concentration increases the marrow transit time and shifts the boundary to the right. The oscillations in the marrow transit time are due to the oscillations in the EPO concentration caused by gene doping.
Reticulocytes will stay in the bone marrow until age 18.75 to 21 days after which they leave the bone marrow and circulate in the blood, where they mature into red blood cells.
Red Blood Cells and Blood Reticulocytes
There is a fixed rate of random daily breakdown of red blood cells due to random daily breakdown or, internal or external bleeding. This is represented by a constant apoptosis rate independent of EPO concentration.
$$ RBCs_n = RBCs_{n-1}\times e^{-\alpha_{RBCs}(EPO(t), \, \mu_{RBCs}) \times \Delta t} \tag{33}$$
$$ RBCs_{n+1} = RBCs_{n}\times e^{-\alpha_{RBCs}(EPO(t),\, \mu_{RBCs}) \times \Delta t} \tag{34}$$
Between the ages of of 35 to 42 days, young red blood cells will undergo neocytolysis if the concentration of EPO in the blood drops below 9.8 mU/ml. The neocytolysis rate will increase as EPO levels drop until the level of EPO reach 3.3 mU/ml, when it maximum.

This construct displays promising results for m-xylene induction. The xylR coding sequence was synthesized during our 2016 project, and the Pu promoter was amplified from 2013 Peking’s BBa_K1031803. Confirmed sequences of these parts are available on the registry.
The experiments were performed as follows. Strains were inoculated from frozen stock and grown overnight in LB media. The following morning, the cultures were washed and reseeded to an OD=0.1 in M9 + 4 g/L glucose media. Literature has previously reported that this regulatory network is coupled with the σ54 factor [2], a nitrogen limitation protein [3]. Thus, we modulated the nitrogen content for this experiment.  As the cultures entered early/mid log phase, they were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and 1 mM m-xylene[4]. Samples were measured for GFP fluorescence (excitation 485/20, emission 528/20 nm) and optical density (OD600nm), and data was collected over the next 24 hours on a Biotek Synergy HT microplate reader. Additionally, RFU = “Relative Fluorescence Units” = (Media GFP value)/(OD600).
Figure 2: Pu & m-xylene characterization in [1.0x] nitrogen
Figure 3: Pu & m-xylene characterization in [0.1x] nitrogen
Results:
1 mM m-xylene induces a 4-fold increase in fluorescence.
Low nitrogen concentrations marginally increase fluorescence.
To test specificity the of the promoter, we performed similar experiments in the presence of another substrate, 1 mM toluene, and 1 mM benzaldehyde, a product. The experiments were performed the same as the m-xylene conditions, but in LB media as opposed to M9.  A more detailed protocol can be found in the Methods section.

The two limiting substrates are introduced at opposite ends of the bioreactor.  The limiting substrates are C-substrate (carbon substrate) and/or oxygen. The biofilm thickness must be less than the oxygen penetration (50-200 micrometers) but stay less than 150 micrometers for best performance.

We attempted to do PCR for the parts for which Chris made primers . To prove that the PCR was successful, we ran aliquotes of the reaction products through a gel. An image of the gel can be seen here . No bands can be seen for the aliquotes; therfore, we concluded that the PCR did not work. We believe that there was a problem with the cycler; therefore, we will be trying the procedure again with a different machine.
Monday, July 23
We attempted PCR again with a different machine. Unfortunately, we used too high of a concentration of primers. Therefore, when we ran a gel, two bands appeared for each sample. The excess primer would greatly lower the efficiency of a Gibson reaction. Furthermore, the bands on the gel all had similar size even though the parts are not of similar size. Therefore, we believe that nonspecific amplification took place. An image of the gel can be seen here .
There were some modifications to the Static Biofilm Assay Protocol.  Once the plates had grown for a long enough time period (every hour for 1-8 hours and then 24 hours and 48 hours) they were transferred to the 4 degree freezer.  The plates were then removed, the excess liquid was dumped out, and the plates were then sprayed off with water and dumped out again.  The plates were than stained with crystal violet with the following steps:
add 125 microliters of crystal violet to each well plate
let sit for 15 minutes
wash off (Note: at this point the plates are stable for several weeks)
Analyzing Plates:
500 microliters of 80% ethanol | 20% acetone were added to each well
300 microliters (or enough until the well were full) were taken from the 24 well plate to the 96 well plates
this was then analyzed using the spectrophotometer to determine the OD of each sample

We attempted PCR for a third time. This time, the gel shows single bands of varying size. An image of the gel can be seen here . We are now going to proceed to the Gibson"

Das Hauptziel der „Human practice task“ (wortwörtlich menschliche Praxisaufgabe) beim iGEM-Wettberwerb ist es die Öffentlichkeit über die Möglichkeiten der kürzlich entstandenen Synthetischen Biologie zu informieren und ihr Mistrauen zu mindern. Daher versuchten wir einen Weg zu finden, mit dem wir möglichst viele Menschen erreichen und gleichzeitig eine offene Diskussion über  Synthetische Biologie anfachen konnten. Die erste Frage die wir uns stellten, war natürlich: Wie viel weiß die Öffentlichkeit eigentlich über dieses Thema? Aus diesem Grund entschieden wir uns eine Umfrage zu entwerfen und diese einerseits in der Altstadt von Göttingen auszuteilen und andererseits über das Internet zu verbreiten.
Zusätzlich beschlossen wir am 7. September einen “Informationsabend zur Synthetischen Biologie“ zu organisieren. Dieser sollte sowohl allgemeine Informationen liefern als auch entgeg"

ENGAGEMENT
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
RNA Day
On August 1st, also called “RNA Day”, our team decided to help the University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team at a booth set up at our local farmer’s market. This public engagement activity introduced the members of our community to iGEM, in addition to the work that both the collegiate and high school iGEM teams have accomplished. At our booth, we interacted with the community by providing different activities, such as synthetic biology based colouring sheets and toothpicks and marshmallows to make DNA. People at the farmers market were even able to conduct a DNA extraction experiment, which allowed them to venture into the types of activities that members of iGEM partake in.
Whoop Up Days
Our team had a booth at our local summer carnival, Whoop Up Days, to promote synthetic biology and iGEM. The booth allowed individuals to learn about iGEM and how to pipette. We were even able to raise over $100 in donations through selling stickers that we had designed ourselves. This booth was successful in bringing awareness to synthetic biology in addition to fundraising.
iGEM Music Recital
We held a music recital to showcase the musical abilities and talents of our team members, in addition to raising money to send more representatives to Boston. We were also able to engage with our community by giving a presentation on iGEM, our project and synthetic biology as a whole.
STEAM
As part of our public engagement, our team had the opportunity to integrate our project into ""Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics"", or STEAM, an after school program for elementary school students run by The Crossings Branch Library in our city of Lethbridge. At the beginning of the program, we taught the kids about iGEM; afterwards, we explored the topic of bacteria, proteins and DNA by doing two fun activities: DNA extractions and play-doh protein-expressing bacteria. Our goal was to teach these students about the wonder of synthetic biology, which has subsequently created interest in the community of youth for synthetic biology. This demonstrates the engagement of our team with the Lethbridge youth.
We found that the interlab study was a good way for us to learn the"

The poster of the iGEM team SDU-Denmark , which the danish iGEM team presented at Street Science.
With our SynBioDay - Street Science we generated publicity. Here you can find the links to the two press articles .
In the box below you can find the instructions for the extraction of fruit DNA, taken and modified from CommunityBricks .
Script for DNA-Extraction
1. Mix a tea spoon of salt and 3 – 4 big drops of dishwashing detergent (or a squirt) in a BlueCap (50 mL) and add water up to 50 mL. Close the BlueCap and agitate till everything is solubilized.
2. Cut an apricot, a tomato or a banana into half, break a half into small pieces and mix them with your Detergent-Salt-Solution
3. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes
4. Use a blender to crush your fruit pieces (be careful, only blend for a short time, < 5 sec)
5. Use a coffee filter to separate the fluid and the solid
6. Transfer a part of your fluid into a test tube and pour ice-cold ethanol down the inside of the tube, use the same volume fluid and ethanol
7. DNA-strands precipitate in the upper phase (this can take up to 5 minutes). You can fish your DNA with a wooden toothpick, if you want to.
8. Place the DNA in a reaction tube, add ethanol and glue the cap
9. Kids now can take home the fruit DNA they extracted
Comments:
Don't let kids handle sharp knives
Kids are not allowed to use the ethanol, that's a job for the advisers

Unfortunately, it appeared to be too large a molecule to be detected by the bruker MALDI-ToF machine. It was concluded that the machine's hardware settings could not match the requirements for such large molecules. However, the expected length that we expect HRT2 produces is in the 2-10 kDa range. This is within the limits of the machine, though we have yet to test this hypothesis as the machine is frequently occupied by other research groups.
Composite production system
Growth experiments
Carrying the HRT2, dxs and both (CPS) devices and expressing the genes could impair the growth, and hence be important in production purpose. To test if the growth of MG1655 bacteria is impaired when carrying and expressing our devices, we measured the growth rate with OD600 measurements.
Four different MG1655 strains carrying either no plasmid (WT), pSB1C3-Pcon-araC-term-Para-HRT2 (HRT2), pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI(N)-term-Plac-dxs (B.subtilis) (Dxs), or pSB1K3-Pcon-araC-term-Para-HRT2 and pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI(N)-term-Plac-dxs (B.subtilis) (CPS), were grown from OD600=0.05 and induced with 1 mM IPTG and/or 0.2% arabinose  during growth. The first experiment showed impaired growth of the bacteria only carrying construct expressing HRT2. We thought that the reason why the strains expressing HRT2 as well as Dxs didn’t show impaired growth rate could be due to a phenomenon called inclusion bodies. When overexpressing too many proteins, there is a risk of misfolding and hence loss of function. A way to lower this risk is to lower the temperature. Therefore we set up a growth experiment where the temperature was lowered from 37 to 20ºC at time of induction. This did not prove to make a difference, and CPS strains with and without IPTG and/or arabinose induction grew at same pace as WT. However, we want to verify these results by a more thorough investigation and consequently setup a new growth experiment including OD600 measurements, counts of colony forming units ("
Hong_Kong_UCCKE,2017,Team:Hong Kong UCCKE#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,")
Conclusion
From the results above, we can say we have successfully cloned the plasmid DNA into the cell.

Does the hardware address a need or problem in synthetic biology?Did the team conduct user testing and learn from user feedback?Did the team demonstrate utility and functionality in their hardware proof of concept?Is the documentation of the hardware system sufficient to enable reproduction by other teams?
We built a fully automated microbial growth management system that eliminates the need to take growth curves and measure optical densities manually, with the capability to draw a sample, dilute it and measure the OD, while maintaining a sterile environment. We also designed software that allows GCODe to take readings at pre-set intervals, plot graphs and notify experimentalists as desired. Our incremental progress, evolving based on the needs and suggestions of the biologists around us, has resulted in two models, the GCODe Mini and GCODe Pro, both of which have been successfully tested in a laboratory setting. The Mini has also been assembled by undergraduates working only from our instructions as seen on the wiki. GCODe is the low-cost open source solution that finally removes the pain from growth curves - across the globe."

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," building materials, a new venue of possibilities suddenly appear. Fungi are genetically modifiable. This allows for tuning of different external parameters or even adding properties such as biosensors etc. Thus, the interesting question to answer in this aspect is; what genetic modifications are beneficial when it comes to construction on Mars?
Like any other organism, any fungus is optimized for the survival of its species in its niche. No fungal strain is solely optimized for creating strong materials, as that would not be an advantageous evolutionary strategy. By making the fungus a little worse at surviving, we aim to make it better for a building. In our project, we ended up focusing primarily on two genes; melA and gfaA.
Protection from UV radiation and Melanin
One part of what makes the surface of Mars a hostile environment is its radiation. Unlike the terrestrial atmosphere, the Martian atmosphere does not shield well against cosmic radiation, making radiation a serious concern on the red planet (10). Part of the radiation issue is short wavelength UV radiation such as UVB and UVC, which is not just harmful to living tissue but also causes radiation damage to solid materials (11). Nature has evolved systems that give the protection against UV radiation, most well-known is the pigment melanin. Overexpressing melanin might make fungal materials more resilient against radiation damage. Studies have shown that melanotic bacteria experience increased protection from the full spectrum of UV compared to counterparts without melanin (12).   To slow down the potential erosion from UV radiation, we wanted to express the gene melA from Rhizobium etli CFN42 (13) in our fungal host. A previous iGEM team from the Technical Institute of Tokyo have shown that overexpression of melanin in E. coli can been achieved using the melA gene . melA encodes this for a tyrosinase that catalyses the enzymatic steps converting tyrosine into dopaquinone. We investigated the biosynthetic pathway of melanin in A. oryzae and discovered the same metabolic step as encoded for by melA (14). Heterologous expression of MelA in A. oryzae may thus also increase the production of melanin.
Melanin (Codon optimized for A. oryzae)
As a part of the project we set out to codon optimize, the Tokyo Tech melA gene from Rhizobium etli CFN42 to increase the expression in A. oryzae. Several studies have shown that expression of heterologous genes in some cases can be largely increased (15). The effect of the cod"

iGEM Leading-in
This year's human practice of Tianjin iGEM team mainly focused on how to start a new iGEM team. Our goal is to let more students who are interested in synthetic biology get familiar with iGEM, participate in it and join in our big family. Our task can be divided into following parts.
iGEM Handbook
Figure 1. iGEM Handbook
In China, there are more than 1000 universities and colleges related with Life Science, Biotechnology and Bioengineering. However, compared with high participation of foreign countries, only several universities in China have a good command of skills of biological designing and experimenting. Moreover, many undergraduates have little access to learn about microbial designing and synthetic biology. To help more Chinese students get familiar with iGEM, we write an iGEM handbook with Chinese, a language used by about 1/3 of the world population. This helps freshmen without much researching experience to learn more about iGEM, and those universities which have never started an iGEM team to create a new idea. We hope that through our joint efforts, we can make further steps in the road of life science.
Our handbook is composed of 4 parts.
A background introduction of iGEM competition.
Specific experimental guidance. Here we pick out several well-known magazines. Through training, greenhands will be looking forward to laboratory life, and those with lab experience will have a great opportunity of improvement.
Summarization of the recent-year experience of several outstanding teams. By communicating, relationships between teams are strengthened. By learning from each other, more progress will be made in the field of synthetic biology.
Introduction to several iGEM gold-medal projects. By having a basic understanding of their projects, we can inspire young people to develop their imagination and create newer and better products.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," above, greater cell density corresponds with greater lycopene production.
The second graph is derived from experiments using LB with two different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP): 50 μM and 100 μM. During the experiment with 2 mM copper (II) sulphate; the wild type E. coli cells continue to grow, since it did not produce an environment where there was substantial oxidative stress. Sodium nitroprusside can create an environment with greater oxidative stress. Due to the greater oxidative stress, the wild type cells are unable to grow in these conditions and show a very low optical density at 485 nm, which indicates a lack of lycopene production. The gradient of the two wild type cell graphs are similar, which is expected, as neither have an oxidative stress promoter. Wild type cells grew better under less oxidative stress (50 μM SNP), compared to 100 μM SNP. The optical density at 485 nm is lower for higher oxidative stress conditions with the wild type cells, which is due to their respective cell densities. However, the mNARK-Lycopene cells continue to grow and produce lycopene in these conditions. The lycopene cells display greater growth in the harsher 100 μM conditions compared with 50 μM. The gradient of 50 μM mNARK-Lycopene at 0.8435 is less than that of the 100 μM sample, which is 1.0864. This indicates that our mNARK device increases lycopene expression under higher oxidative stress.  In this experiment, the performance of the Lycopene cells is more pronounced, clearly showing that the mNARK-Lycopene devlice mops up the oxidative stress, which prevents the cells from dying. This results in a greater optical density being achieved and, by extension, greater lycopene production.
From the above data, we can deduce that our biobrick will produce more lycopene when there is more oxidative stress in older people there creating a regulatory feedback system.
Hence, we have characterised our silver BioBrick.
GOLD MEDAL:  Spy promoter BioBrick functions as pH switch
The deterioration of oral health in the elderly is accompanied by an increased prevalence of caries and periodontal disease, which are risk factors for some systemic diseases and nutrition problems (1).

The thought process was that by recognizing the presence of blood, the bacteria would be induced to release microcins. Microcins are naturally-produced bacterial metabolites that are able to kill other bacteria. We wanted to limit the probability of opportunistic pathogens escaping a leaky gut and causing sepsis in the patient. However, Dr. Zimmerman warned that this method would not be likely to produce enough microcins to be therapeutic, so we took a look in the iGEM registry. Harvard BioDesign 2015 had the answer. After combing the iGEM registry, we found a way to attempt to optimize the probiotic range of our bacterium with the addition of their fimH BioBrick BBa_K1850001. More information about this can be found on the Design page.
Microbes in Space
One interesting application of our probiotic was explored through meeting with Dr. Amor Menenzes from our school’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Dr. Menenzes specializes in systems biology and biological controls, like the creation of feedback loops. He originally guided us in producing a model for our butyrate metabolic system. In exchange, our team gave a presentation about the astronaut microbiome during one of his class lectures. One of the points covered when talking to Dr. Menenzes was the need to test bacteria on Earth before sending it up into space. This would be achieved by replicating a microgravity environment in instruments like High Aspect Rotating Vessels (HARVs). The culture vessel is completely filled with fluid and spins perpendicular to the plane of gravity. Cells become essentially buoyant as they continually ""free fall"" and can avoid high shear stress that would cause cellular damage or impair growth. Microbes can behave differently in such conditions, primarily due to the negative impact on gravity-driven transportation processes. Although this is not a true anti-gravity experience, microgravity still allows researchers to predict the fate and functionality of microbes in space.
Using the power of bacteria in space is not a novel concept; the potential for microbes to create hospitable life conditions outside Earth’s atmospheric boundaries is an ongoing quest. There is an expanding field of study concerning the use and feasibility of probiotics on the International Space Station. There has also been research on the change in bacterial populations of the gut microbiome in volunteer individuals living in a confined environment that simulated space living conditions. The human body reacts differently in space, and the population dynamics of microbes species fluctuate. To learn more, we corresponded with Dr. Silvia Turroni, a"

Second Annual NEGEM
On Saturday, September 14, 2013, we hosted the Second Annual New England Regional iGEM (NEGEM) meeting at Boston University. During NEGEM, each of the teams presented their research for twenty minutes and followed by a ten minute question and answer session. The mini conference was very constructive in that each team was provided with critical feedback for their presentations.
We appreciate the MIT , Wellesley and Stanford-Brown teams for taking time out of their busy schedules to participate. We hope to see them again next year!
In addition, we would like to thank Kim de Mora, Kitwa Ng, Karen Goebel, and Ana Sifuentes from iGEM Headquarters for coming to share their take on each of the presentations.
We cannot wait to see the improvements of everyone's presentations in Toronto!

Rice University iGEM Team
This year, we collaborated with Rice University's iGEM team on an app that would display information such as structure and function of a molecule once the user 'imaged' a moving crystal. The purpose of this project was to make a way for people to get a better understanding about molecules such as hemoglobin, as well as provide insight as to how the structures are determined.
Through the collaboration, we acted as guides for the development of the game, assisting in the preliminary planning stages, finding relevant tutorials and game engines, and acting as a reference for when they were unable to implement features. The collaboration initially began through email correspondence, but was later done through a shared Google Document where they would be able to post questions and we would be able to reply with relevant links and explanations."

Week 3: May 26 - 30
We introduced ourselves to the online software ‘Benchling’ and began cataloging our parts. We will be using Benchling to keep track of our parts during the cloning process. We also used Benchling to construct our first reporter/repressor test systems in silico. Performing cloning in silico helped us get an idea of the steps that we will need to take, and to plan out the restriction digestions that we will need, i.e. how to use the BioBrick system to assemble our constructs and exactly which enzymes to use.
We have gently settled on the idea of using a two-part genetic circuit, where the repressor gene regulates the reporter gene in a fashion analagous to ‘gates’ in electrical engineering (Brophy & Voigt, 2014) . We cloned several more parts, specifically the repressor/promoter pairs: C1-lambda, C1-434, and C2-P22. Promoters will be used as operators - though they function as promoters, we will be using the strong, constitutive promoter Pveg instead, then the repressible promoters will instead function as an operator. By using a strong, constitutive promoter we will ensure optimal expression regardless of the operator used. We also repeated efforts to clone RBS, pTetR, and TetR - up to the point of completing miniprep and confirmation by colony PCR.
We requested more B. subtilis parts from iGEM HQ - a terminator, and several RBS sequences and plasmid vectors. All but one of the vectors will be an integration vector which will allow us to integrate our constructs into a specific locus in the B. subtilis genome. The RBS sequences will offer improved translation rates in B. subtilis compared to using RBS sequences originating from E. coli.
Week 4: June 2 - 6
This week we contacted both Dr. Lisa Allen and Dr. Abebe Bayih in hopes that they would be able to give insight on our multi-disease detector for a quick and easy diagnosis of neglected diseases in the developing world. Given that they have hands-on experience in impoverished areas, they are able to offer valuable opinions of what technology local people currently use and also what they would want created and/or improved. We also brainstormed further questions to ask. As a group we did a few trials of DNA extraction from strawberries in order to become proficient in our techniques for the Telus Spark"

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," afternoon of      practical biological work, the pupils analyzed the DNA samples and determined the length      of the plasmid used. After tidying up and cleaning all the tables, the pupils gave us their      feedback about the workshop. All in all, this was a very successful afternoon, we learned       a lot from it ourselves, had fun and hope that we helped the pupils getting an insight in      the occupational field of genetic engineering. We want to say thank you to the Marie-      Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen and the biology teachers for letting us organize this      workshop, being so helpful with and enthusiastic about the idea. Of course, we were      mindful of safety, too. We worked in a biology room, where eating and drinking is      prohibited. Every student had to wear safety goggles and gloves, they had to change at      least two times, during the whole workshop. We used no harmful substances and had      safety sheets put on display.
Christian-Ernst- Gymnasium Erlangen
On Juli 11th, 2017 members of our iGEM team then visited the Christian-Ernst-     Gymnasium in Erlangen, giving a workshop on iGEM and genetic engineering. Alena,     Ann-Sophie, Benedikt, Hannah, Steffen, Ariane, Luise, Eva, Alex and Jonas met at     7:30am to get all the last minute preparations done. After Alena, Ariane and Steffen     informed the students about iGEM, genetical engineering and therefore ist risks and     benefits. But the workshop should not stay as theoretical is that – basic biologic work     techniques were coached by our team with the aid of a micro cake recipe: The students     were able to “bake” a cake under laboratory like circumstances. Afterwards, our team     members provided the students with information about university life and possible     courses of study. All in all: a verysuccessful human practice project!
