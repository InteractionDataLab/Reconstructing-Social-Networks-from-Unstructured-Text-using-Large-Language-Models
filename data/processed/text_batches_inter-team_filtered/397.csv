Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

Why the ""Pollution Crusader Device""?
The alarming levels of pollution in Delhi are not hidden from any of us. Delhi has been ranked the first most polluted metropolis in the world, and is one of the most heavily polluted cities in India. In the period between 2000-2011, PM10 levels in Delhi's air jumped by as much as 47 per cent.
Hence we came up with idea of using biology to cater to this problem. To come with a solution that is both sustainable and effective. We started with making Eco.coli that could reduce (NO)x emissions.
We further instigated the problem and found that one of the largest contributions to rising pollution in Delhi is the exhaust from automobiles and other devices using petrol and diesel as fuel. The main components of Diesel engine exhaust are:  Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter:
NOx
SOx
CO2
CO
All these emissions are responsible for causing harmful health impacts on living"

The 3D-printed cuvette brace offered space for LED and photosensor to be attached. The space for the cuvette is slightly larger than the size of cuvette, leaving extra space for vibration. During the measurement, inlay the cuvette into the fitting hole in order to fix it.
The 3D-printed shell is a box with four interfaces attached to the brace. The baffle plate covers and protects details of the system, leaving a hole for the cuvette.
Processor
Beetle
We chose a small MCU - Beetle based on Arduino Leonardo as processor. It is very small in size, only 20mm by 22mm. In addition, it has a microUSB which can be burned directly, and it can also be connected by wire directly, which is very convenient for debugging.
Filters
We use reden filter paper as our filters, which is usually used in photography. It is not as good as professional filter but it is cheaper and easy to obtain in China.
More info: link1 link2
Power Module
For portable purposes, we use both batteries and power cords for power supply. Specifically, we use a 150mAh battery, a power management module suitable for lithium battery, and a micro USB interface for charging. It is connected to a button, which is clicked for start and double - clicked for shutdown.
Photosensitive Sensor
TSL235R
The same as Team Aachen, we choose this photosensitive sensor for its small size, which is only 4.6*2.6*4.6
LED
We use 605nm and 485nm LED, which variance is less than 5nm.
Temperature Sensor
LM35DZ
LM35DZ  is a cheap and fine temperature sensor, we use it to remind the users to put the yeast in a proper temperature for cultivation.
Display Screen
In order to display the results visually, we choose to use the display screen to demonstrate the results. We choose a small display screen,0.96 inch, which uses the IIC communication protocol

In this way the lenses will be split up what would have become a 2D-pixel into individual light rays just before reaching the sensor. With the help of sophisticated software, all these tiny images can be combined to sharp 3D model of the scene. Lytro is one of the first companies that is already working on consumable light field cameras with microlenses (Nolf, 2016) .
According to Nikon, another possibility to use microlenses is when you want to focus multiple focal planes at the same time. This means that you can focus upon different points that are not at the same height (z-direction). Regular camaras or microscopes can only focus upon one height at the same time.
For the last two options, it is important that the microlenses always have exactly the same properties. This means that they should always have the same size and the same optical properties. A FACS scanner could probably be used to do detect the cells with certain properties. However, more research is required to make this possible. For the applications where the goal is purely to capture more light, it is not necessarily a requirement that every microlens has the exact same properties. The biologically produced microlenses can easily be implemented in these kinds of applications.
Optical fibres
A single-mode optical fiber with microlens (Altman, 2007)
For all the above described applications, microlens arrays are used. Single microlenses can be used to couple light to optical fibres. Optical fibres are very thin, flexible and transparent fibres that are made from silica or plastic (Karp, Tremblay, & Ford, 2010) . They are mostly used to transmit light between the two ends of the fibre. Because they permit transmission over longer distances and higher bandwidths than for example wire cables and the amount of loss is much smaller compared to metal wires, they are widely used in communication applications, such as telecommunication and computer networking. Microlenses can be used to make the optical fibres even more efficient (Karp et al., 2010) .
Suitability of our lenses for the different applications
We succeeded to produce almost spherical microlenses. As described before, for many applications light capturing is a limiting factor. Based on our modeling , we can conclude that our microlenses focuses light and the lenses can be used to capture light more efficiently therefore. However, the modeling also shows that our biouologically produced microlenses have no focal point but a focal area. For multiple applications this is an"

""Years from now we will treat most infections with bacteria and not antibiotics.""
Professor James Malone-Lee
Barlow Professor of Geriatric Medicine
A solution is urgently needed for the increasing number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The engineering of bacterial cells to fight human pathogens is a promising alternative to administering traditional antibiotics. Our project involves the use of synthetic biology to engineer living therapeutics that have the potential to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are a major public health concern in developed countries. This is largely due to growing antibiotic resistance.
The Problem
Antibiotics have negative side effects and their resistance is a growing problem
UTIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the bacteria that cause them are frequently resistant to antibiotics
Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms
Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of all hospital-acquired infections
Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections
Problem with Antibiotics
Antibiotic use is associated with numerous negative side effects, allergies and reactions. The most common side effects of antibiotics all impact the digestive system and occur in around one in ten people. Around one person in fifteen has an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and cephalosphorins [ 10 ]. Half of the patients we spoke to during our project wanted us to find an alternative to using antibiotics, owing to the severity of the negative side effects that they experience.
Despite their negative side effects, antibiotics have been used so widely and for so long that the targeted microbes have adapted to become resistant, reducing the effectiveness of the drugs. A vicious cycle ensues in which ineffective antibiotic treatments leads to overprescription and overexposure, which amplifies the problem of antibiotic resistance. Global antibiotic consumption grew by 30% between 2000 and 2010. [ 27 ] Described by the Chief Medical Officer of England as “a threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.

Dry Lab Collaborations
eXplaY model in collaboration with team Groningen
When team Groningen visited Vilnius and participated in the life sciences BioHackathon, we have spent many hours together while friendly communicating, as well as exchanging ideas about modeling our project. We intended to design a liposome-surface display system and team Groningen was so interested in SynDrop idea, that they even offered some help. Finally, through this collaboration a molecular thermodynamics model, called eXplaY , was built that we are grateful being able to use.
Mathematical model for necessity of mRNA addition to IVTT system
While creating our cell-free system we had hypothesized the necessity of adding initial mRNA over single DNA into our liposomes. With the help of team Edinburgh, mathematical model proving our theoretical concept was designed. This model might be helpful for creating more efficient cell-free systems for membrane protein research.

Following this lack of time, we used another protocol (detailed in the following subpart) to check and quantify the presence of our tissue vector in the lung. For this, we studied in the literature what dose of M.avium could be injected into a mouse model. Different studies, on several pathologies of bacterial origin, mentioned the injection of 105 to 107 CFU.ml-1 (colony forming units) per mouse by intravenous route.
We chose to realize this experiment on 3 murine model: immunodepressed, normal, and cancerous.
According to several studies, it seems that mycobacteria has a specific affinity for fibronectins, surexpressed at the surface of tumor cells. Mycobacterial tropism for tumor area has not been yet demonstrated, the cancerous murine model allows us to test this hypothesis.

Day -7: Inoculation of 4.10^6 LBS cells (fibroblastic cancer cells) subcutaneously on 2 black 6 mice.
Day 0: Inoculation of 10^6 CFU.ml-1* of tissue vectors, M.avium, by IV route (intravenous) injected in the tail of the 3 mouse models: immunodepressed, cancer, and normal (2 mice per model).
The concentration of injected tissue vectors was determined by measuring the optical density. The optical density of 10^6 bacteria is not detectable in a spectrophotometer. We therefore measured the cell suspension absorbance of 10^8 bacteria. Once diluted by 100, we obtained the desired concentration is: 10^6 bacteria.
Day 7: Mice sacrifice, organs extraction and cell suspension obtention, from the lungs, liver, spleen.
The cell suspension obtained is then analyzed by flow cytometry, to verify the size and granularity of cells. These 2 characteristics are totally different between eukaryotic cells comprising murine organs, and the vector tissue M.avium of prokaryotic origin.
We can thus verify and quantify the presence of the vector tissue.

Results
A lung sample of each murine models, has been analysed by flow cytometry, to determine and quantify our tissue vector presence, M.avium in the lungs. This experiment could not be repeated more than once, we can only be reserved for these results. Nevertheless, various publications have already demonstrated the Mycobacterium avium implantation in the"
XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#wetlabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," found out that some bacterial colony had grown on the LB agar  plate containing Amp, while there was no colony growing on the plate of control  group.
Fluorescence  Test:
Today is  the first day when we tested the new circuit named 4J induced by aTc. But  things got not well. According to the experiences, we made a gradient, 4  levels, of aTc concentrations – 0, 0.25, 2.5, 25 mM. All data gave us the only  information that there were no green fluorescence protein expressions in our  cultures. Answers to these questions are under researching and testing.

Cell  Immobilization:
Measured  the fluorescence intensity of capsules prepared at last night.
The  capsules were shaken for 10 hours after they were prepared. Then added  Arabinose solution and measured the fluorescence of capsules.
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PBAD-RLT at night and  transferred them to LB culture medium.
Fluorescence  Test:
Since  two new circuits of the group of Time Delay were constructed two days ago, we  tested these circuits today with the same concentration of arabinose, 0.1 mM,  as before. This time, we still wanted to get fluorescence / OD600 curves. But  when we got results, we found that curves of these two circuits got coincident.  It seemed that we might get some mistakes in our parts contribution.

 Our collaborations
Collaborations in the iGEM competition are important for us as well for other teams because it’s a source of mutual help. We don’t consider other teams as competitors but mostly as a source of inspiration. We hope to have helped some             teams too. In this competition, mutual help is essential for present a project as successful as possible in Boston.             Networking, sharing and communication are the keys in research and did our best to keep them at the centre of our working philosophy!
OUR MEET-UP: Biotech4Change - 3 mins “Present your iGEM project” pitch
During our meet up at the European Parliament we gave the opportunity to other iGEM teams to present their project in 3 mins in front of the public and the panel of experts! It was a unique opportunity in an incredible venue! Since                 we were the only Belgian team we really wanted to valorize our work and share it with other teams from across Europe! More info about the conference .
We were happy to host 3 teams: Lund (Sweden), Paris-Pasteur (France), TU-Eindhoven (Netherlands).

Public's views on transgenic technology
Transgenic technology has been showing brilliant talents in the novel fields like new energy and medicines and has propelled the economy in both primary and secondary industries. However, controversial transgenic technology has not been mature enough, especially the underlying issue relative to ethics and security, which stirred debate among the public, Thus, the main purpose of this survey is to understand publics’ attitudes toward transgenic technology.

Background
With the vast development of human society as well as the continuous increase of global population, a serious imbalance between humans’ demands and natural supply gradually occurs. Fortunately, the rapid progress of humans’ science and technology has bridged this contradiction to a certain degree. Transgenic technology is a novel method raised since 21st century, the improvement of which possesses a significant potential to both current issues worldwide and development of human beings in a long run. Nowadays, transgenic technology has already generated high economic value in traditional industries including primary industries and secondary industries. As for the novel fields like new energy and medicines, transgenic technology has also exhibited its brilliant talents. However transgenic technology is a two-edged sword, parts of which are still not mature enough, especially the underlying issue with regard to ethics and security associated with it has already led to a large amount of discussions. Thus, the main purpose of this survey is to understand publics’ attitudes toward transgenic technology.
Purpose
As a part of Human Practice, this report of survey will be primarily subject to learn publics’ attitudes toward transgenic technology and understand their doubts over this novel technology.
Respondent and general condition
Respondent: Most undergraduates, some students’ parents and random people in the public
General condition: Respondents’ ages are mostly distributed from 18 to 30, and the data distribution follows the model of Gaussian distribution, while its axis of symmetry is around X=20(years old). Additionally, respondents with a Bachelor or higher degree have taken up a large proportion of the sum.

General Safety
Probably one of the most important points in every laboratory is safety. For this reason the University established rules for every person working in the lab.  Food and cosmetics are forbidden in the lab with no excuse. We put on a Lab coat when we enter the laboratory and wash our hands to be sure we do not bring any contaminations from the outside to the lab. When working with living organisms we wear gloves and when we work with harmful material we also wear safety goggles.  When we are working with ethidium bromide we have to move to a special room and wear nitrile gloves. It is also important that no equipment, which is contaminated with ethidium bromide, leaves this room.  While working with hot materials we wear special heatproof gloves. When we use any new equipment we ask a more experienced researcher to give us an introduction. Sometimes Bunsen burners are not enough to protect delicate material from contamination. For this materials we use the lamina flow hoods.  And for sure we wash our hands each time we leave the lab but this should go without saying.
Safe Project Design
We are using two antitoxin/toxin systems (ccdA-ccdB & maze-mazF) in our experiments. For this reason our designed plasmid causes a lot of stress to E.coli. We figured out that the cells do everything to destroy the plasmid. There might be no selection advantage in nature. Furthermore, we used E.coli XL1 strain for all our experiments.
Safe Lab Work
Beside the general “good laboratory practice” no further measures were needed.
Safe Shipment
Like our last years team we sent our BioBricks with the standard process, required by iGEM. Additionally we sent our ccdB plasmid to the university of Concordia on a steril filter paper, according to Rosman, Miller. Improved method for plasmid shipment. Biotechniques. 1990 May;8(5):509. Thanks to this method we didn’t have to send a living organism.

Collaboration: imagining the future together
In the world of iGEM, teams from different universities usually work on distinct projects tackling separate issues. Sometimes, however, the combination of two projects can give rise to novel solutions that could not be achieved by either project alone. As it turns out, the iGEM projects of team Amsterdam and team TU Delft give rise to such combination. In this essay we wrote together, we explore how our projects could be combined and describe a potential application of combining Amsterdam’s synthetic consortium with Delft’s nanowires and 3D-biofilm printer.

Creating a new generation of affordable biorefineries
An exploration of combined projects and visions
iGEM Amsterdam & Synenergene
Delft
The TU Delft iGEM team designed constructs that give bacteria the ability to form nanowires between each other, creating an extracellular matrix which forms a structure, and form a biofilm. In the project of Amsterdam, the E.coli and cyanobacteria will form the biofilms. The E.coli bacteria are producing the nanowires. The cyanobacteria will be trapped by these nanowires in such a way that specific structures of both E.coli and cyanobacteria are formed. These specific structures can increase the production rate as the  ratio of cyanobacteria to E.coli can be engineered to ideally match the steady state conversion rates, while at the same time reducing diffusion limitations between both partners.

Secretory module
Alpha-factor
We use α-Factor to facilitate the secretion of our exogenous proteins. (see Figure 2)
α-Factor is a 13-residue peptide, secreted by cells of α mating type, that acts on cells of the opposite mating type to promote efficient conjugation between the two cell types, which leads to the formation of aα diploid cells. α-factor is synthesized as a precursor of 165 amino acids containing an 83-residue leader and four α-factor coding regions (Lin-Cereghino GP, 2013), each preceded by a short spacer peptide.
Figure 2 Predicted structure of the α-mating factor pre-pro secretion signal.
The first helix is part of the pre-region, whereas the following two helixes are part of the pro-region.
(Source: Lin-Cereghino GP, Stark CM, Kim D, et al. 2013)
As a natural signal peptide that is widely present in yeast, α-factor has strong and potent secretory properties. Studies have shown that its secretion is almost 100% (Lin-Cereghino GP, 2013), which can prevent the secretion of exogenous tubulin from interrupting the yeast's inherent microtubule system.

Microtubules are fibrous elements in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, where they play comparably diverse and important roles. The microtubule building block is the tubulin αβ heterodimer (Caudron, 2002). A typical microtubule is a hollow water-filled tube with an outer diameter of 25 nm (Fygenson, 1994) and an inner diameter of 15 nm. Alpha-beta heterodimers associate head-to-tail to form protofilaments running lengthwise along the microtubule wall with the beta-tubulin subunit facing the microtubule plus end conferring a structural polarity (Alberts, 2014). Microtubules usually have 13 protofilaments but different protofilament numbers can be found in some organisms and specialized cells. (see Figure 3)

Parts we helped to characterize.
pArs_mRFP (BBa_K1106003)
A promoter sensitive to the presence of the arsenite ion. It codes for mRFP to produce a red fluorescence when in presence of arsenite, working as a biosensor. This part is from Team: Buenos_Aires and was characterized in our lab as a collaboration between TecMonterrey and Buenos_Aires.
New parts we created
Hip-1 (BBa_K1166000)
Composed of the HIP-1 promoter with the FNR expression cassette upstream for a stronger hypoxic regulation, this promoter will start translation in coding sequences 3' downstream in a hypoxic environment.
His-TAT (BBa_K1166003)
A biobrick that includes the TAT signal peptide that can be fused to any protein for an easy internalization into mammal cells. It includes a 6x His-tag for easy purification.
TAT is a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) derived from the transactivator of transcription from HIV and has been used to internalize a range of large and small molecules from peptides, DNA and antibodies, to liposomes.
TRAIL (BBa_K1166004)
Contains the T7 expression cassette for the soluble part (aminoacids 98-281) of TRAIL with an N-terminal histidine tag (x6) to enhance its purification. It is known to cause apoptosis by binding a membrane receptor.
TAT-Apoptin (BBa_K1166005)
Codes for the T7 expression cassette for TAT-Apoptin composed of a N-terminal TAT translocation peptide, followed by a linker (GGGGS), a histidine tag (6x) and by the same linker fused to Apoptin. Apoptin is a protein from the Chicken Anemia Virus known to cause apoptosis in human cancer cell lines only using a pathway independent from P53 by a phosphorilation in the Threonine 108.

As for respondents’ attitude towards sewage treatment 88.51% people show their willingness for paying to improve current treatment method; 71.62% believe proper treatment is very important, 26.35% think it not so important and the rest think it not important at all or don’t care; 79.73% of the respondents think sewage has a great influence on our environment, while 15.54% don’t agree, and 4.73% don’t care at all.
As for people’s attitude towards water, 16.22% of people say the quality of water are very important to them, and people always, sometimes, and never pay attention to the quality of water are 32.43%, 43.24% and 8.11%, respectively; and people who are satisfied, not very satisfied, not satisfied at all and don’t care are 15.54%, 66.22%, 2.7% and 15.54%, respectively; 77.03% people report that sewage near the place they live stinks more or less.
When asked about some basic knowledge about water, 82.43% of respondents give a correct answer to the comparison between water resources per capita in China and the world average level; however only 16.2% people know that the proper pH value of standard drinking water ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.
As for the government’s role in treating sewage, 10.81% say they know the government has taken some actions; while others don’t agree or don’t know about government’s action.
From the statistics, most people feel it a duty for them to contribute to the water treatment. This means that there really exits obvious problems in the quality of water in our daily life. However, the result also shows that people have a very good understanding of their living environment and they are willing to be involved in the environment protection business. This survey collected some information and made people think more about the waste water treatment issue.
Further Discussion
In China, the water resource issue is becoming the most serious problem that we have to face. For more than 600 cities in China, two thirds are lack of daily life water, and 100 cities are even in serious shortage of water resource, including Beijing, Tianjin etc. There is no doubt that saving and protecting water resource from pollution is the most important issue to our society and government.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," been preparing to build it, the main question we had was - what is the combination of substrate nucleotide and catalytic biomolecules we should use, in order to confidently know if our system or its parts are working as intended?
For example, if we would have tried to build CAT-Seq using a random library of different catalytic biomolecules and at the same time tested the system performance, we would have no idea whether if it’s the catalytic biomolecule and substrate nucleotide combination that is influencing our positive or negative results, or is it the CAT-Seq method itself. In other words, we had two groups of variables. For that reason, we wanted to reduce the variables to one group - system performance variables.
In order to achieve that, we have decided to use standard, already well established low-throughput methods to find a particular catalytic biomolecule and a substrate nucleotide pair. After that, we can then use that well-characterized catalytic biomolecule and substrate pair to build and optimize CAT-Seq.
Obtaining the first catalytic biomolecule
In order to find a correct combination of Substrate Nucleotide and the Catalytic Biomolecule that can catalyze the removal of the substrate, we have decided to look for a hydrolase. The is because a direct removal of the substrate from nucleotide seemed like the most timewise efficient choice.
First, we synthesized a cytidine which had a benzoyl substrate attached to it: N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. Instructions on how such substrate nucleotide can be synthesized can be found here.
Then, an esterase library was screened manually using microwell plates in order to find the hydrolase enzyme which can catalyse the removal of the substrate. Once such enzyme was found and its sequence was determined. We have then used this pair of esterase enzyme and substrate cytidine to build the first version of CAT-Seq.
Next, we have performed an in-silico modelling of our Esterase enzyme.  The goal of the in-silico analysis was to create the Esterase mutants which would have different catalytic activities. Once such mutants were constructed, their relative catalytic activities were measured again using the same standard methods we have used to find the initial esterase enzyme. This was done in order to construct a small Esterase mutant library which would have precisely-defined catalytic activities by already established low-throughput measuring methods. Then, with CAT-Seq, we can also measure the activities of those mutants in high-throughput, which"

Optimization of the SeeDNA system to improve sensitivity
Results so far show that in principle the SeeDNA system is working as expected.  To be useful the system must be able to detect low amounts of target DNA.  We have begun to systematically optimize each step and parameter in our detection protocols to improve efficiency.  A big increase in efficiency can probably be achieved by using cells that are more highly competent.  We focused on other parameters initially.
Experiment 1 (optimization of temperature of the detection reaction)
We varied the temperature at which the activated detector plasmid is incubated with the target DNA.  For this we used the HPV detector and dsHPV target oligonucleotides. By varying this simple parameter a significant improvement in detection efficiency was obtained.  It is hoped that the optimization of further parameters can yield even more improvements.

Testing a fluorescent read out for the SeeDNA system
To test this fluorescent HPV detector plasmid we used the HaeIII digested pBluescript+HPVtarget as our target, with HaeIII digested pBluescript (empty vector) as a control.  Detection reactions were set up and transformed as usual.  One hour after transformation chloramphenicol was added to the transformation reaction and it was incubated in a 37 degree shaker"

The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter two
Just as the little prince gradually felt asleep, the life light of Little Dot started flickering. It was the time for Little Dot to replenish some energy; instead it would like to left the little prince aside. He was almost unfamiliar after all.
“It may be…better… to message her for help…” Little Dot knew it would be scold angrily by Summer. But Little Dot had just got used to hold consideration for others; moreover the little prince would get ill the next day after a whole night here. For that Summer had adjusted the celestial body into sleep state, the temperature control device would activate at night. Then it would become cold. Summer did so to attach the dew to the ground and the plant. The celestial changed relative humid thanks to this, for it had been quite dry before instead.
In the Glass House, Summer was helping her figurines—just so many fiddled by her own--replenish their energy. Summer was rightly so lively; she would raise hell provided that she live in so big a house by herself. Besides dealing with some daily expounds, she had a special hobby—dressing herself up as the Flame Angel to save the universe. She had fabricated countless equipments, including clothes, shoes, magic tools and even antipersonnel weapons and so on. Still it was"

Clarified lysate of Tn5 protein was added to the washed His-Select Ni resin and incubated with gentle mixing for 60minutes at 4 ℃. The His-Select Ni resins were washed with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20mM imidazole, 1mM DTT, pH8), and eluded with with 6* 500μL (6CV) of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 250mM imidazole, 1mM DTT, pH8) at 4 ℃, according to the Purification protocol.

In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," destroyed by autoclaving.
None of our designs or parts are highly hazardous to the environment since they mainly involve environment-sensing genes and fluorescent proteins. In a hypothetical environmental release, they would have a disadvantage for overproducing useless metabolites such as GFP, so their competitiveness would decrease and they would not be able to survive for a long time. We have tested, with some values, how this metabolic charge affects their growing rate. Our results indicate that our genetically modifications decrease –rather than increase- biological fitness. We have not missed the possibility of horizontal gene transfer risks so we asked for non-conjugative plasmids which also required external inducers.
In conclusion, when we work, we are very concerned about the risk in public and environmental safety, and take the necessary measures needed to prevent damage.
Researcher safety
People who work in a laboratory should be taught properly about the risks. We had to verify the safety of our biological material, techniques and chemicals that we intended to use.
We have avoided using the most common hazardous chemicals and techniques in a laboratory. For example, we have used RedSafe® instead of ethidium bromide in our agarose gel. Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent that distorts the structure of the DNA helix, it is both mutagen and carcinogen. In addition, we have followed the following points faithfully in order to develop our project with care and caution:
-Wear labcoats, as it prevents possible projections of chemicals from reaching the skin. Of course, it also avoids possible damage to your clothing.
-If you have long hair, it is advisable to put it into a pony tail.
-Use rubber gloves every time you can. However, it may be unsuitable to wear them when working close to a fire.
-Rinse your hands regularly when working with media and microorganisms.
-And last, but not least, remember that in the laboratory is strictly forbidden to smoke, eat or drink beverages.
In particular our project has a special consideration with UV-radiation in one of our constructions. In order to activate that construction it is necessary to irradiate with UV-light (254 nm), so we built a special machine to irradiate bacteria in a controlled and safe environment. This machine totally blocks UV irradiation towards researchers. The machine was called Tordeitor 3000. Here you can see a self-made video about it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=448MrmbAzdo .

SilkyColi: Reprogramming the physical and functional properties of synthetic silks
Safety
The iGEM Safety Committee has approved the UCLA team to receive an exception to the Policy Against Release of Wet-Lab Projects . This exception permits the UCLA team to present samples of bacteria-derived silk at the 2015 Giant Jamboree, as long as the silk remains in a closed container. This exception was granted based on two tests performed in advance:  (1) a swab test that did not show any living transgenic bacteria remaining on a sample after it was processed (2) a bioinformatic search against AllergenOnline , a database of allergenic proteins  Any questions may be directed to the iGEM Safety Commitee (email safety AT igem DOT org).
As a manufacturing iGEM team, we take safety very seriously, especially in the context of producing unique biomaterials for use in the environmental and biomedical fields.  As such, we focused on maintaining rigorous microbiological and allergenic safety of our synthesized silk products, especially in the context of potentially bringing our silk samples to the Jamboree.
Streak-and-Swab Test
In order to analyze whether our processing silk samples are free of transgenic bacterial contamination as a byproduct of genetic silk expression, we perform a swab and streak plating analysis of our resultant silk fibers to determine if the silk samples, when swabbed onto a plate, result in growth of bacterial colonies.  Our results, after a web with our sample samples containing proteins of the Bombyx mori fibroin heavy chain (FibH) and the co-spinning nodule containing FibNT, FibCt, and sfGFP proteins, suggests that the fibers a sterile (especially due to the post-processing wash in an 90% isopropanol coagulation bath to strengthen the fibers) (Figure 1, below).

Overview
    In our system, we have three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
    To contruct our farmers, we contructed a new part invertase(BBa_K2250000/BBa_K2250001/BBa_K2250003). Our E.coli MG1655  can not utilize sucrose as its nutrients. Invertase catalyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, thus providing nutrients for all bacteria. See the intervase test for more details.
    To realize the role of the warrior, we utilized a kind of molecule called AHL([N-]acyl-homoserine lactones). There are several kinds of AHLs, which bind to different receptors with different affinity. AHL together with the receptor can bind to specific promoters and activate the corresponding gene. We want to design a gene circuit with orthogonality.In other words, we want the warrior to kill bacteria from the other group but not from its own group. To accomplish this, we did the orthogonality test to select the comparatively best pairs.
    After the construction of our warriors, we tested how the warriors really work. We have two standards to see if the warriors are fitted or not. First, the warrior must have good orthogonality. That is to say, the warrior must kill its enemies but not itself. Second, the killing ability must be neither too strong nor too weak. We carried out the killing test to test our warriors.

We received the sequencing results back. We have construct 1, with ssRA tags confirmed. We saw the results from the plates ffrom yesterday and they look promising. We don't have background fluorescence in the presence of reduced ferrocyanide in the agar plate.  Overnight plate exeriment and solution experiment suggests that sulfite does reduce GFP fluorescence but cells in the plate were able to recover as they have interface with oxigen.The plates contained also sodium sulfites, that gets rid of oxygen (which mimics the reducing portential of the electrode). Now it's time to do the same, but with the elctrodes. We are going to do it today. Hopefully by the end of the week, we have some solid results. Golden Gate did not work again. The positive contro also did not work. This suggests that there is something wrong in the golden gate mixture.  Sue, the lab technician, reminded to Amrit that we need to clean more. Everytime we use something, just clean it afterwards and tidy up the lab every night.  So we are getting back the cleaning rota. And also let's come to the lab earlier, so we don't have to leave at 22 every night...

Introduction: collaboration with the Melbourne team and their star peptide
The degradation pathway of DCM by DcmA produces a number of intermediates. Some of these, such as formaldehyde, are suspected to be toxic to our host bacteria above certain concentrations. Alongside using microcompartments for our project, we have also collaborated with UniMelb iGEM and considered attaching our different enzymes to the arms of a star peptide (https://2014.igem.org/Team:Melbourne) . Doing so would increase the likelihood that the reaction product of the first enzyme encounters the second enzyme in the pathway rapidly due to their proximity, therefore preventing the buildup of metabolic intermediates.
Our reaction
Our reaction
Our reaction pathway is as follows:
Reaction 1: DCM + DcmA --> toxic intermediate (formaldehyde)
Reaction 2: toxic intermediate (formaldehyde) + FdhA --> neutral product (formate)
The Melbourne star peptide length can be varied in order to control the rate of reaction. Melbourne, however, were unsure of the form of the relationship between these length and rate and asked Oxford to develop a model of this. We hypothesized that, broadly speaking, the effect of increasing the length of the tether would result in a decrease in reaction rate due to two factors- the increased time taken to diffuse from one enzyme to the other and the decreased likelihood of colliding with an enzyme as the distance of diffusion increases.
A visualization of the star peptide- the key variable is the distance between the active sites of the two key enzymes. We were asked to propose a relationship between this distance and reaction rate.
The model
The model
The star peptide- building the model
To isolate the effect of increased diffusion time, our simulation released 100 molecules from the same starting point and tracked their motion through stochastically driven diffusion. It then tracked the time required for 50 of these molecules to reach radii of varying length.
This is again based on another implicit assumption – that a collision between an enzyme and a substrate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for reaction to occur. Therefore, we have assumed that reaction rate is proportional, but not equal to, collision rate. As such, we cannot state the exact reaction rate and have normalized our data so that our highest data point takes a value 1 and subsequent reaction rates are"

Toulouse FBA Model
We cooperated with Toulouse on the modeling. Here we describe the Flux Balance Analysis the Toulouse team generously  performed for us.
Flux Balance Analysis is a widely used approach for studying the flow through metabolic networks. In our  case we are interested in the leucine and AHL production rates of the type A cells and their effect on the growth rate of the bacteria. This is very important because if cell A has a big metabolic burden and thus, a very low growth rate, cell B would overgrow it and our pattern formation system would not work. Therefore, it is very important to keep the growth rates of cells A and cells B as close as possible to each other. To check the effect of our system on the growth rate iGEM Toulouse ran a FB analysis.
When a FBA is set up. The metabolic network of the organism in question is represented as a matrix $\mathbf{S}$   of size $m \times n$ . This matrix is filled with the stoichiometric constants of each reaction. Each of the $m$ matrix  rows represents a unique compound. Similarly each of the n columns represents one unique reaction. Next   a vector $\mathbf{v}$ of length $n$ is defined which contains the flux through each reaction. Finally, the   vector $\mathbf{x}$ is defined to contain the concentrations of each metabolite. The steady state solution  is the insteresting one, therefore:  $$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \mathbf{Sv} = 0 $$  Which is the nullspace of $\mathbf{S}$. In this set of solutions, a maximal or minimal value can be identified  using numerical optimization. In order to run the optimization algorithm a cost function has to be defined.  $$ f(x) = \mathbf{c}^{T}\mathbf{v} $$  The equation above shows such a cost function. Here the vector $\mathbf{c}$ represents a weight vector. In practice  it is used to choose the metabolite of interested by setting the corresponding entry to one and all others to zero.  From an optimization perspective the equation $\mathbf{Sv} = 0$ represents constraints, which guide the numerical  solver to the right solution.
In our case the"

In the end, although we still have a majority of young people between 16 and 25. However, we had an improvement of almost 1/3 of the answers coming from other age ranges.
Figure 5: Zoom on women's age
Figure 6: Zoom on men's age
With the first version of our survey, we did not ask details about the scientific background, and especially the background in biology. However, we quickly realized while reading some comments and seeing the first results that feedback on the survey, and on what people understood or already knew, was highly related to their background in biology.  For example, we were surprised at some of the first people who answered saying that the survey did not help them to better understand synthetic biology but with this question about the background in biology, we discovered that some of them had a Ph.D. or were College students in biology and therefore did not get any new information from our explanation.
Figure 7: Backgrounds in biology of the surveyed population
Opinion on synthetic biology
One of the goals of our survey was to open up synthetic biology to a wider population by asking questions on it and explaining what it is and what it is for.  We wanted to know whether people knew about it and whether they had any interest in it. We can see from Figure 8 that the majority of people are interested in synthetic biology or GMOs. Although, 6% seem not to be interested.
Figure 8: Opinions on GMOs
We can also observe that 100% of those polled have a good opinion about synthetic biology’s utility. Indeed, even though 75% of those polled thinks synthetic biology needs an ethical framework, it is still a field of study that could have a great role in driving science forward.

Just as the iGEM year has started and our Team was formed, we readily acknowledged the main “big picture” problem we want to solve in synthetic biology - the difficulty of creating novel, synthetic parts. In particular we were interest in synthetic catalytic biomolecules.
Catalytic biomolecules are a cleaner and greener substitute to chemical catalyzers used all over the world. The catalytic biomolecules offer an enormous 17 orders of magnitude chemical reaction acceleration as well as excellent stereo-, chemo- and regio-selectivity in aqueous environments. Yet, one of the main drawbacks of using enzymes is that for many important chemical reactions, efficient enzymes have not yet been discovered or engineered.
That said, identifying enzyme amino acid sequence with the required novel or optimized reaction is a challenging task because the sequence space is incomprehensibly large.
The discovery of Generative Adversarial Networks
While exploring the possible ways of solving the previously described problem we have stumbled upon an article describing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As we were not familiar with these relatively new neural networks at that time, we have studied the examples of what it has already achieved. The main idea of GANs is that it can learn the patterns of a given data input in order to generate examples as if they were from a given dataset. For example, if shown enough cat images, it will not start to generate an exact, specific cat image from the dataset, but it will learn how a cat should look in general. That results in a GAN that may produce cat images which do not have analogs in the dataset. A completely new cat!
We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer"
BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the process of translation, ribosome ought to drop at stop codon, but it has some possibility that the ribosome could directly identify start codon and move on to translate the next gene, which means we could save a promoter.
Fig.12 Ribosome movement at “Stop-Start Codon”.
Actually, this phenomenon is not common. According to Vivian, The transcription ratio of the downstream gene and the upstream gene is about 1:5-1:10. Multiple factors impact the data, such as the strain of the bacteria, the plasmid backbone, the gene itself... and so on.
Module 5 : cI repressor and its promoter
One of the keys to our project is how to couple the target gene to the expression of growth-promoting factors, and how to avoid minor variations in the regulatory part bringing a huge impact on the entire system. Initially our idea was to use a large number of operon regulation systems in prokaryotes—usually a small molecule substrate corresponding to a repressor. When a small molecule substrate is present, the repressor dissociates from the operon region that is located upstream of the promoter so that downstream products can be expressed. Therefore, the gene catalyzing the synthesis of the small molecule substrate and the target gene are expressed in tandem by a specific DNA sequence, and the repressor is integrated into the genome for constant expression, so that simultaneous expression of the growth-promoting factor when the target product is expressed can be achieved. Thus, the strain carrying the target gene is given a growth advantage.
However, this approach has two important disadvantages. First, building such a system is cumbersome and difficult. This is mainly reflected in the fact that there is often more than one gene for synthesizing a small molecule, and transferring these genes into the bacteria not only brings a large metabolic burden to the recipient bacteria, but also makes the whole system complicated and hard to predict. Second, small molecular substances are often easily transported across the membrane, which may make it possible that the bacteria that cannot correctly synthesize such a signal molecule (that is, the bacteria whose target gene is not normally expressed) obtains the same growth advantage as the bacteria that normally express the target gene. This invalidates the entire system.
Therefore, we hope that the signal conversion part of the system is as simple, efficient and leak-free as possible, which makes us think of transcription activators. These proteins tend to be of low molecular weight and are not normally transported extracellularly. It can promote the expression of downstream target genes by interacting with the transcription factors originally present in the cells, without the"

A Meet with Christopher Voigt
The iGEM Team TU Delft had the privilege of meeting Dr. Christopher Voigt, Associate Professor of Biological Engineering from MIT, Boston on September 2nd, 2013, in Delft. It was indeed a great honour to interact with Dr. Christopher as he was very keen to know about this year’s project by Team TU Delft.
The project ‘Peptidor’ was explained to him in detail along with the questions and queries we had in our mind, asking for his suggestions and views about them. The bacteria-versus-bacteria strategy is a hot research area, but it will surely take time in his opinion before it will be applied in practice. He suggested that a research area much closer to application is the use of bacteriophages. The application part of the project Peptidor which is the use of a ‘band-aid’ to cure MRSA was also explained to Christopher. In his view, such applications have a higher chance of being quickly approved by the FDA. This, since the engineered biological parts are only applied to the skin instead of digested or injected. The meeting also focused on the ‘Synthetic peptides’ engineered by Team TU Delft. Dr. Christopher found this a novel approach in a competition like iGEM.  The human practise-based Fluorescent microscopy ‘Do it yourself Kit’ by Team TU Delft was also one of the parts of the project which he found very innovative as it combines mechanical engineering with iGEM.
Finally he wished us best of luck with our journey ahead to the European jamboree, and invited us to visit his department if we qualify to go to Boston.

Mabel and Helen in the studio with Kat Orman!
We answered this by using the analogy of computer hardware: if your computer hard drive is broken, you can buy a new model from the shop without worrying about whether it will fit or not, and it's the same with stretches of DNA sequence that you can stick together. We were also asked about our outreach and the efforts we were making to change the mindset of a society that demands to be prescribed antibiotics.
Finally, Kat ended by asking if we thought we could change the world with our project. After a little nervous laughter, we gave our answer: hopefully! Our section begins 1hr 6mins into the 3 hour show. Click here to have a listen!
UNIQ Workshop
We met with 40 prospective Oxford students to teach them about Synthetic Biology. The students had in interest in Biochemistry but knew nothing about iGEM .
We hammered home the key message of Synthetic Biology - that we achieve more progress by expanding a registry of standardised biological parts - through a 15 minute introductory presentation on BioBrick s.
We then split them into groups and gave each one a mentor from our iGEM team. We worked through questions to test their understanding in a tutorial style and asked them to explain the constructs of previous iGEM teams. They finished by presenting their findings to each other.
See the handouts we gave the groups here . All the groups were given the Synthetic Biology page, and then one of the Group question pages.

We gave a presentation on ABR to a class of GCSE students from University Technical College, Oxfordshire (a local school specialising in science) at the Natural History Museum in Oxford, The Pitt Rivers Museum. This was to spread awareness of ABR to a younger age group, inspiring them with the potential applications of synthetic biology.
Our talk covered the discovery of antibiotics, the advantages of them (including their use in laboratory work), how they work, and how bacteria can evolve to gain resistance to them, as well as concepts such as horizontal gene transfer and the consequences of antibiotic resistance on our everyday lives. It also covered our project outline, and pros and cons of Solution, showing how it should help combat antibiotic resistance.

Model Project: We used mathematical modelling to pick the best Chlorite dismutase for our Perchlorate reductase. Our model page shows the full details. Modelling also informed the perchlorate concentration in the bioreactor, and the bioreactor size.
Demonstration: The following evidence showed that our parts worked. Firstly we needed to determine if the signal peptides native to A. oryzae, A. suillum, D. aromatica and N. defluvii were functional in E. coli. To do this we engineered GFP to contain the signal peptides from these proteins and performed cell fractionation and a Western blot to assess whether the proteins was present in the periplasm. This Western blot showed that 3 of the 4 signal peptides were functional in E. coli, with the exception of N. defluvii. Next we performed the same Western blot analysis to determine if Chlorite dismutase were expressed in E. coli as present in the periplasm. This showed that 3 of the 4 were present, again with the exception of N. defluvii . Finally we assayed the activity of the Chlorite dismutase using a Clark electrode and showed oxygen generation from all the Chlorite dismustases in the presence of chlorite with the exception of the enzyme derived from N defluvii.

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Design
We were inspired to create this project by the Tsinghua iGEM 2017 team. This team created a two part recognition system to recognize aflatoxin B1 in plants, using coordinately bound single chain variable fragment antibodies fused to either the activating domain or binding domain of Gal4 to mediate activation of pGal1 mediated reporter genes. We saw the development of this technology as an opportunity to create recognition systems for a number of toxins in plants, and therefore wanted to validate a similar experiment in plants. We have been working this year to increase the reporters and the ease with which our expression system can be modified using a series of interchangeable parts, and have just begun experiments to validate our plasmids/reporter constructs. To create the interchangeable parts, we created a gateway compatible multiple cloning site, into which we could clone in and out promoters and reporters in the PGWB1 and PGWB2 systems. We are testing our reporters without the use of toxin in Nicotiana benthamiana using agrobacterium mediated transient expression. We have completed making our system accessible to interchangeable promoters and transgenes, but still need to prove the efficacy of the reporters/promoters.
It is our hope that future plant biologists will be able to use the vector systems, reporters, and recognition devices we create."

Overview

Aiming to rationally design synthetic gene circuits with specific functions, we develop a software for automatic design which integrate methods including electrical engineering, stochastic simulation, and circuit performance analysis.
Given a truth table where the inputs and outputs take only 0/1 values by applying the standard procedure of electrical engineering to biology, we convert the truth table into Boolean Formula and use relevant algorithm to find corresponding digital circuit scheme which is as simple as possible in the sense of electrical engineering.
Appropriate biological structure of logic gates will be chosen from our database and embedded into the digital circuit. Among all these possible gene circuit designs, our software can recommend one or more most reliable circuits according to gene circuits’ fitness score which evaluates their complexity. Users can either accept the recommendation or choose any gene circuit they like. Meanwhile, the detailed biological structure will be screened for users’ reference.
Once a gene circuit is generated, our software will numerically simulate the stochastic time evolution of all the inputs and outputs.
If the simulation results correspond with the initial truth table, sensitivity analysis and optimization will be done to further maximize circuits’ practical realizablity, and robustness analysis will access their relative immunity to perturbations.
Finally, a thoroughly considered gene circuit will be generated by our software, available for wet-lab experiments.
Our software keeps the compatibility of various methods or algorithms and reserves the space for users to redesign. Moreover, our software adopts user-friendly GUI and visualize the designing process, which makes the operations much more convenient for users.
For more details, please read our User Guide .
Motivation
Since its inception over a decade ago, a series of remarkable progress have been made in the field of Synthetic Biology. As the design and testing cycles rely more on DNA synthesis and high-throughput assembly methods than on the traditional molecular cloning tools, workflow for a biological circuit engineer may no longer be limited by the pace of fabrication but instead by their ability to analyze circuit behavior in the near future. Therefore, our team adopts a workflow for biological circuit design with multiple-inputs-single-output and given functions in Boolean value. By discipline borrowed from electrical engineering and the analysis of connecting logic gates, our software is able"

To help them check the data from their software, the XMU team used xxxx and accompanied software to measure bacterial quantity and OD600. We designed our co-culture plan to inspect the impact of pH and salinity. The goal of the collaboration is to get the microbial growth curve in different salinity and different pH. We sent our data back to Imperial to analysis.
BGU_ISRAEL
The XMU-China also collaborated with BGU_ISRAEL to provide them the background of current solutions for plastic waste in China. They aimed to provide a more eco-friendly way to degrade PET in the aspect of synthetic biology. And to show the advantages of the new method, they want to see the traditional solutions to the plastic. So we would tell them some information about how we deal with plastic, to help them go further in their project. Also, we investigate public’s attitude towards the issue.
Questionnaire
We tried to connect with more teams, and we found it an efficient way to understand a project by questionnaire. So we spread many questionnaires from other teams like LMU-TUM_Munich , Paris_Saclay , Virginia and Evry . iGEM Peshawar spread our survey which was found in the Newsletter by them. They used their contacts and social media platforms to reach out to more people. Their effort helped us to collect the foreign response. As return for our helpful work, Paris_Saclay, Virginia and Evry gave their badges:
We also appreciate it that Cornell_NY gave us great assistance in giving away our questionnaire.
Lanzhou
We helped them test their system providing them with TEM image of the bacteria. If their system works, there will be an apparent metal ion peak and protein peak in TEM image, which means their project can really deal with the mercury ion in the media. Otherwise, the system needs to be improved. As return, Lanzhou helped us to construct a BioBrick, BBa_K1960450 . Somehow we failed to finish this part. During the communication between us, Lanzhou was so warm-hearted to offer assistance to us. The BioBrick from them helped us a lot.
Translation
We collaborated with others not only in project but also in human practice. To assist other teams with their human practice, we played out our Chinese-speaking advantages to provide dome translation. We helped METU HS Ankara translate iGEM experiment protocols into Chinese. Besides, we contributed the spread of surveys of Exeter , Pasteur_Paris and"

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"                         due to its organoleptic properties acquired during                         cooking. There are many varieties of semi-dwarf rice                         crops which are cultivated around the world. Hence,                         this particular variety is not a necessity from the                         nutritional point of view.
Environmental impact
Higher Yielding Varieties have the advantage of                         producing higher amount of grain in the same land                         extension. The outcome is that less land extension is                         needed to feed the same amount of population. If higher                         yielding biotech crops had not been available from 1996                         to 2011 thanks to the Green Revolution, an additional                         108.7 million hectares of farmland would have been                         needed to maintain global production levels (15). Land                         extension is a very valuable resource for the                         environment. On the other hand, these varieties need                         more chemical fertilizers, that can damage the soil. As                         they are more efficient, up to three rounds of                         cultivation and harvest can be made, deteriorating                         micronutrient content of the soil.
Socio-economic impact
Bomba rice is very popular in Spain for its use in the                         famous dish paella. Nowadays, this variety is expensive                         compared to others, but it is still considered the rice                         that should be used to properly cook paella. The                         increase of productivity while using less land and                         water can lower its price and spread its use, allowing                         more population to enjoy its organoleptic properties.                         This turns out to be a benefit for the farmer and for                         the consumer, who can find a quality product at a lower                         price. Additionally, a higher production makes it                         possible to export traditional and local Valencia rice                         around the world, extending a cultural dish. As a                         negative consequence, it is possible that less                         employees are needed for the cultivation of a crop that                         consumes less land extension. This can be counteracted                         by the jobs that can be created as a result of the                         increasing production.
4. Organoleptic Properties Improvement
Organoleptic properties constitute the overall                         appearance of a product: smell, touch, flavor...                         Undoubtedly, a better appearance means higher consumer                         acceptance and a significant reduction of food loss and                         waste due to slower ripening, for example (16). A 2015                         report published by FAO estimated that a 40-50% of                         global fruit is yearly wasted or lost (17).
The following scenario is set in China, the major world                         fuzzy kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) producer, with                         1.765.847 tons produced in 2013 ( 18"

Due to the NADP requirement of MerA, the cells are required to stay alive throughout this process, accounted for this with novel cell encapsulation technology that allows the cells to remain viable and at the same time not in direct contact..? Our system was tested in 3 different chassis: E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Shewanella, encapsulated and unencapsulated in the presence of either mercury chloride or methylmercury chloride and showed very promising results!

Heavy Metal Bioprecipitation
Click the operon to be linked to the phsABC part page!
The phsABC genes from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 encode thiosulfate reductase, which catalyzes the stoichiometric production of hydrogen sulfide and sulfite from thiosulfate for heavy metal removal by precipitation. Within a separate bacterium from that containing the mer operon construct, This system allows us to extend our heavy metal bioremediation device to be applicable to a wide range of heavy metals in addition to mercury in both ionic and organic form. The phsABC operon encodes three open reading frames (ORFs), designated phsA, phsB, and phsC. Based on sequence homology to formate dehydrogenase-N, it is predicted that thiosulfate reductase behaves in a similar fashion. The PhsA subunit is predicted to be a peripheral membrane protein active site bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) molybdenum (MGD) cofactor. PhsC is an integral membrane protein that anchors the other two subunits to the membrane, and contains the site for menaquinol oxidation and two heme cofactors located at opposite sides of the membrane. PhsB is predicted to possess four iron-sulfur centers that transfer electrons between PhsC and PhsA.  was shown to have the highest catalytic activity in the IPTG- inducible plasmid pSB74.

In iGEM 2016, we designed and created a novel BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter) inspired by blood glucose meter (BGM). The glucose oxidase (GOX) was used as an oxidoreductase to catalyze the oxidation of glucose in the electrochemical analyzer. In a similar way, the alcohol oxidase (AOX) is an oxidoreductase to catalyze the oxidation of alcohol and could be applied in the alcohol measurements. This year, we proved the concept by cloning genes, protein analysis, enzyme activity assay and electrochemical modeling.
For the BioBrick parts, we’ve created and submitted 11 new parts to the Registry including AOX genes [ BBa_K1991000 , BBa_K1991001 ], Lpp-OmpA (LO) genes [ BBa_K1991004 ] and LO-AOX [ BBa_K1991005 , BBa_K1991006 ] fusion protein genes as Basic Parts, as well as a constitutive promoter [ BBa_J23101 ]and RBS [ BBa_B0034 ]-driven LO fusion protein genes [ BBa_K1991002 , BBa_K1991003 , BBa_K1991007 , BBa_K1991008 , BBa_K1991009 , BBa_K1991010 ] as Composite Parts. We have demonstrated and collected all of these parts for the application of alcohol oxidase in the blood alcohol meter.

Both manuscripts were published on an online platform and on May 21st, 2016 all those who published manuscripts, as well as judges and editors, read, reviewed, and offered suggestions to improve the papers. We received a lot of very helpful feedback from other authors and judges. The feedback they offered made us work hard to find very specific answers to challenging questions, and some comments challenged the way we approached problems we were facing in the lab. After the conference we came back to our project with new perspectives, answers, ideas, and questions.
For our content and efforts in collaboration during the conference we were awarded badges in the following categories:

In late September we were contacted by the professionals in the synthetic biology field that we would be working with for editing of the papers.  The formatting and copy-editing process is underway, and the papers will both be published by late October.
Interviews
As an aspect of our collaborations with other teams, we participated in Rice University’s “Humans of SynBio” project. Based on the Humans of New York social media campaign, where pictures and stories of people are shared with the world.  This project allowed us to share our experiences in iGEM and as students participating in synthetic biology.  We talked to a member of their team over Skype and he asked questions about our experiences. Their team then posted a summary of our experiences as part of their campaign.
“I think the experience is not as much about the project as it is about personal development and about learning and getting to know the world of science and everything it involves.” - excerpt from article (Aug 28. 2016, Rice iGEM Facebook)
Along with being interviewed by the iGEM team at Rice University, members of our team were also interviewed by a Swiss university team out of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) that runs a website featuring iGEM news and interviews from iGEM teams and their members across the world.
The members interviewed were able to take an introspective look at the inner workings of the team, how far we’ve come, how we manage to work together and get along.  Two articles were written on the team: one based on the interview, and the second about the project more specifically.
Mentorship
Another part of our collaborations included mentoring a new team from Notre Dame Collegiate high school in High River, Alberta, Canada. Though"

Methods
Fluorometry
Triplicate of each sample were inoculated overnight in a deep-well 96 well plate. M9 minimal salt solution was used for the inoculation because it gives low background fluorescence.   1% and 2.5% (w/v) arabinose concentration was used for overnight induction. Samples were diluted around 10-fold the next day and regrown to mid-log phase (OD600=0.3 ~ 0.6). 200µl    of sample were drawn out from the deep-well plate and plated on a clear round bottom plate for measurement. For each sample, OD595 and Fluorescence was measured using    EnVision Multilabel Reader. The excitation wavelength was 485/14nm and the emission wavelength was 535/25nm. Conversion factor for OD595 to OD600 was obtained   by calculating the slope of the OD600 v.s. OD595 graph. The conversion factor, 1.24 was multiplied to OD595 reading to covert the measurements to   OD600. Background fluorescence was subtracted for each fluorescence measurement by making another standard Fluorescence v.s. OD600 graph. DH10B with    pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 was used to produce the standard curve. The corrected fluorescence was then divided by the corresponding    OD600. Finally the average and standard deviation were calculated.
PBAD Characterization
(Please note that the following data has been shown to be problematic because our new data do not match our old data. We will update the following information as soon as possible - HKUST iGEM 2015.23Jan2015)
Introduction
PBAD promoter is an arabinose inducible promoter. In nature, the promoter exist in the arabinose operon to regulate the transcription of araB, araA, and araD.    The arabinose operon or the ara operon encodes enzymes needed or the catabolism of arabinose to xylulose 5- phosphate which is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway   . The Pc promoter which is adjacent to the PBAD promoter transcribes the araC gene in the opposite direction. AraC protein is responsible to repress the activity of   the PBAD promoter when arabinose is absent. Once arabinose is present,the AraC protein binds to the arabinose and dimerize. The dimerize form of AraC-arabinose can   activate the PBAD promoter (Schleif, 2010"

13. Incubate both plates upside down at 37ºC for 14-18 hours.
Colony PCR Screening
The goal of this PCR is to take single colonies from transformation plates and to amplify the DNA in the positive control (ligated vector and insert) and negative control (vector only). After screening, gel electrophoresis will occur to determine whether or not the vector and insert ligated to each other successfully (do this by checking the base pair count).
1. After running a transformation, prepare a master mix (1x GoTaq Flexi Green Buffer, 0.15mM DNTP, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.63u GoTaq Polymerase, 0.38μM FWD primer, 0.38μM REV primer, and molecular water to a final volume of 10μL). Add an extra 20% uncertainty to each volume of reagent to ensure there is enough mastermix for all PCR tubes.
2. Make sure master mix is mixed using pipette. Then, put 20 uL of the master mix into each PCR tube.
3. Take out the transformation plates from the refrigerator. Also get a new LB-CAM plate (will be used to streak a single colony onto new plate).
4. Select a colony,  place a toothpick on it, and dab the same toothpick onto the new petri plate. Then use the same toothpick to inoculate a PCR reaction. Finish streaking the plate using a round-ended toothpick. Properly discard both toothpicks. Repeat until completed for all PCR tubes.
5. Centrifuge the PCR tubes. Then, set the thermocycler so that it has the correct settings (since each PCR reaction is different. Place the PCR tubes in a thermocycler, and start the reaction.
6. Incubate the new petri plate (with the streaks) upside down at 37ºC for 14-18 hours."

Note the double transformation scheme, which allows us to use the same trp- ura- dropout media for testing all transformations, even W303 yeast cells that lack synthetic constructs.  Also note that 1 and 2 have been included for all three.  They will be needed to show the
So, we will be doing the following transformations this week:
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
3. pRS304* + GliR reporter (Z0510)
4. GliR (Z0415) + pRS306
7. pRS304* + LexR reporter (Z0418)
8. LexR (Z0412) + pRS306
11. pRS304* + YY1R reporter (Z0511)
12. YY1R (Z0416) + pRS306
13. YY1R (Z0416) into [YY1A & YY1A Report]
14. GliR (Z0415) into [YY1A & YY1A Report]
15. ZifR (Z0421) into [YY1A & YY1A Report]
16. GliR (Z0415) into [GliA & GliA Report]
17. YY1R (Z0416) into [GliA & GliA Report]
18. ZifR (Z0421) into [GliA & GliA Report]
19. ZifR (Z0421) into [ZifA & ZifA Report]
20. YY1R (Z0416) into [ZifA & ZifA Report]
21. GliR (Z0415) into [ZifA & ZifA Report]
This will require 8 trp- ura- plates (not including an additional 2 plates for controls), as well as 9 triple dropout plates. This will also probably require growing two separate batches of W303 yeast cells for the transformations.  Since in the past we have managed to get enough cells for four transformations, we will likely need to double the recipe.
Plasmid DNA required:
pRS304* - x4 = 68 uL - do 100 uL
pRS306 - x5 = 85 uL - do 100 uL

What is Biohub 2.0?
Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval and more convenient biological ideas sharing. It is constructed on the basis of iGEM's official database. The parts inside are filtered and ordered intelligently, and presented to users in a friendly way. Users can grade the parts they've used, or post critical articles under them and exchange ideas with other users. All the data collected in the community will be used for more accurate ordering.
More than a community, Biohub 2.0 is also a flexible plugin system, which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform. Plugins will have full access to the community's data, so plugin developers can make further analysis of the parts. It's also welcome to deploy plugins that implement useful synthetic biological algorithms. With this mechanism, new tools and algorithms can be acquainted by other scientists more quickly.
BioSearch
BioSearch is a powerful search engine against Biobricks, with high performance and great accuracy. It's one of the core part of Biohub 2.0. You can access it via the search box on th top:
Just type anything you want to learn about a part and press Enter, in less than one second you will get the results:
The bricks are ordered by their qualities and creation date, which means you are always able to get the best and latest one to meet your need. The quality of bricks are ranked by several factors, including frequency of use, sample status, and assessments from users in forum, and so on. Each brick is displayed with a progress bar at the right bottom corner, which represents the relative ranking.
BioSearch supports multi-dimensional filtering. You can use `t:<type>` to limit the type of bricks:
or use `n:<part name>` to precisely locate a brick using its name:
or add an `h:` filter to mark out the matched words:
Multiple filters can also be combined to make complex query:
For each brick, Biohub will automatically fetch its relevant data from iGEM's offical website, and keep them updated. Biohub owns the same data as iGEM Parts Registry, but organizes and displays them"

Day 1 was mutiny. Five students had met with a sponsor in the morning and when the two captains returned to the room, the students were milling around, whispering under their breath, and fidgeting. The problem was with motivation towards the project, as some students felt that it wasn’t novel enough. We had found a 1998 paper by Duport et al. that explained how their team developed yeast to produce pregnenolone and progesterone - the things we wanted to make. It turns out though that the paper didn’t lead to anything, the strain has been lost, and it was a good proof of concept for our idea. From the uprising we learned to communicate thoroughly.

Our yeast strain is going to have all the genes to make progesterone, as well as the lactase enzyme so that we can feed it lactose and it break it down to glucose and galactose. We figured out after much deliberation how we could have our friends in developing nations get the accurate dose of progesterone. We learned from our mentor that we could use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container"

uOttawa,2013,Team:uOttawa#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"When we tested these strains in the IPTG and ATc gradient, we observed a very small range of cofactor concentrations that allowed for the temporal spike in sfGFP.
Click on the graph to expand
With tighter regulation of the rtTA activity, we would expect stronger negative regulation and thus tighter linearization of rtTA activity, however, this is not what is observed in our results. Here, we observe a more narrow window of cofactor concentrations that allow for the temporal pulse in sfGFP. This may have to do with the sequestering of the rtTA protein to its own promoter instead of the downstream promoters. As the rtTA is now effectively regulating the activity of all three promoters that are crucial to the function of the feedforward loop infrastructure, it makes sense that the regulation of its binding affinity must be more tightly controlled than in previous cases for successful function of the network.
Future directions
Now that we have determined that our incoherent feedforward loop is functional as expected and is able to produce a temporal Z (sfGFP) response, we will be able to test the fold-change capabilities of our synthetic network by regulating the concentration of the X (rtTA) stimulus over time.
Collaboration: Waterloo
This year, we had the opportunity to collaborate with the iGEM team from the University of Waterloo. We were asked to aid them in the construction of four large DNA constructs for their project, as illustrated  below:
In order to do so, the uOttawa iGEM Team designed a total of 36 primers for the uWaterloo team. Because many of the individual parts were very short, an experimental oligonucleotide-based synthesis method was used, in combination with a modified overlap extension PCR assembly method. A very detailed protocol was written for the uWaterloo team, and they were successfully able to construct their DNA constructs using our method.
In exchange for the construction aid, the uWaterloo team compiled a list of differential equations that were used to model our synthetic biological system. The equations were also implemented in MATLAB for us by the uWaterloo team. Thanks for the incredible help, Paul and the uWaterloo team! Learn more.
Collaboration: Purdue
In addition to our wet lab collaboration with Waterloo, we were also able to participate in the largest collaborative project in the history of iGEM, in partnership with Purdue University. Purdue contacted many iGEM teams across all corners of the world, and together we worked to propose a new characterization standard for the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Thanks for the invitation, Purdue! Learn more.
