Assumptions of This Model
At each enzyme, employing the Michaelis-Menten equation assumes the law of mass action, meaning all substrate that reaches the boundary at each enzyme is completely converted to product 5. In reality, product levels are expected to be slightly lower than predicted due to imperfect substrate-enzyme interactions.
Employing Fick’s law of diffusion assumes that a concentration gradient is the only force driving substrate motion in the system. In reality, charge interactions may create a substrate channelling effect, or substrate-enzyme repulsion, leading to increased or decreased true product yields when compared to the predicted data 8. Fick’s law also does not account for the shape of each molecule, and how angular momentum of each of the substrate may affect motion of the substrate between enzymes 9.
The distance between enzymes is assumed to be relatively constant as the reaction takes place. In reality, the enzymes may be moving rapidly and non-constantly, creating variation in the amount of product produced over a given time 9. By employing a constant distance model we are effectively taking an average of the distance between enzymes.
Simplifying the geometry to 2 dimensions, and a half sphere further assumes that diffusion would not be biased in any directional plane in the real system. This assumes an equal and opposite flux in the plane perpendicular to the plane of distance between enzymes.
Figure 3: Geometry of the model developed in MATLAB looking at diffusion.
Approximating the enzymes as spheres is the last assumption employed to simplify the system, the enzymes are approximated as spheres as opposed to points due to the size of the enzymes relative to the distance between them (either reference MD or reference trigonometric analysis). Additionally, the exact position of the active site of the enzyme is not considered in this case. This may have an effect on the accuracy of the model in cases where the active site of the enzyme is pointed away from the next enzyme in the reaction pathway 2.  A more realistic model would involve assigning the site of reaction (production or consumption) to be a point on each of the half-spheres. The point could then move over the surface of the half sphere, mimicking the changing orientation of the active site in a real enzyme reaction. This was not possible due to an inability to assign point-node boundary conditions on element meshes in MATLAB, however other more specialised software for solving finite element problems may be available to solve this problem.
Analysis and Results
The concentration of substrate reaching the sink over a 0.2 second time-frame was measured at multiple distances. The largest distance between enzymes was 1500 angstrom"

It doesn’t matter if you want something organized or you need somebody to juggle pelleus balls, you should contact Stefan. Also, when you’re not sure about any cloning or lab method you can rely on his creative advises. Even programming is not a problem to him. He keeps the lab tidy while being in a good mood, you will find him singing, clanging, terribly cursing and sometimes fooling around.
Thomas Juretschke
He’s the most eloquent person in our lab and though he tends to beating around the bush. When he is speaking Spanish, you can imagine him as a real “latin lover”. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to disturb his stoical good mood. That is especially advantageous when he comes to moderating our sessions and manages to calm down emotionally heated debates. And also his public activities are definitively worth mentioning - be it in public schools or on the streets .
Lisa Schäfer
If you have any questions concerning modeling or computers and if you have ideas for the homepage and want them to be realized, ask Lisa. She is the major IT-force of our team and will do her best in programming all the fancy and odd imaginations the team comes up with.
Advisors and Instructors
Hanna Wagner
When having questions about cloning - you should ask Hanna. Be sure, she will always have another strategy that will work with your plasmids! In performing Gibson cloning, she outstrips all of our attempts. It’s the greatest pleasure for her, when we report on successful experiments based on her advices. Furthermore, she is gifted with an extraordinary talent in painting unicorns .
Adrian Fischer
Count Adrian as an open ear for our laboratory and non-laboratory related problems. He is not only an expert in cell culture, but also a very empathetic person. He knows when it`s time to come clear and wake up the whole team. Here, his manner of speaking is worthwhile to mention. PUNKT! Next, we were always benefitting from his 24/7 attendance and would have been stranded if he hadn‘t been able to conjure some HEKs out of some unknown incubators…
Beate Kaufmann
Bea is also a former member of the iGEM team of 2010 . Thus, we always benefit from her experiences, especially when they differ from Adrian`s opinion.

Being a renowned worldwide competition, iGEM also emphasises the significance of the intellectual property rights. After some investigation, it was found that patent was still applicable in iGEM related products by fulfilling certain requirements. It is believed that intellectual property rights would indirectly affect the prospect of the synthetic biology.
The tri-stable switch has previously been worked on by Brown University iGEM team in 2006 and 2007. Although the team did not complete their circuit construction, the idea was originally theirs. Hence, we ventured on an investigation based on articles and interviews with experts regarding academic originality. Some sources mentioned that our team is able to patent the invention as long as nobody has previously filed a patent application. Moreover, some patents are only applicable in the scope of a specific area, depending on the country in which the invention has been filed. We therefore might be able to patent tri-stable switch since Brown University is located in different country. Nonetheless, the idea has long been published on their iGEM wiki page - a public domain, resulting the invention to lose its novelty.
Although the tri-stable switch is non-patentable, we can still patent the application of tri-stable switch as long as we have not uploaded or shared our application to a public domain. We however think that it is too early to do so as we have yet refined the complete designs for our application. Tri-stable switch has various applications, and beneficial functions are not just limited to biosensing. People can therefore develop tri-stable switch accordingly and claim rights when an appropriate application has been established.

Hello everyone, Here is the team of WHU-China!  Team WHU-China 2014 was born at the foot of the mount LuoJia, November 2013. The team is mainly formed by sophomore and junior of the college of life sciences, Wuhan University. Our team has a great tradition and this year is the third time to join in the competition. In our warm small group, both sophomore and junior work together. We hope that we can learn more knowledge of synthetic biology and get access to more experimental skills by ourselves during the competition. What is more important is that we can make a contribution to the society. Let us join hands to swim in the vast ocean of synthetic biology and find treasures one by one!
Haoyuan Sun, as the captain of the team, is devoted himself into the completion. From the establishment of the project, to undertake the whole experiment guideline, he is just like a glaring star in the night to guide us where to go ahead. In the iGEM team, he not only uses his knowledge to solve the problems, but also encourages us by his humor to get through the difficulties. Besides the iGEM, he is skilled in playing ball games and telling jokes.
Hi, I am Zheng Sun, In the team of iGEM, everyone can find his/her own place, and iGEM has different meanings to different people. As for me, iGEM provides me with a great chance to explore the field of synthetic biology and the way to go into the society to touch different people and handle series of things I have never met before. Thanks iGEM for giving me such a chance"

In a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are several key components: members of the public and trained scientists, collaborative discussion, and a topic closely related to genomic editing. The Museum of Life and Science has, over the many years it has been open, built a substantial network with the community and local scientists and thus can be an important asset in attracting a diversity of opinion to the forum. Duke, likewise, has a network with many biotechnology firms which can not only bring a unique business perspective of genomic editing, but also draw new community members (especially Duke students) more interested in hearing about the latest developments on the technologies. Combining our resources, we should be able to attract a diverse crowd and create a successful discussion."

Search the Database & Adapt
We knew we would be presenting to a group of individuals with varying levels of background knowledge; because of this, we wanted to include a presentation as a part of our outreach. However, we were unsure how to create an engaging presentation for a mixed experience audience. For inspiration we turned to the Database . During our search we found TUDelft's 2017 TEDX presentation. There was a video of one of their team members giving a presentation. Her presentation style, use of familiar personal stories and pop culture references, and level of sophistication when describing the team's project shaped how we approached our presentation. We modified the presentation time from 10 minutes to 25 minutes and integrated the subjects we felt would be most engaging based on our previous conversations with nursing home staff. We did not however, let the entire outreach event become a presentation. After reviewing several other teams’ projects, namely BostonU's 2016 Building with Biology event, it became evident that facilitating discussions can be an excellent way to increase engagement and promote mutual learning. We chose to make the second half of the program a guided discussion using questions adapted from our own Building with Biology Public Forum. This model allowed us to bring everyone up to speed on the science, while also giving the participants a chance to share with us what they knew and thought about synthetic biology. Reviewing these two past iGEM projects solidified our goal of  creating an interactive and educational program which encouraged participants to develop their own opinions about synthetic biology.
Implementation
On September 10th, we presented to 22 of the residents at WinsorMeade and on September 17th we presented to 25 of the residents of Williamsburg Landing. These visits were one hour, with 25 minutes for our formal presentations and 35 minutes for discussion. The participants were eager to ask questions and share their own opinions about synthetic biology. We had a diverse array of perspectives which made for an engaging and high energy forum. We are scheduled to give a 2 hour presentation for the Christopher Wren Association in Spring.
Reflect & Record
These events were an amazing hit with the residents! Both of our nursing home visits surpassed their scheduled time because residents chose to stay after the program to ask additional questions and continue the conversation. At Windsormeade in particular, several participants had done reading prior to the event and had come with specific stories to share and questions to ask based on their readings! Conversations ranged from the threats of bioengineered weapons, to the potential to cure"

Biosafety And Biosecurity
Biosafety and biosecurity are related, but not identical, concepts. Biosafety programs reduce or eliminate exposure of individuals and the environment to potentially hazardous biological agents. Biosafety is achieved by implementing various degrees of laboratory control and containment, through laboratory design and access restrictions, personnel expertise and training, use of containment equipment, and safe methods of managing infectious materials in a laboratory setting.
The objective of biosecurity is to prevent loss, theft or misuse of microorganisms, biological materials, and research-related information. This is accomplished by limiting access to facilities, research materials and information. While the objectives are different, biosafety and biosecurity measures are usually complementary. Biosafety and biosecurity programs share common components. Both are based upon risk assessment and management methodology; personnel expertise and responsibility; control and accountability for research materials including microorganisms and culture stocks; access control elements; material transfer documentation; training; emergency planning; and program management.
Biosafety and biosecurity program risk assessments are performed to determine the appropriate levels of controls within each program. Biosafety looks at appropriate laboratory procedures and practices necessary to prevent exposures and occupationally-acquired infections, while biosecurity addresses procedures and practices to ensure that biological materials and relevant sensitive information remain secure. [1]
Laboratory Practices Followed By Our Team
The laboratory supervisor must enforce the institutional policies that control access to the laboratory.
Persons must wash their hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics, and storing food for human consumption must not be permitted in laboratory areas. Food must be stored outside the laboratory area in cabinets or refrigerators designated and used for this purpose.
Mouth pipetting is prohibited; mechanical pipetting devices must be used.
Policies for the safe handling of sharps, such as needles, scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware must be developed and implemented. Whenever practical, laboratory supervisors should adopt improved engineering and work practice controls that reduce risk of sharps injuries. Precautions,"

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Presentation_-_-_TEXT.html," starch requires just this one enzyme. We proved that this BioBrick has some starch-degrading activity with an iodine assay: iodine turns starch black, so a halo around the bacteria means starch has been degraded.
[Discuss any advances in attaching cellulases to INP since this was written.]
[Slide: genetic instability]
Finally, we dealt with a serious objection raised by several people. The fully working system will require several copies of the INP gene in the construct, to fuse to the different cellulases. One worry is therefore the potential for genetic instability and recombination. However, we believe that in industry it will be possible to synthesise different versions of INP, which use synonymous codons to code for the same protein, while having different DNA sequences.
We wrote a software tool to assist in this process.
Society
We set out to answer two different questions:
Could a biorefinery plant using this technology be built and be economically viable?
Should we as a society proceed down this road?
[Slide: Process flow diagram]
To answer the first question, we constructed a process flow diagram, which is an engineering design tool illustrating how a biorefinery would be arranged in the real world. The PFD is not a definitive answer to what a biorefinery should look like but an articulation of how it might look. It shows biomass raw materials subjected to pre-treatment via fractionation and depolymerisation of lignocellulose and hemicellulose. After lignin is seperated it undergoes hydrous pyrolysis to convert it into phenols. Cellulose is separated and undergoes conversion into glucose. Finally glucose is converted here to sorbitol, but there is potential for conversion to other food and chemical products.
[Slide: Economics of Biorefineries]
Then we conducted an economic analysis of the biorefinery. While this analysis makes many assumptions, it shows that it is at least plausible that such a biorefinery could be economically viable. We estimated $2.5 million dollars of investment is required plus $4.5 million in production costs.
[Slide: Industry, Church, Academia, Politics]
To answer the question of whether we should build a biorefinery is even harder. But we conducted interviews with a number of figures involved in the debate around synthetic biology: people from business, academia, philosophy, environmental groups, politics, and the Church.
[Slide: Interviewees - names/pictures]
A number of key themes emerged.

Today's Procedure
Goksel, James and Mathew working on procedure

Add 600 ul fresh Sol.II
5 min RT then add 250 ul Sol III
Centrifuge for 20 mins
Put 1ml supernatant into new tube and add 600 ul Isopropanol
Spin for 15 min and aspirate
Add 500 ul 70% ethanol and spin for 5 min
Aspirate and speed vac resuspending in 50 ul water
Making up Solution II
The procedure states that Solution II should be made 'fresh' so we had to make it today and before we carried out the rest of the procedure. The solution is made up of the following:
2ml NaOH (1M)
1ml 10%SDS
7 ml water
Because the volumes and the molarities of the recipe were given and because the solutions of NaOH and SDS were made up already, there was no need for calculations.
Carrying out the rest of the procedure
James removing the supernatant from the Eppendorf tubes
Goksel discards the supernatant extracted from the freshly centrifuged tubes
The procedure demanded us to centrifuge 3ml (at least) of the 10 cultures. However the Eppendorf tubes that are placed into the centrifuge dont't have that capacity. So we pipetted 1.5ml of the 10 cultures into 10 Eppendorf tubes, spun them, removed the supernatant and added a further 1.5ml of the cultures to the 10 tubes.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," I have taken part in the wet lab portion of the research, in finding a means to decarboxylate napthenic acids via microbial modification. I am an active individual who enjoys getting involved in the community, and I am also fond of reading novels, swimming, hiking, travelling, and listening to music. Synthetic biology has always intrigued me, making iGEM a fascinating learning experience, and I have especially enjoyed the strong team aspect of the project.
Chris Wintersinger
I am a Biomedical Sciences major in the University of Calgary's Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I enjoy candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach, and balancing magnesium salt concentrations for creating PCR master mixes. When I'm not in the lab using glucose to repress transcription of S7 micrococcal nuclease, you will find me lusting after beat-up pickup trucks listed on the Internet, or using my Brownie Hawkeye box camera to take pictures that look like I smeared the lens with Vaseline. After I graduate from iGEM, I hope to pursue a career as a chimney sweep, door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, or failing those, perhaps a biomedical engineer.

Hi my name is Himika and I am a veteran iGEMer, I was on the Calgary team in 2010. This year I decided to rejoin the team. I recently graduated from Biomedical Sciences honours and will be starting a Masters degree in September 2013. In my free time I do martial arts and painting.
Iain George
This past year I completed my undergraduate degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology at the University of Calgary. Currently, I work in Dr. Howard Ceri's and Dr. Ray Turner's labs studying how bacterial biofilms can thrive and potentially be used to cleanup toxic environments.  My research has focused on how two species of Pseudomonas can interact with and possibly degrade naphthenic acids and biphenyl, while contending with heavy metal conditions. This fall I am beginning a Masters of Biology looking at how different genes in yeast are regulated.  This is my first year working with our iGem team and it has provided me the opportunity to mentor other students and learn valuable skills.  When I am not living in the lab I enjoy hiking in Alberta's amazing mountains and trying my hand at photography.

In order to confirm the limited concentration of Tryptophan, we did a macro experiment. We put Metarhizium in an L-Tryptophan concentration gradient Petrie dishes from 0.05% to 0.14%. with solid and liquid czapek. After six days of cultivation, it can be seen in the
following results:
We can see the ten photos that, in the solid czapek, the Metarhizium can stay alive at the L-Trp concentration of 0.09% or higher while it could not grow well or die at a lower concentration. We can also see that Metarhizium could not survive without L-Tryptophan.

We compared protein bands between BL21, the blank control and three groups transformed into different single plasmids, aiiA, ndh and gfp. These two gel pictures were got in two different days.  Data analysis:   The target proteins of pSB3T5-aiiA/BL21 and pSB4K5-ndh/BL21 should not be expressed because the promoter should be induced by AHL. The target proteins of pSB1C3-gfp-luxI/BL21 have been expressed but GFP was misfolded we suppose. However, the band marked in red was not the target band. Maybe it's the complex of AHL-LuxI.

We performed a SDS-PAGE comparing expression of double plasmids, gfp and aiiA, and two corresponding single plasmids. What's more, we wanted to find more details about band which possibly is the misfolded gfp.  Data analysis:   The band marked in red disappeared is pSB1C3-gfp-luxI/BL21.The LuxR, GFP and AiiA  are the same of size (marked in yellow). However the band of AiiA was not clear. Many target proteins were misfolded. Therefore the culture condition should be optimized.

Are you hungry?
The experiments with our glucose-sensitive construction were carried out by three different ways: (1) containing only glucose as a carbon source, (2) containing galactose as an extra carbon source and (3) containing sodium acetate as an extra carbon source, since we checked in previous tests that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth.  All tubes had, in addition to the glucose gradation, also IPTG (see information on the molecular mechanism ). For fluorescence intensity (FI) measures cell growth, i.e. OD600, was taken into account. We worked with a 0D600 close to 0.1 in order to be able to use high sensitivity in the fluorimeter.
As you can see in the graphs below, the less glucose you have, the more fluorescence you get. And this results replicate well when galactose (Figure 2) or sodium acetate (Figure 3) were added to the medium as supplementary carbon sources. The threshold for a boost in the fluorescence intensity seems to be 0.1 g/L of glucose, since from this concentration the values get really high. Normal values are 10 g/L, and we got the best results when we added 10-4 glucose concentration of that of the canonical values.

culture (OD) for differents amounts of glucose present in the medium.

UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Towards Optimization of DT-HT Binding.
Profound understanding of the natural HT and DT binding could be analyzed by measuring the binding activities in different pH concentration. This could serve as potential basis for prediction models of environment that supports the interaction. Principles of measuring the activities are the same as previous one. Triplicates are subjected to different pH solution, ranging from 4-8.5, during an hour incubation prior to elution (Table 4). The used concentration of DT in this assay was 180 nM (as it referred to maximum binding of DT concentration towards HT in 250C).
Table 4. Net OD600 (minus blank: elution buffer) results of DT-HT binding in different extracellular pH. Triplicates were conducted to minimize bias effect of absorbance index.
Figure 15. This clustered column represents amount of spheroplasts remained in the eluent buffer after washing in different pH solution. Triplicates with standard bar errors indicate any data bias optimized as samples. Different alphabetic indexes top of the column express data significances, such as a-b (p<0.05), a-c (p<0.05), and b-c (p<0.01).
Optimal pH for the binding interaction occurs at 7 to 7.5 (Figure 15). This is exactly the physiological pH condition inside human body. Significant drop of binding activity observed at pH 5.5 could indicate early spheroplast autolysis, since it triggers intracellular cascade of lysis protein according to Raam R, et al.  Therefore, lab models of binding HT-DT could be conducted optimally within pH range of 7 to 7.5.

The standard curve obtained for percent ATP-to-ADP conversion from luminescence data is shown in Figure 16. With this standard curve, we can estimate how much ATP is converted into ADP (or how much ATP is conserved in HT-DT reaction compared to normal) based on given luminescence data later in the experiment.

After reading and analyzing the two replies, we listed three questions below :
 
1. Why not just ingest sugar directly instead of complexing the solution by creating Genetically Modified bacteria? 
 
2. What if people won’t absorb any sugar they eat? Does that mean we can have sugar as much as we want? 
 
3. if the quantity of consuming sugar is uncontrollably rising, won’t it cause any sugarcane-farmer exploitations?

Visit to Chung Mei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
Introduction
Chung Mei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has a long history in medical production and marketing. Established in 1926, Chung Mei provides several medical drugs for patients or sub-healthy people. Ｍore specifically, its services includes a wide range of over-the-counter medicines and consumer healthcare products.
Motivation
During our last time’s meet-up with Doctor Zhu in (FIRDI), we discussed our design of modeling with him . However, the main research in FIRDI is about upstream technology and he is not proficient in the design of products, so he suggested that we may get what we need from medicine producers. With contacts and preparations, we successfully paid a visit to the CEO Lin and the manager in Chung Mei.
Highlights
We should choose the lactobacillus which is low colonization rate, thus we do not need to add suicide circuit to our lactobacillus. 
It is important that choosing the good food additions for lactobacillus.
We need to make sure that our product is acid proof but will melt in our  intestine.
Conclusion
After having discussion with the CHUNG  MEI’s CEO Mr. Lin, we thought that is too hard to model our product. Therefore, we will not temporally take modeling into consideration. Furthermore, they also gave us some useful ideas. we can choose the low colonization rate lactobacillus and every kind of bacterium likes different parts of intestine, so we have to focus on whether our lactobacillus grow up at the front part of the intestine. To sum up, we can sure that our lactobacillus can absorb the maximum amount of sugar.
Market Analysis
 
Since there are also many products used to lose weight, we search it on the internet and use the table to compare the differences between the medicine(Only two kinds of medicine, orlistat and lorcaserin, were allowed by government"

Introduction
Since the system we design is used for synthesis of polyketones, it is necessary to ensure the supply of various substrates. As a typical substrate of diversified polyketones, propionyl-CoA is needed to reach the level of enough concentration. Thus, we knock out some pathways in E.coli to increase the concentration of propionyl-CoA. Moreover, we enhance the pathways that convert propionate into propionyl-CoA. By the way, sfp gene is also integrated into BL21 (DE3), and BAP1 is achieved after all of these modification.
Design
In E.coli, propionate is converted into propionyl-CoA and then utilized for metabolism with the steps catalyzed by proteins of the prp locus. Specifically, PrpE is in charge of the converting part, and PrpRBCD utilize propionyl-CoA as a metabolic substrate. Therefore, we delete prpRBCD genes in order that the ability of E.coli to utilize propionate as a carbon and energy source was eliminated. However, propionyl-CoA can only be produced through the converting reaction, so the prpE gene was placed under control of an IPTG-inducible T7 promoter.
By the way, using homologous recombination, a single copy of the sfp gene under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter was integrated in the prp operon of BL21(DE3), yielding E. coli BAP1.
The sfp gene product, which is part of the surfactin biosynthetic gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis, can effectively modify ACPs from all PK"

Bristol BSim Modeling
Having met some members of the Bristol team at Newcastle's iGEM workshop earlier in the summer, we became interested in each other's project, and especially in Bristol's BSim Modeling software. From that point onwards, we decided to set up a collaboration between the two teams. We can conclude that it was a successful, win-win collaboration in every aspect.
BCCS-Bristol and in particular Neeraj Oak and Tom Todd, were in very close collaboration with our Modelling & Medals Criteria Champion Elena Pallari, for the establishment of a fruitful co-operation. This multidisciplinary collaboration between team members of both teams emphasises the spirit of iGEM 2010. The model did work with some amazing video simulations of our genetic circuit based on the mathematical equations using the BSim software. A big THANK you from the UCL iGEM team 2010 to the BCCS-Bristol iGEM team 2010. Click on the following link to understand more about how the BSim modelling program works Bristol BSim

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the bioreactor into each of three microcentrifuge tubes.
Spin down tubes for 5 minutes at 8000 g.
Dilute each tube by transferring 200µL of the supernatant to 1800 µL of water in a new microcentrifuge tube.
Measure the methanol concentration using the YSI machine (in g/L).
On the first bioreactor run, the concentration of methanol decreased over time, and the readings were accurate. Methanol is a volatile liquid, so we expect the concentration to decrease until it reaches its equilibrium with the vapor state, which can be seen on the graph. On the second bioreactor run, however, the measurements were widely inconsistent. Machine calibration, measurement techniques, or a combination of various other factors could have caused the error, but sources are undetermined. We do see the methanol concentration reaching a lower equilibrium, but with the lack of precision and multiple trials, this data set is ultimately inconclusive.
Conclusions and Future Plans
Conclusion:
The data gathered from our various tests suggest that our fructose construct could be functional. Unfortunately, due to our inability to properly measure methanol concentration over time, we cannot definitively prove that methanol is being degraded. However, since cells with our construct post induction grew faster under methanol exposure than their uninduced counterparts, there is a high possibility that our transformed cells are metabolizing methanol and using it as an energy source. This would explain why induction results in an increased growth rate in the presence of methanol. Additionally, the simulated landfill gas scenario shows that our fructose construct is viable enough to survive in the conditions associated with a landfill environment. When compiled together, all of this data suggests that our fructose construct could be implemented into a landfill environment along with a construct expressing sMMO in order to assist in the metabolization of methane to carbon dioxide.
Future plans
There are a lot of potential avenues for this project in future years. First and foremost on our list of future plans is to complete all of the plasmids we set out to construct at the beginning of the summer. This would include finishing the sMMO plasmid as well as touching up the GroESL plasmid through several mutagenesis reactions. Upon the completion of all desired constructs we would run another set of even more rigorous tests on each individual construct. Specifically, we plan to definitively prove expression of all enzymes in each pathway with SDS-PAGE. This time around, we may plan on using constructs with proteins with affinity tags for purification. Running purified gels will increase the likelihood"

METU_Turkey,2013,Team:METU Turkey#safety.html_-_-_TEXT.html," decided to work on are presented to many people in the area in order to see if they are of any concern for the biosafety regulations. All the procedures that are used in the lab are also approved procedures that are used by these people mentioned above.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
We believe using specific strains designed specifically for labwork will be safer. It is possible to genetically modify the organisms so that, they are not able to grow outside the lab environment. There probably is not a way to build some biobricks that can be modified in order to make them safer since their function will be the cause of safety issues.
 
EVEN MORE QUESTIONS! (Thanks to iGEM ATOMS Turkiye)
 
Questions?
1) When you change the genetic information of bacteria in bees’ guts this may have the possibility of changing the genetic material of most bacterial flora. Have you thought about a possible solution to this?
 
2) Will this change effect the bees honey production and so affect humans and animals health?
 
3) How will you manage the amount of Coumaric Acid produced?
 
4) Will Coumaric Acid affect the plants which the bees touch?
 
 
 
Answers!
1) We will introduce our gene construct to the bacteria before hand and then introduce it to the host bee via food (a process called paratransgenesis), so it is highly unlikely for the other bacteria to get this part. Also, our system is optimized for B. subtilis, the promoters we used and the products as a whole have slim to no chance of functioning anywhere else.
 
2) The bacillus strain we selected is native to the bees' gut. It is normally not found in the honey stomach of the bee, even if the bacteria were to get into honey, it will still be in the natural levels. Other than that, according to literature, IPTG is never traced in honey, so our little germs, even if they can make it into honey, will be killed because of our kill switch.
 
3) There is actually no real data about the p-coumaric acid levels let alone it is not known if such a thing as p-coumaric acid overdose exists. We used in our system a constitutive promoter for the production of it too. What we expect and what we could argue from literature is that having p-coumaric acid is in all cases preferable. Maybe"

\[   \textrm{percent change in OD}=\frac{(C_{avg}(t)-C_{avg}(0)) 100}{C_{avg}(0)} \]
Note that this operation will only shift the curves down to zero and will scale them up. Using this formula, the following curves are obtained.
Figure: Percent of initial OD as function of time
These are indeed similar to the ones we obtained in our spectrophotometeric experiments. These curves, though obtained numerically, can be used to fit to the data and obtain estimates of particle sizes and the diffusion coefficient.

Safety Considerations of Our Biobrick parts and Our Project
In this section, we are going to answer safety question 2 in detail, taking the potential risk in the future into concern.
The main safety challenge we must face is that as a practical bacteria therapy our direction is, we shall demonstrate that the “E. coslim” will not harm its host when it is developed completely. As few experiments we can do in such limited time, we have done a series of theoretical work to solve problems in this field.               Intestine-colonized pathogenic E. coli may cause immune responses, following by diarrhea, inflammation and fever (although the strain we use is considered non-pathogen). Thus we plan to transplant the whole synthetic system to another organism (for example, Bacillus subtilis, has proved safe in human intestine). We know that it is hard as the two organisms are very different on transcriptional mechanisms, but we believe the work of establishing model system (that is what we are doing) in E. coli will make it easier. Also, as the rapid development of synthetic biology and gut microbiology, we hope in the near future, we can modify the genome of E. coli to change it a safe intestine microbe.
Another risk is that when the engineered bacteria get higher efficiency on energy production, they could proliferate out of control. To forestall this situation, we design a “death” device (for more information, click on Death ) using D-xylose as inducer. It means if you want to stop weight losing, what you have"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#development of new methods_-_-_TEXT.html," UBP retention in vivo, in vitro replication and PCR experiments, it is mandatory to have a reliable method for UBP detection. In most cases, scientists working with unnatural bases have to develop their own methods specifically suitable for the detection of the very unnatural bases they are working with. Unfortunately, these methods often come along with unfavorable circumstances.
One method commonly applied is the usage of molecular beacons, as described by Johnson et al., 2004 for the detection if isoG and isoCm in PCR experiments. This is a quite circumstantial and expensive method, as for every ssDNA sample, an individual fluorescence labeled, specific oligonucleotide containing the unnatural nucleotide complementary to the one which should be investigated is needed. Additionally, the influence of the analyzed unnatural bases on the annealing temperature has to be investigated previously, to prevent unspecific hybridization from influencing the analysis results. A different method used primarily for UBP retention analysis is the biotin shift assay (Zhang et al., 2017). In this approach, a DNA sample is used as a template in a PCR reaction with biotin-labeled nucleotide triphosphates of one of the unnatural bases. Through specific interaction with streptavidine after amplification, molecules containing these labeled nucleotides are shifted upwards in comparison to DNA molecules of the same length in subsequent PAGE analysis. The use of specially labeled variants of the analyzed unnatural bases is generally not recommended, as even small structural changes might have a great impact on the interaction with other biomolecules and could lead to falsified experiment results. In addition, the necessity of a PCR amplification for UBP detection is disadvantageous too, as the proportion of DNA molecules with sustained and lost UBPs might be greatly impacted, particularly - but not exclusively - due to influences of the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates on the PCR reaction.
Analysis of DNA containing isoG and isoCm with the Mutation Analysis Xplorer
Primer annealing
To test the best annealing efficiency, we applied three different annealing methods.
HEPES annealing
1x Composite Buffer annealing
Aqua annealing
We designed five ssDNA pairs with different bases at position 40. Each of the natural bases A, T, G, and C will lead to a recognition sequence of one of the restriction enzymes EciI, BsaI, SapI and MnlI. We postulate that non of these restriction enzymes will recognize their respective recognition sequences if the basepair between isoG and isoCm is present at this position.              For good"

Postcard-Collaboration
This year our team had a great opportunity to participate in the postcard exchange campaign initiated by the iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf. Without missing a chance to spread the word about our team’s project and iGEM goes green, we decided to incorporate our enthusiasm coupled with creative imagination to design even two postcards for our team. Our team's postcard with information about the project and a postcard with information about iGEM goes green.
After iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf had taken care of distributing each team's masterpieces all over Europe, we were thrilled to receive from them a package of postcards created by the other 26 European iGEM teams and made sure once more that we took part in a really rewarding and valuable collaboration!
Learning about other iGEM teams’ fascinating projects, we joyfully decorated the main working point of our team with freshly received one-of-a-kind postcards and decided to share them among as many people as possible. Newly arrived TU Dresden students from different corners of the world were happy to find their postcards in the welcoming bags presented them by our university. Moreover, the postcards were shared by our team members with people coming from different backgrounds in their neighborhoods and local university communities.
We would like to thank iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf for the organisation of this campaign and every iGEM team for their participation, creation of amazing postcards and willingness to increase public awareness about iGEM.
Synthetic biology is worth spreading and we are happy that iGEM provides us with the opportunity to do so!

BBa_K2127001 (Pcpc560): http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2127001
Cyanobacteria is not optimal system to manipulate the protein expression mainly due of the lack of strong promoters. Pcpc560 is a Cyanobacterial super promoter discovered by Dr. Ma’s team that contains two predicted promoters 14 predicted transcription binding site.  Using the Pcpc560, Dr. Ma’s team demonstrated that functional protein were produced at 15% of the total protein production. Our team decided to test the effect protein production in E.Coli cells DH5α using the 14 predicted transcription binding site from Pcpc560. We believe that 14 sequential binding sites from Pcpc560 will allow us to increase the protein function production greatly using the E.Coli DH5α. We have constructed the 14 transcription binding followed by an strong RBS (BBa_B0030), followed by mutant HIS-Tag psbB. The super promoter can be an valuable asset to other iGEM teams for protein production and therefore we have decided to submit the Construct along with 14 Transcription binding site from Pcpc560.

The psbB gene codes for the CP-47 subunit of the Cyanobacterial Photosystem II in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Using site-directed Mutagenesis Dr Frankel’s team developed a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant containing a histidine tag at the C-Terminus of CP47 subunit. Using the His-Tag we isolated the Photosystem II complex and analyzed the activity using the electron evolution analyzer. Photosystem II purification with high activity highlighted that CP-47 with HIS-Tag at C-terminus can made into BioBricks. We are submitting psbB gene as a BioBrick to claim Silver Medal.

Uros Kuzmanovic
My name's Uros Kuzmanovic, a Junior studying Molecular and Cellular Biology. This is my first year at iGEM where I seek to not only learn the applications and procedures of synthetic biology, but also collaborate with bright individuals to design a novel project. This blurb feels too impersonal to state something personal, but something too impersonal would be uninformative, quite the conundrum. If I could, I would sit down and have coffee with you. All the best!
Adi Malik
Adi is a Junior in Bioengineering, and the Corporate Director of this year's iGEM team. He joined iGEM because of a deep interest in biotechnology, genetics and engineering. He also has an interest in business and entrepreneurship, and is spearheading the effort in this year's entrepreneurship division. All in all, he believes iGEM provides a unique opportunity to develop something, with fellow undergraduates, that can have a tangible, positive impact on the world of synthetic biology. Aside from iGEM, Adi is an undergraduate researcher and consultant with Illinois Business Consulting. He enjoys playing the guitar, running, playing basketball and figuring out creative ways to waste time.
Isiah Ramos
Isiah Ramos attended highschool at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora, IL. He is the Lab manager of the 2012 Illinois iGEM team. His major is Agricultural and Biological Engineering, and he intends to focus on Nanotechnology. He hopes to one day research genetics in order to understand genetic disorders and how to treat them
Cara Schornak
Cara Schornak, a freshman in MCBH, is excited to be on the 2012 Illinois iGEM team. She hails from the St. Louis, MO area, and is proud to bring her own diversity to the team. Cara first became interested in biology in general when she was a freshman in high school. She was inspired by the Punnett Square’s ability to predict the phenotype of the offspring of two individuals and was later drawn to epigenetics through a NOVA science episode. The field of synthetic biology also intrigued her after she heard about J. Craig Venter’s work in California and his tenacious work ethic. Cara worked for approximately two years at Washington University in St. Louis as a laboratory assistant in Dr. Doug Chalker’s lab. There she met her greatest inspiration, a Mr. Scott Horrell, who became her mentor and adviser. Horrell encouraged her to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"

Historical background
Richard Roberts and Jack Szostak from Harvard developed this technique in 1997. They were able to generate and identify a myc epitope starting from a random mRNA library using this technique (Roberts).
What is it?
mRNA display is a technique used to select for proteins that bind to specific targets. It allows for the identification of these selected proteins because they are covalently attached to the DNA that codes for them (Roberts).
Overview of mRNA display (Liu)
How does it work?
A library of DNA sequence variants is generated using error prone PCR or PCR with variable primers.
The DNA library is transcribed in vitro to an RNA library.
Using a DNA splint, RNA strands are ligated to single stranded DNA oligonucleotides with puromycin at the 3' end
The RNA-puromycin fusions are then translated in vitro
The Puromycin mimics a tRNA and is incorporated into the A site of the ribosome. However  the puromycin has a non hydrolizable amide bond, therefore terminating translation and releasing  the polypeptide, which is still bound to the RNA template through the puromycin. This results in a library of proteins covalently bonded to the RNA that coded for them.
In order to create a more stable structure, the RNA is converted to a DNA-RNA duplex through in vitro reverse transcription.
The library is screened for the protein that best binds to the target molecule.
Identification of the protein will be simple, as the corresponding DNA strand is still attached to it. PCR of the DNA followed by sequencing yields the exact identity of the protein at the DNA level.
What does the Mtd have to do with mRNA display?
The Mtd protein is the scaffold for our mRNA display experiment. Most proteins are not capable of undergoing the large number of mutations necessary to create a large"

Abstract
Is genetically modified food safe or not? Is genetic engineering or synthetic biology a horrible weapon? What would the world be if we insist on modifying the genetic material of our fellow organisms? Being the species that has made more changes to earth than any other form of life means a lot of duty. Greater ability brings forth the need for further responsibility. We, human beings, must think over what we are doing. Here comes the necessity for human practice.Our work on human practice can be concluded into 3 parts. First, leaving more people with the impression that synthetic biology is not equal to Resident Evil. It’s not only a question of making synthetic biology known to the world; it’s a human right for every person to know what is really going on. As iGEMers, we have the duty to make iGEM known and eliminate misunderstandings about the subject. We have held a number of activities, lectures and camps aimed at children and young adults during the last summer vacation about iGEM and synthetic biology.Second, learning more about lab safety when coming to genetic engineering and paying close attention to safety when do experiments. For this reason, we studied safety on iGEM safety page, searched from the internet and consulted professors. This summer, we contacted QIBEBT and learned how to regulate a molecular lab. Third, reflecting on our humanistic sensibilities. Our final goal is to protect the environment and make a better future through our own hands. We must do experiments environmentally friendly. Synthetic biology is a subject that can modify genes and change the world. We must value all the living things on the earth and treat them with respect.

I. Detection of C4-HSL in Aeromonas Hydrophila Culture
We cultured A. hydrophila to reach OD600 value of 0.11 (1.5*106 CFU / ml), which is the concentration of pathogen in fish feces when there is potential infection. By using the methods described in Experiments , we measured the concentration of C4-HSL in the culture by HPLC/MS/MS. Firstly, the standard solutions of 50, 150, 300, and 500 ppb of C4-HSL (analytically pure) were tested. The result of 50 ppb standard solution is shown in Fig 1. The figure indicates that the peak of C4-HSL daughter ion with m/z ratio of 102 appears within 1.0 to 1.6 min, and the area of the peak is 4723.699. The peak areas of 150, 300, and 500 ppb standard solutions are 16212.57, 32284.286, and 52014.63 respectively.
Fig 1. HPLC/MS result of 50 ppb pure C4-HSL sample
We plotted the peak areas of standard solutions and found the line of best fit which describes the relationship between peak area and C4-HSL concentration. The derived equation is:
Fig 2. Relationship between peak area and C4-HSL concentration
Then, we tested the concentration of C4-HSL in the supernatant of A. hydrophila culture, and the result is shown in Fig 2. The area of C4-HSL peak within 1.0 to 1.6 min is 1272.754. Therefore, the concentration of C4-HSL in A. hydrophila culture can be calculated by:

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"1. The Gal1 and GFP fusion.
Cup1-GFP
This biobrick is a fusion of the Cup1 promoter and GFP protein. Cup1 is a eukaryotic promoter; the presence of Cu2+ induces it. The fusion allows the strength of the promoter to be quantized in the presence of varying concentrations of copper ions using the fluorescence of the GFP.
Figure 1. The Cup1 and GFP fusion.
Gal1-CFP NSC
This biobrick is a fusion of the Gal1,10 promoter, Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), and the chaperone protein Hsp104.

This biobrick is a fusion of the Gal1,10 promoter, Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), and the chaperone protein Hsp104 with a premature stop codon introduced at position 1.

Hsp104-Gal1
The purpose of our gene retention experiments was to observe the retention of our plasmid by the yeast cells. We used GFP-tagged Hsp104 under the influence of different promoters to study the plasmid retention. A low copy number plasmid was used to more accurately study the partitioning of plasmids into daughter cells. It was also important that we use the same plasmid as our working prototype so that the findings from this experiment could be directly applied to our other data.
This construct is the same one used in the prototype (NSC); this experiment was a positive control to show the normal retention of our construct by cells.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," whether it be on the urinary tract, the lungs of a cystic fibrosis patient or the various plants and pipelines for aquaculture. And such an environment also serves as a hide-out: there is currently no commercial antibiotic that specifically targets bacterial biofilms.
It's time to start a war on bacterial biofilms and, with the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains, a completely novel approach is essential.
This is where synthetic biology and the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition join the story. Synthetic biology is about harnessing the tools that evolution has already developed for us. All we need to add is a little imagination!
THE ENGINEER'S RATIONALISATION OF LIFE
""This isn't a fantasy look at the future. We are doing the future""
Craig Venter
Synthetic biology takes the processes designed by nature and categorises them into standardised systems, allowing bacteria to be designed, built and tested, like how you would build a car.
It's about combining the skills of an engineer and engineering principles with molecular biologists and systems biology thinking. The nature of synthetic biology is interdisciplinary, drawing on a number of scientific fields to provide engineering solutions to some of our biggest problems.
It's about appreciating the complexity of living systems and then sorting them into useable parts, parts that can be built back up into new and exciting tools - tools that will rid of pollution, enhance food production, produce energy, do the housework and, in our iGEM project, destroy biofilms, kill pathogenic bacteria and provide a novel approach to treating microbial infections.
It's about selecting a feature of an organism, identifying its DNA, cataloging it and engineering it into a biological chassis. The approach is beautifully simple: the designs of biology applied to the logic of engineering and then put back into nature.
It's about a lot more than bacteria. Synthetic biology is the engineer's rationalisation of life: where we once aimed just to explain the world, synthetic biology now gives us the capacity to improve it.
HELLO WORLD!
Welcome! We are the 2015 Oxford iGEM team.
What's iGEM all about?
iGEM is a socially-driven research competition in the field of synthetic biology. Participating teams of undergraduates from all over the world work throughout the summer with the aim of using synthetic biology to create solutions to major social or environmental problems. As such, the competition is just as much about ""beyond the lab"" work in the form of outreach and human practices as it's about the actual technology derived from our lab research. A summer of hard work culminated in"

Data Sheet App
The 2012 BostonU team began working on a standardized data sheet to document and present relevant information and data for Parts.
This year, we decided to expand upon last year’s data sheet by collaborating with the Purdue Biomakers iGEM Team .  Purdue contacted many iGEM teams around the world and asked them for their input on the content to include on the data sheet.  After talking with the Purdue team and our computational mentors, Jenhan Tao and Evan Appleton, we decided upon what data to include in the app and designed the format of the data sheet based on last year’s prototype and the results from Purdue’s surveys. We determined two types of data sheets - one for Basic Parts and the other for Composite Parts - and below shows our vision for the final products.
Basic Part Data Sheet
Composite Part Data Sheet
We plan to make a web-based application that will allow the user to input information about their part, experimental methods, and results, including images and hyperlinks.  The web app will compile all of that data and results into an HTML file for the data sheet.

Docking of Monomeric and Homodimeric Griffithsin
Protein-Ligand Docking overview
Docking is a molecular modeling method used to predict the interactions between proteins and small molecule ligands. After predicting the thermostability of GRFT variants using YASARA, we must make sure our thermoengineered structures retain their biological activity. Although we preserved the binding loops of the two proteins, we will determine the binding activity of our proteins by comparing the locations and relatives stabilities of small molecule docking of the normal and engineered variants. Through the use of ZDOCK, a docking software platform used to predict the top 20,000 interactions between small molecules and proteins, we will create structures used for quantitative and qualitative analysis. We predict the thermostable variants will have the same topology of binding to Gp120 and HIV/Zika antibodies since only a few amino acids in the non-binding loop region were altered.
The docking of gp120, a viral glycoprotein formed once the protease of a host cell processes the HIV 1 envelope, will be useful in understanding how to construct the lateral flow assay using GRFT. Since gp120 will be the analyte of interest, useful in immobilizing blood cells infected with HIV, we must ensure that our engineered variants readily bind to gp120 and the specific HIV and Zika antibodies.

The red light signal transduction pathway is supposedly also an osmolarity sensor, mainly dependent on aspartate [ 7 ] concentration, a substance which is present in LB as well as other common media for E. coli. Hence a strain with EnvZ knockout is desireable. For this, the strain CP919 ( BBa_V1012 ) can be used.
CP919 has a kanamycin insertion mutation into the EnvZ genomic region, therefore no kanamycin vectors can be used. Furthermore, in CP919 an additional genomic fusion of ompC-lacZ is present, which makes the usage of a lacZ reporter inappropriate in our AND-Gate system.[ 3 ]
For testing our construct in CP919 we therefore use the GFP reporter part BBa_I746907 , which we subsequently cloned into the low copy origin of replication vector pSB6A1 . As both plasmids need to be electroporated into the same cells, two different origins of replications and antibiotica resistances have to be choosen.
The desired bacteria for our final system is the heat resistant E. coli strain BH28, in which we aim to insert a knock-out in the EnvZ genomic region in a last step.

Changing points in our Project
Monday, May 30th
Meeting with Dr. Dalton:
Contact 3M for hollow microneedles, look at patents
If he can find his microneedles he will give it to us
Would have to consider shear stress, what if microneedles break off and go into the body
Utah array - solid microneedle
Lab on a chip - chips and tips
Perhaps make microneedle system separate with valve
Issues:
In microfluidic systems are bubbles - bubble will block channels
LB chamber, what’s stopping the fluid from flowing directly out the microneedles? Perhaps use a mechanical system to control pressure, could also suck the media back in
Diffusion would be way too slow or not even occur, would need an external syringe pump
Leaving microneedles in for too long will cause immune response from body, wound infections
Need to determine how much pressure the membrane can take
Consider stress on microneedles, fact that skin is very mobile
Skin elasticity, skin varies by thickness based on ethnicity and age, also have to consider the hairs on the skin

Meeting with Dr. Amir Nezhad
About Dr. Amir Nezhad’s Research
Dr. Sanati-Nezhad' primary research interest involves BioMEMS, Microfluidics, Tissue Engineering, Micro and Nano Technology, and Lab-on-Chip.
His research group has focus on development of integrated bioinspired microdevices using microfluidics and tissue engineering approaches for disease modeling, biological systems modeling, and drug discovery.
Another research interest of his group is to develop point-of-care devices for testing infectious diseases, and portable tools for detection of plant and food pathogens.
On meeting with him, we were invited to his lab where he showed us the process of micro fabricating the labs on the chips and how he uses microfluidics in order to do so
The fabrication process is difficult. It requires a semi permeable membrane in the middle where the individual cells can be housed.
Surrounding the permeable membrane is silicone mold to provide structure and handling.
Although the chip looks simple, actual analysis requires a system of micropumps to transfer media, waste and byproducts across the system. This in turn is connected to a computer or microscope system for analysis.
In order to work for cells for 30 days, the first 6 - 15 days is incubating the cells and ensuring they are in"

DRDC Suffield
Synthetic biology is a novel, developing science that is introducing new technologies and capabilities to biology. It gives scientists the ability to create novel systems operating in existing organisms, as well as a growing capacity to synthesize fully synthetic life. There are concerns developing however, that this type of research could lead to either the purposeful, or inadvertent creation of harmful organisms or bioweapons. Increased affordability of synthesizing gene sequences, as well as the increased accessibility of synthetic biology are both issues that our increasing these fears. Therefore our team felt that we should gain an expert’s perspective on the dangers of synthetic biology.
Our iGEM team presented the concept of biobricks, the registry of standardized parts, and the iGEM competition to researchers at DRDC Suffield. Defence Research and Development Suffield, or DRDC Suffield, is a Canadian Military Research facility located in southern Alberta. A major focus of DRDC Suffield is addressing chemical and biological threats. It is also the host of the Counter Terrorism Technology Centre, a key component of national defence that uses unique laboratories and testing facilities to help better prepare Canada from chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) threats.
Following our presentation we engaged in a roundtable discussion with researchers and experts. As with most scientists, DRDC Suffield scientists acknowledged that synthetic biology, including iGEM projects, have dual-use capability. This refers to biological research with legitimate scientific purpose, but also has the potential for misuse that would threaten public health, and/or national security. Another danger discussed was the potential to synthesize harmful pathogens from digital genomes, such as smallpox. Although this would be catastrophic if achieved, it was not interpreted as a priority to our security because of the difficulty of  “rougue” scientists achieving such a momentous task. A more “real” application of synthetic biology causing dangers to our"

Potential Ideas
Respondents provided many unique ideas to try to promote collaborations. A few select ideas can be seen below,
When entering our project summary (15th July 2012) we could enter a few key words. For example we would have entered: Gibson Assembly, Heme Oxygenase, Gene regualtion and light. Teams could search by these keywords to find a collaborator.
Macquarie University
Requiring an earlier deadline for track selections so that groups may see other groups with similar proposals more easily.
University of Virginia
If we have the possibility to find team with keyword, it would be easier to take contact at the beginning of the project. for example, use the name of the microorganisms or the topic...

Samples were then removed from thermocycler, chilled on ice, and loaded directly into a 1% wt/vol agarose gel with 1X SYBRsafe (10 uL of 10,000x stock in 100mL of 1g agarose gel in 1x TAE).  Gel was ran for 40 minutes at 150 V, with dilution of NEB 1kb Ruler (2 uL ruler, 8 uL nuclease free water, 2 uL 6x NEB loading dye).  Gel was then removed and imaged in Bio-Rad Image Lab for screening.
Results of Colony PCR
Colony PCR of 3 iGEM IL 2015 Devices.  Devices show high amplification at 1200 kb roughly, expected size of insert using VF2/VR amplifying primers from plasmid backbone.  From left to right: NEB 1kb DNA Ladder, 3 Digestions from Vinson Lam, Device-Colony 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 3-1,3-2, 3-3, 3-4, and negative control (sterile LB only--no colonies).
Colony PCR results indicate a positive screen for all 4 colonies in each device transformation. Some nonspecific binding does occur, but opportunistic binding and amplification of a 1 kb average insert suggests presence of the insert in between the VF2/VR binding regions.  This correlated with an insert approximately 950 bp in length with added overhangs, which is what we expect for an insert of the device length.
However, the negative control was disconcerting, with a 1.5 kbp band generating.  No band was expected in the negative control, suggesting template contamination of the LB, water, master mix, primers, or equipment.  Care must be taken to decontaminate and discard all contaminants from now on.  However, specific binding of the insert at the correct size in the clones indicates proper presence of device"

Origin
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.
