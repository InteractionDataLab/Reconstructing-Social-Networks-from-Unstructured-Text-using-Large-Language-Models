Swimming agar assay with L-aspartic acid
We conducted a second swimming agar assay with E. coli MG1655. This time, we added paper discs that were soaked with a L-aspartic acid solution. We wanted to observe whether the bacteria are attracted by the amino acid. We tested different parameters:
- agar concentrations of 0.15 %, 0.3 % and 0.5 %
- incubation temperatures of 25 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C
- inoculations depths of ""on the surface"", ""under the surface"" and ""deep in the medium""
- aspartic acid concentrations of 0.2 %, 0.1 % and 0.01 %
Photos of swimming agar were taken and travelling distances measured. 0.3% agar was found to be the best for an overnight culture. A temperature of 37°C was too high, since the swarms spread over the whole plate. All plates showed swarm spread at different levels giving inner and outer rings. Unfortunately, we observed no different movement/growth towards the L-aspartic acid compared with the control (water). It was assumed that this is due to the low concentration, but it wasn't possible to increase the molar percentage of solution past ~0.4%.
The swimming agar experiment was repeated. Since the OD600 of the bacterial culture for the inoculation was too low The plates were inoculated the next day. More concentrated aspartate solution was made by reacting the acid of aspartate with its salt. A concentration up to 7 % was reached. We ordered the salt to save having to do this in future.
This time, only 0.3 % agar plates were used. Two wells were made using the thick end of a 1000 µl pipette tip. Aspartate solution was pippeted into the left"

Improved Parts
 Parts Improved
We improved all of the basic parts we used by putting them into the composite parts that we used. The T7 promoter that we had at the beginning of each construct and our use of the T7 system in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Is an improvement to each of the basic parts. This system allows us to control when the gene is being expressed. This is a great advantage to us as large batch culture overexpression is very stressful on the cells. If we did not use an inducible promoter on our genes we would see significantly less pigment than our literature would lead us to expect. This is due to the fact that the genes we are using have been optimized to produce the maximum amount of pigment possible, and this process on a single young cell would be very stressful and significantly increase the doubling time of the cells. We have induced the cells after they have replicated many times and matured, this allows us to have more cells with the construct that can produce more pigment faster.
The most significant improvements of previously made parts worth discussing is the improvement to the melA and crtY-crtZ (zeaxanthin) coding parts.
The melA gene is coding sequence of tyrosinase from Rhizobium etli. This tyrosinase converts tyrosine to dopaquinone. Dopaquinone is intermediate product of melanin biosynthesis pathway that will polymerizes in an enzyme-independent reaction to form melanin. Melanin production in E. coli requires supplemental tyrosine and CuSO4. The part for the melA CDS was originally made by Kazuaki Amikura of the iGEM09_Tokyo_Tech group (2009-10-14, BBa_K193600 ). Previously, it had been used in an expression construct using the constitutive P(lac)IQ promoter ( BBa_I14032 ) and B0040 RBS (composite part: BBa_K193602 ). We have developed a different expression construct specifically for use in E. coli BL21(DE3) which takes advantage of the T7 RNA Polymerase expression construct in"

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Suicide_-_-_TEXT.html,"1655.RFP, cells which are not colicinogenic, do not produce ZOI when spotted on a lawn of sensitive cells.
Interpretation
The Col E2 cells secrete the lethal activity protein, which diffuses out from the Col E2 colonies spotted on the LB plates. This generates a region where vulnerable cells can not grow, visible as an empty ring (ZOI) around the Col E2 colonies. It is important to note that Col E2 cells do not need to be induced to produce sufficient activity protein to generate the ZOI. These results confirm the toxicity of Col E2 cells against MG1655 and MG1655.RFP, related species of E.coli. We also assayed Top10 cells, NEB turbo cells, MAGE cells, and MG1655 ZI.RFP cells, for more details look here
Expression of Immunity Protects Sensitive Cells
To test the function of our antitoxin plasmid, we performed Colicin E2 toxicity assays on cells transformed with our plasmid. Here we expect zones of inhibition (ZOI) when Col E2 is spotted on vulnerable cells, and the absence of ZOI in the transformed immune cells.
Experimental setup
Cell Types
MG1655: These cells approximate wild type E.coli cells as they have undergone minimal genetic manipulation as compared to other laboratory strains. Genotype: F- λ- ilvG- rfb-50 rph-1
MG1655.RFP: MG1655 cells transformed with constitutive RFP (from Anderson promoter library, BBa_J61002)
Col E2: Wild Type Colicin E2 cells, containing pColE2-P9 plasmid [2]
NEB.Imm: NEB turbo cells transformed with the antitoxin plasmid ( BBa_K914001 inside pSB3C5 ). This strain is commonly used in the lab as it grows rapidly (visible colonies on agar, ~6.5 hours; shaking liquid culture OD 600 = 2.0, ~4 hours). This strain is also T1 phage resistant and importantly it expresses the Lac repressor (lacR), which allows us to induce the production of the immunity protein the pLac promoter with IPTG.

Toronto,2013,Team:Toronto#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry. Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
The spectacular success of the metabolic engineering field eminently shows the defect in this paradigm. Successful engineering of model organisms is based on using chemical kinetics and metabolic networks, where metabolite flux is directed by both gene up-regulation and deletion. (Insert examples here...)
Since deletions from a cell's genome is another means to engineering the cell as a system, we have also characterized the biofilm response of a set of knockout E. coli. Unfortunately, these systems cannot be submitted to the biobrick registry because they do not conform to the Biobrick paradigm, an issue we hope that the iGEM competition can address.

LiU iGEM, Sweden
At the beginning of the year the University of Linkoping team, from Sweden, got in contact with us looking for help with a local 'show and tell' they were a part of. This show and tell was designed to showcase the broad applications of the iGEM competition.
We were able to provide a detailed outline of our project to help showcase the iGEM brand. Importantly for us this provided an international connection outside our standard area of Australasia, connecting us (however briefly) with the other side of the world.
These connections are what we were looking to form with our collaborations this year in the hope that future Auckland teams can expand on our work.
Fig3. shows the LiU iGEM team’s stand. They reported a great deal of interest in their project and have inspired us greatly in terms of how we might want to engage with our community in the future. Inspiring more students into science is a cornerstone of our project this year and the LiU iGEM team’’s stand demonstrates a great way to achieve this.
USYD iGEM, Australia
The 2017 University of Sydney iGEM team has been a major partner, supporting our project from very early on.  After an initial email conversation with Nick, the PI for USYD, Peter of SECA NZ and Emaleen of USYD had a really useful skype conversation, discussing both team’s projects and the setup of USYD. As a new team it was very valuable to hear about the elements of team organisation that were the same and different between our teams and future challenges we may face. Nick and Emaleen both gave helpful information on their system of sitting exams at the same time as the Giant Jamboree. While we ended up organising to sit these exams in Boston knowing the USYD team tends to defer exams until after the Jamboree gave us the opportunity to demonstrate the importance of the competition around the globe.
Fig4. shows the first email we received regarding the iGEM Australasia meetup. We’re on the opposite side of the globe to many teams so it was very humbling to be asked to attend this meetup. We look forward to seeing these meetups continue.
Max of SECA NZ offered some guidance and code to the USYD team around the design of their wiki. As Max’s background is in computer science he was able to support the USYD team in this way.

Statement from Frank Møller Aarestrup
We received a statement from Frank Møller Aarestrup, because we were interested in hearing an expert’s opinion about the use of bacteriocins as an alternative for treating wounds. Mr. Aarestrup is a professor at the Technical University of Denmark and is the head of a research group for genomic epidemiology. His laboratory is appointed as a reference laboratory for antimicrobial resistance by WHO an EU. He believes that there are great future prospects in the use of bacteriocins because it seems that resistance is rarely developed against them. However, Mr. Aarestrup points out that if we choose to inject the proteins into the body, we should be aware of the fact that they easily can be decomposed. This is not a problem since we keep the proteins on the surface of the body. Mr. Aarestrup agreed with our choice of testing S. Aureus strains and also suggested that we tested our bacteriocins in relation to Streptococcus. If we had any time left, we would have been interested in testing Mr. Aarestrup's suggestion.
Interviewing plastic companies
We sent out question forms and made phone calls to 14 different plastic companies, in order to evaluate the sustainability and future perspectives of our biodegradable plastic. Their opinions are very important to us, because they would be future customers of our plastic. The companies were very positive towards using plastic produced by bacteria. However, there were some concerns if the plastic was going to be used for foodpackaging. Likewise, the plastic should be approved by UL and FDA, before being used.
The use of bacteria for the production of plastic, would also open the doors for a product, which would be capable of competing in costs with the current forms of plastic. The companies were very interested in using biodegradable plastic, but not with today’s prices. Several companies have already investigated some biodegradable plastics, but due to its much higher cost they did not end up using it. If a cheaper alternative could be offered, then they would be very interested. This will make them able to offer more options to their customers and provide them with a more environmental friendly solution. We will therefore keep trying to optimize the production of our plastic from bacteria, so that one day we end up with a competitive product.
The plastic companies will only be able to use our plastic if it fulfills the customer's wish"

Diagnosis device survey from iGEM Team Munich
The iGEM Team Munich collected opinions about diagnostic devices in a survey that was distributed to people with different professional backgrounds. In certain countries access to regular medical care is limited, either due to regional fluctuation in the density of hospitals, pharmacies and doctors or due to country-specific healthcare laws. This issue affects millions of people world-wide, both in developing as well as modern countries. iGEM Team Munich aims at developing diagnostic devices, that could be used at home and provide people with diagnosis and hence medical care that would otherwise have no access to.

HPV are small double-stranded DNA viruses that contain of two oncogenes E6 and E7 that are involved in cellular transformation. Two viral genes, E6 and E7 are commonly found expressed in these cancer cells (Song, 2000). Transcription of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) genome is controlled by several promoters and the P97 promoter is considered to be the main one (Braunstein et al., 1999). P97 is the HPV-16 early promoter involved in the transcription of E6, E7 and other viral genes (Dell and Gaston, 2011; Flores and Lambert, 1997; Hebner and Laimins, 2006. Based on Laura et al (2005), P105 is located to the next E6 start codon and is the main early promoter of HPV-18. AP-1, Sp-1, NF-1, Oct-1, TEF-1, YY-1, KRF-1, Skn-1a, and TFIID known as transcription factors that could stimulate P105 promoter activity. HPV-18 P105 promoter and HPV-16 P97 promoter has equivalent function. E2 repression of P105 promoter activity has been demonstrated in HeLa cells (Thierry and Yaniv, 1987) and in primary human keratinocytes (Bernard et al., 1989). Romanczuk et al(1990), suggested that P97 and P105 promoters both could be regulated by similar mechanisms. A comparison of the sequences upstream of the HPV-16 P97 promoter and the HPV-18 P105 promoter revealed a similar spatial arrangement of the four E2-binding sites, the TATAAAA boxes, and the start sites for transcription in the respective viral LCRs. (Romanczuk et al, 1990).  Based on Chong et al(1991), trancript factor such as NF1, AP-1, and oct-1 were present in higher concentration in HeLa cells. Therefor, HeLa cells can be used as transfection for promoter P97 and promoter P105 so it could be activated.

Overview
The model
Simulations
Protein Production
Based on the module 1 genetic circuit, a LacI-IPTG inducible promoter is responsible for kickstarting the production of the drug.
In the absence of IPTG, LacI represses the production of the drug (Cellulase or PAH)
When IPTG is introduced, the LacI repressing pathway is “de-repressed”, and some output protein is produced.

Our goals
The modelling aims to provide an overview and better understanding of the M1 system’s function  by:
Characterizing the system.
Modeling to account for several factors that may reduce/hinder the production of  the protein drug such as:
Lac promoter leakiness
IPTG toxicity
Stability of output protein
This module is an integral part of the design, as large-scale commercialization of the drug of interest depends on finding the optimal conditions for protein production. We implemented a system of differential equations, having made some assumptions and predictions about how the system will behave.
  About the model assumptions and predictions!
The System
Genetic circuits can be simplified using ODEs. A good introduction to modelling of genetic circuits is provided in [3]. By clicking on the link below we can see how genetic circuits were implemented in this system.
  about the equations and what they mean!
Summary of simulation results
When we introduce IPTG into the system, it temporarily removes LacI from the system. Hence, during this period of time, we produce the drug of interest.
When the effects of IPTG wear off, the system returns to equilibrium.
The more IPTG we add in, the higher the amount of output protein.
  about the simulations!
The effects of IPTG toxicity were investigated and we found that for these concentration ranges, IPTG is not toxic to cells. Click on the link to see the analyzed results:See IPTG growth curves
The constants in this model are arbitrary. We justify our usage of these values with a more detailed dynamical analysis of the system, which shows that it can only have fixed points[1]. System stability analysis (read about the equations before opening this file, it's intimidating!)

PCR Cleanup
(using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Purification System)
Gel Extraction:
Following electrophoresis, excise DNA band from gel and place gel slice in a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Trim the slice of parts that don’t contain DNA. Weigh gel slice (by weighing the tube containing the slice and subtracting the mass of the empty tube). Add 10μl Membrane Binding Solution per 10 mg of gel slice. Vortex and incubate at 50–65°C until gel slice is completely dissolved (usually 10-15 minutes).
PCR Amplifications:
Add an equal volume of Membrane Binding Solution to the PCR amplification.
Binding of DNA
Insert SV Minicolumn into Collection Tube. Transfer dissolved gel mixture or prepared PCR product to the Minicolumn assembly. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute. Discard flowthrough and reinsert Minicolumn into Collection Tube. If you are worried about the final concentration of your purified product, you can repeat this step to maximize the amount of DNA bound to the filter.
Washing
Add 700μl Membrane Wash Solution (ethanol added). Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute. Discard flowthrough and reinsert Minicolumn into Collection Tube. Repeat Step 4 with 500μl Membrane Wash Solution. Centrifuge at max speed for 5 minutes. Empty the Collection Tube and re-centrifuge the column assembly for 1 minute with the microcentrifuge lid open (or off) to allow evaporation of any residual ethanol.
Elution
Carefully transfer Minicolumn to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 30-50 μL of Nuclease-Free Water to the center of the minicolumn. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute. By adding less water, like 30 μl, you will increase the concentration but decrease the total amount of product. On the flipside, if you want to maximize product, you can maximize elution volume so long as you don’t care about concentration.
Note: you can also increase yield by warming the elution water before hand. I usually warm it to 40°C with good results.
Discard Minicolumn and take sample to nanodrop (see 'Nanodrop', below) Store DNA at –20°C.

To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.
Yakult
    At Yakult, we understand the great benefits of probiotics for human health. Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.
Meiji
    First, we watched the propaganda film of Meiji and learned about the company's products, market and corporate culture. Then, we visited the company's workshop under the guidance of the staff. The streamlined production made us feel the advanced technology of the company. After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.
Biogrowing Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co. Ltd
    Guided by the head of the R&D department, we visited the company's laboratories, learning a lot about some high-tech equipment. In the conference room of the R&D department, we conducted a far-reaching discussion with the person in charge. He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.
Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd
    Firstly we went to Xinhua pharmaceutical company. At this company, we learned that most of their current drugs are still relatively common drugs, and they are also used in the traditional way of taking drugs. However, some drugs need to be prepared in the form of coating, and need to control the time and dosage, which is not very convenient. Also, the granules are relatively large. We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.

Introducing our project to other iGEM team
The poster showed the topic and proposes of our project. The project is using various colored E. coli to draw a world map. These bacteria could change their color when the temperature increases. Therefore, the color of world map will be changed as well, which could mimic the process of global warming. The poster also illustrated two creative ideas; one was RNA ribosome meter controlling the translation of chrome-proteins, another was genetic circuit which made protein expression ordered.  We displayed the poster and introduced the project to other iGEM teams. They were very surprised to the RNA ribosome meter and the design of genetic circuit. Also, they gave us many significant suggestions on completing the project and improving quality.
A gentleman from USTC said: ‘First, I consider that your ideas are amazing! You can stimulate the process of global warming by culturing bacteria on medium. That is so creative. Furthermore, although you are just doing art design, your team has too much work to realize it. In all, your project this year is excellent！I can give you a little advice. Your project could closely stimulate the global climate. Why not go and achieve the up-date data of global climate? Therefore, you can control the temperature to display more detail information. If so, your bacterial map will be closer to the real world.’
Communication with a gentleman from USTC team
A lady from China-Tongji said: ‘It is a great idea to let the bacteria change their color automatically in order to stimulate the process of global warming. This can directly encourage people to feel the influence of global warming. Also, it contains of many aspects and can mimic many phenomena such as sea-level rise and interaction between coastal and inland area. This design is really delicate.’
Communication with a lady from China-Tongji
A handsome guy from NYU-Shanghai said: ‘: I think your project is really cool! I think it different! You guys are a kind of art design, but you are also very scientific. We try to do something similar. We want to do something very (scientific) also very art! Every week, we are getting closer very art. But I think you guys are still vey scientific. It is really cool!

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Prospects_-_-_TEXT.html,". This can be done by changing the current gene (phaCAP) in the BioBrick from Tokyo Tech 2012  with a stronger promoter and an additional stronger RBS. The use of a weak promoter and an additional weak RBS might also be an aspect in how much PHB there can be produced in the cell. The new device should then be added to our secretion system instead of the old from Tokyo Tech 2012 BioBrick, and hopefully make the E. coli produce even more PHB than we see now.
To produce more rentable PHB, we should first consider which microorganism to use to make the mass production of PHB most efficient. We have considered using Ralstonia eutropha and Bacillus subtilis, which are two commonly used organisms in the industry. Secondly we need to develop our production so it fits with a continuous stirred-tank reactor. We will imply this reactor for large scale production, so we will be able to regulate parameters such as temperature, oxygen level and amount of required nutrients for the chosen organism. It will likewise also be good if we could decrease the use of chemicals to make the production more profitable.
We also need to design a 3D model of our envelope for Bacto-Aid, so we could print the model and produce the envelope through 3D printing. This should be done by creating 3-5 models of an envelope for Bacto-Aid and the best envelope will be selected critically by important criterias for the use of PHB on the skin and how well it fits these criterias.
Producing Bacto-Aid
If we have fully developed our sub elements, we should be able to make Bacto-Aid and test its effect on wound healing. The next step would then be to develop methods for how we could scale our production of the sub elements up to the industrial scale.

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

Reducing the                         water and soil used to grow fruit is key for                         environmentaly friendly strategies. In China, the                         availability of arable land is also a compromising fact                         due to the high urbanization and population increase.                         By slower fruit ripening, resources would be exploited                         in a more sustainable way, as a higher rate of the                         product could finally reach the market.
Nutrition is a big part of our life, the gear that                         allows us to achieve our personal goals every day. If                         we improve the characteristics of the food that                         provides that energy, we will increase our life                         quality.

Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," ampR gene was cloned behind our inducible promoters and we ligated each autoinducer synthetase with a RBS (B0032) overnight.
Friday, June 21, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Jan, Oliver, Roman
The overnight ligation was followed by transformation of competent E. coli XL1Blue MRF cells. In parallel, PCR for C0062 from pSB1A2 was done using Phusion and Q5 polymerase. However, both preparations were negative, so we purified the other two repressor/activator genes (C0071, C0079) by gel extraction. Subsequently, we ligated these bricks with a constitutive promoter. As usual, we transformed competent bacteria with the ligated vectors. Furthermore, Phusion- and Q5-PCR was repeated with different annealing temperatures, which were also all negative. We also changed our cloning strategy as we thankfully received new chromoproteins from iGEM team Uppsala.
Saturday, June 22, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Kerstin
Today was a PCR day. We performed a colony PCR of 10 clones of each ligation we set up yesterday, resulting in 100 PCRs! We had to use all electrophoresis chambers that we could find in order to screen them all at the same time.
Week 6: June 23 - June 29, 2013
The focus of this week’s work was cloning further constructs and the evaluation of their quality by colony PCR and sequencing. Gel extraction was supposed to yield a functional structural gene for a beta lactamase. Additionally we took soil samples for the iGEM Team Norwich.
Sunday, June 23, 2013
Investigator: Laura
The ligations of J23100-B0032-C0071/C0079 and B0032-C0070/C0078-B0015 were positive in the colony PCR, so that we inoculated cultures for biomass production of the clones. We then conducted a colony PCR with ten clones of the B0032-C0061-B0015 construct to identify a correctly ligated clone. Cells with R0071/R0062/K091117-B0032-ampR were inoculated on agar plates with ampicillin supplemented media since we had evidence that our promoters might be leaky.

Constructing the Self Destructive plasmid
Next figures will illustrate how the self destructive plasmid will be constructed.
Figure 1: Assembly of GFP-LVA and ribosomal binding site.
A weak ribosomal binding site and a GFP which contains a LVA tag for rapid degradation are cloned into a high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid.
Figure 2: Assembly of GPF-LVA-ribosomal binding site with double terminator.
A double terminator is added to the GFP-LVA -ribosomal binding site construct and cloned into a high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid.
Figure 3: Assembly of tetR promoter and I-SceI restriction site.
Since the restriction site of I-SceI is not available as BioBrick, this restriction site should be standardized as BioBrick. Therefore we synthesis this restriction site flanked with the BioBrick prefix an suffix. This restriction site is than cloned into a high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid. After standardizing the restriction site this restriction site is combined with a TetR repressible promoter and cloned into a high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid. This tetR promoter will control transcription of the I-SceI endonuclease, in order to avoid constantly transcription of the I-SceI.
Figure 4: Assembly of I-SceI and TetR
The tetR promoter which controls the GFP-LVA transcription is repressed by TetR. Therefore the SDP should contain a tetR gene as well in order to control GFP-LVA transcription. The I-SceI restriction site and TetR generator are cloned into a high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid.
Figure 5: Assembly of endonuclease, tetR promoter and I-SceI restriction site
At this point all the basic parts of the construct are built. In order to construct the SDP these parts should be reassembled. The I-SceI generator(I-Sce-I gene under control of a"

Project AuxIn: engineering bacteria to help fight soil erosion
Figure 1: Arabidopsis plant grown in soil during our soil erosion experiment . (Picture by Imperial College iGEM team 2011.)
In arid areas of the world soil erosion is a massive problem. It is caused by wind and rain sweeping away the fertile top soil and can eventually result in desertification . Climate change and unsustainable farming practices are accelerating the rate of desertification to over 31,000 hectares/day. That is 62,000 football pitches in a day or half the size of the UK every year. In ordinary circumstances the roots of well-established plants help to hold down the top soil, protecting it from erosion. In areas that suffer from desertification however plants do not get the chance to establish large enough root networks to anchor the soil and themselves before erosion occurs.
This year, the Imperial College London iGEM team have joined the international effort to fight desertification.
We hope to engineer bacteria to accelerate plant root development. The bacteria will be designed to secrete the hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), also known as auxin. Seeds will be coated with the bacteria and then planted in the soil. Once the seeds germinate the bacteria will move towards the roots and be taken in by the plant. Inside the roots the bacteria will release IAA – promoting growth and protecting the soil from erosion.
The modules
The title of our project is AuxIn. Our whole project is sub-divided into three modules. The first, Phyto-Route , involves heterologous expression of the chemoreceptor PA2652 in our chassis, E. coli. PA2652 is responsive to plant root exudates like malate and will allow our engineered bacteria to swim towards plant roots. Once they reach the root, they can"

We thank Nanolive for setting up the microscope and helping us in acquiring                   the images.
The iGEM team pre-processed the raw 3D tomographic and 2D fluorescent image files in the Demo version of Nanolive’s software STEVE. The processed files were exported from STEVE into the open source software Fiji, where a z projection of                   the 3D stack was acquired according to the max intensity. The output image was channel merged with the fluorescence channel output. Prior to that, contrast in the fluorescence channel was increased to attenuate background noise. The                   resulting figures are depicted in figure 2.
Figure 13: Fluorescent Image of an SDS PAGE gel of the encapsulin expressed in cell free transcription-translation system (TX-TL system) with Lysine-BODIPY. This expression was performed to generate the encapsulin to be used for validation                     of vaccine uptake by dendritic cells. Imaging filters used were those for measuring fluorescein λex = 494 nm, λem= 512 nm. The first lane is a fluorescent ladder. The second lane (N.C.) is for a negative control (cell free reaction                     with no DNA template supplied). Third lane (HH encapsulin B) is Hexahistidine encapsulin expressed in the TX-TL system supplied with Lysine BODIPY before purification (B stands for Before purification). The fourth lane (HH encapsulin                     S) is Hexahistidine encapsulin expressed in the TX-TL system supplied with Lysine BODIPY after applying our purification protocol (S stands for the Supernatant generated post heat purification).
The images acquired before encapsulin presentation show dendritic cells in their immature round shape. Moreover, fluorescence imaging showed very faint fluorescence originating autofluorescence. One hour following encapsulin presentation"

Chromate Biosensor
Summary
Introduction
Background
Stainless steel is an alloy of different metals and apart from the base material, iron, contains a large proportion >11% of chromium. There is a wide range of stainless steels for a variety of different applications, ranging from surgical steel to alloys used in the aeronautic industry. For our application we assumed stainless steels that are used in bulk production of standard kitchen knives with a chromium content between 12% and 14%. We also utilise the fact that chromate is a salt containing chromium. Bone incisions and kerfmarks, distinctive marks left behind, are current indicators for different types of weapons such as saws (1) or knifes.
We used pig bones to investigate incisions by stainless steel tools.

Initial Ideas
At the beginning of the project we met with Dr. Lucina Hackman, an expert in dismemberment cases at the University of Dundee. In dismemberment cases it is obvious enough that a body has been dismembered. However, if the body is not found for a long time and the only remains are bones, it is hard to tell if a person has been stabbed or if an animal was chewing on the bone. This is where a chromate biosensor would be useful. By detecting minute amounts of chromate on a bone, the use of a weapon may be inferred which will justify searching for trace evidence.
We found that a chromate detector had already been submitted by the Beijing Institute of Technology 2013 iGEM team, where they had created a biobrick for this BBa_K1058008 (Fig. 1). The biobrick is a modified version of a highly sensitive chromate resistance operon of ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1( 2 , 3 ), containing a promoter, Pchr, a coding region for a chromate responsive repressor of this promoter, chrB, fused to the sequence of the fluorescent reporter GFP.
The Science behind Chromate resistance
Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1 was discovered in 2004 in a chromate contaminated wastewater treatment facility. A specific characteristic of this strain was that it could both, reduce Cr(VI) and be resistant to it at the same time. Previously characterised strains were either resistant or could reduce chromate (2) . Over the last 10 years the group that discovered it started working out the underlying mechanisms of this set of characteristics. A transposon located"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," The different levels are therefore defined by their part content and their antibiotic resistances.
To generate a level 0 plasmid, the gene of interest is ligated into the provided level 0 backbone via Golden Gate assembly using the enzyme BsmBI. The backbone contains a resistance to Chloramphenicol, as well as an origin of replication, creating a very basic yet functional plasmid.
The level 1 plasmid contains a promoter and terminator suited for S. cerevisiae. There is the possibility of including  a polyhistidine-tag if there is a need for Western blot analysis. The antibiotic resistance contained in the level 1 plasmid changes from chloramphenicol to ampicillin which enables filtering out residual level 0 plasmids contained in the Golden Gate product. Furthermore, the Dueber toolbox includes the possibility of designing GFP-Dropout cassettes. These are custom-built level 1 backbones whose inserts are sfGFP as well as promoter and terminator suited for E. coli.  Upon a successful cloning step the GFP is replaced by the part(s) of interest, and correct colony shows a white colour. In case of a wrong ligation event colonies show a green fluorescence. This provides a very useful tool to detect unsuccessful cloned colonies. The enzyme used for level 1 changes from BsmBI to BsaI to avoid any interference between different steps.
The level 2 plasmid combines two or more genes of interest with their respective promoters, terminators and tags. The resistance changes from ampicillin to kanamycin. The enzyme of this step is BsmBI again. This level is useful, if the construct you are designing requires multiple genes to be transformed into one yeast strain.

Finally, the flux of the complexes through villi was achieved, giving us the result of mass rate per unit volume. Fig.1-2-1 demonstrates the amount of penetrating CPP-PYY complexes though villi against time.

[Fig.1-2-2] CPP-PYY penetration through villi
Absorption Into Bloodstream
The inside wall of the small intestine is lined with villi that contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed molecules for circulation. The large surface area contributed by these villi allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently.
To evaluate the efficiency of the adsorption, we incorporated “Fick’s Law of Binary Diffusion”, where the diffusion coefficient was given by S R Chary and R K Jain. [7] Taken in calculation for our simulation, the measured interstitial fluid diffusion coefficient (DAB) of bovine serum albumin in tissues was 5.8 x 10-7 cm2/s as reference.
where JA is the mass flux of CPP-PYY complex, ρ is the density of villus cavity, and ωA stands for the mass fraction of the complex. The direction of diffusion was considered from the epithelial cells toward capillaries, signified as y direction, and the distance in between was viewed as 4 μm referred to literature. [8] Furthermore, the mass fraction was set “zero” in the capillaries owning to the rapid absorption, giving the value of gradient as “one” for the following estimation. The result of this effect of binary diffusion is illustrated in Fig.1-3.
[Fig.1-3] Mass diffusion flux(μg/m2•min) of CPP-PYY complex against time(min)
Thrombin Cleavage Efficiency
After CPP-PYY complexes are transported across intestinal cells, they enter capillaries with the help of CPP transmembrane protein and diffusion. However, to suppress appetite, CPP-PYY complexes should be cleaved. Therefore, in our design, we utilized a linker which has a thrombin-favor cleavage site and thrombin is ubiquitous in blood vessel.
From the literature by J. Y. Chang, the percentage of polypeptide cleaved by thrombin is applied to CPP-PYY complexes. [9] The amino acid sequence of CPP-PYY complexes is LEAGCKNFFPRSFTSCGSLE"

Our Project
The aim of our project is to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to be able to detect and sense cadmium which has been taken up from the soil environment and bound to metallothionein. This metallothionein will then become incorporated into a Bacillus spore, the resilience of which means that the cadmium ions can become isolated from the environment (and made bio-unavailable) for many years.
This project involves a number of steps, each of which can be considered as sub projects:
Cadmium Intake
Cadmium Sensing
Cadmium sequestration by metallothionein
Sporulation Tuning
Chassis
Population simulation
Stochastic Switch
Synthesizing a Promoter Library for Bacillus subtilis
Cadmium Intake
For this project we want to be able to process cadmium and cadmium only. Therefore it would be logical to find a way in which we can increase the intake of cadmium without increasing the intake of other metals too.
It is known that a Bacillus subtilis cell (from the 168 strain) takes up cadmium naturally through the manganese transport system (Laddaga. R.A., Bessen. R., Silver. S.; 1985). Additionally it has been demonstrated that mutations to the manganese transport system can affect its ability to uptake cadmium without affecting its ability to transport manganese (Zeigler. D.R., et al; 1987).
The manganese ion channel that we intend to either upregulate or control is the mntH ion channel (also goes under the name ydaR). mntH is part of the Nramp family of proton-coupled metal"

During Aug 14th-15th, our team participated in CCIC(Conference of China iGEMer Committee) in PKU. We gave ‘peer’ review to other iGEM team and gained feedback from others. We enjoyed the process reaching out to other teams, asking for advice and talking about ideas. In the CCIC, the young, ambitious and creative synthetic biologist got together and had fun with each other.
Try out Team Tsinghua's Prototype
This is our feedback after trying out their product
Tsinghua Team has made a very interesting device. It looks a mysterious, with two boxes, a 96-well plate and many wires. And it needs a computer when it works. After a short introduction I learned how to use it. Their software has a funny flash at the beginning and a friendly interface. There are two main functions their system can achieve.
The first function of their device is very imaginative – their device can store information in bacteria. I can choose a small-sized file and then the program will encode the information into the bacteria in the 96-well plate. Since this process would take a relatively long time, I just loaded the file but didn’t wait for the cells to grow up.
The second function allowed me to encode the information by myself. I can choose the time and the color of the light and change these parameters at different time. And for every well it can receive a different pattern of light input. Then, the 96-well plate will receive a set of light input, which may transfer the information to the bacteria. Besides, I think this light change can be used as a light inducer which may activate gene expression or change the state of a photosensitive protein.

Plasmid-Sensing Logically and Adjustably Cell Killer
Monitoring Plasmid Numbers
Kill the Slacker
In the procedure of large-scale industrial
production, due to the random distribution of
plasmids in the process of bacteria proliferation
and division, the bacteria containing less
plasmids will gradually become the
“slackers”.
Generally, we aim to avoid these undesired
bacteria become the dominant population.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of
plasmid-free bacteria and the applied ways are
only limited to the laboratory-use.
What about equipping the bacteria with a
plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer
(P-SLACKiller)?
Here is killer’s basic rule:
Kill the slackers (Plasmid numbers are above a
threshold);
Save the workers (Plasmid numbers are below
the threshold).
Surprise! We can guarantee the microbial
population structure stay optimal now!
Our team divide the experiment into 4 parts as below.
Why not click and have a look?
Basic Circuit
We know low-plasmid level cells cost too much but produce less,like a slacker.So let's kill them to improve production.
Inhibitor
Yes,we set a BOMB in every cell,inside the plasmid.They are controlled to Terminate the cell's life.
Killer
Our project depends on good models.Every step we go all with the direction of our model part.
Recombination
Considering the safety requirements,our project is environment-friendly .

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
Previous integration assay did not show any integration product on the gel. In this section, we will perform PCR amplication with primer sets that will specifically bind to integration product (primer will bind on the target DNA on one side, and to the adapter on the other side). Since this is the first time this type of experiment was carried out. Different variables were tested:
Two different reaction time were tested, namely 1 and 16 hours to see the effect of reaction duration on integration.
Some of the reaction were stopped with heat or SDS to release DNA from the protein. PCR clean up were carried out right after the integration to get rid of excess SDS before PCR.
For the rest of the reaction, PCR reaction was done directly after integration.
The PCR product was either directly run on the gel, or was first subjected to PCR clean up to get rid of small background DNA fragment before running it on the gel.
Second PCR was done to reamplify the first PCR product, in case very little product was visualised.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.
Table 1: Primer sequence to be annealed for the adapter. Note that 5’ of the upper strand of the adapter has to be phosphorylated for successful integration.

Note that patients with severe lesions should use intravenous corticosteroid, and for nonresponder , we consider to use intravenous cyclosporine or to operate, which remove the whole colon and rectal mucous membrane. Some foreign countries use infliximab or adalimumab to induce and maintain remission. But this treatment is not widely used in our country.
Crohn's disease(CD) may involve the whole digestive tract, any place from oral cavity to crissum, typically at the terminal of small intestine, which is ileum and ileocecus. It is an inflammation covered the whole layer. The general pathology of CD is fissuring ulcers and changes in mucus pattern, which will make intestinal tract become narrow and induce the formation of internal/external fistula, characterized by bellyache, fever, abdominal mass and hematochezia/ melaena. We mainly use glucocorticoid to induce remission, supplemented with 5-ASA preparation. To maintain the remission, we mainly use AZA or 6-MP. If it is difficult for glucocorticoid to induce remission, we can try the methotrexate(MTX), cyclosporine(CsA) and infliximab. The latter applies more but there exists the primary/secondary drug resistance problems.
Ulcerative colitis is less difficult to treat relatively. Patients with poor therapeutic effect can choose to have a operation, which is considered to be a radical cure of disease. ( Of course, not every patient in our country will accept the fistulization at the end of ileum. However, PORCH operation is not spread widely currently. ) Patients who have had ulcerative colitis over 10 years has an increased risk of colon cancer. It is more difficult to treat Crohn's disease, because recurrence tendency always exists throughout one's life. Operation can only deal with the problem that intestinal tract become narrow, get block or bleeding. What’s more, it often brings up anastomotic recurrence, thus we mainly consider medicine as a treatment. However, many CD patients require to undergo surgery once or twice all their life, facing the risk of short bowel syndrome.
Actually I think that particular case is not the key point, and learning some common sense about the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Safety Guidelines_-_-_TEXT.html," depend on the genetic changes made to which constructs, which can only be assessed on a case-by-base basis, an additional challenge for regulation. The emergence of biohackerspaces could potentially strengthen these concerns due to the desire to fuel innovation of novel biotechnology with minimal regulation. For this reason, we believe there is significant motivation for a community biology laboratory to implement a biocontainment method that can guarantee the survival of genetically modified microorganisms only under controlled conditions, applicable in a laboratory setting and an open environment.
Additionally, while the US has pre-market approval processes established (like the completion of an Environmental Impact Statement after an environmental assessment), the system recognizes that a pre-market approval is costly for producers and impractical because manufacturers already have market incentives to sell safe products. Post-market regulatory authority allows products to move to shelves more quickly and less expensively, but with more potential for harmful products to be sold.5Reference:
Sarah R. Carter, Ph.D., Michael Rodemeyer, J.D., Michele S. Garfinkel, Ph.D., and Robert M. Friedman, Ph.D. (2014). Synthetic Biology and the US Biotechnology Regulatory System: Challenges and Option (J. Craig Venter Institute). However, not everybody agrees that primarily post-market approval is the right answer. Due to the difficulty of “recalling” a living GMO from an open environment should there be health or environmental concern, some organizations have called for more stringent US biotechnology regulation system.18Reference:
FOE (Friends of the Earth, et al.). (2012) The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology.
To comply with this emerging sentiment and strengthen the biosafety practices of an community space that undergoes no institutional safety review, we propose the acceptance of an auxotrophic biocontainment method that confers an organism’s dependence on protected leucine, a user-supplied nutrient. This will allow creators to ensure the safety of their science, as well as quell the public’s concerns about community science spaces.
We understand that community labs have a tremendous amount of freedom to do what they want, which also presents a lot of opportunity for things to go wrong, so to support our project of biosafety, we have partnered with our local community lab, Open Bio Labs, to develop a comprehensive, standard, and evolvable biosafety protocol for these labs to follow, which will streamline their ability to work with their community. Through Open Bio Labs, we are reaching out to other labs below to receive a first round of feedback before we share the protocol more broadly with the rest of the labs and with other relevant groups such as the CDC and"

In this way, we can determine how specific these proteins really are and how they might respond in our test to DNA not belonging to enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli. This will help us define how specific we expect our final system to be.
When we sequenced TALB ( BBa_K782006 ), we discovered that it had a small mutated segment. We expected a sequence of AGCAATGGG in the repeat variable di-residue of the second repeat. However, the sequence was actually TCCCACGAC. This means that the required target sequence at this position is a C, and not a T, as the parts registry web page shows.  The two TALEs also had a kozak sequence at the front of the sequence. Instead of changing the TALE, we decided to create a new series of target sequences for the mutated TAL B ( BBa_K782006 ) to bind to. We also used PCR to remove the kozak sequence at the front of each TALE, so it would not inhibit the expression.
Having target sequences created for both TALA( BBa_K782004 ) and TALB ( BBa_K782006 ), we assembled a target sequence construct ( BBa_K1189006 ), to be used in our system. Special primers were synthesized and used to create a linear PCR product, containing both the A and B target sequences. We then put it into a pSB1C3 backbone by switching out RFP.
With the TALEs ordered from the registry and our correct TALE target sequences, we have been able to demonstrate a proof of concept by binding TALE proteins with DNA. Next, we will use our designed TALEs to bind to the DNA of EHEC E. coli .

Economics
Ethics
Environment
Legality
and Social Issues.
While discussing all three projects, we were able to come across similar themes in what we would want to explore. These themes included looking at biosafety and patenting of processes/genes. Teams were also able to help each other determine what critical points should be explored, and how such issues should be approached. Students were coached on exploring ethics as a comprehensive look at all issues, displaying both pros and cons.
In addition to our own projects, we also examined a number of successful teams from last year and analyzed what the requirements are for the ethics component of iGEM, and what could be explored further this year. The ethics workshop was valuable preparation in outlining exploration of ethics for each project, and the feedback gained from Dr. Wolbring, Ms. Sheremeta, and all of the students provided an excellent starting point.
Presentation Skills, Fundraising, and Wiki Workshops @ Lethbridge, July 11th-12th
The Alberta Meet-Up at Lethbridge was our largest yet! There were 7 students from Calgary, 7 from Alberta, and 6 from Lethbridge. AiF kindly organized two days packed with valuable workshops, allowing students yet another opportunity to interact with other iGEMers.
The first day began with lunch (one of the best parts of the day) followed by presentation training from Anne Marie Downey. This session provided members with lots of advice on how to format their presentations, what to present, and how to eliminate nervousness. Some members from each team were able to quickly prepare short presentations which were then critiqued by the rest of the students. The critique given to each student could be applied to everyone, which was a valuable experience in looking at good and not-so-good presentation technique. Following the presentation skills workshop, it was time for dinner (another excellent time of day)! The dinner and rest of the evening were graciously hosted by the lovely ladies from the Lethbridge team.
The following morning, students split up to attend the fundraising and wiki workshops. The fundraising workshop was led by Leona Yez. At this workshop, students were taught how to make marketing pitches and other fundraising strategies. Together, the teams discussed which type of companies should be targeted for sponsorship. Additionally, some students practiced making pitches, receiving valuable critique from Ms. Yez and the other students.

This is a fragment of BBa_K2382010. We designed a restriction site, BamHI, before EAAAK rigid linker, so future iGEM teams could take advantage of this part to fuse their proteins with RFP as indicator.
This is also an improvement of previous BioBrick Part (BBa_E1010). It encodes an RFP that have the same amino acids as BBa_E1010 and having a His Tag at the end. Therefore, a fusion protein with this part may have red color and the ability to be purified easily.

Gillespie Algorithm Simulation
Gillespie Algorithm, a Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), can simulate biochemical reactions with small number of molecules accurately. Reactions in cells are full of random fluctuations due to low number of molecules present. For instance, there can be only one or two copies of a gene in one cell. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm for more details)
An example simulation result of our script using Gillespie Algorithm. 100 cells are generated in this figure. We can see how the state of the cell (represented by protein level in this case) change with the flow of time.
We use this algorithm to generate hundreds of sample trajectories at high and low inputs, each representing the dynamic changes in the amount of protein in a single cell. Afterwards, we find a time point when all reactions in cells have reached steady state, and ink down the states of the cells at that very moment. The approach resembles the flow cytometry experiment, in both of which we get a sample composed of cells with dissimilar protein levels.
From the simulated data, we can use methods in experiment data processing to calculate channel capacities.
We use ${k_{on}}$ and ${k_{off}}$, two parameters of dimer forming and disassociation, to characterize the process of dimerization. For split EBFP2 without intein, kon is relatively small due to low affinity, and ${k_{off}} > 0$. For split EBFP2 with intein, kon is larger and ${k_{off}} = 0$ because once they interact, they will not fall apart.
Under suitable parameter set, we obtained the following results shown in the table below. When ${k_{off}}$  comes down to zero, channel capacity increases in accordance to experimental results.
We computationally scan the two parameters in two-dimensional parameter space to explore the impacts of those kinetic constants.
In the heat map, warmer color stands for higher channel capacity, vice versa. The figure on the left stands for the case where both halves are driven by inducible promotors, the right for that where one of them is driven by constitutive promotor. The latter resemble chemical titration, so we legend it as above.
The lower left part of the map is warmer. In this region, ${k_{on}}$ is high and ${k_{off}}$ is low, which means that two peptides are prone to associate. This is the very district where the state of split EBFP2 with intein lies in.
The higher right part, on the contrary, is chilling to the"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
The model should impact your project design in a meaningful way. Modeling may include, but is not limited to, deterministic, exploratory, molecular dynamic, and stochastic models. Teams may also explore the physical modeling of a single component within a system or utilize mathematical modeling for predicting function of a more complex device.
Please see the 2018  Medals Page for more information.

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthetic biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthetic biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong (in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang (in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate"
SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour52_-_-_TEXT.html,") But what would happen if GMOs were approved for all industries? Would it result in the optimal exploitation of our resources and would it lead to the best and  largest quantities of the food production? Maybe it would. But maybe it would also lead to loss of jobs, as  the breeding is easier and more successful. Furthermore smaller companies and private farmers might be  forced to produce larger quantities and better products, as they otherwise could not keep up with the rapid  growth and development of the food producing industry.
In other respects, the permission of GMOs in agricultural industry might lead to the creation of more new jobs, for example within the research industry. GMOs also require environmental safeguards that must be  performed by educated experts. In that way, it could encourage to higher educational levels in some  countries, and thereby high probability of getting a job afterwards.
It has been valuable for our iGEM team to work on constructing an edible coli where so many ethical considerations come into play. To begin with the idea of creating a nutrition source based on non-digestible materials for human beings seemed as the good deed of the day, but it did not take long before this viewpoint changed due to reflections.
It came to our attention that scientists play a major role in the dissemination of new scientific proposals. The reason for this is the importance of a good integration of the proposal, but also because of the impact it can have on peoples lives.
On our ethics course in Copenhagen and through the trip to Ghana, we began to reflect upon how our targeted consumers would welcome our proposal. Whether they would see it as much-needed help or as a deamination of their needs and we realized that maybe not all people would welcome the idea with open arms.
Our ethical considerations have made us look at our project from several new angles and opened our eyes to both the good and the more problematic aspects of our project.

Team WPI met the members of the Boston University and MIT teams at NEGEM this year, and established several collaborations.
Collaboration with Boston University
We gave the BU team two versions of our BclA-YFP ( BBa_K1423005 ) cell surface expression device: one in the Cam backbone and one in the Amp backbone. Team BU performed flow cytometry on the samples as well as a control line expressing YFP internally from a Kan backbone. The results indicate good, though reduced, expression of BclA-YFP compared to the internal YFP.
In return, we performed microscopy on two devices built by the BU team: pTet-pBad-RFP ( BBa_K1401009 ) and pBad-pTet-RFP ( BBa_K1401010 ). The pTet-pBad-RFP or pBad-pTet-RFP expressing E. coli strains were cultured in LB with chloramphenicol plus the additives indicated overnight at 37°C overnight with shaking. 20µL samples of each culture were dropped onto microscope slides and allowed to air dry.  Slides were then fixed in methanol for 10 minutes, dried, and wet mounted with a coverslip in a 50% glycerol solution. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss AxioVert miscoscope with an 100x oil immersion lens, and imaged with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. Images were acquired using Zen software, and processed with Adobe Photoshop. All images were exposed for 2 seconds. Brightness and contrast adjustments made during processing were applied equally to all panels within the figure.
The results indicate good induction of the pBad-pTet device. The concentrations of aTc used for induction of the p"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A TOOL FOR DIAGNOSING IBD BASED ON ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING
The ETH Zurich iGEM team 2016 will focus on the diagnostic monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease. Current diagnostic methods are invasive and rely on biomarkers that are not sufficiently disease-specific. We have engineered Escherichia coli that have the potential to detect several disease-specific biomarkers and to memorize this event. While Pavlov's Coli travels through the gut, simultaneous detection of IBD markers activate an AND gate which triggers a unidirectional switch, thus committing the observation to memory. The addition of a candidate biomarker to the bacteria isolated from the patient's faeces induces the expression of a fluorescent protein, if this biomarker has been memorized. Thus, a single reporter is sufficient to differentiate between many different candidate markers. A community of sensor cells with different sensing specificities can be utilized at the same time, enabling a high degree of multiplexing. Pavlov’s Coli holds promise as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, potentially able to shed light on microbiome imbalances associated with IBD.
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by chronic inflammation of parts of the intestine. The term describes an ensemble of conditions, the most common of which are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. IBD is classified as an autoimmune disease for which no cure has been developed. Current treatments include immunosuppression, surgery, antibiotics and nutritional therapies. IBD is not only a severe burden for the patients, but it also causes increasing direct and indirect costs for society. Furthermore, only in Europe 2.5 million people are affected by IBD and the number of cases is increasing world-wide 1 .
Unfortunately there are no characteristic blood markers to distinguish between the different forms of IBD. The diagnosis is mostly based on the location of inflammation observed during a colonoscopy. Also the underlying trigger of the disease is not"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#experiment#exp4_-_-_TEXT.html," a mammalian where post-transcription modification exists. aceA and aceB construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one plasmid.
ACEA Construct
Backbone
For ACEA construct, we decided to use a commercial plasmid called pShooter/myc/mito (Invitrogen). The vector is designed for expression in mammalian cell. In addition, the vector already contains mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS), a constitutive CMV promoter, Myc tag protein and polyadenylation site.
Constitutive Promoter
In order for the prokaryotic genes to be expressed in mammalian cell, we need to fuse them with eukaryotic promoter. In order to generate the same result as UCLA team’s experiment, we adhere to their choice of promoter by fusing aceA gene with CMV promoter. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is a commonly used constitutive promoter to drive protein expression in mammalian cell.
Assembly
ACEA construct is assembled by extracting out aceA gene from E. coli BW25113 genome. The ligation product was confirmed by digestion check and sequencing.
ACEB Construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for ACEB construct.
Constitutive Promoter
In line with the UCLA’s experiment, we will fuse aceB gene with human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1alpha) promoter. EF-1alpha promoter is often useful in conditions where other promoters (such as CMV promoter) have diminished activity or have been silenced. We cloned EF-1alpha promoter from plasmid called iDUET101a (Addgene).
Tag protein
We engineered in a FLAG protein tag in the 3’ ends of AceB by including the sequence in aceB extraction primer.
3’ primer to extract aceB with engineered FLAG tag gene sequence:
GATCAT CTCGAG CTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATC CGCTAACAGGCGGTAG
[6’ Cap][6’ XhoI restriction site][24’ FLAG protein][25' reverse complementary of 3’ aceB]
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Since pSB1C3 backbone does not have any MLS and aceB needs to be translocated to mitochondria to serve glyoxylate shunt, we extract MLS out from pShooter/myc/mito (Invitrogen).
Assembly
ACEB construct contain 5 parts that needs to be assembled: EF-1alpha promoter, mitochondria leader sequence, AceB engineered with FLAG tag, and"

After a round,   5 more cards are dealt and the game continues, the winner is the person that  wins the most rounds.
Initial testing at The Judd School (July 2016)
Playing the game
After making an initial prototype the team took the game  to The Judd School, a secondary school in Tonbridge,   United Kingdom, to be tested by a group of GCSE students. We started  off the day by introducing the iGEM project as well as explaining   a few fundamental synthetic biology terms such as BioBricks and   plasmids. After forming two groups, the students began to play   the game under our supervision and quickly grasped the rules.   All of the students got involved with the game, often reacting   enthusiastically whenever a mutation occurred in a cell.
Interviews and Feedback
Even though the game was a hit with the students,   we still wanted to determine if the game was a viable option   as an educational resource; the game needed to be able to educate  and inspire students. After the session we conducted a number   of interviews with some of the students, with a few saying that   they were much more likely to study biology after playing the game.
I barely knew about any of this before today, I’m definitely  much more likely to take Biology for A-Level.
We interviewed two teachers at The Judd School to ask if they would  consider using a learning resource such as our own in their lessons   and if they thought the board game would prepare their students for   entering iGEM in the coming years. The head of key stage 3, Dr Courel,   thought that as the game enables students to consider real life applications   for genetically modified organism, and that this would aid the students when   thinking about their own iGEM project. The head of biology at Judd School,  Mrs Andrew’s thought our game would make a great intermediate step between  theory in the classroom, and introducing students to the wet lab.
Improvements
The Judd School visit was both a successful and productive,   as we got plenty of high quality feedback from both students and teachers   on how we could improve the game to educate more effectively and reach out  to more schools.
The students suggested a number of minor improvements to   the gameplay through a short survey, the results of this can be found here . The largest change to our game came after Mrs"

We could therefore infer the bacterial density present in the tumor: 5% of the volume is locally filled with bacteria, in a shell shape. As for other tissues, to be on the safe side, we take as a reference value a concentration of bacteria corresponding to the maximum observed in any healthy organ, for any bacterial strain that as been tested in the paper. This amounts to 1x107CFU.g-1, and corresponds therefore to a bacterial density of around 0.05%

Because it is hard for us to have face to face communication with other teams, we had a We-chat communication group FAFU CCiC with them. This group consists many teams, like BIT-CHINA. We shared our idea with many college students, and they gave us many professional suggestions and kind help.
Social impact
Environmental impact
Our product can help the environment in three ways. First of all, with our modified yeast, food waste decomposition rate will be greatly increased, and then we no longer need to worry about the soil pollution which is brought by traditional kitchen waste digestion-landfill. As the amount of kitchen waste that is digested by landfill decline, salt and other toxicant will gradually stop entering into the soil. Secondly, after decomposition by our genetically modified yeast, some of the useless kitchen waste might be efficiently changed into biological fertilizers. This type of biological fertilizer not only enhances crop production, but also can help the soil maintain a high fertility.  Last but not least, burning of kitchen waste can be replaced by our decomposition method, which will effectively relieve the current unpleasant situation of air pollution.
Economic impact
Our project is aimed to increase the tolerance of yeast in hypertonic environments during food waste decomposition. With our modified yeast, survivability of yeast and their decomposing efficiency can be greatly increased. Currently, most of the companies have to add new yeast periodically to keep the decomposition rate. With the help of our yeast, the companies can save more costs by reducing the needs of large amount of yeast and increasing the decomposition efficiency.
Humanity impact
Because of the effectiveness of our modified yeast in food waste decomposition, people will be able of enjoy a safer and more comfortable life in a fresh and clean environment without the negative effects caused by the food waste.

Secondly, the CAA assay uses an artificial synthetic fluorescent probe DCFH-DA, which is widely                         used to detect ROS currently, but the authenticity of the data obtained by this probe is                         questioned. [23]
MTT assay

MTT assay [24][25] breaks through the defect that the traditional chemical method can only detect single free                         radical, and the cell survival rate is used as the standard to characterize the antioxidant                         activity. However, the evaluation of MTT assay is not very good, because its detection                         condition is too critical for the cell and the cell survival pressure is very high. [26]

Based on the problems mentioned above, we want to screen excellent antioxidants to help us                         scavenge ROS against aging and diseases. Our goal is to build a system with function of                         detecting the antioxidants and has the advantages of high biological relevance, simple                         operation, low-cost, good reproducibility, accuracy, and high sensitivity for antioxidant                         detection. More importantly, we hope to establish an efficient standard for evaluating                         antioxidants through our system.

NU_Kazakhstan,2013,Team:NU Kazakhstan#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," diagnostic value in complex biological samples. Therefore, the development of highly sensitive and selective sensors capable of simultaneous detection of multiple analytes has attracted much attention. Compared with the traditional single-analyte immunoassay, the simultaneous multiplexed immunoassay is more efficient in clinical application since it can quantitatively detect a panel of biomarkers in a single run with improved diagnostic specificity (Tian et al., 2012). Moreover, the multiplexed immunoassay can shorten analytical time, enhance detection throughput, and decrease sampling volume and detection costs.  The approach proposed in this work combines the advantage of using aptamers for recognition of specific cancer biomarkers, magnetic nanoparticles for separation and quantum dots for detection, resulting in a novel, portable, and rapid competitive tool for sensitive and selective multiplexed detection of cancer biomarkers. Since biosensors for biomarker detection involve a biological recognition element, it is necessary to develop an ideal candidate possessing advantages over traditional antibodies, and aptamers can be a good example of it.
Aptamers are short single stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) or RNAs that have an ability to bind to... Aptamers
Aptamers are short single stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) or RNAs that have an ability to bind to various targets with high affinity and specificity and can be developed by way of repetitive cycles of affinity selection and PCR amplification. Being an emerging group of recognition elements, aptamers hold significant advantages over antibodies such as they do not require a host animal for production since in vitro combinatorial biochemistry is applied in this process, exhibit high binding affinities for their targets, and are resistant to biodegradation and denaturation.  To use aptamers versus antibodies in our experiments will be vital since aptamers have been shown to distinguish intimately related substances from their targets on the basis of minor structural changes, such as a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a urea vs. a guanidine group. Moreover, there is one more big advantage of aptamer application in biosensors. The capability to regenerate the function of immobilized aptamers would be the most attractive characteristic of aptamers. Being nucleic acids, aptamers could be exposed to repeated cycles of denaturation and renaturation. Heat, salt concentration, pH of the medium, and chelating agents could work as aptamer regeneration methods (Jayasena, 1999). According to experience of Bruno et al. (2009), the DNA aptamer–MB and aptamet–"
Kyoto,2011,Team:Kyoto#Luminescence_-_-_TEXT.html," is a graph which shows the spectrum of light emitted by V. fischeri in 2010 Cambridge Team's WIKI(--> link ). The peak wavelength is about 500 nm and we can see that the large part of light emitted by BBa_K325909 is in the range of wavelength suitable to lure drosophilas.
3. Experiment 1 --- Drosophila's phototaxis in different colors
We made an experiment about drosophila's phototaxis to the lights of different colors(ultraviolet, blue, green, red, and infrared) to show that our assay with a Y-maze is reliable.
In the Y-maze, There are two diodes at the two ends of the both sides; one is lighting and the other is not lighting. In an assay, we gathered 5 flies with a pooter and put them into the bottom end of the Y maze. After 3 minutes, we counted the number of the flies in each side. ( read the materials and methods in detail )
Fig.4 : The method of the experiment with Y-maze
The results of these surveys can be summarized as follows (Vertical axis of these graphs indicates the average number of flies. error bars correspond to the standard deviation.) :
Fig.5 : This experiment were performed at UV light.
Fig.6 : This experiment were performed at blue light.
Fig.7 : This experiment were performed at green light.
Fig.8 : This experiment were performed at red light.
Fig.9 : This experiment were performed at infra-red light.
In all of these results, the number of flies in light sides is larger than those in the opposite sides. After we run the t test and chi-squared test of those data at a significance level of 5%,  it was revealed that the flies gathered significantly at the LED end under UV light, blue light and green light. On the other hand, when red light was used, the difference between the 2 ends was negligible. This is consistent with the results reported by [2] that drosophilas have a strong positive phototaxis to the light of wavelength shorter than 500nm. It means that our assay of drosophila's phototaxis with Y-maze is a certain assay.
Experiment 2 --- Assay of drosophila's phototaxis to the light emitted by E.coli
We confirmed that our assay with Y-maze is reliable by experiment 1, and we intended to assay the phototaxis to the light emitted by E.coli."

Every iGEM team have its strength and weaknesses. And every project have flaws that could not be seen in a single perspective. Through in-depth collaborations, we can complement each other’s weakness with our strength, and refine our project by evaluating one another.
Mentoring with UCCKE
The Hong Kong UCCKE team aims to create biobricks that detect and degrade uric acid in order to control gout disease. We mentored the team by providing advice, protocols and also helping them to do experimental work. In the beginning of their project, they had difficulty in designing their experiment, especially when designing the assay for characterizing their biobricks. We helped them to construct an assay for measuring the fluorescence signal of their detection module. The assay can be done by incubating transformed E. coli in LB medium with saturated uric acid overnight followed by measuring fluorescent signal in plate reader. The detailed protocols can be viewed below. When they started doing their wet lab, they encountered difficulty in cloning their biobricks. To help them solve the problem, we have provided many advice. For example, to deal with the low insert concentration problem, we suggested them to amplify the synthesized DNA before doing restriction cut. We also suggested them to do restriction map before sequencing. We emphasized them the importance of negative and positive controls when troubleshooting problem of cloning and assaying. At the final stage of the project, we helped them to clone biobricks in parallel. We also helped them to sequence their plasmids and analyze sequencing result. Luckily, they constructed their biobricks on time. After having the biobricks, we helped them to perform the uric acid assay because they do not have plate reader in their school. In return, the Hong Kong UCCKE team helped us to 3D- print our hardware detection kit. They also provided us suggestions on the improvement of the prototype. They helped us a lot because we do have any knowledge in product designing and 3D printing previously.

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the heat pulse had finished.
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and we split the experiments in two batches. FI and OD were measured at t1=60 min, and t2=120 min for batch number 1, while for batch number 2 the heat shock was delayed 40 min with respect to the first batch. Therefore, measurements for batch no.2 were taken at t1=100 min, and t2=160 min respectively.
During the 40 min delay, the microorganism was growing. Therefore, the heat shock in batch no. 2 was applied to a larger population than in the case of batch no.1. Consequently, the measurements of FI and DO gave much higher values. This fact affects the ratio FI/DO, were the two batches can be clearly distinguished (see figure 4).
Figure 4.
Raw data from the heat shock experiment.
Our first modeling work was aimed to obtain data reconciliation. To this point,  we assumed that, during this 40 min delay, the only thing that happened was that cells grew. Growth was approximately linear in the range analyzed, as seen in figure 1 (blue data). We fitted a simple model DO=p1+p2*t. The result can be seen in figure 5, were:  p1 = 0.161573  p2 = 0.000866314 Therefore, the above ratio FI/DO can be compensated by multiplying data by the fractions (p1+p2*t100)/(p1+p2*t), and (p1+p2*t160)/(p1+p2*t). Actually, what we did was to compensate all measurements to the same time base. The reconciled results can be seen in figure 6.
Figure 5.
Model fitting for OD w.r.t. time.
Figure 6.
Recoinciled data for t=60min and t=120min.
Once we had all data reconciled, we fitted them to a static model relating the ratio between fluorescence intensity (FI) and the culture optical density (OD) with the temperature applied during the heat shock.
Since the model is nonlinear with respect to parameters K1 and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at t=60 min, and t=120 min independently. The estimated parameters were:
The results can be seen in figures 7 (t60), and 8 (t120) respectively.

We added 600 mM NaCl and 2% Glucose to LB medium because it is known that storage of trehalose is increased under osmotic stress and also because glucose is a precursor of trehalose (2). Escherichia coli strain TOP10/ pSB1A2-Plow-RBS-otsBA (BBa_K1339018) was cultured in LB medium containing 600 mM NaCl and 2% glucose at 150 rpm, 30 ℃.
Fig.2 shows the growth curve of transformants. From the result, we found that this transformant reached stationary state after 15 hours cultivation.   So, we decided to culture the cells harboring the cell harboring otsBA for 12 hours (while exponential growth) for further evaluation.

2. Optimization of trehalose detection by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method
We used TLC plate coated with silica gel. As standard sample, 1 μL of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 mM glucose and trehalose were spotted onto TLC plates and dried at room temperature. The TLC plates were developed in acetonitrile –water (7:3), dried and dipped into H 2 SO4-ethanol (5:95). Fig. 3 showed the result of TLC of glucose and trehalose. The Rf value of glucose is approximately 0.47. And the Rf value of trehalose is approximately 0.35. The detection limit of glucose and trehalose were 5 mM and 10 mM respectively.
Thus, in our experiments, we tried to confirm the production of trehalose by E.coli by this method.

3. Optimization of enzyme reaction time
To measure the concentration of trehalose, trehalose was converted to glucose with trehalase, which was then measured using a glucose dehydrogenase. At first, we investigated the optimal enzyme reaction time. Trehalase was added to 50 mM trehalose solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 ℃.

Investigators: Jan, Anna, Melanie, Kevin, Roman, Judith
This time we inoculated the reactors with a 70/30 ratio of E. coli JM109::K1073034/E. coli Top10F'::K1073035 and cultivated for 22h under constant observation to make sure we didn’t miss potentially interesting growth behavior. Samples were taken every hour. After plating a diluted sample on agar plates with chloramphenicol, OD520 was measured for monitoring the growth behavior. In comparison to earlier reactor cultivations, this time we added 5 µg/L clavulanic acid to the cultivation media (2xYT + either ampicillin in first reactor or chloramphenicol in second reactor) to suppress the background expression of beta-lactamase.

Investigators: Jan
We conducted another ratio test on Wednesday. Therefore 2xYT media with ampicillin and 0.01 µg/mL were inoculated with different ratios of E. coli Top10F’::K1073035  and E. coli JM109::K1073034 and cultivated for 14 hours. Additionally a control on chloramphenicol was cultivated. Unfortunately this time the clavulanic acid concentration was too low and the cells grew as if cultivated without clavulanic acid.
Week 20: September 29 - October 4, 2013
This week we spent time evaluating our last continuous cultivation of mixed E. coli JM109 and Top10F' containing our final constructs. Other than that we prepared our data and ourselves for the upcoming regional jamboree.

To protect our contributor’s human rights, respect their dignity and privacy, avoid any form of discrimination as well as ensure their integrity and wellness, we took into consideration the universally recognized ethical standards which are principles of benefit, no maleficence, justice and respect for autonomy.
We also made sure our procedures where according to the Mexican Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Individuals.2 We requested a letter from our institution approving our social science research was done in accordance with their ethics code and values and under the stipulated in the annexed letter, we also requested a consent letter filled up by our participants where they accept we share their information on our webpage and in the Giant Jamboree's presentation. Trough this letter they also recognize our behavior and procedures were done according to the iGEM values.

Silver Human Practices
From the first time you set foot outside the laboratory and leave scientific articles aside to interact with people related to your project, you begin to realize how crucial human practices are.
Human practices allowed us to investigate and validate the purpose, design, scope, and execution of our project. Is our product suitable for beekeepers to use? Will it disturb the innocuousness of honey? Is it capable of counteracting more diseases?  Is it permissible before the law? These are some of the questions that were answered throughout our human practices chronology; we were driven to think, reflect, and act on it as our integrated human practices.
Beekeepers, beekeeping societies, international organisms, government representatives, and researchers were all essential for fortifying our research.

Government Institutions
Thanks to regulations and laws that promote safety and well-being, it is possible for a project to be fully implemented. The rapprochement with governmental institutions focused on the primary sector allowed us to consider essential legal aspects for the development and execution of our project; It was thanks to these meetings that the legal plan was formed.

UESTC-software,2016,Team:UESTC-software#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". To have a future blueprint of our project, we talked with pupils about the DNA information storage in the activity, “To Be Scientists Tomorrow”. They were very active and said they wanted the files would not be lost. Children said what they like, absolutely, their innocence inspired us.

We collected the professors’ suggestions besides the ordinary people. We met and discussed in iGEM Southwest China Union. The participants not only focused on software functions, but also were curious about the algorithms. During the communication, they gave suggestions about the development of software performance from a professional view.
Evaluation of Our Approach
On the way to achieve our goal, we concentrated on the progress of our project and its result. As we found there were the points that were not considered, we decided to change our approach. Throughout this process, we learned evaluation is a result of hard work.
Evaluation of Propaganda
According to various interviews, in fact, most people generally believed something related to synthetic biology is dangerous. So they did not eat genetically modified food as far as possible. We introduced simply about synthetic biology and tried to eliminate their mistakes. Obviously, not all of people can accept us. But we will continue to make efforts to correct the  thinking of public.
From the lecture, students knew more about synthetic biology and are all more interested in biology. Creating plasmids by their own hands makes the technology easily understood. Then the activity let children feel biology more directly through doing experiment by themselves. We remember one boy said that experiment is untouchable in ordinary life, today he felt cool and excited. This is what we want to achieve. The activity changed the stereotyped images of biology, and it becomes vivid in masses’ eyes. Young children are new-rising force of our country. Letting them realize the great development prospect and arousing their interests in biology are significant to continue biology studies.
Evaluation of Edutainment
Bio2048 is a special tool to learn biology. We practiced to test its feasibility. We opened a sina microblog to push our project progress and it has already attracted 1030 fans. Many people made comments after trying, and most said that the game was attractive for the combination of knowledge and enjoyment. Some thought that our game was lack of description words, therefore, we added introductions to build a learning mode in the game for easier understanding.
Students in primary and middle school are extremely interested in the way of acquiring new conceptions. Teachers are surprised to see that it isn’t only a kind of edutainment but also an integration of math and"

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," al., 2002 ). The two genes for the sensing system are virA and virG ( Stachel SE and Nester EW, 1986 ) which are constitutively expressed at a basal level. VirA is a histidine kinase. An autophosphorylation occurs at the His-474 residue, after sensing the phenol 3,5-dimethoxyacetophenone,  acetosyringone ( Huang Y et al., 1990  ; Jin SG et al., 1990a ). In the next step in the signal transduction cascade, the phosphorylated VirA leads to the transfer of the phosphate to Asp-52 residue of VirG ( Jin SG et al., 1990a  ; Jin SG et al., 1990b  ; Pazour GJ and Das A, 1990 ). VirG is the response regulator of the two-component system (Brencic A, Winans SC, 2005) and acts as a transcription factor. Hence it binds to the virulence box (vir Box) containing promoters, for example the virB promoter ( Jin SG et al., 1990a  ; Pazour GJ and Das A, 1990 ).
VirA receptor structure
The VirA receptor consists of 829 amino acids and is a transmembrane protein in the inner menbrane of A. tumefaciens ( Melchers LS, 1989 ). VirA spans the inner membrane, with two transmembrane domains, a large periplasmic region, and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain ( Banta LM, 1994 ). VirA directly senses the phenolic compounds for vir activation ( Lee YW et al., 1996 ). Therefore the linker domain is essential for induction by phenolic compounds ( Chang CH and Winans SC., 1992 ). The linker region is located in the cytosolic site at position 280 to 414 ( Lee YW et al., 1996 ). This region between the amino acids 283 and 304 was highly conserved in four different strains of Agrobacterium, and therefore likely to serve as the receptor region for the phenolic inducers which are common to all four strains ( Turk SC et al., 1994 ).

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."
