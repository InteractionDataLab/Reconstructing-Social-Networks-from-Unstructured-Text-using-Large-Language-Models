eGFP: 8,9/ml
Note:
Unfortunately, (almost) no colonies have grown of CaXMT1 and CaDXMT1. This is a bit strange, because the same medium was used at the inoculation and all colonies had grown in the SC-U 2% glucose medium. The induction of the expression will be repeated with these transformants.
The taken samples were centrifuged at 1500xg for 5 minutes at 4°C (200ml in several steps, eGFP 50ml in one step) and washed with 10 and 5 ml water, respectively. Afterwards, the suspension was centrifuged again and resuspended in 2ml water. The suspension was repelleted again and stored at -80°C until further usage.
Preparation of over night cultures
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the preparation of over night cultures of E.Coli- cells, having been transformed with the CaXMT1-, CaMXMT1- and CaDXMT1- expression cartridges, in order to have a sufficient amount of the plasmids (i.e. composite parts).
Operational sequence:
A single colony grown on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol was picked and used for inoculation of 6ml liquid LB medium containing 6µl of a chloramphenicol solution (final concentration: 30µg/ml). Incubation was done at 37°C over night with 180 rpm.
Harvesting of cells (S. cervisiae + pTUM104_Preprothaumatin)
Investigator: Martin, Alois
Aim of the experiment:
5. Determine the OD600 => 6.7. 6. Centrifuge the cells at 1,500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. 7. Decant the supernatant (stored at 4°C; secreted thaumatin?). Resuspend cells in 8 ml of sterile water. 8.

Events Attended
Oxford Biochemistry Alumni Event @ the Royal Society
Team members Glen Gowers and Philipp Lorenz attended the 2014 London Biochemistry Alumni Event hosted at the Royal Society. The occasion attracted alumni from across a period of more than 50 years – bringing together those who completed their PhDs in the 1950s, with students graduating last year. Following an introduction by Head of Department Mark Sansom and talks from two Royal Institution Christmas Lecturers, our iGEM team members entertained guests with their presentation.
Synthetic Biology: Short Past, Long Future
Oxford iGEM meet up in collaboration with SynOX
On June 19th 2014, the Oxford iGEM team invited all of the teams in the UK and Ireland to the first British and Irish meet-up of 2014. Hosted in the Oxford University Biochemistry Department and co-organised with the Oxford Society for Synthetic Biology (SynOx), the event was attended by 15 iGEM teams as well as Oxford University undergraduates and postgraduates.
The day included three talks about synthetic biology and iGEM:
Dr Jarek Bryk (National Centre for Biotechnology Education, University of Reading – current mentor of Reading iGEM) spoke about what it takes to get synthetic biology incorporated into university teaching and about his dedicated efforts towards establishing the Reading University iGEM team.
The iGEM supervisor’s perspective was presented to us by Dr Richard Kelwick (researcher at the EPSRC National Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation, Imperial College London) along with the lessons he has learned from being a mentor to the past three Imperial College teams.
Last, but certainly not least, Randy Rettberg (Founder and President of the iGEM foundation) imparted to us his vision of synthetic biology as the next revolution in humanity’s technological development.
The talks were filmed to enable a livestream feed of the event to be broadcast live to those unable to attend: even allowing them to be involved in the question and answer session.

Human Practices
Overview
An important aspect of synthetic biology is the consideration of how the technology has applications in the context of the wider society. We believe that collaborating with scientists, clinicians, social scientists, patients and the general public is essential to ensuring that our product benefits society. Our approach to human practices involved working with professionals, patients and the public to understand their opinions about various aspects of our project, and using this feedback to alter the design of our project and tailor our educational outreach activities.
The focus of our work on human practices was to integrate four major themes:
- Applied Design
Our approach to applied design involved creating surveys and interviewing patients to analyse the unmet patient needs and the most important issues that require addressing to improve patients’ quality of life. Regular conversations with patients, as well as professionals experienced in law, manufacture and clinical delivery of therapeutics, enabled our design to continually evolve in light of this feedback.
- Public Engagement and Outreach
As a field still in its infancy, public knowledge of synthetic biology is limited and is often viewed with scepticism. As a result, public acceptance of genetically engineered therapeutics will be restricted by public knowledge unless educational resources are provided. The provision of summer school classes, public outreach events, online resources and a long-term public education plan were parts of our public outreach efforts. Our public engagement was integrated with our work covering applied design, as we remained open to feedback and used guidance from the public to shape our product design.
- Entrepreneurship
Our focus on entrepreneurship was a way of understanding how our therapeutic could be transitioned from the lab into the real world. We interviewed IBD patients and other key decision makers to determine the best value proposition. We surveyed the public about their preferences for potential products, and considered patents and regulatory procedures governing how our therapeutic can be taken into market.
- Safety
Safety is an essential consideration for the design of any genetically modified organism, particularly those used as medications. Discussions with clinicians and researchers, as well as some of the questions raised by patients and public we spoke"

As TOR pathway is the core controller of intracellular phosphorylation, mutations or genetic engineering on TORC1, in other words TOR1 or TOR2, would be the key to increase the tolerance to FAP and solve our problem. However, even though TOR pathway is proved to be a central element of signaling transduction, research on TORC1 of yeast are not so clear and well-understood for us to directly learn from. Fortunately, noticeable work has been done on mTORC1 (mammalian TOR complex 1) that modulation in certain amino acid sites could improve the activity in response to adverse nutrient status and inhibitors. The high homogeneity between TOR in yeast and mammalian TOR (43% of TOR2 and 39% of TOR1) makes it possible to transplant the mutations of mTOR into the yeast. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of eukaryotic cell growth. In particular, mTORC1, one of the two complexes that contain mTOR, is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, proliferation, cell cycle and autophagy. Hyperactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway is observed in human cancer. A variety of approaches including deletion analysis, yeast genetic screens and mining of human cancer genome databases were taken that resulted in the identification of activating mutations of TOR. These studies suggest that the FAT, FRB and kinase domains are the three regions of TOR where activating mutations can be identified.
Experiments also showed that TOR2-mTOR hybrid protein in which the carbon terminal of TOR2 was replaced with corresponding part of mTOR was stably expressed in yeast, localized to the vacuolar surface, and associated with a phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase activity. What’s more, TOR2-mTOR and TOR1-mTOR hybrid proteins mutated at the position corresponding to rapamycin-resistant TOR mutants (S2035I) conferred rapamycin resistance. These findings directly indicate that the kinase domain in TOR and mTOR have been functionally conserved from yeast to man. The comparison of yeast TOR and mTOR domains also shows high similarity in the carbon terminal where most activating sites concerning the resistance of inhibitors is located.
The overlap in functions and activating domains render us to start with hyperactivating sites on mTOR appeared in Human cancer and drug resistance. In terms of several literatures, mutation sites can be sorted into three groups. Firstly, L1460P mutation in FAT domain and"

During our project, we brainstormed on how we can share our project or spread ideas in synthetic biology to
the public. We finally participated in nine Human Practice activities, covering Scientific and Social Thinking,
Project Assessment and Public Engagement. These activities also helped us improve our software design on
safety and model.
SCIENTIFIC & SOCIAL THINKING PROJECT ASSESSMENT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
Scientific & Social Thinking
Central China iGEM Consortium
   In order to promote the communication between iGEM teams around China and prepare for the incoming Giant
Jamboree, SYSU-CHINA and SYSU-Software organized Sun Yat-sen University Central China iGEM Consortium in
Hedanqing Lecture Hall, with 28 teams participating in. The consortium lasted for 3 days, consisting of the presentation
section and poster section, simulating the agenda of Giant Jamboree.
   We invited Yan Zhang, the vice president of our school to make a speech at the beginning of the opening ceremony.
We also invited Haoqian Zhang to share his iGEM experience and give his precious advice.
   In this consortium, we also presented our software, sharing our ideas with other teams and introducing our
Genexplorer.
Promoters and RBSs Calculation
   Our previous idea had found it was impossible to construct satisfied circuits by retrieving the promoter and RBS se-
quences from iGEM Registry and combining with CDS directly because most of the records in Registry lacking strength,
and we can’t determine which part we should use. Thus we developed a model from previous work to calculate the
strength of these parts through their sequences.
   Apart from the main project, we also wonder if we can use our model to calculate the strength of promoters of
RBSs in Registry. So we downloaded all sequence data from Registry and use our model calculating their strength.
We would develop this model into a small tool so that every team can use it to calculate the strength of their con-
structed promoters or RBSs.

Vera van Noort, Center for Microbial and Plant Genetics
The research group led by Vera van Noort is interested in understanding biological systems as a whole. They try to achieve this through computational analysis of large-scale data generated by the ever growing number of new technologies that can systematically measure the behaviour of multiple cellular components, such as biochemical activities, biophysical properties, subcellular localization and interaction. They use and develop new methods to integrate, visualize and query the large amounts of information available and in such a way come to new biological discoveries. A particular focus of the group is proteomics and post-translational modifications.
Yves Peeters, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology
After completing his master thesis at KU Leuven, Yves obtained an IWT fellowship for his PhD work in the field of synthetic biology. His primary interest goes to DNA polymerases and their modifications towards creation of artificial nucleic acids.

Cultures were then plated onto a LB agar + Chloramphenicol plate which were then innoculated in four locations with 10μl of connector 2 (C12 - Rhl) and grown overnight resulting in the picture below.
Figure 5: Initial Testing of Chromoprotein Reporter Variants
There is a visible vibrant colour change present for both the spisPink and the aeBlue chromoprotein variants however, as the colour of the amajLime is very similar to the wildtype colour, both in cultures, pelleted and plated, the colour is difficulty distinguished. For this reason, it was decided to carry forward the two brightest chromoproteins for further testing while optimising amajLime separately. In order to test these two chromoproteins reporter variants into the Sensynova framework, cultures of IPTG detector, processor unit and three reporter modules, two chromopreteins and the sfGFP control, were inoculated and grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol (12,5ng/μl). The cultures were then diluted at OD600: 0,1 and mixed together to obtain co-cultures with ratio 1:1:1 and 1:1:13. Some samples were supplemented with 1mM IPTG to induce the expression of quorum sensing molecules and eventually achieve the chromoproteins visualisation (Figures 6, 7, 8).

Dr. Gu’s review helped us to clarify a lot of details. For example, we found that, the most rewarding as well as the best applied situation in the allergy reactions are Type I hypersensitivity (or immediate hypersensitivity), for which the exposure may be by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or direct contact.
What’s more? During those days, we were also preparing for the exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum, so the review by Dr. Gu also inspired us how to make publicity to ordinary people. Above all, we could make sure that what we would disseminate was accurate, and after that we could try to demonstrate the allergy reaction process in the same Framework as Dr. Gu did, which was very easy to understand.
When this section was finished, we started to ask for some clinical data and experience which correlated tightly with our project.
Those facts and details included that histamine release in Type I hypersensitivity was within several mines, and remains for about 1h; the survival time of immunocytes by the normal way of storage since separated from body was about 24h; the volume of blood sample we were supposed to collect from finger was 10-20μl; the settings of controlled trials for every single test can help to get rid of the influence of Basophil count randomness, etc
The second clinician was Dr. Zhao, from the department of General Surgery.
He told us that himself is allergic to dust mite. And he had the experiment of treatment, so as both clinician and patient, he gave us several application possibilities at both hospital and home.
For the application at hospital, the blood could be collected via Hemospasia from vein, which just needed inserting the needle for one time. It’s already better than Skin Prick Test, for firstly it was in vitro and secondly it only made patient feel “hurt” for one time. And as for the required blood volume for each certain allergen test was relatively small, maybe over 200 allergens could be test with the blood sample collect from the patient at the same time.
For the application at home, it could be used by those patient being treated with desensitization therapy. They had to tracking therapeutic effect, and without our system, they would need return visits to hospital frequently. But once they got our system, they could do finger blood collection with simple hemostix themselves, and test the histamine release to the specific allergen, to which they are treated to get desensitization.

McMaster,2018,Team:McMasterA#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project."

Collaborations with FJNU-China
FJNU-China
2018 is the first year for FJNU-China team to participate in the iGEM competition, yet the teams competing in the first year are often lack of the relevant experience and grasp of the subject scale.
Since XMU-China team and FJNU-China are the only two teams in Fujian province in China, it is incumbent upon XMU-China team to instruct FJNU-China team and communicate with them to make the team fell they are parts of iGEM family as soon as possible.
In August, we held the Conference of Fujian Province iGEMer Community in China，and at the meeting, the both teams presented their own topics. Based on the topic of ideas, gene circuit design, experimental programs and practical application level, XMU-China put forward their own ideas, which helped FJNU-China better prepare for the competition and explain the ideas of their subject. After the meeting, we introduced them to the hospital's dermatologist and led them to visit the Xiamen Environmental Protection Bureau.
At the end of the competition, XMU-China provided years of experience to help FJNU-China to complete the safety form and judging form.

SYSU-Software
In the brainstorming stage, in order to solve the problem of preservation of Cas12a protein in microfluidic chips in hardware design, our team retrieved a large number of topics related to protein preservation in previous years. Finally inspired by 2017 TU_Delft's TDPs project and improving the characterization method. But it costed a lot of our time and efforts. After communicating with the team SYSU_Software in September, we asked them to quickly and accurately search for the previous project. They upgraded the functions of their software to cater our needs. We compared the information obtained by the manual search and the information obtained through the software search, and found that the software can be well positioned to the part of the experimental plan we need, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the manual search, but the work efficiency is improved and the work efficiency is lowered.

“We can never say gene doping is safe. There may be many unforeseen consequences. ”
Steve Chinn, Health Scientist at the University of Stirling
Apart from athlete health there are also public health risks inherent to gene doping use. There is a risk of viral spreading when unregulated therapies are brought to the market, which may pose a global and environmental threat. Also, unregulated implementation may lead to use of vectors that can infect athletes’ germ line, possibly causing harm to future generations. On top of this, the desire for performance enhancement is not only present within sports. Changing DNA for performance enhancement attracts public attention, and thereby might invoke public health hazards.
“It is a big risk to have a healthy part of the population on gene doping, of which the consequences are still unsure.”
Dr. Colin Moran, Professor in Genetics and Sports Science at the University of Stirling
Responsibility
Gene doping use is, just as more conventional doping, a decision made by the athlete. As became apparent from athlete interviews and surveys, athletes are under a lot of pressure to perform well, both intrinsically as well as by external stimuli from family and coaches e.g. Furthermore, due to the possibility of germ line infections, the responsibility of gene doping might not lie completely with a second generation athlete. The responsibility issue was a topic first brought up by an attendee at our presentation at the Delft Health Initiative and a topic we then further addressed in Stirling .
Social inequality
Social inequality has been a topic of discussion within current doping. Some types of material doping are allowed since, according to Moniek Nijhuis , an Olympic swimmer who told us her story, they 'are accessible to every athlete and do not harm athlete health'. However, many doping treatments are extremely expensive and not available to every athlete worldwide. This would include gene doping. On top of that, gene doping might have a lasting effect and has the potential to interfere with many more characteristics than just genes that enhance performance. Therefore, financial status could provide the rich only with the possibility of becoming a ‘better’ person when it comes to genetic constitution.
We addressed the challenges described above with the creation of our detection method and discussed the topics in our expert discussion at the University of Stirling. Here we talked about why gene doping detection is so important and why it is extremely important to unite strengths. You can watch the movie on this discussion below.

Our characterisation of existing BioBrick BBa_K759001
Aggregation Module inducible by arabinose in E.coli
Aim
To verify Assembly Standard 10 compliance
Methods
1. Standard restriction digest and gel electrophoresis
Escherichia coli bacterial culture containing plasmids BBa_K759001 (coding region of Ag43 only), was inoculated overnight in LB-chloramphenicol medium in a shaking water bath at 370C. Plasmid mini preps were conducted with a Qiagen plasmid mini prep kit. Single and double restriction digests were carried out accordingly:
Restriction digests with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI was performed to linearize the vector and to confirm the existence of unique restriction sites, as required by the iGEM biobrick Assembly standard 10 rules. Double restriction digests with EcoRI plus PstI and XbaI plus SpeI were performed to separate the BBa_K759001 insert from the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. Digests were incubated at 37370C for 2 hours and analysed by gel electrophoresis. Theoretical maps were used to calculate the expected sizes of the fragments and to compare them against the gel electrophoresis results.
2. Sequencing data
The plasmid was sequenced by the DNA Sequencing Services at University of Dundee .Sequencing analysis was performed on BBa_K759001 to confirm the suspected additional PstI sites. 6 sequencing primers (see Fig.1) were designed that were located evenly across BBa_K759001 (sequence data was taken from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts) plus both BBa_G00100 (forward primer that amplifies from the prefix)"
Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," homologous recombination, allowing the yEmRFP gene to replace the Ura3 gene. The 5-FOA solid medium and PCR experiments were used to screen correct colony PVRVC. The insertion of the last part referred to the previous method. This process is graphically displayed on the above figure.
To achieve mating, another mating type of wild haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 was used for modification. By digestion and ligation, we constructed vika gene on plasmid pRS416 which contains a selective marker Ura3, and plasmid pRS413 which contains a selective marker His. Then we introduced those two different plasmids into BY4742 respectively.
Results of Characterization of Mating Switcher
1) Proof of Existence of Device Parts
We built three device parts in total. They were integrated into the chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by transformation. We used colony PCR to prove the existence of these three parts in our strain. The result was showed as below.
Fig.2-2. The results of PCR of PVUVC, TVUVC, PVUVC colonies. (length of 7607bp, 7865bp, 8131bp) As we can see, three parts and all fragments had been amplified, which indicated that we succeeded in constructing them.
The PCR’s results confirmed that the target genes were ligated into chromosome correctly.
2) Verification of yEmRFP in the colonies
The main characterization method of verification of yEmRFP in the TVRVC applied by us was observing the expression of red fluorescent protein under the fluorescence microscope. By this way, it will be much more intuitive so that we can directly get the results. We took pictures under different visions and the results are as follows.The experiments of PVRVC regulation system used this assay method as well.
Fig.2-3. Microscope image of yeast cultured with SC-Leu with yEmRFP gene transformed.
Fig.2-3. Microscope image of yeast cultured with SC-Leu with yEmRFP gene transformed.
From these images we can clearly see the expression of yEmRFP. These images undoubtedly verify the yEmRFP gene has been transformed succeessfully.
3) Result of Mating
After we got the strain that introduced the yEmRFP gene, we let it mate with another mating type haploid yeast, which had plasmid with vika gene. The result was showed as follows:

Contamination Detection
The overnight culture created on 7/23 was examined under a light microscope for contamination.
100 μL of o/n culture was placed in a microcentrifuge tube and then vortexed to seperate the cells.
10 μL of the culture from the microcentrifuge tube was then placed on a glass slide and covered with a coverslip.
The cells were observed at 40x with a Nikon Eclipse 200 microscope.
Small circular cells were observed moving across the screen at a slow pace. The cells formed groupings of 2-3.
Nothing other of note was observed.

This may results from the CdS quantum dots’ property as a semi-conductor. In the design part about this photosynthesis system, we have a detailed introduction about light-catalyze of semi-conductor. With light energy, we can active the electrons to the conduction band which also create a hole spontaneously. Then the hole will be filled up with the electrons from the electrode. So the cathode current will increased.
In a word, with this outcome, we can safely conclude that CdS quantum dots can increase the cathode current with its semi-conductor property. So, with this photosynthesis system, we can further increase the speed of the electron transfer process which leads to the improvement of synthesis efficiency.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"Mutagenesis PCR
To make mutations in dCas9, mutagenesis PCR was used according to the Quikchange protocol . The adapted protocol that worked best for us is shown here.
Primers with mismatches to the template on the site of the mutation were designed using their online tool .  The following PCR mixture was made:

Most of the time, 100 ng template worked best for us. Additionally, 5 µL of 5x GC enhancer was needed to run the Ala10 → TAG PCR reaction successfully.
Then, the following cycling program was used to amplify the DNA:

Step 2-4 were repeated 30x.
PCR products were checked by gel electrophoresis. If amplification was successful, PCR products were cleaned using the Zymo PCR cleanup kit according to the accompanying protocol and eluted in water. The cleaned samples were digested for I.5 hours with DpnI, cleaned again, and 5 µL of the eluted sample (in water again) was used to transform electrocompetent cells. Resulting colonies were miniprepped and verified by sequencing.
Yeast assembly
To construct pEVOL-Asp, a construct containing an aminoacyl synthetase (aaRS) and tRNACUA (ref) suitable for incorporating Aspartate in response to the TAG stopcodon, yeast assembly was used. In this method, linear DNA fragments are transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To select for positive clones, one of the fragments is a part of the yeast expression vector pYES2. pYES2 contains the URA3 gene, which releases auxotrophy for uracil, as well as a 2µ ori for high copy maintenance in yeast. The other fragments included two IDT gBlocks containing the aaRS and tRNACUA, as well as part of pEVOL-pAzF 7 containing the arabinose promoter and CAT resistance gene.

Introduction
Background
SplitGFP
Split GFP is split into two fragments between amino acid residue 158 and 159, FA (N-terminal domain) and FB (C-terminal domain). FA alone can’t emit fluorescence. Equally, FB alone can’t emit fluorescence. When FA and FB co-express and meet, the fragments associate and restore fluorescence. Split GFP is used to research RNA detection and localization in vivo by fusion with RNA binding proteins.
Aptamer
Aptamers are nucleic acid or peptide molecules, that bind to a specific target molecule. There are many target molecules, for example enzyme, acceptor, virus protein, organic molecule, and so on. RNA aptamer requires a secondary structure formation (hairpin-loop, G-quartet, pseudo knot and bulge loop) to bind to a specific target molecule. RNA aptamers are useful in bio-engineering, because they are easier than proteins for mutation and prediction of secondary structure. In addition, RNA aptamers don’t need to be translated and they work rapidly.
MS2 and PP7
MS2 and PP7 are one of the single strand RNA phage coat proteins. RNA aptamer sequences and structures to recognize MS2 and PP7 coat protein have been determined.
Previous work
Camille J. Delebecque and his colleagues have reported organization of bacterial metabolism in vivo by using an RNA scaffold1. They used PP7 and MS2 fused with split GFP to evaluate the scaffold, consists of PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains, whether PP7 and MS2 proteins assemble. They succeeded in assemble PP7 and MS2 proteins.
2012 ZJU-China team registered parts (BB_K73800, BB_K73804, BB_K73805), PP7 and MS2 fused with split GFP which bind to PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains respectively. FA and FB emit fluorescence when they meet. Therefore, when a scaffold containing PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains are expressed, FA and FB come closer and emit fluorescence due to two fusion protein bind"

Meet the Advisors
All of the advisors gave us their knowledge and advice, both in technical matters and in the practical management of a team project. Olivia spent a great deal of time in the lab with us introducing techniques, offering her wisdom when things went wrong and making sure we didn't burn the place down. However the project itself was run by the students. It was up to us to decide on our topic and our strategy, finding information ourselves wherever we could. Synthetic biology, as a discipline is new to St Andrews, so our supervisors in some cases were amateurs in the same sense as we were. Therefore all work documented on our wiki is the work of the students unless stated otherwise.
Anne Smith
Anne's research is in the field of computational biology. She examines complex biological networks, developing and evaluating algorithms to infer functional interactions based upon observational data.  She works many levels of biological organisation, concentrating on networks in molecular, neuronal, and ecological systems.  Her current research concentrates on the use of Bayesian networks to infer interactions in these biological systems.

John Mitchell
John is interested in anything computational and related to molecules. After a PhD in theoretical chemistry, his first postdoc was in Biochemistry at UCL. He has been a lecturer at Birkbeck and at Cambridge, before coming to St Andrews in 2009. Since then, he has done lots of chemoinformatics, quite a lot of bioinformatics and only a little real theoretical chemistry. His scientific interests include computing the binding affinities between proteins and ligands, side-effects and toxicities of pharmaceuticals, and how much of a compound will dissolve in water. His group have worked extensively on the prediction of molecular properties such as melting point and solubility from chemical structure. They also use computational methods to study enzyme reaction mechanisms. They continue to develop the MACiE database of enzyme reaction mechanisms in collaboration with Prof. Janet Thornton at the EMBL-EBI.

HUST-Innovators,2014,Team:HUST-Innovators_-_-_TEXT.html," SMRT
Single molecule real time sequencing (also known as SMRT) is a parallelized single molecule DNA sequencing by synthesis technology developed by Pacific Biosciences. Single molecule real time sequencing utilizes the zero-mode waveguide (ZMW), developed in the laboratories of Harold G. Craighead and Watt W. Webb[1] at Cornell University. A single DNA polymerase enzyme is affixed at the bottom of a ZMW with a single molecule of DNA as a template. The ZMW is a structure that creates an illuminated observation volume that is small enough to observe only a single nucleotide of DNA (also known as a base) being incorporated by DNA polymerase. Each of the four DNA bases is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes. When a nucleotide is incorporated by the DNA polymerase, the fluorescent tag is cleaved off and diffuses out of the observation area of the ZMW where its fluorescence is no longer observable. A detector detects the fluorescent signal of the nucleotide incorporation, and the base call is made according to the corresponding fluorescence of the dye.
The DNA sequencing is done on a chip that contains many ZMWs. Inside each ZMW, a single active DNA polymerase with a single molecule of single stranded DNA template is immobilized to the bottom through which light can penetrate and create a visualization chamber that allows monitoring of the activity of the DNA polymerase at a single molecule level. The signal from a phospho-linked nucleotide incorporated by the DNA polymerase is detected as the DNA synthesis proceeds which results in the DNA sequencing in real time.
Phospholinked nucleotide
For each of the nucleotide bases, there are four corresponding fluorescent dye molecules that enable the detector to identify the base being incorporated by the DNA polymerase as it performs the DNA synthesis. The fluorescent dye molecule is attached to the phosphate chain of the nucleotide. When the nucleotide is incorporated by the DNA polymerase, the fluorescent dye is cleaved off with the phosphate chain as a part of a natural DNA synthesis process during which a phosphodiester bond is created to elongate the DNA chain. The cleaved fluorescent dye molecule then diffuses out of the detection volume so that the fluorescent signal is no longer detected.
Zero-mode waveguide
The zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) is a nanophotonic confinement structure that consists of a circular hole in an aluminum cladding film deposited on a clear silica substrate.[3] The ZMW holes are ~70 nm in diameter and ~100 nm in depth. Due to the behavior of light when it travels through a small aperture, the optical field decays exponentially"

which were improving on
BBa_M39904 Human Insulin cDNA
BBa_M1877 human insulin
 
Previous parts in the registry encoding ‘Human Inuslin’ were either incomplete or did not match human insulin when entered into a BLAST database. It seems as though there were few teams attempting to create human proinsulin (A, B and C-peptide chains) on a single vector, and so our addition of the complete verified human proinsulin coding sequence is an improvement on these previous parts. Furthermore, we have added an N-terminal His tag to our proinsulin constructs, allowing ease of purification using affinity chromatography. Our addition of an arginine residue between the His tag and the proinsulin protein allows simple one-step cleavage and removal of both the C-peptide and the His tag, as all have the same trypsin cleavage site (arginine residue).
 
The addition of the Ecotin tag assists in the expression of proinsulin by inducing its transport to the periplasm, an oxidative environment with reduced proteases, ideal for folding proteins with disulphide bonds such as proinsulin. Furthermore, periplasmic expression allows for a simplified purification procedure, as only the periplasmic fraction is required.
 
We have also used an extended ribosome binding site with high efficiency of recruitment, which is an improvement on parts entered that were only protein coding sequences.
 
 
MODELLING
We created multiple models and used them to direct the path of our project
 
We created models of three types: experimental, physiological and economic. In the experimental model we wanted to examine the complexities of optimizing recombinant insulin production from microbes, so we examined the practicality of multiple expression systems.
 
A model was produced that took into consideration the multiple energy costs within a cell, and examined the predicted success of multiple expression systems: cytoplasmic expression, periplasmic expression and secretion into the surrounding"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Application#Rollout_-_-_TEXT.html,", even though in developing regions there currently is a system where the health authorities decide.
In normal conditions there is no need to inform the patient about the technology behind the diagnostic, but we should inform about the GMOs when this is a sensitive topic in those countries.
In case of a severe epidemic, diagnostics cannot be imposed. Depending on the status of a disease, however, local governments can take measures to separate a patient from healthy individuals. Nonetheless, this scenario is seldom applied, as the diseases for which these measures are allowed are extremely scarce in number.
Read our ethics page to see the complete story of how we came to these conclusions.
Step 9.  Political impact on diagnostic availability
In addition to approval of global healthcare organisations such as the FDA and WHO, implementation of a new diagnostic also requires governmental approval from the country it will be implemented in. This approval is based on trial results obtained during initial testing of the diagnostic during development. The specific requirements for a diagnostic to gain approval varies per country. Unfortunately, these regulations are lacking in strictness for a large number of countries. As a result, the wrong choice for diagnostics is easily made, resulting in costly mistakes in clinical decision making [1].  Especially in developing countries, these regulations are insufficient due to the absence of a qualitative good healthcare system. Mantis aims to improve this situation, by becoming an affordable alternative, while still retaining a high level of safety and well-documented regulation.

Step 10.  Treatment
Once the tests have been performed, the group tested positively for the infections will be sent to the hospital for further testing and/or treatment. We found that this process could be improved in some situations. For example, the current tests for HAT are still troubled by a high false positive rate (up to 99%) and even false negatives [1]. This means that for all positively tested persons in a village, further testing is necessary through microscopic analysis on-site and extensive confirmation tests and staging in nearby hospitals. However, since many more patients are sent for further testing than is actually needed due to the false positive result of the screening test, this will increase costs for the involved NGO(s). According to dr. Philippe Büscher (Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp),"

Introducing a negative control. Stock LuxPQ BBk (of the uncut variety) will produce a distinct band on the gel around 7500 bp (accounting for the psB1AC3 plasmid and the LuxPQ gene), with fluctuations in levels based on the degree of coiling. Accordingly, if the NotI restriction digests did not actually digest, the digest lanes will resemble this control. This tube included 2uL of DNA, 1 uL of dye and 7 uL ddHOH
PCR products to evaluate specificity. If there are significant genetic mutations in the BBk sample, the primers will either not anneal at all (resulting in no PCR product) or anneal but give a product that is of a different size (if the mutations are beyond the primer domain).
Gel set-up
A 0.7% agarose gel was made. 10 uL of the aforementioned cocktails were loaded into each well, with the well key included in the results picture. Voltage was set at 90V and left to run for 50 minutes. A GenRuler 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder was run in parallel to provide size calibrations for our results.

HNS/HNST108I
We aimed to compare bacteria motility between two kinds of HNS knock-out E. Coli; first one expresses HNS protein and the other one expresses HNST108I mutant gene. In order to produce these proteins in high amounts, we chose to combine GadE sequence with T7 promoter, a promoter which has a high rate of transcription. In addition to this, to have a controllable system, LacI protein attachable Lac operator was added between these two gene’s sequences and T7 promoter sequence. We searched to find a vector which can lay down all those conditions and found out that peT-45 expression vector is useful. When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of HNS and HNST108I and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning them into peT-45. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequences and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered HNS and HNST108I genes into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final constructs after this cloning are; respectively T"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," When a colour is measured by the sensor, we multiply each of the components by corresponding coefficients and then convert it to the name of a colour. We also wrote a C++ program that takes the sensor values as an input and does all necessary calculations to output the actual colour of the sample.
Additionally we designed our experiment to measure the fluorescence of RFP and RFP cell count using a plate reader over a time course of 30 minute increments overnight. We prepared overnight cultures and are planning on diluting the samples by 4 to create 6 triplicate samples. The plate reader shakes the samples at a set speed and keeps the temperature constant. Our samples will be shaken at the fast speed. We plan to do a couple of experiments at different temperatures of 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C to see how temperature affects cell growth and fluorescence. Using this data we are going to plot the different concentrations and observe cell count/fluorescence vs. time course of 30 minutes to determine which concentration produced optimal results and at what time period. This experiment will help us determine a threshold for the optimal concentration and if this value plateaus, or decreases over time.  Using this data we will be able to determine parameters of this component of the system and be able to incorporate it into the entirety of our model.
Additionally this weekend consisted of a workshop in Lethbridge with the iGEM 2014 Lethbridge Team in which we were able to continue working with our data and modelling.  We also received valuable feedback regarding different aspects of modelling we should further explore.

Week 11: July 14th - July 18th
This week started with looking more into our Arduino - sensor set up. The colour sensor works a majority of the time, but every once in a while it would not turn on or would turn off when the serial window is opened in Arduino Programming Environment. Unplugging the Arduino and plugging it back in helps to get the sensor working again. The fact that the sensor is not working every single time suggests that there might be impurities in our circuit or code. We will be contacting lab technicians at Schulich School of Engineering that work with Arduino to arrange the meeting to discuss the problems with our set up.

The Aga2 protein (Aga2p, 69 amino acids) binds to Aga1p through two disulfide bonds and after secretion remains attached to the cell through its contact with Aga1p. The N-terminal portion of Aga2p is required for attachment to Aga1p, while proteins and peptides can fuse to the C-terminus for presentation on the yeast cell surface. A yeast display system is particularly useful for mammalian cell surface and secreted proteins (e.g., receptors, cytokines) that requires endoplasmic reticulum-specific posttranslational processing for efficient folding and activity.

Q5: How to establish a functional adhesion platform?
At first, we consider using INP surface display system in E.coli to display mSA for binding to biotin in S.cerevisiae and use OmpA surface display system to display cellulase and hemicellulase, so that cellulose and hemicellulose can be degraded and the product can be utilized by S.cerevisiae. However, we found that OmpA-CenA (a kind of cellulase in part registry) did not have the correct function as we expect. Therefore, we decide to construct the adhesion platform.
We use INP from BBa_K523013, BBa_J23106 and mSA from team Peking to build our part J23106-INP-mSA with a 4X linker. Similarly we acquire BirA from E.coli genome that can biotinylate biotin accepted peptide (BAP). In addition, we use pYD1 to display BAP on the surface of S.cerevisiae.
We co-culture these two strains and explore the proper condition to culture them together. To analyze this system with mathematical model, we also characterize the growth curve of these two strains and the only consumption rate of the corresponding carbon source. With these data, we simulate a co-culture model, and then feed back to our wet lab and optimize the experiment condition so that we can get the best ethanol production.

After 3 days of culture growth (shaking at 190rpm, at a temperature of 30°C) the cells are big enough to start with the delftibactin purification (liquid culture) and the fast test on the agarplates. For the fast test on the agarplates we prepare an soft agarose solution (0,5% agarose and 10mM AuCl3) and incubate every plate with 10 ml solution for two hours at rooms temperature. If delftibactin is present there can be observed a ring structure around the cells.
For the purification of delftibactin, the liquid culture will be centrifugated at  7000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant will be treated with HP20 resin (20 g/L) and then shaken 2h at 220rpm. With the Buchner funnel filtration the resin will be collected and washed with 400 ml dH2O. Afterwards the resin is again washed with 400 ml methanol which will be evaporate under rotary vacuum. The leftover is resuspended in 2 ml of ddH2O:MeOH (1:1). The solution is added to a HPLC column and the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) is analysed in a mass spectroscopy facility. The mobile phase consists in 2%-14% acetonitrile and  98% water +5 mM (NH4)2CO3.
After the purification we plan to mix the purified delftibactin with different gold solution (AuCl3) concentrations (between 5mM and 20mM). After a 2h incubation a precipitation would be observed.
In case the pre-experiment works, we have proven the reliability of the paper and the expected read out of the assay.

THEORY
The theoretical background for the efficiency and accuracy of the LCR is based on the un-gapped oligonucleotides and manner of construction of the BB.
Step 1
Build un-gapped oligonucleotides that are around 60bp each
Step 2a
Mix the oligonucleotides together.
Step 2b
Phosphorylate the 5’ ends of the oligonucleotides so that the Taq DNA Ligase (Thermostable) can work on ligating the spaces
Step 3 Use a chained reaction to allow the overlapping pieces to anneal and then use the ligase to join the DNA backbone.
This is the step where the efficiency and the accuracy are most obvious. The oligonucleotides have a very high specificity for their complementary strand. This is thanks to the ~30bp stretch of complementary DNA. There is also a very low possibility for loxP sites since a palindrome sequence is much harder to find as the stretch of complementary sites for annealing grow longer.
Step 4
Every step thereafter is the same as the old BAG protocol.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#Conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html," so we introduce a conjugation term that will allow donors and transconjugants to convert recipients to transconjugants. This term comes directly from Levin, 1979.
System of PDE's
Since there are three species we are concerned with there are three PDEs to our system. Let D represent the concentration of donors, R the concentration of recipients, and T the concentration of transconjugants. Each equation will have a diffusion and logistic growth term but the recipients and transconjugants will receive a third term for conjugation.

Results
We simulate a square area with size 1 cm2 using a simple finite difference scheme (first-order forward difference for time, second-order central difference for space). We use 100 grid points in each dimension so dx=dy=0.01 cm and then choose dt so that dt=(dx2+dy2)/10d where d=0.001 is the diffusivity. This provides results very similar to the ABM.

Remarks and Future Work
We regard the ABM as our main conjugation model, due to its accuracy. Unfortunately, its excessive runtime limits the amount of analysis that can be done on it. In order to conduct more analysis on the spread of our conjugative plasmid through the target population, we are planning to use the ABM to validate the PDE model. Initial, small scale results for the ABM (population size of < 100 000 bacteria) seem to correspond well to the PDE results.

Cells were incubated for       5 h at 37°C before centrifugation (900 RPM, 3 min, 24°C). Cells were resuspended with fresh DMEM to a final concentration of 1,5 x 10^5 cells/ml) and seeded (0,5 ml/well).
Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and the illuminated with blue light for 1 h (not the dark control).
Cells were infected with 250 µl virus supernatant (+0,5 µl Polybrene) per well. Medium was changed after 4 h of incubation at 37°C.
After 24 h and after 48 h of incubation 200 µl supernatant was taken and used for SEAP assay as described before.
Since, SEAP is already produced by Phoenix cells during generation of viral particles, SEAP was detected in every negative control.
Blue light induced receptor.
HEK cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292 and PKM297) and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003). The receptor was labeled with mCherry. Cells were infected with MuLV EGFP afterwards; (left) incubation in the dark, (middle) after illumination with blue light, (right) cells expressing the light induced receptor were infected with MuLV.

I. Background
“All of 2018 iGEM teams were invited and encouraged to participate in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.” Our team took part in this study which was aimed to figure out and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements. The main task was to quantify expression of GFP in common, comparable or absolute units. In our case, we measured fluorescence using plate reader.
II. Design
Fluorescence is widely used as a proxy for promoter activity by expressing fluorescent proteins such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Despite this is an indirect measurement, it provides a useful insight into expression levels and has significant advantage that it could be a real-time monitor without disrupting cells.
Fluorescence/OD600 is routinely used to give an adjustment of the relative expression per cell.

Expression of T1R2-T1R3
T1R2-T1R3 synthesis
Fig.1 The synthesis and expression of T1R2-T1R3
To synthesis human sweet receptor gene T1R2-T1R3, we firstly got its sequence from NCBI and used Snap Gene to optimize the sequence. Then we synthesized the target gene by using OLIGO (oligo design software).
To begin with, we designed 45 pairs of primers for each sweet receptor and each primer had a 15bp overlap region at each end. We divided the primers into 3 groups named block A, B and C, and mixed the primers of each group respectively with a final concentration of 10μM. We got 6 ideal fragments successfully after PCR and purification.
Fig.2 Oligo assembly. Overlap-Extension PCR.
protein tags
To verify whether the heterodimer had been expressed and located at the proper position successfully, we set different color proteins as tags to each sweet taste receptor. We chose blue, yellow and green fluorescent tags separately. For the primer design, we added another 20bp of N-terminal of each sweet taste receptor as the overlap region. The fluorescent tags were linked to each sweet taste receptor by OE-PCR.
Another way for verification was to add different epitope tags to each sweet taste receptor.
Fig.3 Human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3 heterologous expression
Fig.4 Fused Myc & His tag separately at the N-terminal of the target protein
However, according to the protein expression process, adding color proteins on the N-terminal of the target protein may not provide enough time for color protein to fold at its functional state before being secreted. So we plan to use His tag along with antibody detection.
T1R2-T1R3 expression
In order to express the human receptor T1R2-T1R3, we chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2-1C as the host and pESC-Leu as the shuttle vector. We selected two restriction sites, BamHI and Sal"

Achievements
Bronze:
Our team successfully registered for iGEM.
We had a great deal of fun during the summer and can’t wait to attend the Jamboree!
All of the required forms, including the judging and consent forms, were completed and sent in.
We completed a description of our project, which can be viewed on our team wiki. Our parts were submitted to the iGEM registry.
We included an attributions page on our wiki.
We created a poster for our project and it will be presented during the poster session at the Jamboree.
Our iGEM team was mentored by the Collegiate Team at the University of Lethbridge. They helped us with procedures and in designing our constructs.In addition to the Collegiate team, we hosted a high school iGEM workshop in February to help other iGEM teams in Alberta learn laboratory skills that they would need.
Silver:
We submitted the following parts to the iGEM Registry:BBa_K1792002 (Dextranase), and BBa_K1792004 (Nuclease).
We characterized our BBa_K1792000 (PDP) part.
We completed many human practice endeavors for our projects.
Gold:
We created an innovative human practices activity by creating a petition about amending the urban beekeeping bylaw in our community and distributing “seed bombs” to the public to encourage the growth of bee-friendly places within our city.
We hosted a workshop at the University of Lethbridge where the Central Calgary High School team, Consort Alberta High School team, and the OLS Canmore High School team were taught basic laboratory techniques, such as pipetting, miniprepping, and ligating that are essential to the lab component of iGEM."

To further investigate if dehyration is purely the cause for the color change I have been observing, I placed these same chromoproteins (Prancer Purple and Scrooge Orange) onto a small piece of filter paper which I then put in the -80 °C. Once the samples had been allowed to freeze for 20 min, I removed the filter paper and placed it in a lyophilizer (a device that dries a wet sample using a vacuum pump system) for an hour, taking pictures as time went on. I observed that Prancer Purple appeared pink when totally dehydrated and Scrooge Orange was almost impossible to see (it was practially white). After I removed them, I reydrated the colors and saw that while Scrooge Orange came back to its original color (as it does during the heat tests), Prancer Purple also comes back to its original color (this is not observed in the heat tests, it usually comes back as pink). These findings suggest that a combination of dehydration and heat contribute to the color change observed.

A protein extraction of a 1 mL culture of AE blue - CBD- His Tag was performed on an existing culture from last week. This was done to verify that the lumio tag was expressing the fluorescence we were expecting. From this I also determined that the protein is in the soluble fraction (I ran both the soluble and insoluble fraction on a gel and saw a band at the correct size in the soluble fraction lane).

Phytase
Design
At the core of Northwestern’s Phytastic Probiotic project are two main subprojects.
The first is to clone different phytases from different organisms into E. coli and then to engineer E. coli to constitutively express the phytases at varying levels. We used a lab strain of E. coli as a model chassis for this project, but our technology could be adopted to function in probiotic strains as well. The four phytases we chose were phytases from E. coli, citrobacter braaki, aspergillus niger, and bacillus subtilus. These phytases were selected based upon varying specific activities, pH optima, and temperature optima that are expected to be most compatible with physiological conditions of the stomach, as compared to other phytases. Our general methods comprised PCR from genomic DNA, gibson assembly,  and standard RFC10 biobrick assembly methods.
Construct
Each of the four phytases was PCR-amplified out of its respective organism’s genome.  However, due to the introns present in the the Aspergillus niger phytase coding gene, we had an intron-free version of this gene synthesized by IDT. We assembled these parts together using Gibson assembly. After PCR cleanup, gel electrophoresis was performed to verify that the expected band patterns were observed.
After gel verifying and sequencing each of the phytases, an unexpected restriction site was discovered in the middle of the Bacillus subtilus phytase gene that prohibited biobrick assembly. Thus, we decided not to pursue this phytase construct further at this time. The three remaining phytases were cloned into protein expression backbones from the parts registry with constitutive promoters and ribosome binding sites already cloned into the vector. Several promoters from the same promoter library were used as each has varying relative expression strengths. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing was again performed to verify that the parts were assembled as expected.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

Beginning Research in Non-Model Microbes with Concordia University iGEM , Cornell University iGEM , Northeastern University iGEM , University of British Columbia iGEM , University of La Verne iGEM , and Utah State University iGEM
Over the past few years, iGEM has increasingly centered around non-model microorganisms—organisms which are less well-characterized and have fewer resources for genetic manipulation than the model E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Despite a prevalence of non-model organisms in iGEM competition projects and the potential impact which these projects may have, few resources exist for teams hoping to initiate research in non-model strains.
The 2015 Yale University iGEM team has collaborated with several other teams working in non-model strains to design a set of considerations for future iGEM teams in order to reduce the barrier to entry into non-model organisms. We synthesized the experiences of other teams into a handout, which has been made available on our team wiki and will be available at out poster at the Jamboree.

The second plasmid codes for a modified Human Immunodeficiency Virus reverse transcriptase. The third plasmid codes for Murine Leukaemia Virus reverse transcriptase. These two reverse transcriptase plasmids were gifts from Voight Lab, MIT [6].  Each cotransformed bacterium would then be able to synthesize 1 of the 5 component strands of NDC or NDC-AS.
Successfully cotransformed bacterial colonies were picked and inoculated in Terrific Broth for overnight culture. This step is for mass production of the component strands we needed. After that, the single-stranded DNA synthesized inside the bacteria were extracted using TRIzol® Reagent and chloroform. At the phase-separation stage, only the top aqueous phase, which contained RNA and DNA single strands, was collected. The collected nucleic acids were then digested with RNAase A overnight to remove the RNA, leaving behind the DNA componant strands.
To check if these strands actually could form NDC and NDC-AS, we used them to assemble the nanostructures by PCR annealing as described above. The previously conducted PAGE was repeated. These E. coli-synthesized NDC and NDC-AS were also visualized under transmission electron microscope.
PAGE
The collected single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were suspended in water which contained leftovers of chemicals used in extraction. Because of this, these ssDNA could not be easily visualized on PAGE, as performed above for NDC assembled from chemically synthesized ssDNA.
None the less, we tried to amplify the ssDNA extracted using primers that overlapped with the component ssDNA sequences. We expected to get back bands of the expected ssDNA sizes as shown in Fig.1 and Fig.6 on PAGE. We also annealed the strands synthesized by ETHERNO, to see if large complexes similar to NDC and NDC-AS as shown in Fig.1 and Fig.6 could be produced.
Expected bands of Strand-1, Strand 1-AS, Strand 5 and Strand 5-AS can be seen in Fig.20a, which means these 4 strands were present in the ssDNA extracted from ETHERNO. Other strands could not be amplified here, may be due to problematic primer design. Designing primers for these nanostructure component strands was challenging due to the complicated secondary structures formed.
Since these extracted ssDNA were able to form large structures that could not pass through PAGE.(Fig. 20b),"

The created recombinant molecules are transformed into specific hosts: Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The constructs generated are screened and sequenced to confirm their successful assembly. The positive clones are passed to the characterization team.
Characterization
Fabrication Team Members:   Judith, Brittany, Meghan, Adam
The Characterization Team collects and analyzes data on our constructs after they have been designed and fabricated. They specifically want to determine how quickly the different fluorescent protein constructs mature and degrade. To collect data, they are using an automated microscope platform that includes a microfluidic system for trapping cells, and switching the available nutrients to them. All of the hardware is adaptively controlled by the software GenoSIGHT. This arrangement allows them to precisely control when cells are exposed to a stimulus, and automates the collection of fluorescence data. After data is collected it is compared to a mathematical model of expected maturation and degradation processes. Parameter estimation is then used to give us quantitative descriptions of our constructs. This information is used to compare different constructs, and it is passed back to the Design Team. The Design Team then compares these results to their expectations, adjusts their models accordingly, and generates new designs as necessary, beginning the cycle all over again.

Projects which could be useful for a space travelling:
REGObricks brings the principle of In-Situ Resource Utilization to bear on the problem of constructing, maintaining and expanding shelter for human inhabitants on the desolate Martian landscape.
By producing macromolecules essential to bacterial growth, PowerCell will form a metabolic foundation for the biological systems which will eventually enable a settlement on Mars.
Not about biosafety, but:
The team used GelRed, a DNA dye produced by Biotium Inc, as a non-toxic alternative to ethidium bromide (EtBr). Let's use it too!
They do not believe that their BioBrick parts will have any negative effect on the environment. But they could be interested by our project!

Since laccase takes about 80 days to degrade about 40% of the sample PE, we will also consider integrating a delay module into the alkane metabolism module, inspired by the iGEM team of HKUST 2017. The idea is that the alkane channel and alkane processing proteins will only kick into effect after 80 days of PE breakdown, so as to save cellular resources. The time delay module will be enabled by the phlF inducer, which induces the pHLFp promoter in front of the alkane metabolism genes. Since the genes have a lower RBS strength than that used by the phlF inducer gene, this will create a time delay when producing the alkane metabolism proteins.
6. Primary market research: Listening to our potential users
One of the aims of our public engagement and education exhibition was to find out the major concerns of the general public in choosing sources of renewable energy. This will help us to choose the focus and design our MFC to better suit the public’s concerns and aid in a more user-friendly design. The detailed analysis of our collected data can be found here
The results show that “impacts on human health” and “constraints in the conditions/ requirements for energy production” are the public’s major concerns. There are also concerns with the release of environmental pollutants such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid during the production of renewable energy generators. However, survey results show that the public had regarded this issue as less important as the long-term generation of renewable energies are comparatively cleaner than energies from fossil fuels where there are no chemical pollutants generated during energy production. Upon reviewing our MFC system design, the release of CO2 from our MFC will be produced as a by-product during electricity generation, this greenhouse gas, therefore, will still be a pressing issue that the team needs to tackle. Involving the public engagement results into our MFC design, we have set the following design standards/requirements for our MFC:
1. Limit the impacts on human health by limiting users’ interaction with the inner mechanism of our Laccase degradation and MFC system. Chemicals and cell culturing medium should not be harmful to both the environment and humans. This can be done by making the MFC a closed system during operation, where the users need not manually operate the system at any intermediate stage.
2. Focus on reusing or fixing the CO2 that will be released from the respiration of our cell culture to minimize environmental pollution.

Enzymology
CL:The week we conducted the test assay for ethanol detection. Simple one-step assay takes ethanol and NAD+ into acetylaldahyde and NADH with use of alcohol Deh (ADH) enzyme. Final NADH concentration can be determined using its molar extinction coefficient and absorbance at 340.0 nm, and is proportionate to initial ethanol concetration.  Ethanol concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM were assayed with 173U/mL ADH.  and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm.
Results: Final NADH concentrations were calculated to be off by a factor of ten due to unexpectedly low absorbancies. Assay was repeated with increased ethanol concentrations (0.5-10mM), but absorbancies remained lower than expected.
Discussion: It was determined that this assay was now sensitive enough for the range of ethanol concentrations that will need to be detected in our project, therefore opt to use a more sensitive Alcohol Oxidase enzyme instead.  The alternative enzyme was ordered and will be stored until testing.  A rough draft protocol for the alcohol oxidase assay was also written up and buffers were prepped.

Growth of BL-21 cells was tested in hopes of finding a cell line that could grow in BG-11 with minimal supplements.  BL-21 cells showed only very slight increases in growth relative to 10-ß.
Next, cell growth in BG-11 was tested with varying amounts of NH4Cl, in hopes that we hadn't seen desirable levels of growth due to ammonium chloride concentrations that either weren't sufficient or were toxic.  Cultures were grown in triplicate, with 10 mL cultures in 16x25 mm culture tubes, in an effort to analyze more samples quickly.  Results showed that varying the ammonium chloride levels anywhere between 0.5-3.0 mg/mL (9.35-56.1 mM) had little noticeable effect.

Top three ideas were discussed
Bio Memory:
Advantages: Long lasting memory, would be good to say “Hello” using our memory
Disadvantages: The amount of data we can store may not be much.
We may store the spores on a plaster to save their positions and use it on another agar plate to display the same data"

Modelling Method: Reaction kinetics of pathways for synthesis of PHB
Questions addressed by model
Determine the rate limiting step in the pathway (and implement solutions to improve the rate of that step)
Can potentially provide insight into the impact of gene order
Pros
Relatively easy to translate metabolic network to mathematical terms (Schallau et al., 2010)
Can be integrated with the project’s experimental data and used to reiterate model and lab experiments.
Cons
Difficult to find parameters for many reactions in the pathway.
When analyzing multiple pathways that interact with each other, we may have to assume constant reaction rates for simplicity.
Modelling Method: Steady state mass balance to predict amount of PHB
Questions addressed by model
Helpful for cost analysis of PHB production
Identify the least efficient parts of the process (in terms of conversion)
Can be combined with cost analysis to figure out the areas of the Process , which can be modified to improve PHB production while adding the least cost.
Evaluate how much PHB will be produced depending on plant capacity (also combined with cost analysis to suggest the optimal scale at which PHB production is most feasible)
Pros
Can be integrated with the cost analysis
Can be integrated with Process development.
Cons
Cannot be integrated with experimental data.
Modelling Method: Translational kinetics to predict effect of codon optimization
Different bacteria have different tRNAs that are abundant in their cells. When genes from other species of bacteria are expressed in E. coli, they may have a very inefficient translation efficiency if the available tRNA pools are very different. The impact of the difference can be calculated using tAI (tRNA adaptation index)  (Han et al., 2010). The tAI for a gene is a measure of the availability of the tRNAs that serve each codon in the gene (Han et al., 2010). Synonymous codon substitutions can affect translational kinetics, which subsequently affects the final protein structure and function (RegulonDB).
Pros
Determine increase in translation efficiency after codon optimization.
Determine effect of synonymous codon substitutions on protein folding (synthesis enzymes or membrane proteins involved in secretion).
Further optimize sequence to take into account secondary binding structures etc to optimize mRNA translational efficiency.
Cons
Cannot be integrated with experimental data.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations can be used to model protein folding.
Many unknown parameters involved.

Cut off two little leaf disks of approximately                             0.8cm and put it into an Eppendorf tube.                             Immediately, freeze it with liquid nitrogen to                             avoid the deterioration of vegetal material.
Grind the freeze sample using the metabolomics                             robot. Put the samples on ice.

Take an optimal plate to use in the                             luminometer. Fill luminometer wells with 40 ul of LUCII which is stored at -20°C.
10 ul of sample is added in each well. Wait                             10minutes. During this time turn on and configure                             the luminometer.
Measure luciferase activity
Prepare 40 ul/well of Dual Glo 1x (STOP                             solution + substrate). The substrate is at 50x                             concentration and stored at -20°C.
When the first luciferase measure is done, it                             is necessary to add 40 ul of Dual Glo into each                             well. Let it rest during 10 minutes.
Measure the Renilla activity.
Take the obtained information and analyze                             it.
It must be kept in mind that the luminometer                         (machine to measure the luminescence) has to be ready                         before adding the reagents to the samples because it                         needs 10min to be ready. Set the timer (10min) with the                         first sample of luciferase and add the reactant to the                         other samples as quick as possible.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#T7 promoter variants#selection_-_-_TEXT.html," was used to keep track of fluorescence in the cells over the course of the experiment: the non-lysed cells were expected to fluoresce according to the appropriate gene (RFP or GFP, depending on the culture).
Results
This graph tracks the optical density (measured at 600 nm) over time of the two flasks. It can only be used to confirm that there was growth in each flask, which is to be expected since each flask contains both lysing and non-lysing cells. The growth dynamics are a bit strange, but the optical density increases generally over time.
The fluorescence data shows that, in both cases, the non-lysing cells kept producing fluorescent protein, meaning that there was no general, unselective lysis going on. The relevant fluorescence grew over time, as expected for non-lysing cells. The negative-control culture containing RFP seems to have grown less radically than its GFP counterpart, but the difference with respect to the lysis culture is substantial (see the lower of the two graphs).
The qPCR data in this graph indicates that the content of the supernatant is indeed the expected content, with respect to the twin cultures of each flask. Where lysed cells are expected to release GFP plasmids, we find GFP genes in the supernatant in much higher concentrations than RFP and vice-versa in the other flask. We can thereby confirm that the right DNA is selected in each flask and finds its way into the supernatant.
The colony fluorescence count, which is our other method for quantifying DNA concentration in the supernatant, also confirms  the qPCR data from the previous graph. Indeed, the ratio of RFP colonies to GFP colonies per plate in the case of cells that lyse and release RFP plasmids grows over the course of the experiment. In practical terms, the likelihood of recovering DNA that is not the desired DNA (i.e. natural cell death leading to plasmids in the supernatant) is low.
The flasks, after ten hours, show a clear difference in color. The flask on the left contains a lysed culture of RFP-containing co-transformations with a non-lysed culture of GFP-containing co-transformations which accounts for its yellow-green hue. The flask on the right, conversely, contains a lysed culture of the GFP-containing co-transformations with a non-lysed culture of RFP-containing co-transformations, which accounts for its pinkish hue.

The response of light receptors Cph8, LovTAP and our green light receptor to different wavelengths of light have not been fully characterised. The absorbance spectra of the light sensitive proteins ( Figure 1 ) might not exactly mirror their response to light, but should give us a good idea of their properties until this is possible.
In LovTAP, the light sensitive domain of the protein is the Lov2 domain from the Avena sativa blue light receptor phototropin. This binds flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which is its co-factor. Schüttrigkeit et al. (2003) measured the absorbance of the wildtype Lov2 bound to FMN. Since this is the active part of LovTAP, we expect our blue light receptor to have a similar response in vivo. The red light absorbing form of Cph1 is what responds to red light in Cph8. The absorbance of Cph1 was measured by Gambetta and Lagarias (2001) . Similarly, the absorbance of the green light absorbing form of CcaS, which we are planning on using in our green light receptor, was measured by Hirose et al. (2008) .
In accordance with the above, the challenge was then to design and characterise luciferases compatible with the sensors. In this, we decided to build on previous"
