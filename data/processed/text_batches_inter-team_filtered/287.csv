SYSU-CHINA,2016,Team:SYSU-CHINA#Team#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," our School or Life Sciences, Professor Zhang put great attention in our project this year and was also willing to support us. She attended our thesis proposal, and gave useful advice as she is an expert in stem cell researches.
She also attended our CCiC and gave a speech in the opening ceremony, approving our work and encouraging undergrads to proceed scientific researches.
Supports from host lab
Such a wonderful and cherishing experience with the lab!
Our host lab this year is the lab of Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory of the School of Life Sciences. We received mass support from staffs and lab members throughout our project process, which includes:
Commonly used reagents such as PBS, ethanol, and materials like centrifuge tubes, and experimental instruments like incubators and centrifuges are all provided by our host lab.
Lab manager Ms. Zhong and lab assistant Ms. Sun helped us with all the reagent booking, by sending our booking lists to specific reagent agencies.
Lab members lent us cell lines of Hela, A549, MCF-7, 293T, parts of mCherry and CYAN, and all the vectors we needed for experiments. They also generously gave us advice on many experimental details.
Supports from other teams
iGEM is a big family!
Exchange ideas with SZU, FAFU and XMU
After Synbiobeta Activate-Shenzhen, team SZU founded a meet up to exchange ideas. During the meet up, we help SZU to debug the construction of their circuits and the project design.
Exchange parts with SYSU-Software and FAFU-China
We shared iGEM interlab kits and iGEM plate kits with SYSU-Software. During our experiments, we found out that one of our Interlab plasmids (Device I) could not be transformed well in bacterial culture medium. So we borrowed some plasmids from SYSU-Software. Furthermore, SYSU-Software had used up one of their plate kits (B0015 terminator) and we gave them ours.
We received several parts (CFP, YFP) from team FAFU-China when the shipment of Biobrick to China is still confusing. Sincerely thanks to FAFU-China!
Attending CCiC
28 teams and more than 200 students came to attend our CCiC. Everyone enjoyed the time and harvest a lot. Thank all the iGEMers for their participation!

13 September 2012,13 days to go ...
As the deadline is coming closer we now have to start to produce the figures necessary for our results part. We decided to meet twice during each week to be able to discuss everything fast and effective. In order to not reduce your anticipation (and because it will not be very interesting) we will not summarize the following meetings but of cause we will keep you updated as soon we have interesting news!
07 September 2012,We organized the ""Legoland for Scientists"" symposium at the University of Göttingen.
Read everything about it here.
06 September 2012,Only one day left until the information evening ""Legoland for scientists""...
In today’s meeting we only had one topic: our information evening on the following day. We discussed the presentations about iGEM, our projects and the introduction of our speakers and afterwards simulated the discussion. Everybody is very nervous but it will be fun for sure!

Abstract & Introduction
Mycelium is an ideal candidate for the construction of building materials on Mars due in most part to its replicability; a builder will end up with more material than he brought with him. However, while concrete and rebar are not easily transported, they are conveniently measured in volume and in weight, and a builder can precisely simulate the things that he can build given his material constraints. The model developed for our project attempts to confer this ease of measurability onto mycelium in order to better understand its utility as a building material—given a starting amount of mycelium, how much can a builder grow given his time constraints? Alternately, if a builder brings fillable molds and a starter colony of mycelium—how long will it take for his fungus to fill the mold? I constructed a Python model to answer these questions, and to simulate the fractal and competitive growth pattern of mycelial hyphae, in the hopes that it will be used to inform others’ efforts in growing mycelium in the future.
Materials and Methods
To begin, we got growth data—a few weeks’ worth—from the team members responsible for actually growing mycelium in the lab. We put this data into a spreadsheet and ran various regression analyses on it. We found that an exponential model fit the data with high fidelity, with an R2 value of 0.93. We devised an exponential growth model in Python and ran several simulations. However, we found that the data for the quantity of mycelium grown was dubious as growth periods grew longer, giving enormous values that did not reflect the data gathered in the lab.
We began researching models online, and eventually found a tumor growth model, called the “Eden Model” (after the person who initially developed it; the link to the literature we referenced is given in the “Discussion” section of this page). We were interested in tweaking the Eden model for mycelial growth, because the way that tumors grow is remarkably similar to mycelial proliferation: both incorporate substrate adjacent to their borders into their bodies, initially"

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Data#gfp spore_-_-_TEXT.html," spore crust proteins flanked by the promoters and terminator above.
Since we want to display the fusion proteins on the surface of B. subtilis spores, we needed to clone our final constructs into an empty Bacillus vector, so that they would integrated into the chromosome of B. subtilis after transformation. We chose the empty vector pSBBS1C from our BacillusBioBrickBox for the cotZ constructs.
All resulting Sporobeads were investigated by fluorescence microscopy. The intensity bar charts show the fluorescence intensity, while the 3D graphs illustrate the distribution of fluorescence intensity across the spore surface. This correlates with the localization of our fusion proteins in the crust. For image analysis we measured the fluorescence intensity of an area of 750 pixel per spore by using ImageJ and evaluated the results with the statistical software R. The graph below shows a summery of our results obtained from all constructs.
Fig. 1: Data of the various Sporobead constructs
Fig. 1 verifies the previously described diffuse background fluorescence of wild type spores (W168). The B49 strain even shows an increased fluorescence background. Nevertheless there is a significant difference between gfp-Sporobeads and W168 and B 49, respectively. Sporobeads with present native cotZ revealed uniform distribution around the edge, whereas the ones with the deletion of cotZ elucidated a clear ""polar"" distribution. Additionally there is a difference in fluorescence activity between the two versions of cotZ recognizable. It appears the strain B 70 with the construct PcotYZ-cotZ-2aa-gfp-terminator and the deleted native cotZ had the strongest fluorescence. But as it does not have a uniform fusion protein distribution, B 53 would be the strain for future Sporobead applications.
In some 3D graphs the picked cell does not represent the average fluorescence intensity depicted in the bar chart, because it was chosen randomly.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#HeatherNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the afternoon, Joanna and I met with Orit to discuss our user- testing protocol, and received helpful feedback and advice.
Thursday: Summer Research Poster session
Friday: Today we executed three user-studies with groups of high-school students from the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound program. We began the study with a pre-task questionnaire to gather information about the users’ existent knowledge of Synthetic Biology.  We then gave a short presentation to introduce Synthetic Biology concepts, and performed a demo of our application.  After the students had the opportunity to use the application, they filled out a post-task questionnaire with repeated questions about Synthetic Biology as well as an evaluation of the application itself.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Localization_-_-_TEXT.html,"™-System by invitrogen. The three compound system consists of HEK-TRex™-293 cells that harbour one chromosomal Flp recombination target (FRT) site, a Flp recombinase expression plasmid and the plasmid encoding the receptor as well as another FRT site for stable integration. [18] The detailed principle of the integration is described in the figure below.
Cells that succesfully integrated the plasmid into their genome will lose their resistance for Zeocin™, but become resistant to hygromycin B (hygB) as the plasmid encodes the hygB-phosphotransferase, a kinase inactivating hygB by phophorylation. [19] Thus, successfully transfected cells can be easily selected via hygromycin B. To ensure that the resistence does not come from non-integrated plasmid, this process takes several weeks and divison cycles.
Fig.8 Stable transfection was performed using the pcDNA5 vectors obtained from invitrogen
The succesful integration of the pcDNA plasmids was verified by genome-PCR (see methods). Therefore, we designed three primers: One that binds to the SV40 promotor and part of the following FRT site, one that binds part the hygromycin restistance gene and another one for the lacZ-Zeocin sequence. In the event of stable integration, the size of the amplicons will be around 550 bp, according to the distance between the SV40 and the hygromycine resistance gene. Wheareas in case of no integration the amplicon size will be around 400 since this corresponds to the distance between the SV40 and the lacZ-Zeocin sequences.
The results are shown in figure on the right. The lower band visible in the samples 2-5 leads us to the conslusion that, despite hygromycine selection, the cells are not yet a monoculture - something we also observed in the flow cytometry analysis further discussed below. On the other hand, a high portion of cells do have the construct integrated into their genome.

For better traceabilty we supplied all of our receptor constructs with reporter genes like mRuby and/or Nanoluciferase. mRuby is located on the C-terminus respectively the cytosolic end of our transmembrane receptors right before the Strep-tag. Cells that express and fold the protein properly should give a signal of 605 nm (red"
SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Over the summer we attended several meetups. Our first meetup was at the Danish Technical University, who held a meetup for the Danish teams. This was also where we initiated our collaboration about mathematics. We gave a talk about how to design a Wiki and we learned a lot from the other teams and generally had a blast!
In June we met up with the other Nordic iGEM teams at the Nordic Jamboree. We presented our project and received feedback on where we should further focus. When we heard the other teams presentations, we realized that the Stockholm iGEM team's project was almost identical to ours. Thus a collaboration was born with the iGEM team from Stockholm.
We also had a great road trip to Germany, where we met up with German teams. Here we had the chance to present our project and get some good constructive feedback on our video and project. It was also really inspiring to learn about the other team's project.
The University of Copenhagen held a meetup with focus on Human Practice, which we attended. We learned much from the meetup and had the opportunity to talk to Ana from iGEM Headquarters. She gave some great feedback! It was also at this meetup our collaboration with Chalmers University began.

Integrated Human Practice
This year our integrated human practice work concentrated on improving the feasibility of our project and exploring its potentials. We contacted experts and technicians to discuss our design and experiment plan with them. Results of these work have been proven helpful to the adjustment of the schematic design and the detailed experiment procedure.
Change of Material -- Interview with Prof. Meng Wenxiang
After the literature research phase, we found microtubule to be an ideal material for our extracellular enzyme loading scaffold for its self-assembly feature and its employing of modifiable subunits. Therefore, we scheduled an interview with professor Meng Wenxiang, an expert on microtubule, before we initiated our experiments.
With Prof. Meng Wenxiang at Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology
To our disappointment, professor Meng directly pointed out a fundamental flaw in our plan, which was the stability of microtubule could not meet the ideal requirement of the extracellular scaffold. According to his research data, microtubule could not exist in vitro for more than a week even with the help of microtubule-stabilizing drugs, such as taxol® and its analogues. This defect of microtubule invalidated its potential as the extracellular scaffold material, but it did inspire us to look for a similar but more stable material. So we began our search for materials that met these requirements. Shortly after, we found flagellar filament to be the stable self-assembled biopolymer we wanted. Thanks to professor Meng's advice, we eliminated one possible systematical cause for failure in advance.
Improvement on Experiment Protocol -- Interview with Prof. Zhang Linqi and Her PhD. Students
Since we were new to this technique, and it's imperative for us to enlarge the knowledge base we had on this technique. Hence, we went to Tsinghua University to consult professor Zhang Linqi and her PhD. students, who had tons of experiences and knowledge on this technique.

Backend Part
Django
Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern.
Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code, it emphasizes reusability and ""pluggability"" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. It also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface, which is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
Python 3
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. It is cross-platform and it interpreters are available for many operating systems.
Nginx
Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer.
Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," do not have to go through the phases of approval resulting in accessibility to everybody. By marketing on websites and magazines with scientific content we effectively get in contact with our target group. To sum it up, we can provide two things to potential customers. First a binding protein generating system to researchers and the specific customized binding proteins themselves.
Idea:
The impact of antibodies in modern medicine is on a permanent rise. However, major problems are costs and time for development and production, as well as ethical discussions concerning the immunization of animals that are killed during the harvesting process. We want to establish an alternative using antibody-like binding proteins that are generated in vivo in E. coli. Profiting of the short generation time and the exponential growth of bacteria, we want to generate and optimize binding proteins in a much shorter period of time while also being more cost efficient. Furthermore, no animals are to suffer our process. The binding proteins can subsequently be utilized in both, diagnostics and maybe even in therapy against pathogens. Due to the ability of our system to adapt quickly to a specific target protein under evolutionary pressure it is especially useful in concern of quickly evolving and newly arising viral pathogens. Our goal is on one hand to develop binding proteins in E. coli in a process of directed evolution that can be utilized in diagnostic techniques and target-mediated drug delivery. On the other hand we want to add a production process to sell custom ordered binding proteins. The concept of our system is structured into the following aspects: At first, we created a library of random binding protein sequences in bacteria forming the starting point of our project. After that we used a special plasmid which generates a higher mutation rate in a specific region. Finally, we developed a selection system to select proteins that show the best affinity to the target protein. Mediated by the binding of our improved protein to the target, the cell in concern is granted a selective advantage directly increasing its evolutionary fitness. The potential of our project is a quick response to suddenly emerging viruses. We provide a quick response to these threats. Whether the pathogens are new, mutated from an animal only pathogen to a human pathogen or already known viruses that changed or adapted in a way that the present treatment is no longer effective. Our goal is to reduce the time for the development of an binding protein and also make the immunization of animals obsolete. This not only benefits human in the detection and treatment of diseases but also stops the killing of animals. Due to its time efficiency the spread of the pathogen is inhibited earlier, further reducing the number of people become diseased and preventing any damage caused by the pathogens. Our target audience are patients with a"

It is not only to manipulate parts of existing organisms, it is the creation of new ones.”Although synthetic biology uses the same material and methods for DNA manipulation like conventional biotechnology and the difference may appear more quantitative then qualitative it can be argued, that the initially quanitative expansion of technical possibilities enables these goals which then lead due to their consequences and radicalism to a change also on a qualitative stage”.It seems that synthetic biology leaves the traditional field of biology and its natural background. The question about what is life maybe will no longer be intersting for mankind and can be replaced by questions like: “What can I synthesize and how can I use life to reach my goals?” If life is just an artefact of engineering is it still be possible to talk about ethics? We think yes because the technical progress not only changes the way we think about organisms, it changes the way we are living. Social world can not be isolated from the world of technical science like Bruno Latour demanded. Now it is time to think about descisions which change our future. This manuscript, a prospective technology assessment, is one trial to give an outlook what might happen if this new technology is used for in our example cleaning the planet from waste PET. We will compare different applications and give in the end a recommendation for future descisions. We know that we are restricted, because we can not look into the future and nobody knows to what consequences technical acting today really leads.
Chapter One: Problem description and goal definition
After describing the background of synthetic biology in the introduction, this chapter will be used as introduction for the evaluated project. Since the prospective technology assessment modell of Wolfgang Bender is used, two ethic modells which can be used for the reader as orientation in the following manuscript will be discussed in this chapter. It is no question that there is no happy medium and some day a descision has to be made. Either for the use of synthetically ingeneered organisms with all possibilities and  consequences or against it with all negative effects which might emerge. In the next subchapter the future purpose of the new organism will be described.

Unintentionally, a large amount of this PET finds it´s way into the ocean in consequence of inappropriate waste disposal or detachment of plastic in apparel in washing machines.

By observing the fluorescence signal over time the transcription levels of different TX-TL batches can be compared.
Cell Extract – A Platform For Qualified Comparison Of BioBrickTM
These results prove our home-made TX-TL as a high-quality expression platform regarding transcription as well as translation. Thus, it forms a perfect platform for testing various biological parts listed in the iGEM Registry. The standardized expression system allows a more reliable comparison of BioBricks for iGEM teams around the world.
Data Analysis
One of the most essential aspects when it comes to manufacturing therapeutics and, thus, a major             consideration while designing Phactory is quality control. To tackle this issue from a bioinformatician’s              point-of-view, we analysed minION Oxford Nanopore sequencing data in order to draw conclusions on purity, origin, and functionality of the bacteriophages genome.
For this purpose, the wetlab team sequenced several phage genomes: T7, 3S, NES, FFP. Analysis of the results              has been performed using an in-house developed software poreSTAT. For each sequencing sample, it is              determined how many bases are sequenced, what base-pair yield has been achieved and how many minION pores             were used.
Considering the sequence in which the reads have been acquired, it can nicely be seen how the used chip              gets worn out with each sequencing experiment. While for the first sequencing experiment many pores are              show high average read lengths, the used pores average read lengths decreases with the number of              sequencing experiments.

Phage Genome Assembly
Genome assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments in order to reconstruct the original sequence.              Particularly Nanopore sequencing is well suitable for genome assembly since its long reads allow to reduce              the ambiguity of highly similar and repetitive sequences. The read distributions of the sequencing experiments              are shown in Figure 2.

Peptide aptamers
Monoclonal antibodies
Affinity (KD)
10 to 100 nM
10-3 to 100 nM
In order to maintain the combinatorial ability and diverse specificity of the antibodies, the peptide aptamers have a random peptide loop. These are typical from 10 to 20 amino acids long. To construct these combinatorial peptide libraries, twenty (or ten) repeats of the codon 3'-NNK-5' 3'-NNK-5' N represents any of the four nucleotides; adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). K represents either G or C. This restriction will limit the chance of a stop-codon occuring in the sequence. In a 60 nucleotide sequence, this means that 440x220 = 1,27x1030 different sequences could be generated. is inserted into the gene encoding the scaffold protein. If the variable loop is 20 amino acids long, one will get 2020=1,05×1026 different peptide combinations. This should give enough diversification to resemble the diversity of antibodies.

Why did we choose the hTrx-based peptide aptamer as our alternative to the antibody? In contrary to antibodies, peptide aptamers are small monomeric proteins that have been proven to be efficiently expressed and produced in bacteria such as Escherichia coli - especially when presented in a human thioredoxin scaffold.

Charles Hsu
is a sophomore studying biology at MIT. Charles decided to participate in iGEM because he felt it would be an excellent  opportunity to explore the manipulation of fundamental  principles of life to engineer innovative solutions to challenging problems. He hopes to use the  leadership and technical skills he gains from iGEM to help him in his aspiration of becoming a  clinical physician. Charles has previous lab experience from working at the  National Yang-Ming Medical University Department of  Physiology Clinical Medicine Core Lab. While there, he  researched the effect of anti- inflammatory chemicals on  the recovery rate of wounded alveolar epithelial cells and  designed a new error-minimizing measurement technique utilizing  basic geometry software.  Outside the lab, Charles spends his free time leading the  MIT Freshman Heavyweight Crew as a  coxswain. Charles is also an Eagle Scout and current Emerson scholar studying the  viola with Professor Marcus Thompson.
Jenny Cheng
is a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology receiving her  Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in June of 2011. Jenny decided to  join the iGEM team to gain further experience in synthetic biology after becoming interested in the  subject while working as an undergraduate researcher in the Lab of  Molecular Self-Assembly with Peter Carr. During her time working in  this lab, she created the TraceData application, which generates a  Microsoft Excel document from DNA sequencing files and analyzes  the DNA sequence. She looks forward to being able to continue to  combine her solid computer science skills, which include the ability  to code in more than 5 languages, with her lab experience to solve  biological problems through iGEM."

iGEM Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
Researcher safety
Microorganisms:
We are working with three different bacteria species.
The first one is E. Coli (K-12) and the strain we used is called TOP 10, is commonly used in a large number of labs. It belongs to Risk Group 1, it is not pathogenic, and also not able to survive a long time outside lab conditions. N. Europaea (ATCC 19718) is a common soil bacterium and does not pose a health risk. P. Aeruginosa PAO1 is a human pathogen with intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants and also has environmental adaptability. However even though P. aeruginosa is capable of infecting healthy humans it is largely an opportunistic pathogen. The website of the Center for Disease Control states that “serious Pseudomonas infections usually occur in people in the hospital and/or with weakened immune systems. However, healthy people can also develop mild illnesses with P. aeruginosa, especially after exposure to water” [2] . Gloves were worn at all times when handling P. aeruginosa cultures on plates or in liquid medium and special care was taken to not expose open wounds. Our final mutants do not incorporate genes from P. aeruginosa that make it pathogenic, so they do not have elevated risk over non-transformed E. coli.
Reagents:
We are using the following reagents, which could potentially pose a risk.
Nitric Oxide (NO) : Should not be inhaled. Causes skin and eye irritation.
Ethidium Bromide : Should not be inhaled or ingested. Causes skin and eye irritation. Can be toxic when used often: mutagenic/carcinogenic.
Nitrous oxide (N2O) : Should not be inhaled, anaesthetic effect. Avoid skin contact.
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) : Should not be ingested. Causes skin and eye irritation. Limited evidence of carcinogenic effects.
Public safety
There is only limited access to the lab (by authorized students and researchers) so the risk of release is very small. In case of release of Pseudomonas, it is considered to be a mild pathogen, and if an infection in humans was to occur, it can be treated with antibiotics. In addition to that P. aeruginosa is an abundant end"

McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html," (mGEM) wet lab focused on. mGEM’s research is for a non invasive and highly selective method for treating gastrointestinal tumour cells. IL-2 is a key component of this since it is possible to engineer it to be only expressed in the presence of tumors. The highly selective nature of this makes it an ideal candidate to be modified using quorum sensing in the gut microenvironment.
Since the application of IL-2 is often done in a large, continuous dose, it is important to minimize the impact from side effects. The toxic nature of IL-2 therapy is attributed mainly to capillary/vascular leak syndrome (C/VLS).2 This side effect manifests itself as peripheral edema and weight gain, ascites (collection of fluid in peritoneal cavity), pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. Patients with previous history of hypotension, oliguria (having less urine) and respiratory failure are often more susceptible to VLS symptoms. Protocols approved by the Clinical Research Committee of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were modeled to be selective of test demographics. Patients eligible for high dose IL-2 therapy include 18 years or older individuals with a minimum platelet count of 100,000/mm,3 a serum creatine level of <2mg%, a bilirubin value of <1.5mg%, and a performance score on the Karnovsky scale of 80% or greater.3 Other exclusion criteria include patients with autoimmune disorders, renal disease or those consuming immunosuppressive drugs. By following through with these criteria, it ensures a minimal risk background for sample patients.
Other methods of controlling IL-2 toxicity were also considered. High IL-2 doses included gastrointestinal side effects such as transient nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia.4 Prophylactic (intending to prevent disease) antiemetics (a drug used to prevent nausea/vomiting) given before and throughout the first IL-2 dose, were observed to minimize nausea and vomiting. This type of prophylactic was also seen to not increase the risk of hypotension, unlike similar medications.5 Even with all these options considered, it is crucial that IL-2 dosages remain low and are preferably administered by trained medical personnel.

Today we prepared pGFP-rrnB plasmids using midiprep. We followed GenElute's midiprep protocol.
We had two E.coli cultures inoculated with pGFP-rrnB left overnight. Although the samples were of the same plasmid, we treated them individually as one culture seemed to express the GFP more than the other. We used 100ml of each sample aliquoted into two 50ml falcon tubes then carried out the midi prep procedure from the protocol on the 4 tubes, combining our DNA samples at the end. In the DNA concentration step we centrifuged the tubes at 16000rpm for 30 minutes before adding ethanol to rinse the DNAs. We then centriguged the tubes again for 10 minutes at 16000rpm.
We evaporated the tubes for 5 minutes at the end before resuspending each tube in 50ul of distilled water. The tubes from the same cultures were then combined and the DNA concentrations for the two samples were"

David Ishee - a Virtual Conference
As part of Integrated Human Practices, we reached out to Mr. David Ishee, a well-known biohacker.                Mr. Ishee is a passionate dog breeder who was stumped with the idea that there wasn’t a way to tackle                    an inherited disease in Dalmatians called hyperuricemia. Hence, he took it upon himself to find a way                 using genetic engineering as a tool and as inexpensively as possible. He started out his own venture to                  face this issue and has hence inspired several to use synthetic biology as a tool to face many problems.
We had a virtual conference with Mr. Ishee over Skype and he took us through his initial research                  with Dalmatians and the difficulties he faced with respect to rustic genetic engineering in his               home-lab. He talked us through the CRISPR technology and how unique and easy it was use it for                  modifying each strain. He also suggested how our organism of choice interacts withotherorganisms               in the native ecosystem and how it might affect our project.

We will transform the sequence confirmed minipreps when more DNA is needed. We attempted site directed mutagenesis of PtrpC + hph + TtrpC in  pAh13G. The extension time was a little short for pAh13G so it might not work. We ran gel a gel, which had a band at 100 base pairs, meaning it didn’t work. We will attempt this again tomorrow with a longer extension time. Colonies of BL21-A1 and DH5α with pC13CG grew.

We ran a gel of the colony PCR and pC13CG 1, 3, and 4 had the correct band at about 1.8 kb. pC13A and pC13F (XbaI,PstI) did not have enough DNA. As a result, ligations for creating pC13I and pC13J are on hold. We ligated and electroporated pC13AF, pC13AG, pAK13CR, pAK13CS from other digestions, and plated them overnight. We found the the transformations of pC13BR and pC13BQ were too efficient and had to restreak the plates in order to isolate single colonies. We ran colony PCRs of pC13BU, pC13CC, and pC13CD, and at least two copies of each construct seem to be successful!
Weird happenings in lab: what we thought was PtrpC with GFP turns out to be PtrpC with mRFP! Good news: PgpdA and pC13F with homologous regions for Gibson are good! We tested the transformation efficiency of our new T7-ready bacteria, BL21-A1 as well. We ligated and electroporated pC13AF, pC13AG, pAK13CR, pAK13CS from other digestions, and plated them overnight.

The main aim of the presentation was to show the students what they would experience if they were part of a future Oxford University iGEM team. We therefore focused on our own experience of iGEM, both the opportunities we have had for developing new skills as well as the social side of our summer. We also discussed how they may be able to get involved in future years. As our presentation was to be the last item at the end of a tiring week for the students we included short animations, little text and many photos on our slides and maintained an informal tone for our spoken delivery. We initially intended for the presentation and Q&A session to take 20 minutes, unfortunately due previous events running over time we had to shorten our presentation slightly as we went along and were unable to answer any questions. Despite this we still had a positive response as one student came to us at the end to enquire how they could get involved. We would like to thank Kathryn Scott for kindly fitting us into the very full UNIQ timetable.
YSL Workshop
In the process of putting together our report and our guidance for iGEM teams, our team, in collaboration with the event organisers Philipp and Bethan of UCL iGEM, ran an intellectual property workshop at the Young Synthetic Biologists Conference 2.0 for other iGEMmers interested in the issue. It was difficult to cater for such a range in terms of the level of understanding of the audience; some members had hardly heard of IP whereas others were familiar with and often had strong views on the subject.
The event was a great success; teams attending said 'I hadn't really appreciated just how big an impact this area of law could have on scientific development and particularly on synthetic biology - it's given me a lot to think about!'. We had a great time and there were some really interesting and insightful debates and comments.
And of course, Boston!

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," our ambitions and what we would like to achieve as an organisation, we clarified SinBio vision:
A society that is enthusiastic about synthetic biology, is confident in its use, and supports people who want to be part of scientific community.
Later on, we have developed goals aligned to the vision:
1. To address the first part of our vision, we believe that for people acknowledge and become interest in synthetic biology it has to be established as an integral part of our life, providing benefits for our well-being. Of course, their possible negative aspects or dangers should also be discussed. The relevance of synthetic biology has to be demonstrated to the general public, and the solution it offers - explained.
Such public engagement should be a two-way process, enabling the public to express their interests, ideas and/or concerns, thereby helping scientists and stakeholders to innovate the synthetic biology in the right direction. We should also bring business into the picture as society more often has contact with science through products and services it uses.
We have then picked out the methods we could use to engage the public with the field of synthetic biology:
Participating in and organizing scientific events for the community, wherein people could get familiar with concepts of synthetic biology, its potential and benefits.
Collaborating with startups and mature businesses that may want to incorporate the methods or products of synthetic biology in their workflows.
Releasing a popular periodical newsletter on the latest accomplishments of the synthetic biology field.
These means might improve the public’s understanding the scientific expertise in ways they prefer and feeling that their opinions count resulting in overall approval of synthetic biology.
2. To raise the confidence of using and applying synthetic biology, the community has to first understand what it is. This confidence should arise from informed understanding of the processes of synthetic biology and science in general. This goal should be approached from two perspectives.
First, the general community who has limited knowledge about science principles and topics in general.
Secondly, the people from scientific community who need to expand their knowledge circle into the field of synthetic biology (e.g. life sciences students).
To acknowledge these two groups, we are going to implement different means to engage them into processes of synthetic biology:
Steps for familiarizing general public on scientific research concepts and means to conduct it:
Making a list of trusted scientific sources available to the general community and promoting it.
Organizing general lectures and workshops.
Steps for students to to understand processes behind synthetic biology:
Organizing in depth lectures and workshops on synthetic biology.
Collaborating with Vilnius University to make synthetic biology a part of study programmes.
3. The third thing we want to focus on is developing a society with qualified"

Moreover, our Mycobacterium does not subsist in the organism. It is indeed lysed during the liberation of phage in the tissue after the addition of doxycycline.
Regarding doxycycline, it has side effects such as staining of bones, toxic epidermal necrolysis, the Stevens Johnson syndrome, megaloblastic anemia, esophageal ulceration, neuromuscular block, cutaneous porphyria, or dyschromatopsia. However, this antibiotic is already widely used by the pharmaceutical industry and does not present any danger as long as the doses and contraindication are respected.

Lambda Phage
Our cell vector encapsidated only the therapeutic plasmid (not the entire genome). If it infects bacteria of the commensal flora of the organism (which may be limited by changes in protein internalization), the bacteria will receive just the therapeutic plasmid.
Moreover, our phage is a prokaryote, but cells of human body are eukaryotes. It can therefore be no risk of homologous recombination or integration between its genome and our cells genome, as they do not belong to the same ""world"".
Back to top
Therapeutic Plasmid
The therapeutic plasmid brings to the organism tumor suppressor genes (p53, p16, ATM, RB1 or PTEN) wild type. The promoters added are those present in healthy cells: so there is no increased synthesis of tumor suppressor genes in healthy cells. The regulation is not modified.
Back to top
BioBricks
Our biobricks set no safety problems :
The biobrick for COS sequence may set a security problem since it allows the encapsidation of any sequence within the bacteriophage lambda. We can therefore encapsidate “harmful” sequences in a recombinant phage. But this biobrick was not subjected to iGEM.
Some of our biobricks are an assembling of bricks already existing in the register of MIT.
For other biobricks, it is a DNA targeting sequence (DTS), which recruits nuclear localization sequence, a factor specific stem cells (CFS) and a capsid protein of phage lambda synthesized from its own genome. Thus it does not cover new issues of safety.

2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Haemin is a second year student majoring in Biotechnology. She is one of the two leaders of this year HKUST iGEM team. In the lab, she works diligently and is very helpful when needed. But most of the time, she looks blank-minded and often makes small careless mistakes. Her trademark quote is ""What did I just do? *blank face*

AW Jacqueline Theeng Mei
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jacqueline is a year two student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Apart from being a junior member in iGEM team, she is also the secretary of the team. Claiming to have above-standard laboratory skills, she performed various kinds of experiments. Quite often, she will work in the laboratory from 9am to 6pm. Unsurprisingly, she likes to attend every meeting and make reminders and minutes for every meeting. EVERY MEETING! (To those who don’t read her emails, be careful). Enjoying iGEM competition, she likes to perform site directed mutagenesis and Gibson assembly daily. Rapping is one of her precious abilities as well as stalking others. Indeed she is the number ONE stalker in the team. Although she tried very hard to shed this title, the fact that she is a stalker will not change.

UNC-Asheville,2017,Team:UNC-Asheville#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," started with sMMO.
sMMO has been shown to degrade TCE both chloral hydrate, and an intermediate epoxide, which is short lived at room temperature. Our team decided to attempt the pathway which goes through the epoxide, and ends with glyoxylate. Glyoxylate is part of a native secondary anabolic pathway of E.coli which theoretically could mean that colonies expressing our metabolic pathway would route TCE into the glyoxylate cycle. Our synthetic pathway is linear and because of this, all of the chlorinated intermediates would eventually be fed into the native metabolism and turn into native metabolites. Additionally, the epoxide intermediate spontaneously degrades into four compounds CO2, formate, glyoxylate and dichloroacetic acid. The first three of these are these harmless and/or feed directly into E.coli metabolism. Dichloroacetic acid meanwhile, can be degraded by a protein known as haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (dhlB-2), isolated from Xanthobacter autotrophicus strain GJ10. The DNA sequence for this protein was isolated and converted into a biobrick by the 2014 Sydney Australia iGEM team. While this team was unable to fully assemble their metabolic pathway intended to degrade dichloroethane, they did manage to characterize dhlB-2, and showed that it degraded both chloroacetate and 1,2-DCA. Other papers have shown that dhlB-2 can degrade dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) and we predicted that a functional dhlB-2 which could degrade other halogenated compounds would degrade DCAA.10
The last protein we needed to make our full pathway complete was GroEl/Es. The Braunschweig team described difficulties of getting sMMO to fold properly in JM109 E.coli, and used the Takara Chaperone protein folding kit to that end. Although this protein is naturally encoded by E.coli, it was demonstrated by the Braunschweig 2014 iGEM team that using the GroEl/Es plasmid under the inducible pBAD promoter allowed for the six subunits of sMMO to assemble properly. Rather than spend the money on the kit, our team decided to make GroEl/Es a Biobrick, with the intention to eventually make it a composite part with pBAD.
Our project now formalized, our team now turned to the task of convincing our university to fund our research project. UNC-Asheville is a small"

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," population increases [3 ]. Biotechnological methods could help increase food production since generating genetically modified crops can provide protection from pathogens. Besides fewer insecticides and other chemicals are needed. Another aspect in generating GM food is to modify the nutritional value of the food. One example is the so called “Golden Rice” that has a higher concentration of vitamin A than normal rice.
Green genetic engineering is not only a scientific issue, but also a political, social and commercial one. That is why our project addresses the populace. It is an important issue for almost everybody in the population and it is a really present and much debated topic.  In Germany a lot of research is done in the field of green genetic engineering. However, the step to the application of GM food is still difficult. That is why the iGEM TU Munich Team wants to inform people about genetic engineering in general and to moderate the concerns about it. Besides we want to lay the foundations for a new generation of functional food by producing iGEM’s first and finest SynBio Beer.
School Visit
On July 24th, two of us visited the Joseph-Bernahrt-Gymnasium to give exciting talks about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. In addition students could get their hands dirty trying to reveal some of the genetic secrets of bananas, pineapples and ""gummi bears"".
Public Relations
Throughout the entire project we used different media channels to inform the general public. Our cooperation partner was Laborwelt.de. In addition we kept our followers up to date using a variety of social media.
Comic
Our team designed a comic introducing our hero ""Super Yeast"". In an entertaining way the comic explains the idea of synthetic biology and our project. We created two versions: one for children and one for grown-ups. Have a look and find out what our hero experiences!
Information Day
On August 25th, German iGEM teams informed the general public about synthetic biology and iGEM. This nationwide information day was a joint effort to inspire people throughout Germany and spread the word about synthetic biology.
Politics
On September 18th, we invited the general public to an evening full of presentations and an interesting panel discussion. Experts gave comprehensive talks and during the panel discussion scientists and politicians debated on genetic engineering in food.
Movie
In total we produced two movies. One in cooperation with an online magazine called ""Wissen + Konzepte"" to highlight the scientific part of our project and another one to present our team and our project.

A Cheeky Visit to the Radio Station
At 10am this morning (10/09/15), Helen and Mabel left the Biochemistry Department to walk to the studios of BBC Radio Oxford, ready for an 11am broadcast. After half an hour’s walking, they were glad they’d left that much time, since the building was still on in sight. However, they trusted the map Mabel had on her phone, which said they were only two minutes away, and arrived with plenty of time to sign in, have a quick sit down and a glass of water, and to go over their plan of what they were going to say.
The producer then came and collected them from reception, being very welcoming and enthusiastic about our work, and shortly afterwards, they were introduced to the presenter of the show, Kat Orman. They had a chat about the outline of the show, including basic questions that would be asked, and then it was time to perform!
After a few introductory statistics and soundbites of quotes provided by the producer, the interview started. The main topic of conversation of antibiotic resistance. Within this, they talked about why we chose our project, what outreach we’re doing, and how we would combat the prospect of a society who demand to be prescribed antibiotics. Additionally, they spoke about how DNA cloning works, in very simple terms, and the concept of synthetic biology. Kat, like her producer, was very enthusiastic about our project, claiming that it had the potential to save the world! We said that we hoped that, if our idea were to be developed further, it would.
Finally, Helen and Mabel took a few pictures with the microphones and Kat, before leaving the building, buzzing with excitement all the way home. We’d like to thank BBC Radio Oxford for inviting us to come and speak about our project.
Until tomorrow…

As it happened that we share with the BCCS-Bristol projet some similarities and especially on the modeling part we have decided to contact them in order to either find synergies or just to be sure not to make a redondant modeling work. Obviously it seems that we were not working on the same domain.
So in order to make a complete modelisation of the ""project"" we provided them unconditionally with the Mathlab source code of the production of vesicles.

The yellow colony in the figure is mating successfully. After the induction of galactose, vika recombinase was expressed, and yEmRFP gene and terminator was deleted so that β-carotene expresses. The color of colony was changed from white to yellow. In addition to it, we also tried other methods to turn on the switch.

Aftermath
During both interviews, gene therapy and cell engineering were mentioned as technical methods to express our work as a treatment. After the interviews, we decided to do more detailed research on these two methods. Altogether, these interviews pointed at topics that we need to learn more about for the safe and effective application of our project.

Preservation of Cas13a activity at different concentrations
As CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 were chosen to dry Cas13a, we simulated the behaviour of the two proteins at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L. An example on how the difference in concentration affects the number of chains is shown in Figure 13 for SAHS 33020. We again chose a volume fraction of 0.1 and analyzed the development of Cas13a coverage (see Figure 14) as well as the energy over time (see Figure 15).
Figure 13: Initial state of lattice model simulation for SAHS 33020 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L at a volume fraction of 0.1.
In Figure 14 the number of direct neighbours to Cas13a is plotted against the TDP concentration at the same time in each simulation. Boothby et al. 2017 had previously observed a logarithmic behaviour of LDH activity towards TDP concentrations as high as 10 g/L. For this reason, we fitted a logarithmic curve over all points with function (4).
$$ y = m\cdot \ln(x) +b\tag{4} $$
The coefficient of determination of the resulting curve is between 0.7 and 0.8 for both fits, indicating that it complies with the data reasonably well. The system might not have reached its saturation point, but the curve evens out towards higher TDP concentrations as would be expected. This means that, up to a concentration of 1 g/L at least, a higher Cas13a coverage can be achieved by increasing the TDP concentration. Better preservation of Cas13a activity may be possible to obtain with higher TDP concentrations, but our results indicate that the difference in the resulting desiccation tolerance will become less pronounced at higher concentrations. This complies with observations by Boothby et al. 2017 , who observed that the curve was flattening out towards the saturation point after around 1 g/L.
Figure 14: a) Number of direct neighbours to Cas13a over a) CAHS 94205 and b) SAHS 33020 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 g/L at 800 moves per chain at a volume fraction of 0.1. A logarithmic function was fitted to the data. The resulting R^2 of the fits is between 0.7 and 0.8 for both.

OUR INSTRUCTORS AND ADVISORS
Sophie Vaud
Sophie is a PhD student at the Synthetic Biology Research Centre in Nottingham since January 2015. She aims at taming a bacterium charmingly called Cupriavidus necator that, in spite of a convoluted name, has the great ability to grow on some industrial gas waste such as CO2 and H2. To do so, she is laboriously developing bacterium-related high-throughput genome editing tools to rewire the metabolic pathways of the bug and turn bad gas waste into sustainable chemicals.
 
When Sophie is not in the lab (because there is an incubation time) , she likes running, reading, kayaking, going to the theater or meeting up friends around Europe for city/beach breaks. A fan of improbable science, she secretly dreams of winning one day an Ig Nobel Prize (like tracking whether locusts could detect collisions in Star Wars films!).

Abstract
The growing need for alternative fuel sources has sparked interest and research across many scientific and engineering disciplines.  The fledgling field of microbial fuel cell development has previously relied on anaerobic metal reducing organisms such as Geobacter sulfurreduccens.  This project sought to isolate genes from the electron shuttling pathway in Geobacter and transform them into the more manageable aerobic Escherichia coli.  The Missouri University of Science and Technology iGEM team isolated four outer membrane cytochrome (omc) genes from Geobacter, vital to the extracellular transportation of electrons. The four genes; omcB, omcE, omcS and omcT, were cloned into individual plasmids.  The eventual goal is to combine all four genes into one plasmid to transform into E. coli to create an aerobic, electron transporting microbial system.

What is a Microbial Fuel Cell?
A microbial fuel cell is a device similar to a battery that can harness electricity from bacteria. These exoelectrogenic bacteria transport electrons outside of the cell to reduce compounds in the outside environment. The process is the final step in normal electron transport for these bacteria. Microbial fuel cells harness these extracellular electrons to power a load. The bacteria grown on the anode, where they donate electrons to a carbon surface. The electrons then move along the circuit where the energy is capture to power a lightbulb. Hydrogen ions are transported across a permeable membrane into the cathode where they meet the electrons and finally reduce oxygen into water.
Creating a better MFC
In the past, microbial fuel cell research has been conducted solely in an anaerobic environment due to the anaerobic nature of most exoelectrogenic bacteria. We moved the key electron shuttling genes from an anaerobic bacteria, Geobacter sulfurreducens, to an aerobic bacteria, Escherichia coli"

Apoptosis susceptibility experiment with sTRAIL
sTRAIL is a sinaling molecule activating the TNF pathway in cancer cells, specifically inducing apoptosis in these cells, as opposed to the case of non-cancer cells which are not susceptible to sTRAIL [Srivastava 2001] . With the following experiment we are determining the optimal incubation time and sTRAIL concentration for induction of apoptosis in our cancer cell lines of interest.
Count cells and prepare a mastermix to have 80’000 cells or 600’000 cells per well for adherent and suspension cells, respectively. Prepare enough mastermix for all desired controls, concentrations, incubation periods, and replicates.
Distribute the cells into the wells of a 96-well plate, 200 µL per well.
Adherent cells must be allowed to settle for 2 hours previous to the start of the experiment.
Apply 5 µL of the desired dillutions of sTRAIL to the appropriate wells and incubate for 2 to 6 hours at 30ºC.
After incubation, separate cells from their medium (spin down suspension cells, remove medium from wells with adhesive cell.
Wash 3 times with DPBS.
For detection of apoptosis, Annexin V-Alexa488 can be used. It will bind to externalizes phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells.
Resuspend cells in Annexin binding buffer and add 5 µL per sample. Incubate at RT for 15 min.
Dillute Annexin V-Alexa488 by addition of 50 µL of Annexin binding buffer. Alternatively, engineered E. coli bacteria expressing our INP-Annexin V construct along with RFP (BBa_K1847015) can be used for detection.

Beta Testing Initiative
This year Michigan Software focused on beta testing as a form of collaboration. We sent out a call to all iGEM teams through several mediums, and received responses from the iGEM teams of MSU, Carroll High School, IIT Madras, Westminster University, the University of Florida, and our sister team Michigan Synthetic Biology. The teams followed instructions to upload a protocol and viewed several of the key features of our site, and were then asked to provide feedback. For example, they were asked what information might also be useful to have when searching for protocols. The complete survey guiding the testing can be found here (https://goo.gl/forms/TJOCenKrEzsICL2g1) (embed this later).
Through this collaboration, we gained quite valuable feedback and insight into how scientists and science students not only use our software, but how they see it and what improvements they believe we should implement. As a software team comprised mainly of computer science students, this feedback is essential to the further development of our software. It helps us determine whether or not our project is useful to the target community. In exchange for their feedback, we provided assistance to the teams with their wikis. If they encountered issues while formatting or styling their wikis, we helped them with the HTML and web design aspects, areas of software where we have expertise.

ProtoMetrics
     ProtoCat is meant to enable lab researchers to get feedback on their lab procedures; in order to improve efficiency or gather feedback. But how can they quantify which version of a protocol is better? What if a researcher wants to gather feedback about a specific step, or specific product? Ask for the calibration of the equipment that other people are using? And even if they can get it in the comments, how will they get that information in a readily accessible and usable form? This need gave rise to ProtoMetrics, our way to allow researchers to get quantitative metrics on their protocols.
     ProtoMetrics allows users to specify three types of questions: Text, Numeric, or Polls. Text and Numeric are relatively straightforward; the former asks for a text response (ex: describe the resulting solution), whereas the latter is for strictly numeric responses (ex: How many grams of product were you able to produce?). Polls allow for a respondent to choose from a selection of responses, which can be used for specific equipment calibration. Once the users have submitted the responses, the publisher of the protocol can download the results in a Comma Seperated Value (csv) file for easy import into Excel, MATLAB, or a similar analysis tool.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#6 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," listen on instead of using a single channel for everything, and wherever possible messages from one part to another use the same format: 'owner's ID','destination object's id','message label' as the first three parts of the message. Some messages don't need any more information than that, and some are broadcast messages that don't need a destination object id either. Others would have several additional pieces of information, each separated by a comma. This system has been very reliable, and it takes practically no effort to set up reliable new messages types now.
I believe I actually made a big diagram of all the messages to make sure that none were conflicting with each other, before realizing that if I just followed these rules there couldn't be any problems!
Also made a list of what I hadn't implemented yet:
Count mode, aka the Interaction Checker
Polymer maker, aka the Biobricker (later fully implemented! wohoo!)
DNA binding interactions, I had RNAP and repression working, but not translation/transcription or activation, and the system for termination was a little unstable too. (later fully rectified and implemented as well. yay!)

Marketing
Today I spoke to the President from BioAlberta and he generously offered to donate money to iGEM Calgary. BioAlberta was added to our Bronze list for sponsorship.
I also wrote up some emails to  companies after researching the companies for the past few days. The rest of the marketing team edited the emails before I sent them off. I also call 8 other companies and 5 companies were interested in looking at our sponsorship package. I sent off the package and updated the iGEM marketing excel spreadsheet. I left a voicemail to the 3 companies and I'll follow up with them tomorrow or later this week. I got the contact information of the Marketing Lead for one of those 3 companies. My plan is to call the other 2 companies tomorrow to first: get a hold of someone in-charge of sponsorship and second: speak to them about our project, potential applications and how it may benefit their company.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"orum sensing takes place between bacteria of the same species, there are cases of interspecies quorum sensing. Auto-inducers affect the gene expression of the bacteria once they reach a certain concentration threshold. Bacteria using quorum sensing usually produce small amounts of auto-inducers, so that the concentration of auto-inducers are affected by the concentration of the bacteria. In other words, quorum sensing, in essence, regulates gene expression in response to cell density. Using quorum sensing, bacteria are able to act in unison, as if they were a single organism.
Quorum sensing is widely used by various bacteria for various functions, so each uses a slightly different auto-inducer so the signals are not mixed up. In general, gram-negative bacteria use a class of molecules called N-acyl homoserine lactones, or AHL, while gram-positive bacteria use short processed polypeptides.
For example, the picture below represents the quorum sensing mechanism in the bacteria vibrio fisheri.  Vibrio fisheri is a bacteria that produces bioluminescence, and is famous for revealing quorum sensing for the first time. Vibrio fisheri uses quorum sensing to produce light in high cell density, and researchers first discovered quorum sensing from examining it.
Quorum sensing in vibrio fishri involves LuxI and LuxR as well as AHL. LuxI is the protein that produces AHL, and LuxR forms a complex with AHL to affect the regulation of genes. In this case, it produces luciferase, which produces bioluminescence. Furthermore, the process also boosts the production of LuxI, which creates a positive feedback loop. This AHL-LuxR quorum sensing mechanism is one of the most well known gram-negative quorum sensing pathways, and it can be engineered to affect almost any coding sequence we'd like to.
For the project, we have developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL. In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells.
Experiment: Process and Results
There are many ways of utilizing quorum sensing for medicinal use, and one of the most intuitive and most well-known methods is quorum quenching.
Quorum quenching takes advantage of the fact that quorum sensing also plays a role in expressing virulence, and interferes with the quorum sensing that produces virulence. There are many"

Collaborations：Library
This year, we have constructed several sensors and reporters as our inputs and executors to provide users more options when using the MagicBlock system. These blocks include lacI-lasI, which generates signals upon induction; pcons+GFP, which constitutively generates signals; lasR-GFP and lasR-mRFP, which present different fluorescence and lasR-amilCP, which gives bacteria resistance to chloramphenicol. Meanwhile, we also collected parts that can be reformed for our MagicBlock from other teams. For example, we have collected promoters that can sense nitrogen from UCAS, an auto-inducer quorum-sensing generator from SiCAU-China, a toolbox of recombinase from Fudan-China, cellulase and pectinase from LanZhou iGEM team, and Bt toxin protein from FAFU-China. In addition to part collection, we also reconstructed some MagicBlocks from previous characterized parts so that they can be integrated into our project. Thus our library was and will be continuously improved by users to increase the versatility.

We also kept a sample of unpurified PCR product from this digestion to run on a gel, to see if we're losing our desired product in the PCR purification step.
The bands on this 1.2% e-gel were unexpectedly high. It maybe a problem with the gel.
We performed a ligation reaction using the following recipe:
5 ul ligation mix
4 ul backbone
1 ul oligo
But after seeing the gel results we are unsure whether the ligation could be successful.
In order to further troubleshoot our less-than-ideal gels for our digestion product, we ran a third digestion reaction, using the second recipe. This time we simultaneously digested our oligo, and our cross junction (which had been shown to work before). We also ran the unpurified PCR product from recipe 2 on this gel.
See tomorrow's entry for the gel image. Our digestion of the cross junction appeared to have worked, while once again, we got unusually large bands for our oligo.
PCR of Zif268 to create GFP Reporter Strain
We performed a PCR to clone out Zif268 so that we can later assemble Zif and GFP into our reporter plasmid. We used the Zif clone Forward and Zif clone Reverse primers (Primer index: 148 and 149). We had an annealing temperature of 62* and an extension time of 90 seconds. Our expected product was ~3 kb.
See tomorrow's entry for the gel. Our PCR appeared to have worked, and we have a strong band at our expected product size.

Plate reader:
We got some beautiful growth curves! A few of the more critical ones are below:
NM+his: both selection strain and pSR01 grew, but the selection strain grew faster. This might just be an artifact from having accidentally added more cells to the selection strain than the pSR01 wells, but it may also show that the pSR01 strain grows slower. Another possibility is that we are expressing enough zinc fingers for it to be slightly toxic for the cells. Next time maybe we should let the plate reader go for longer than 16 hours just in case the cells need more time.
NM: selection strain does not grow, while pSR01 does a perfect rescue!
pSR01 HARV3-AT comparison: the concentration of 3-AT does not seem to make a difference in the growth curves (the differences appear to be due to different wells starting with slightly different amounts of"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"seradish peroxidase, even temperature can be varied as well.
It was noticed that some models predict negative concentrations of enzyme intermediate even though the governing equations were correct. We believe this was due to the stiffness of the system, for some reactions occur 7 magnitudes faster than others. When using a different technique, say stiffness switching, the simulation takes a very long time while progresses little, reaching maximum iteration step sets as 10^6. Fortunately the negative concentrations predicted were only of magnitude of 10^(-30) micro molar, such that it doesn't effect the result much. To fix the issue completely, however, may take more time by simplifying the governing equations.
Currently luciferase was modelled in luminescence output while β-galactosidase and horseradish peroxidase was modelled in color metric output. To make a proper comparison we wish to model the luminescence of horseradish peroxidase too. Even though the unit of measurement of luminescence and color metric output were in arbitrary units, we wish to obtain good insights in the shape of their response curve to select the one best suited for our needs.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
To add information about mass balance to the reaction scheme of chemiluminescence of horseradish peroxidase we used a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). That is, in addition to differential equations governing the rate of change, because of the chemical equilibrium between species, algebraic equations constraining the relation between them are also included. Mathematica complained about the system being over determined even if no initial condition was given. In fact the form this DAEs has is not solvable by Mathematica.
The workaround for this problem I have found was to reduce everything to the fundamentals. So instead of equilibrium expressed as system of algebraic relations, I broke them into two reactions with rate constants large enough to be fast still obey the proportionality required by the equilibrium constant.
Maya 2012 couldn't open the Ferritin file created in Maya 2014. So I switched to Maya 2014 and now everything works fine.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
The modelling is finished for now; until data from our experiments start to coming in, there is nothing to model. To help prepare the experiments I spent time studying experimental design and analysis techniques, with focus on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and factorial design. The book I had chosen to study from was Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments textbook.

Detection of Virus Like Particles
A key part of our project is the detection of VLPs . We need sufficient visualization to get conclusive evidence of VLP formation. Besides standard approaches, we will investigate alternative methods to detect the formation and stability of Virus-Like Particles. In this paragraph we explain in short which methods we used and how these methods work. We also describe the limitations of the techniques, so that other people have an idea about what is possible.
Electron Microscopy
Figure 1: Electron microscopy versus Light Microscopy, instead a light as a source to illuminate the sample EM used electrons and instead of glass lenses, EM uses electro-magnetic lenses
The most straight forward method to detect VLPs is Electron Microscopy (EM) [1]. We prepared and investigated multiple samples ourselves. This work was done at the Virology department of the Wageningen University.
Electron microscopy works similar to light microscopy (figure 1), but instead of visible light being used to illuminate the sample"

Ecological impacts
Taxol is an cytotoxic drug that has immense potential. Unfortunately, getting taxol is not so easy. Its history has been racked with environmental concerns and supply issues that delay Phase I, II, and III clinical trials. Because of the nature of the illness this disease targets--cancer is fatal and many people are willing to spend immense amounts of money for just marginal impacts--time is quite sensitive.[6] An initial Phase II trial at Johns Hopkins University found an activity rate of 30% of taxol against ovarian cancer, [2] and later reports showed 20-50% activity, mostly partial remission [6.] Taxol is unique in its mechanism of microtubule stabilization, disrupting mitosis and leading to cell death. [2] Ovarian cancer results in the death of 12500 women in the US per year, so these results generated strong interest. [6] Taxol was also found to have activity in a variety of other cancers: breast, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. [1] Despite the strong results and urgent need, it took 30 years for taxol to get from nature to being prescribed in clinics. [13] The two main barriers preventing taxol from reaching its full capabilities are supply, as well as safety of its administration.
The Pacific Yew Tree
Taxol was originally isolated from the bark of Pacific Yew tree in 1962 by botanist Arthur Barclay. [1] Pacific Yews are found in Washington and Oregon, slow growing, and not abundant enough to keep up with clinical trial demands. [2] 20,000 pounds of bark--equalling two to four thousand trees--makes 1 kg of taxol.[2] There is about 100 mg of taxol per kg dried bark. This is enough to do in vitro testing, but amounts on the magnitude of grams are needed for tests to officiate taxol as a drug candidate. [3] Not only are yields low from trees, the process of collecting takes time, from waiting to collect in the spring and summer months when park peels easily, to the more than nine months for drying, extraction and recryst"
TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#tech#hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," dimension. Our last and final approach is to split the movement axes using screws for control, as demonstrated below:
Figure 2. Our micromanipulator setup. By turning the threads, we can precisely change the two axis alignment.
In the figure shown above, the green stack functions as a frame to fixate the screws. Thereby, one end is attached with springs allowing more bounce and flexibility. The yellow and the red stacks enable the alignment control in the x and y direction, correspondingly. The camera is then placed onto the red stack to record holograms once the light source, the object to be observed, and the camera is properly aligned. We used these micromanipulators to study the necessary parameters in our project. Due to the compactness of them we stepped back from the micromanipulators in our final setup improving the robustness on the other hand.
Light Sources
As the resolution of the microscope highly depends on the implemented light source, we decided to test a variety of different light sources. We started with an upcycling idea: why not use an old X-Box One's DVD Pickup, the advantage being the little cost for a reliable laser source. DIyouware Bros gives a detailed instruction on how to use the pickup, and a customized PCB board as a micromanipulator to align the laser source at the desired position with micrometer precision, and to control the intensity of the laser. However, a fatal disadvantage was discovered during our tests with the experimental setup. A Fresnel lens is integrated onto the laser diode within the pickup, producing an undesired interference pattern, thus destroying the recorded holograms. Other approaches are using an LED, a collimated light source, and a pinhole, to produce point source eminating spherical waves. The disadvantages of common LEDs is the low intensity, and the little coherence time compared to the laser source. The brightness can be compensated with high power LEDs, such as the ones used in fishkeeping, or even better, smartphone flash lights. Imagine a DIHM adapter for a smartphone: nowadays, most smartphones have tremendously bright flash lights. They are common LEDs with a high intensity peak lying in the blue light spectrum making it easy to detect in our experimental setup. Thus, offering a proper solution for a portable easy to use microscope.

Camp BioE
Throughout the whole month of July, our iGEM team presented to middle and high schools student on what iGEM is, the field of synthetic biology, and our project. These students are part of Camp BioE, a multiweek summer intensive camp that covers different areas of biology and bioengineering. Before the camp started we realized that synthetic biology can be confusing, so we included fun, interactive games to better explain the topic. Our presentation to the students offered a balance of teaching students valuable information, getting students interested in synthetic biology, and engage the students to create a lifelong memory. We wanted to encourage them to recognize and learn about synthetic biology and someday become future iGEMers!
Translating with Camp Bio-E
Some of the students at the Bio-E camp did not speak English or English was not their first language. Luckily, one of our iGEM members, Tucker, was able to speak Spanish fluently and aid each of the students to fully understand synthetic biology and other camp topics. Tucker helped translate information regarding our presentation about synthetic biology, communicated the rules and expectations of their work, explained experiments they ran during the camp, helped to guide their work in developing their own project and presentation, and more.
Portersville Christian School
Our first stop on our journey of presenting synthetic biology was a small school outside of Pittsburgh called Portersville Christian School. We specifically wanted to present to students not only in the city of Pittsburgh but the surrounding areas as well. We also wanted to inspire students by showing them some of the new technologies that are available and provided them information about ways they can get involved. We presented the students with fundamental information about the synthetic biology field along with showing them our project and providing ways they can get involved in the field.
Crossroads Foundation
During the first week of July, we presented to students at the Crossroads Foundation, a non-profit organization that’s goal is to provide academic resources to students. Although this program was not specifically geared toward biology or science, our team realized how important gathering a multitude of educational information at a young age is and wanted to reach out to a multitude of different programs and schools. The high school students were eager to learn about synthetic biology along with the CRISPR-Cas9 system and were ecstatic to play the games we had prepared for them.

When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. But what if the network structure is altered? What if a “parallel circuit”, where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation, is in place of a “series circuit”? Inspired by information theory, we scrutinize noise propagation in parallel information channels, and construct synthetic biology circuit using split florescent proteins and split dCas9 to quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature."

Scientific Community
General Public
This year iGEM Pasteur Paris attended multiple events with the purpose of spreading information about what iGEM is, inside and outside scientific fields. We decided not to limit ourselves to the Parisian region, so we travelled all around France and even to Denmark talking about our project NeuronArch. Our talks were not only with biologists but with physicists, mathematicians, chemists. We wanted also to speak with middle and high school students and even children, raise awareness on disabilities but also vulgarize our project, synthetic biology and science in order to spark vocations.
Engaging the Scientific Community
Translational Research Day
The Translational Research Day is a full day small symposium dedicated to translational research. The event was organized at Institut Pasteur (Paris) from 2007 to 2014 by the former Center for Human Immunology. Since 2015, it is organized by the Translational Research Center. This year, it focused on gathering scientists working on neuropsychology, microbiota and angering. We had the pleasure to share our ideas and present to the scientific world for the first time our team’s project NeuronArch through our first poster.

Young Researchers in Life Sciences
The Young Researchers in Life Sciences (YRLS) is one of the most important conferences of spring. We participated in the 9th edition conference held from the May 2nd -4th at Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris. Young researchers presented their projects through scientific posters, like we did, and gave us some precious advices on the experiments to come.

Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," it’s only coherent that men attempt to repair their mistakes. As biologists, we offer to solve this biological problem, in this fragile ecosystem, with a biological solution. Physicochemical approaches have been partially successful and hopefully, combined with biological ones, one might expect the treatment to be completely successful.
However, our project is merely a proof of concept. We are aware that it won’t be possible to right away test our genetically modified bacteria in real conditions. Indeed, the ecosystem of the cave is very delicate and vital for the preservation of the frescoes. Thus, it is necessary to know what might be the impact of our modified microorganism on the environment before using it to treat the caves. We need to remove the black and white fungi while preserving the balance of the ecosystem. However, after getting in touch with scientists and people working in the Lascaux cave, it turned out that we will be able to test our genetically modified bacteria in a ""cave test"". Among others, we contacted Yvan Moënne-Loccoz, part of the scientific council of the Lascaux cave and Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle Director of the National Museum of Prehistory.
It is obvious that any project involving the release of genetically modified bacteria in an ecosystem, needs an in-depth studies to evaluate the evolution of the ecosystem following the addition of a genetically modified native bacterium. Such studies have been already done before. For example, a Canadian study analyzed changes in microbiota of rhizosphere (soil area directly formed and influenced by roots and microorganisms) and endorhiza (internal root tissue) cucumbers after adding a genetically modified native bacterium. This allowed the estimate of the risks associated with the future use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) in crops. This study shows that the ecosystem’s modification in this project is not significant. It gives an encouraging result for the use of synthetic biology. It may be possible in the near future to get the same results for our project and why not imagine being able to reopen the cave to the public in the future?

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2018,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in the academic version, which is opposite to what we expected. Since we do not have enough answers, we cannot establish that there is a significant difference. However, we might be able to say that people seems to be positive towards this kind of treatment even though it includes eating gene modified yeast. It might even be the case that people are more positive towards the treatment when the information about it seems more professional and scientific. From the written answers in the survey it appears to be the easiness and the immediate start of the treatment that convinced most people to take the yeast pill both for detection and treatment and as a preventative measure. For the respondents that did not want to use the yeast treatment, the reason appears to be lack of testing and risk information about the product. How could they know that it was trustworthy? The written answers have been summarized here .
Product Safety and Ethical Aspects
Meeting with Associate Professor in Biolotechnology Field
Carl Johan Franzén is an associate professor in bioreaction engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. He has not only experience of working with yeast, but he has also been a part of the ethical committee at Chalmers University. We thought that it was a great opportunity to discuss our project with Carl Johan Franzén to hopefully get an expert’s view on our idea. The meeting with Carl Johan Franzén was rewarding, and it resulted in a discussion about the risks that comes with our product. He reminded us that it is not only important to look at the risks of the yeast being ingested by the patient, but to also consider what will happen when it leaves the body. Is it for example possible that the inserted genes will spread in nature and what will happen if they do? We made our best to do an unbiased and probable evaluation of the potential risks with our product.
Patient Safety
Since the final product, a pill containing freeze-dried Saccharomyces Boulardii, is ingested by the patient it is important that the safety of the patient is considered. In our case this mainly concerns the relationship between the yeast and the gut, in terms of the probability of the yeast outgrowing the gut bacteria and colonizing the gut. From literature covering the subject of S.boulardii as a probiotic, we can conclude that this is not likely. In medical studies it has been shown that in patients that ingest S. boulardii continuously over a period of time, the probiotic yeast concentration in the colon reaches a steady state after 3 days (Czerucka, D. et al. 2007).  Furthermore, it was found that"
ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Interplay_-_-_TEXT.html," downstream components: the PABA producing enzymes and the pigment to get an idea how much PABA the system can produce at steady state.
UVR8 Feedback
We were interested in how the absorption of UV-B radiation by our protection molecule PABA can affect the activation of our UVR8-TetRDBD fusion protein. The negative feedback reduces the output, but has no other adverse effects on the system.
Decoder Circuit LovTAP Cph8
To see how we can indirectly detect sunlight with blue and red light receptors, we came up with the idea and biological implementation of the decoder . Our model showed that the decoder can work in theory and resulted in constraints given the promotor strength in the system.
PABA and the Sun protection factor
Last but not least we were wondering how much PABA we need to produce to achieve a certain Sun Protection Factor (SPF). Or, vice versa, given the amount of PABA our bacteria produced, what is the achieved Sun Protection Factor. This helped to decide for a chorismate accumulating strain to produce more PABA to yield a higher SPF. It also revealed that we also need an UV-A absorbing molecule such as the PABA related Padimate O to reach meaningful SPFs since UV-A and UV-B radiation are likewise dangerous.
Trivia
The modellers produced a month stock of liquid LB media and LB agar, performed a Miniprep and loaded a gel. The lab guys became Photoshop and Illustrator experts for the poster and presentation.
