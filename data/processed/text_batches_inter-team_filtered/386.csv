Every year, a small number of students from the Lower Saxony region have the chance to be a part of the Life Science Lab in Hanover. They get the opportunity to form teams by themselves and work on different science projects. Examples include DNA extraction from roses and ELISA tests for the Zika-virus.  We decided that this is a good platform to present our project and talk about science. We prepared a 3-hour long workshop and presentation about the different methods we often use in the lab, like cloning or immunostaining for example. We tried to explain the function and structure of TALE’s to the students and what impacts they could have in all subfields of science, like medicine or plant breeding for example. We also spoke about ethical aspects of synthetic biology, our motivation to study science and different aspects about the studies. For example the structure and the amount of learning and practical works. We hoped to see some of them at the university later.
Postcards
In cooperation with 7 other German iGEM Teams in 2016 (Bielefeld, Aachen, Tübingen, Göttingen, Darmstadt, Düsseldorf, Erlangen) we decided to start a postcard action to clear up prejudices most people have against synthetic biology. The idea stemmed from the iGEM team in Aachen. We decide to design a postcard about the usage of pork blood in the insulin industry and how the quantity of pig slaughter can be reduced by using synthetically produced insulin. We sent some postcards to the other teams and received their postcards in return. We then distributed the cards on the streets, in bars, and around our university. In this way, we got in contact with people and talked about the positive aspects and struggles of synthetic biology. We also hoped to get rid of the fear that synthetic biology is dangerous and can damage the world.
Ethical lesson
A large part of science is the ethical questions that need to be answered every time one starts a new project. So we decided to talk about the ethical aspects"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," platform with sub-systems of a known function already pieced together within cell, it is possible to simply add a cell to generate desired behaviour instead of having to consider the underlying biological parts. Top-down design will enable a more interdisciplinary approach to biosensor development, as knowledge of underlying biological behaviour is no longer required, and will generate biosensors better suited to their intended functions, as the design process will begin with consideration of end-user specifications, as opposed to discrete biological parts.
The next step. Another advantage to the bypassing of gene assembly enabled by our platform is the increased ability to automate system construction. Microfludic systems are those which control the movement of small volumes of liquids (10–9 to 10–18 litres) using a variety of methods, which may be used to perform biological experiments. These devices have a number of advantages over traditional, manual, lab methods. They only use a small amount of liquid, which means less reagents are consumed and the time taken to perform experiments is reduced. These small amounts of liquids are easier to manipulate than larger volumes, meaning there is greater control over reactions resulting in a high degree of sensitivity (Whitesides, 2006). However, many devices do not have the ability to control temperature, which is important for many methods of gene assembly. Cell mixing, as opposed to gene fragment assembly, is more suited to automation on these platforms, as there is no requirement for precise temperature control. Also, the increased control over small volumes of reagents allows the screening of precise cell ratios. Additionally, programs are in development for the automation of protocols on microfluidic, which will allow the rapid combination of a number of variant biosensor components. To utilise this advantage, we developed software for the simulation of microfludics experiments

Project overview
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and is leaked into the atmosphere at different natural and industrial places. A big part of the industrial methane emission is in the agricultural sector in places like barns1, Bacteria in the rumen of cows and other cattle produce methane. or paddy fields2,3 Bacteria in the soil that produce methane. (rice fields). Natural methane emission places are for example wetlands4 land areas saturated with water in which methane producing bacteria reside. or gas hydrates5 Gas hydrates are trapped ice-like crystals of gas that are only stable in a specific temperature and pressure range. Found on continental shelves and under permafrost. To minimize the leakage of methane in these or other places one would want to breakdown methane locally. Or even better, one could convert methane to methanol or biomass so it can be more easily transported and used as a bio-fuel instead of being discarded. The current technology doesn't allow this kind of small scale local breakdown of methane, because this process requires high pressure and very high temperatures to break the strong bonds within one methane molecule.6 An attractive alternative is bio-conversion of methane. Methanotrophs single-cell organisms that metabolise methane. can naturally breakdown methane and use it as their sole carbon and energy source. Even better, the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO) that these methanotrophs use can breakdown methane at ambient temperatures and pressure.6-9
Thus if we could understand and use this enzyme it would be possible to develop tools to minimize the methane leakage at many places like barns and gas hydrates. However our knowledge about methanotrophs is limited and culturing them is relatively difficult and slow. That is why we want to implement MMO into Escherichia coli (E. coli) so that it can breakdown methane. Since methanol, the breakdown product of methane, is poisonous, we will also implement the Ribulose-Monophosphate (RuMP)- pathway from Bacillus methanolicus to convert methanol to biomass in three steps. To hold the bacteria we want to design an air-filter that could be used practically anywhere for this purpose. The first part of our project is based on the iGEM 2014"

2.1.1.2 FimE dependent fim switch(wild-type) state assay
To confirm the function of fim switch(wild-type) in the presence of FimE(wild-type), we constructed Biobrick parts, ( BBa_K1632013 as Fig. 3-3-2-9.  ( BBa_K1632013 enables arabinose-inducible expression of the FimE (wild-type).  In ( BBa_K1632007 and ( BBa_K1632008 , either the fim switch [default ON] or the fim switch [default OFF] is placed upstream of the GFP coding sequence.
 
Fig.3-3-2-9.New plasmids we constructed to confirm the function of fim switch.
Our purpose is to confirm that FimE (wild-type) inverts the fim switch (wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state predominantly. First of all, we measured the fluorescence intensity from the GFP expression in the presence of arabinose. From the results (Fig. 3-3-2-10), we confirmed that our fim switch(wild-type) is inverted from [ON] state to [OFF] state predominatly.
Fig. 3-3-2-10.The intensity of fluroscence in cells measured using flowcytometer
 
 Next, in order to confirm inversion more precisely, we also show the percentage of ON state (Fig. 3-3-2-11) and inversion in the level of DNA sequencing (Fig. 3-3-2-12).  Fig. 3-3-2-11 shows inversion from [ON] state to [OFF] state predominantly. E. coli harboring the [ON] fim switch(wild-type) plasmid glows in green fluorescence while E. coli harboring the [OFF] fim switch(wild-type) plasmid does not glow under ultra violet light.  Cells transformed by the plasmid mixture extracted from the experiment formed two types of colonies: those with strong fluorescence and those with little background fluorescence.  Also, sequence complementarity in the specific region of the switch shows intended inversion of the fim switch(wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state. Considering the percentage of [ON] state, FimE(wild-type) inverts the fim switch predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state.

Arte y Bioarte
Comúnmente entendemos por arte aquel acto de creación y expresión del ser humano por medio     de la manipulación de distintos materiales, imágenes o sonidos para trasmitir una idea o un     sentimiento y así producir un efecto estético en otra persona. Es muy fácil asociar esta     palabra con la belleza. Resultado de ello es la antigua división entre bellas artes y artes     menores.
En la actualidad el arte ha ampliado su definición al adelgazar los limites entre     disciplinas artísticas, tecnológicas y científicas, generando un resultado multi, inter     y transdisciplinario con una estética que no siempre corresponde a lo bello. Así al     asistir a un museo de arte contemporáneo las obras exhibidas se pueden convertir en un     dispositivo que invite al espectador a la reflexión.
Un ejemplo es el BIOARTE, el cual se puede definir como un campo del arte contemporáneo     que manipula el proceso de vida. Invariablemente emplea uno o mas de los siguientes     enfoques:
-El uso de biomateriales  específicos en formas inertes o en funcionamiento.
-El uso de las herramientas y procesos de la biotecnología.
-La invención o transformación de organismos vivos con o sin integración social o al     medio ambiente.
Al respecto  Edith Medina escribe:
El bioarte tiene como objetivo primordial borrar la línea entre la ciencia y el     arte, así como generar interrogantes del avance de la misma sobre la forma humana y     la vida en general. El material orgánico se convierte en la herramienta artística del     bioartista, desde mariposas, plantas, genes y ADN, hasta piel humana, laboratorios,     bioreactores, tubos de ensayo; de los cuales se toma posesión y se crean obras,     modificando procesos históricos y culturales. Cabe mencionar que el Bioarte hace uso     de la tecnología de su tiempo, y de esa manera evidencia el contexto histórico,     social y político de la humanidad.

May 2016
Our team leader went to his high school to introduce the concept of iGEM, hoping to make more people know about iGEM and come to join this competition together!
iGEM X Synthetic Biology exhibition
June 2016
We held an iGEM X synthetic biology exhibition in school library, drawing hundreds of visitors. We aimed to promote the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology to the common people by showing them some basic principles and practical application related to the synthetic biology.
We also made the elements of the biobrick (promoter, RBS, and etc) to let people learn how to complete the whole biobrick by assembling the elements themselves. We also provided the notebook to let people draw their own biobrick. And we got a lot of interesting “biobrick” from the people’s drawings. This was really cool exhibition experience!

Then we observed each sample with an epifluorescence microscope. The results were promising. B2- did not express sfGFP, but B2+ did. Additionally, in both cases (B2+ & B3) and (B2+ & supB3) the fluorescence of sfGFP disappeared almost completely. We are going to do soon another experiment but with a rigorous protocol.
May 14 – 20, 2012
The Distribution Kit 2012 arrived! Now we have a lot of new parts!
We prepared for second time samples of B2+ & B3+ to observe in the epifluorescence microscope the effect of time in the samples.
This time B2+ & B3+ presented much more fluorescence, and it persisted over time (at least 1 hour with no significant variation).
Additionally, we began to amplify the spider silk monomer ADF-3 from the plasmid that Christopher Voigt gave to us. But the amplicon was barely visible in the electrophoresis. We will have to try it again, or maybe try another technic like touch-down PCR. Or the primers are designed for repetitive areas?
May 21 – 27, 2012
We received the results of the DNA sequencing of Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid. Fortunately, these results are coherent with our designs. Great news!
Also, we went to the confocal microscope
May 28 – June 3, 2012
For second time we tried to amplify the spider silk monomer ADF-3 from the plasmid that Christopher Voigt gave to us. This time we believe that the PCR worked!
June 4 – 10, 2012
On Tuesday Bernardo presented all the advances of iGEM team UC Chile 2012 to professor Rodrigo Gutierrez and the Plant Systems Biology Lab members. We received many useful recommendations.
June 11 – 17, 2012
We did another experiment to investigate the interactions between our bacteria B2+ and B3, but this time with a serious protocol and recording the data for later analysis.
We expected that our results were coherent with our theory. [1] . Protease K should also be able to cut the HIV cleavage site, releasing the sfGFP.

LIGHT TO ODOR
Our roses were colorful now, but only fragrance that makes them vivid, appealing and with the soul as a real rose. So there came our second part, light to odor, making our roses more perfect and real. We first tried to use CRISPR/Cas9[1] gene-editing system to knock out the original gene of E. coli producing smell to prevent E. coli from giving off a nasty and unpleasant smell. Then based on the RGB system[2], we achieved the control of multiple odors with light.
Gene knock-out using CRISPER-Cas9
Figure 1. The tnaA and L-tryptophan degradation resulted in the unpleasant odor in E. coli.
The inherent unpleasant odor of E. coli comes from indole produced naturally in the cells’ metabolic process. In the L-tryptophan degradation pathway, Tryptophanase, encoded by tnaA gene, degraded L-tryptophan of indole, which produces the odor in high concentration.[3]
.
L-tryptophan + H2O = indole + pyruvate + NH3.
(The enzyme needs Co-factor: pyridoxal 5'-phosphate)
Figure 2-3. The procedure and the mechanism of CRISPER-Cas9.
Therefore, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, we tried to knock out the tnaA gene. First, we transformed a pCas9 plasmid into the host cell. Then selecting the positive clone, we used electroporation to transform plasmid TargetF (Figure 4"

Introduction of Yeast two-hybrid system
Our first gene circuit is based on Yeast two-hybrid system.
Yeast two-hybrid system(Y2H) is a molecular biology technique used to discover protein–protein interactions (PPIs)[1] and protein–DNA interactions[2],[3] by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two proteins or a single protein and a DNA molecule, respectively.
The premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For yeast two-hybrid system, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD can bind to the UAS and the AD can activate the transcription of downstream reporter gene. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.
[Figure 1] Yeast two-hybrid system
History
Y2H was originally designed to detect protein–protein interactions using the GAL4 transcriptional activator of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The GAL4 protein activated transcription of a protein involved in galactose utilization, which formed the basis of selection[4]. Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein–DNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use Escherichia coli instead of yeast[3]. The key to the Y2H is that in most eukaryotic transcription factors, the activating and binding domains are modular and can function in proximity to each other without direct binding[5]. This means that even though the transcription factor is split into two fragments, it can still activate transcription when the two fragments are indirectly connected.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hybrid_screening#cite_note-young-1)
Application of Y2H
In application, this system often utilizes a genetically engineered strain of yeast in which a reporter gene (GFP, nutrient genes or others) is inserted,"

Overview
Silver
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Cameron reports knockouts from Yale.
-Jacob
July 15
Sent the potential biobricks for sequencing last Friday, ordered primers for mutagenesis on DszC, ordered primers for attachment of fluorescent genes to amino acid genes, received all but yddg knockouts from Yale, found that the Arg knockouts work as described. Several other primers were also ordered, but I am not privy to their nature.
An attempt at doing an experiment to calibrate the fluorescent proteins for the plate reader (looking for quenching, linear relationship between OD and fluorescence, etc) was done on Sunday, but as it turns out, we had the wrong promoter for a fluorescent protein, and the wrong antibiotic resistance for one of the other proteins. Given this, we gave up, and decided to do it later with the proper strains.
Recently, there was a meeting with the kill switch team from Calgary. They suggested doing more sequencing, and that is indeed a good idea if we want to pursue this project. I think that the intein primers were ordered, but again, I am not privy to exactly what was ordered.
Competent cells were made from each of the knockouts, and they worked well. The yddg strain was ordered through collaboration with Calgary as well as the keio collection proper in Japan.
Today, I watched two pairs of eyes. One was black, and the other grey. And while the owners thereof, for the space of five seconds, walked past each other, the grey shot at the black, and the black fiddled the grey. Bonus points for identifying the poem without using a search engine.
Our Gibson assembly kit came! Doing the math, it turns out that it is about 30 times more expensive than gold, so we will use it wisely. Personally, I would have liked to just order the enzymes and buffer reagents, but c'est la vie. Our biobrick assembly kit also came, but that is rather less exciting.
The sequencing results from our amino acid biobricks came back, and it looks like only MetA was successful. It should be noted that the melting temperatures of the Vf2 and the VR primers are 60°, for cPCR validation of biobricks.
Several new combinations of fluorescent genes, antibiotic resistances, and Keio strains were made. We used the wrong ones last weekend, but now, we are going to test TyrA- +GFP, TrpA- +RFP, MetA- +YFP, and"
Paris-Saclay,2012,Team:Paris-Saclay#Project#Project Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"115017. As a consequence, the translation of the sequence encoding the cI repressor of phage lambda should take place only above 32°C (T1).
Inactivation above a given temperature: thermosensitive protein
The wild-type lambda cI repressor is efficient at 42°C, however a temperature-sensitive (Ts) cI repressor mutant, called cI857 was isolated and has been widely for temperature-controlled gene expression in bacteria. At low temperatures cI857 retains its wild type property, whereas at nonpermissive temperature (42°C), the repressor is unstable and is not able to bind to the operator of the PCI target promoter (Fig. 3). The Ts repressor which is available via biobrick BBa_K098995 can used to prevent a repressor activity on PCI above 42°C (T2).
The reporter system
Numerous reporters genes can be used to monitor gene expression. We chose a coloured reporter system based on the production of lycopene. Bacteria expressing the lycopene biosynthesis genes have a red color.
Figure 3:  The different steps and the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lycopene.
The genes crtE, crtB and  crtI encode three enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lycopene that convert the colourless farnesyl pyrophosphate to red lycopene via the intermediates geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and phytoene (Fig. 3).These enzymes are naturally expressed in tomatoes and carrots .The crtE, crtB and crtI genes has been assembled by the Cambridge team in 2009. They  are available via the BioBrick BBa_K274100 (Fig. 4).
Figure 4: BBa_K274100
Experimental system
Biobrick BBa_K274100 is a composite biobrick which contains the lycopene biosynthesis genes (under control of the arabinose promoter); the color red will be the reporter of promoter cI-dependent transcriptions of the four following constructs:
We propose to substitute the arabinose control by the cI repressor control (part of biobrick BBa_K098995). In the presence of the wild-type cI repressor (from biobrick BBa_C0051), the expression of the lycopene biosynthesis genes is repressed and the bacterial cells will be white regardless of their growth temperatures. This construct tests the efficiency of the repression by cI

Our parts collection is designed to make up a device for targeting any specific pathogen wanted using our osmY-hfq fusion biobrick to secrete our siRNA biobrick out of E. coli. Fusing Hfq with OsmY meant we could have it bind with the siRNA expression system we designed (expression system contains micC sequence for binding with Hfq from E. coli and chiA for binding with Hfq from Serratia marcescens). Using a simple PCR method a targeting sequence can be added to spiRNA specific to the gene of your choice. Using this in tandem with our OsmY-Hfq fusion proteins allows future users to use our system in a variety of other settings."

Practical and Hands-on Biology Education
During the academic year, our team offered a semester-long academic course, entitled iGEM 101, which gave students at our university the chance to learn about the theory and practice of synthetic biology. We designed our course to balance lecture-based instruction on essential concepts in synthetic biology, and real experiments that students would conduct to complete their own mini-project, inspired by real projects by iGEM teams.
We also reached out multiple high schools in the Nashville area, with the hope of starting a high school team. We met with the faculty of three schools, where we described what iGEM was, and asked for them to gauge their students' interests in forming their own iGEM team. We found a number of high school students that were interested in iGEM, who we tried to coalesce into a single Nashville-area high school team. Unfortunately, we were not able resolve the logistical challenges of forming the team. Despite this setback, we have established the groundwork for starting a high school team in the upcoming year.
Implications of Mutation in SynBio
We as team felt throughout our project that the synthetic biology community as a whole has not paid sufficient attention to the danger posed by mutations. As we emphasized throughout our research, no engineered genetic system is immune to mutation, and there is a genuine potential for harm as synthetic biology finds increasing real-world applications.
To help raise awareness of these pressing issues, we developed a survey which we distributed to other iGEM teams. In it, we described some examples of how mutations may derail genetically engineered constructs:
Every geneticist knows that all DNA sequences carry the possibility for mutation. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the risks that these mutations pose to practically applying synthetic biology. Our team is looking for collaborators who are willing to answer a simple question: if your BioBricks were implemented in the real world, what would"

For the glowing tree idea and the time capsule idea, we looked more into the actual lab procedures and for the game idea, we started thinking about various different options of implementation that would still render the game collaborative and dynamic. We presented our thoughts to Orit, and she suggested that start storyboarding and thinking more about interfaces now that our ideas were solid.
Wednesday, 6/12: After spending yesterday afternoon storyboarding our three main ideas, we met up with Orit yet again to show her our work. We knew that our lab procedure for the glowing tree idea was way too long, and Orit agreed; she suggested that we go through the lab procedure once more and to this time, capture the big ideas. Thus, we started a new storyboard for that experiment. We also redrew the storyboard for the time capsule idea, adding more details we had skipped over in our initial draft. Lastly, we unfortunately ran out of time to discuss our game idea (which was a slight bummer since we were a little stuck on it), but we will definitely talk more about it during our meeting with Orit tomorrow.

Then, in the afternoon, we started working on our final draft storyboards for tomorrow’s presentation and brainstorming session with BU. Once we had finished, we headed upstairs to room 211 to pin up all of our papers in preparation for tomorrow.]
Friday, 6/14: Today we had a very fruitful brainstorming session with the BU igem team. It was exhausting work, but we were very productive and got tons of great feedback from all of the people who came. In the morning, the people from BU were split into three groups, and circled around the room to hear each Wellesley project group present their projects. After a lunch break, we then reconvened and discussed the suggestions people had made in the morning so that more brainstorming could be done as an entire group. For our project, personally, Heather and I received great feedback on both the glowing plant and the time capsule ideas. One such example was including a guest book after the experiments to log down how people feel about these new, innovative ideas. All in all, it was a fantastically productive day, and we are eagerly looking forward to next week and the next stage of implementation.

Simulation 4: How does the introduction of IPTG into the system affect the amount of protein interest [Pout] produced?
Here, we are interested in varying the initial amount of IPTG introduced into the system. We have used arbitrary concentrations of IPTG, going from 0 to 8.
The more IPTG we introduce, the more LacI is temporarily removed from the system. LacI removal means that production of protein of interest [Pout] is no longer repressed. The more IPTG we add in, the more LacI is removed, and the greater the yield of output protein [Pout].
Note that this model is highly simplified. We have only taken into account the constitutive expression of the LacI repressor, and other features of the dynamics of the Lac operon have been neglected. Therefore, our simulations may not match the observed experimental behavior from the lab. However, they are useful in providing us a better understanding of the mechanism of chemical induction and will provide some of the engineering constraints that the Wetlab must take into account when performing experiments.

We hope that this model can guide the control of soil conditions in phosphate-solubilizing bacteria(psb). Let the phosphate-solubilizing bacteria(psb) grow better and promote Phytoremediation process. To achieve the best effect of soil heavy metal treatment.
The growth curve model of PSB
The pollution of heavy metals in soil is a major problem of environmental sanitation in the world. The governance process faces many difficulties. Phytoremediation is a promising technology because it does not cause secondary pollution and low cost. However, the growth process of these plants are typically inhibited by high concentrations of heavy metals, It causes slow growth of plants and decelerates the phytoextraction process. Therefore, our team engineer a class of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) to reduce the concentration of heavy metal ions in the soil. It also accelerates the growth of plants and repairs soil. Faced with severe heavy metal pollution, the environment of soil is complex and diverse.
Be familiar with the growth condition of the PSB. It becomes very important. In order to better understand the growth condition of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), we adopted the classic Gompertz  model. The following is the fitting effect diagram of growth curve

Abstract
We compared E. coli BW25113 bacteria under three different conditions: controls (1g) simulating Martian (± 0.4g) and microgravity (± 0g). Subsequently, RNA isolation and state-of-the-art RNAseq were performed, revealing significant down regulation of a translation initiation factor (yciH, ) and increased expression of two membrane proteins (yceK, hdeD, p_fdr < 0.1). Furthermore, under simulated Martian gravity, 56 antisense RNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed, constituting 56% of differentially expressed RNAs. Genome annotation (GO) of the genes inhibited by the affected antisense RNAs in the 0.4g treatment shows that E. coli specifically appears to suffer from carbon-deprivation and acid stress. These results are intuitive, given the reduced or absent convection in partial and microgravity, respectively, leading to build-up of waste products. We conclude that E. coli primarily responds to perceived changes in gravity on a translational level.
Introduction
We are interested in the effects of simulated Martian gravity on the expression of genes, as measured by RNAseq. Primarily, we would like to identify highly up and downregulated genes, so that their respective promoters can be used as gravity BioBricks in the iGEM competition. Furthermore, we want to characterize the transcriptomic changes in Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) with respect to stress and potential virulence, when partial gravity is simulated. To this end, we isolated RNA from bacterial colonies grown in the Random Positioning Machine (RPM 2.0), made by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands. 1

Interviewing Jay Keasling during the symposium
In addition, we were extremely lucky to not only discuss our project, but also get an interview with the keynote speaker of this conference, Jay Keasling . Subsequently, we recorded several conversations with other speakers as well as guests of the symposium. On the one hand, these interviews touched some general questions about the progress and perception of synthetic biology. On the other hand, the main topic was the risks and benefits of community labs. As a result, we gathered a wide spectrum of opinions, which contributed to and influenced our human practices project.
To sum up, by covering a variety of aspects concerning Community Labs we had now aquired enough background knowledge to meet a real Community lab. Fortunately, we already made friends with some members of the ""Technik Garage"", the Community Lab we had the pleasure to meet at the MakerFaire.

After a brief mishap with an uncapped centrifuge tube and an overzealous Megan, we were able to miniprep our cas9. (Good thing we inoculated two samples...) As usual, this was followed by analysis of the sample: nanodrop and a test digestion. We will also speak with iGEM Colombia later today! We're hoping to incorporate their cholera sensor into our depathogenizer. We're also trying to get in touch with a professor here who studies public health to explore the ethical side of our project, and synthetic biology as a whole.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," the experimental procedures.
Firstly, the expression vector will be linearized at the cloning site of choice. A small sequence (15-20 bp) overlapped with the end of the cloning site will be added onto the insert through a PCR step. After the inserts and the linearized vector are mixed in the presence of Exnase for only 30 min, the cloning DNA products can be directly subjected to E.coli transformation with true positive rate over 95%.
Steps
1. Preparation for linearized cloning vectors
Select appropriate cloning sites, and linearize the cloning vector. GC content of 20 bp regions at both ends of linearized cloning vector has great impacts on the recombination efficiency. The maximum recombination efficiency can be realized when the GC content of these regions is within 40%∼60%.Thus, it's better to avoid regions with sequence repeats and select regions containing even GC content.
The cloning vectors can be linearized by restriction digesting with endonuclease or by reverse PCR amplification.
2. Design of PCR primers of the insertions
The principle for the design of ClonExpress MultiS primers is: introduce homologous sequences (15 bp∼20 bp)into 5' end of primers, aiming to making the ends of amplified insertions and linearized cloning vector identical to the ends of their neighbours which is required for recombination reaction. Taking sequential assembly of three insertions (assembly order from 5' to 3' is as follows: insertion 1, insertion 2, insertion 3) to pUC18 cloning vector as example, design the primers as below:
Firstly, design the forward primer of insertion 1 and the reverse primer of insertion 3 (two insertions next to cloning vector) according to Figure 1.
Figure 1: Design of the forward primer of insertion 1 and the reverse primer of insertion 3
Notice: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency. When calculating the Tm of primers, the homologous sequence of vector ends should be excluded and only gene specific amplification sequence should be counted.
Secondly, design the reverse primer of insertion 1 and the forward primer of insertion 2. Homologous sequence used for inter-recombination between insertions can be fully added to either the reverse primer of insertion 1or the forward primer of insertion 2, and also can be partially added to both of them. Taking the addition homologous sequence to the reverse primer of"

SCU-China was invited this year and presented the project “Look What They’ve Done To My Shoes.” Haoqian Zhang, the finalist leader 2010 from Peking University gave us some good advice. We’re so happy that a lot of people are interested in our project.
It’s such a cool experience to meet with a lot of teams in China, including NCTU-Formosa from Taiwan. We talked a lot about the team project, the team construction and difficulties a lot with different teams. At the same time, it’s glad to travel in Guangzhou and Sun Yat-sen University."

They really loved Autumn Concept. The ground was filled with yellow and red leaves, tables decorated with pine cones, and it started at 08:30 pm until 02.00 am.  DJ perdormance and Live Band Music has been performed in IF Performance Hall which is a well-known place in Ankara.   Same as the previous ones, our first aim was to introduce synthetic biology.
We gave Lab education to young iGEM'ers!
We have started, advised and helped to this year's High School team ""METUHS-Ankara""!
We are raising new iGEM'ers!
HighSchool iGEM Courses: There is a part of iGEM for highschools which they can attent with their projects like for undergraduate and graduate parts. METU Development Foundation Schools (ODTÜ Geliştirme Vakfı Koleji) is one of the highschools which participate in this competition. We met this young iGEM'ers in this winter and made an education programme about synthetic biology. First, we attented to conference of Dr. Emrah Altındiş called “Approaching the deveopment of bacterial antigen with the help of Bioinformatics and Proteomics”. Then we visited our university's Central Laboratory. In Central Lab, we reviewed the protocols and performed Plasmid Isolation and Gel Electrophoresis. Then we made an presentation about iGEM Competition, generally what it is, what did we do last years and we gave some advices to them. We think this education program was helpful for METU highschool team and for us. We were so glad to share our experiences with young scientists. We have helped them in their WetLab and Modeling of their project. We are planning to repeat this education and helping in the following years.
II. METU The Day of Synthetic Biology!
As METU iGEM 2014 Team, we organized “II.METU The Day of Synthetic Biology” in February 22, 2014. With more than 190 participants, event was extremely productive for everyone. We both find the opportunity to listen to our teacher working on synthetic biology and contact with other iGEM teams. Our event started with the opening speech of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Can Özen. His ideas on İGEM and iGEM teams in the past years led us at many issues. Then Assoc. Prof. Dr. Yeşim Aydin Son’s “Synthetic Biology in the"

The malaria-specific Millennium Development Goal has already been met. This has been very effective at preventing Malaria in a lot of areas. However, the fact remains that Malaria is still endemic in many African countries mainly because no drastic measures have been taken to combat it, such as intense pesticide control or a drug that cures Malaria instead of treating it.
Kay Monroe stressed on this fact:
You’re only in a net at night when you sleep and mosquitoes don’t only bite at night. This medication doesn’t eliminate reinfection so there are a lot of other things that needs to be done. We eliminated malaria in the US by drug treatment and by spraying a whole lot of DDT- we killed all the mosquitoes consistently. Governments, thus have to be involved, there has to be infrastructure and money. Poor countries are not going to spend money on this when they barely have enough for food or where there are governments being run by different radical groups every 6 months. As far as I’m concerned all mosquitoes carrying malaria need to die. They are the most adaptive species of insects I’ve seen. That’s my opinion and I’m an animal scientist. I don’t want to get rid of any animal species but mosquitoes, I mean what good are they doing? Oh yeah, fish eat them but so what? We only want to eliminate the ones with the malaria parasite.I’m fairly opinionated about this because at the end of the day Malaria doesn’t need to exist. When you see the kids suffering and dying of Malaria, you think ‘what is the point of this? It just needs to go.
Resistance to Artemisinin
Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin was first established on the Cambodia-Thailand border in 2008 and is now existent in five countries: Cambodia, Myanmar, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Thailand and Vietnam. Artemisinin resistance spreading to other countries could generate a major public health emergency. The WHO has recurrently advised countries to rid their pharmaceutical markets of artemisinin monotherapies, which could possibly encourage artemisinin resistance and thus, threaten the effectiveness of ACTs.

God knows I would willingly have adopted         their most approved method of a splendid residence, and silver-mounted         harnesses for my bays; but they were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams,         and my vicious little nag had nearly all this time to eat his oats and         nurse his bad temper in his comfortable stable.
""In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my         rose-bushes,--sometimes with tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and         occasionally listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel,         with her customary account of 'a pain in me side an' a flutterin' about me         heart.' At rare intervals I ministered to some of her countrywomen in         their fulfilment of the great command when placed in the Garden of Eden.         (What a dirty place it would have been if inhabited by Irish women!)
""And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of         character. I think I should have left in despair if it had not been for a         lovely creature up the street. She was the wife of a distinguished fish         merchant down town.

Accordingly, I soon found         myself in the presence of the accomplished lady, having--I confess         it--given my hair an extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.
""Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful         fool--nothing less, dear reader, or she would have never married old         Mackerel.

The Davidson / Missouri Western synthetic biology team
Team Description
Our team is composed of undergraduates and faculty from Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina and Missouri Western State University in Saint Joseph, Missouri as well as a student from Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia and a student from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. This is the third year of iGEM collaboration for Davidson and Missouri Western, but the first year of participation for each of the fifteen students. In past years, the team has worked collaboratively at a distance, meeting for the first time at the iGEM competition in Boston.  This year, the team worked collaboratively from the two campuses for most of the summer but spent one week visiting each other's campuses, working shoulder-to-shoulder. The above picture was taken July 3, 2008 on the steps of the Chambers Building on the Davidson College campus.
E. nigma Project Overview
A recent article about cryptographic hash functions challenged the world to create a better hash function, an algorithm that produces a digital fingerprint of a digitized message.  We decided to work toward the design and construction of a bacterial hash function.  To this end, we designed and constructed several novel dually-regulated hybrid promoters, crucial new elements in the genetic circuitry we designed to function as biological XOR gates.  These gates produce a positive result in the presence of exactly one input and a negative result otherwise and can be put in sequence to create a bacterial hash function.  The name of the project is a play on the name of the World War II coding machine used to encrypt military secrets.

The cells were cultured in broth LBAmp, harvested during exponential growth and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Left: Bright field (BF); Right: RFP; Abbreviations: P1 = [http:partsregistry/Part:BBa_J23117 BBa_J23117]; P2 = BBa_J23116 ; P3 = BBa_J23110 ; P4 = BBa_J23118 ; P8 = BBa_B0034 ; C2 = Clone 2.
For qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2), E. coli cells cultured in broth LBAmp medium were harvested at an OD600nm of ca. 0.6 (exponential growth phase) and when the OD600nm had reached approximately 2 (stationary phase). The cells were incubated over night and a third sample taken the next morning (OD600nm was ca. 2 – 3). The relative mRNA levels of rfp were normalized to the rpoA levels. Then, the fold change (∆∆CT) of the promoters compared to promoter 1 (the weakest) was calculated for each phase. The fold enrichment obtained for different growth phases could not be compared since the CT values determined for rpoA suggested a generally altered transcription during the different growth stages. For the exponential phase (Fig. 2 A), the fold changes indicate that Promoters 1 and 2 were weak. For Promoter 2, the rfp mRNA levels appeared to be slightly higher than for Promoter 1. Promoter 3 led to even higher rfp mRNA levels. For stationary phase (Fig. 2 B) and overnight incubation (Fig. 2 C), the same tendency was observed. Only for Promoter 4 during stationary phase, the fold changes for the replicates provided contradicting results: While replicate 1 suggested that this promoter was stronger during stationary phase than promoter 3, the second replicate indicated the opposite. In addition to this, Promoter 4 seemed not to differ significantly in activity compared to Promoter 1 when considering replicate 2.
Fig. 2. The RNA from two E. coli clones of cells transformed with an Anderson promoter plasmid was subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. The CT values of rfp determined by qRT-PCR were normalized to those of rpoA. The fold change of rfp transcript levels relative to the rfp transcript levels of promoter 1 were calculated. The bars indicate the fold changes. Two independent replicates are shown. Replica"

As the captain of the entire team, I oversee and participate in every aspects of the project including experiment design and execution, activity discussion, and wiki edition. I have a vision for this team that everyone involved will grow in both character and skill. As a Christian ""philosopher"", the theme of life intrigues me- this is why I love biology. I have lots of experience with biology: internships in hospital, summer sessions in University of Chicago, labs in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and AP Bio class at school. I wish to learn as much as possible during the iGEM preparation and lead my team to strive for excellence!
Andy Wang
Team Leader
I am Yicheng (Andy) Wang, a student dabbling in the field of synthetic Biology and employed iGEM as the first springboard from the elementary course material to practical lab works. I would admit participating iGEM to be a painstaking process as I paralleled the research with organization of the team. Neither multitudinous experience as a leader nor advanced academic skills were possessed of me, yet I do embrace the honor to perform as one of the leaders and stride with my teammates on the path of pursuing academic excellence as well as consummation of inner spirit. Extensive experiments were implemented and the team peeked into the hardship of scientific research, not only from the repetitive trials and failures, but also through the attempts to raise requisite funding. iGEM will unquestionably be placed as the first milestone of my career, and I believe, in God's testimony, hope will be fulfilled through diligence.

Introduction
One of the silver medal requirements is to include a team collaboration in an significantly way. This is because on iGEM, you have the unique opportunity to work with like-minded people all around the world on a project. You can influence the work of others in many ways, starting with meet ups to discuss problems and ideas and ending with helping them to complete an important task in their project. Over the year, we had different collaborations listed below.
Carroll iGEM
In July, the Carroll iGEM Team introduced us to an opportunity to collaborate with them on Instagram. We made a picture with Mike the Microbe who visited us in our Chemistry Lab. Mike is a cartoon friendly bacteria and iGEM teams all over the world hosted him in their labs. We were very happy to had him in our lab.

Meet-Up
German Meet Up During the German Meet Up in Marburg we talked with many German iGEM teams about their projects, comparing different approaches and meeting nice people from all around Germany.
European Meet Up The European Meet Up in Munich helped us to improve our presentation skills, exchanging experiences associated with the progress of our work and listening to intriguing talks.
Oslo In May, we had the opportunity to visit iGEM Oslo, since one of their members is an exchange student from Tübingen. We had very nice talks and an excellent workshop with the communications which lead to the development of plenty of good ideas, like the Ract! Festival or our public debate.
Bielefeld We visited iGEM Bielefeld during our attendance of the Hanovermesse, enjoying a tour of their laboratory and exchanging ideas.
HyperpodX The HyperpodX Team Oldenburg gave us insight in a very different approach of a big project.

Herein, the latter are based on azo dyes capable of having    their entire network contracted by light irradiation. The biopolymer matrix is fabricated by    Escherichia coli and consists of catcher-tag systems modified with a biotin-accepting anchor.    The molecular machines attach to the biopolymer tissue via biotin and biotin acceptor    interactions. Due to the crosslinking of the single protein strains the stiffness of the resulting    tissue can be adjusted accurately.
In both cases, the achieved tissues are cell-free and can immediately be adapted to the system.    Within the scope of the project, the construction of a DEA-prototype is planned, since the    realization of electrical stimuli is more feasible than through photo-induced signals.

ZJU-China,2010,Team:ZJU-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," and purpose analogous to that found in human actions are also inherent in the rest of nature. To the eye of an untrained observer, the evolutionary history does provide an image that living organisms follow apparent teleology. However, as Hans Reichenbach once put it, it was the greatest discovery of Charles Darwin that the apparent teleology of living organisms can be explained in a similar way by a combination of chance and selection...Darwin saw that the progress of evolution can be explained in terms of causality alone and does not require any teleological conceptions. Yes, the long, beautiful Darwinian process of creeping depends on the universal cause and effect relationship and a little bit chance. Hence, it doesn't speak for any moral significance in the remote past or in the might future.
    For the second question, we still need to focus on the core principles of Darwinian evolution. The fact that biotic artifacts created by the synthetic biology have no causal connection to historical evolutionary process is no doubt. By building a synthetic organism made solely from chemicals and blueprints of DNA, synthetic biology will be able to create biotic artifacts entirely different from the any living organism existed in the natural history. No descent relationship or even no relative relationship. So the synthetic organisms will not be the products of natural selection. However, these biotic artifacts don't against the core principle of Darwinian evolution-chance and selection. They will also undergo survival struggling, evolution and elimination, maybe in lab, in the factory or even in the natural environment. Thus, the definition of the selection needs to expand from mere natural selection to a more specific artificial selection. This scenario recalls me the study of Non-Euclidean geometry. The essential difference between Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry is the fifth postulate-the nature of parallel lines. According to our empirical intuition, we comfortably believe that within a two-dimensional plane, for any given line l and a point A, there is exactly one line through A that does not intersect l. And that is also what Euclidean geometry states. However, as for the Non-Euclidean geometry, there are at least two lines through A that does not intersect l. Likewise, the natural selection is the fifth postulate, it is about to be endowed a broader idea because of the application of synthetic biology. Moreover, it brings us new perspectives about Darwinian evolution, the potential relationship between natural and artificial biosphere, whether they are safely isolated, orderly competitive or inherent hated. To sum up, synthetic biology won't overturn the Darwinian evolution, in the contrary, synthetic biology will apply the core spirit of Darwinian evolution to a"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Reengineering the mechanisms of chemotaxis is the first step in the assembly of such a bacterial communication system. With “Biotweet”, we have attempted to construct such a network within a microbiological setting: a challenging task, considering that bacterial cells cannot be linked by wires.
Riboswitches are ligand-inducible RNA protein expression regulators that are comprised of an aptamer domain and an expression platform (Gallivan, 2007). The aptamer is a sequence of nucleotides that is designed to specifically bind to ligands, while the expression platform consists of a ribosome binding site (RBS) and a downstream coding region (CDS). When the specific ligand or analyte binds to the aptamer domain, the riboswitch undergoes a structural change. This results in the exposure of the RBS and the expression of the downstream CDS (Figure 2, top left panel).
By linking CheZ expression to post-transcriptional activation by a unique analyte (using an analyte-specific riboswitch), bacterial motility can be guided towards a specific stimulus. We chose to use artificial riboswitches to control the expression of the flagella rotation regulator protein CheZ. Using this approach, the expression of CheZ can be regulated in a ligand concentration-dependent manner, outside the control of the natural chemotaxis pathway (Figure 2, right panel).
We have decided to include two fluorescent reporters as fusion proteins (both N- and C-terminal CheZ fusions are well-tolerated, according to Gallivan, 2007). This allowed us to observe activation of the riboswitches in the context of our experiments.
We borrowed heavily from studies which have described riboswitch-controlled bacterial chemotaxis (Topps and Gallivan. 2007). Topps and Gallivan (2007) demonstrated that these riboswitches can be used to reprogram the chemotactic response, allowing bacteria to move up a concentration gradient of the analyte that activates the riboswitch (a process known as pseudotaxis). Bacteria can theoretically be reprogrammed to respond to any stimulus, if the appropriate riboswitch is made. This provides the versatility needed for biological network connections to be established in any application. Furthermore, this eliminates the need to engineer novel chemoreceptors.

Although very relevant, these issues cannot be answered easily. The definition of life will be discussed later. What is more important is what this controversial research and what is written about it in the media does with the perception of the iGEM community. In regard to the last question it is remarkable that far less people are limited by their unfamiliarity of the actual research.
One small group is trying to find a way in between the given answers and explains that Venter, although not ""playing God"", is creating (artificial) life.
The plurality of the open answers indicates that his research is overstated by media, Venter is not creating life nor will he ever be able to. Some arguments that fund this statement: using existing materials without understanding its origin is hardly creating life and he would only create life artificially if he started out with man-made components only.
Although Venter is pushing the technology as far as it goes, over 80% (including the other-answers) does not believe that Venter is playing God by creating life artificially. Although depicted as controversial in media, the scientific community believes Venter is not creating life (let alone play God), but rather uses smart engineering principles to succeed in his goals.
Graph 6.
6. (See previous question) What do you think the perception of the public would be?
Venter operates controversially by trying to create a new life form artificially
It is just research, he is not able to really create life. He is only able to put biological components together
Other:
This question should indicate how the synthetic biology community thinks that the public perceives Venter's research. Although researchers themselves believe that Venter is only using engineering principles, a majority of 51% assume that the public will think the research is controversial and that Venter is trying to create life artificially. Nevertheless, a group of 35% thinks that the publics opinion will be rather the same as theirs.
The other-answers:
A large group of the other-voters believes that communication is crucial, the public's perception on synthetic biology and specifically on Venter's research depends on how it is communicated to them. The media has great influence on the publics opinion through giving a new technology a certain positive or negative swing (more on this topic can be found in the Communication section).
There are also people who think that the public does not have enough specific knowledge to understand the complex principles of synthetic biology and the research that is going on to understand it.

UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," electronic design, the EDA community is facing a crisis. In order to deal with this crisis, a variety of Electronic System Level (ESL) methodologies are emerging. One popular approach is Platform-Based Design (PBD).
PBD is concerned with what is termed the orthogonalization of concerns [1]. These concerns are:
Functionality (what something does) and Architecture (how it does it). For example, multiplication functionally is the same whether implemented as a series of adders or a dedicated multiplier. This separation goal should be of use as well to synthetic biologists.
Behavior (Semantics) and Performance Indices (Latency, Throughput, etc). Behavior defines how a device operates (bus protocol for example). Performance is a cost of that behavior (bus transaction latency). Again, this may be of use in describing biological systems.
Computation, Communication, Coordination. How things compute should be separate from how they interact (communicate) with other aspects of the system, and both computation and communication should be separate from the scheduling mechanisms.
By keeping these issues separate, the now modular design allows for a smoother verification process, reuse, and abstraction. These goals are also of use to the synthetic biological community if predictive, large scale synthetic designs are desired.
In order to achieve these goals, PBD is a three stage process: top down application development, bottom up performance exposure, and defining a common semantic meeting point to explore functionality and architecture mappings. Figure 1 illustrates this methodology and provides the needed description. [2], [3], and [4] are all successful applications of PBD in embedded electronics.
What follows is a breakdown of the three major aspects of PBD along with how these can be used in the design of synthetic biological systems. For the purposes of the Clotho project, PBD primarily manifests itself in how the software architecture is developed and the role individual pieces play in the overall design.
Functionality
Functional Space for Biological System : Figure 2
Functionality in PBD purely describes the behavior the desired design should exhibit. It makes no association with the underlying mechanisms that will be used to physically implement the functionality. For embedded electronic systems, models of computation (MoCs) such as Kahn Process Networks, Finite State Machines, Dataflow Networks, Petri Nets, etc are typically used to this end. These are mathematical descriptions which can be analyzed for various properties such as liveness, state reachability, and schedulabilty.
For synthetic biological systems, the ways to describe desired functionality are still in their infancy. For example, while NOR functionality is well understood in a digital logic context, a"
Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Our solution_-_-_TEXT.html," system
In our circuit, IL-10 is secreted in the presence of NO and absence of elevated extracellular adenosine. We decided to use NO partly due to the work of the Stanford 2009 iGEM team, who used NO detection to activate the synthesis of retinoic acid. We used the same SoxR/SoxS promoter system to detect NO but instead, are using it to stimulate IL-10 production.
The SoxS promoter (pSoxS) is an oxidative stress-responsive element, activated by the dimeric transcription factor, SoxR. Oxidation of the iron-sulphur cluster by NO leads to a shift into the active state.
IL-10 is targeted for secretion by fusion with a C-terminal HlyA tag. This is recognised by the HlyD/HlyB/TolC complex which constitutes the type I secretory apparatus. By combining the four genes into a single operon under control of the SoxS promoter, both IL-10 production and its export can be upregulated in response to an elevated NO concentration. Therefore, transcription of new mRNA and export of previously synthesised proteins are inhibited in the absence of an inducer.
Membrane-anchored nucleoside hydrolase
We implemented a membrane-anchored adenosine hydrolase to catalyse the breakdown of extracellular adenosine into adenine. This would then diffuse into the cytoplasm and control the negative feedback loop
The hydrolase was designed to be excluded from the cytoplasm in order to maximise the signal to noise ratio. This is particularly necessary due to the action of periplasmic deaminase in converting adenosine to inosine, which cannot be detected using a riboswitch. Cytoplasmic adenosine, if hydrolysed, would lead to alteration of metabolic function, resulting in a high intracellular adenine level independent of extracellular adenosine. Secretion across the inner membrane thus increases the sensitivity of the response whilst minimising the impact of our device on the growth of the chassis.
Two independent parts were designed to fulfil this role:
Periplasmic Hydrolase
The type II system, TAT, is well characterised, allowing the secretion of protein complexes into the periplasm. By attaching a C-terminal secretion tag, the hydrolase dimer can be secreted in a folded state.

REGULATORY SYSTEM MAPPING
The system map was created to help the team to select genes relevant to biofilm response regulation as targets for characterizing overexpression strains and  deletion strains.
Species such as proteins, mRNAs, csRNAs, genes, metabolites, etc. are nodes in the map; interactions between the species are represented by lines between them. Arrows indicate positive influence (the product of an enzyme, a ligand binding to a DNA-bound transcriptional repressor, etc.), while lines ending in a single bar indicates negative influence (an enzyme breaking down a signal molecule, a csRNA interfering with transcription, etc.).
Environmental stimuli that perturb the represented system cause a large sequential chain of interactions, some signal-amplifying, some signal-repressing; hence the map can be used to track down the resulting phenotype. Used in another manner, this map can also suggest the effects of a gene deletion on signal transmission pathways for any given environmental stimulus.
The current version of the system map was made by referring to ECOCYC entries, extracting the regulatory influence data from the entries for each node, and connecting the influences.
NOTE: This map was created solely for picking interesting genes, no annotations to ECOCYC were tracked.
The CellDesigner model can be found here.

Cloning - Challenge Accepted!
Molecular cloning of the gblock fragments in pSB1C3 backbone (digestion, ligation, transformation) and their confirmation by diagnostic digest agarose gel run.

As all cloning strategies, there were few trial and error scenarios wrt to the ratios of fragments to be used for a perfectly assembled DNA.
Ligation math for all the fragments were done and the process of digestion, ligation and transformation was carried out successfully to yield 2 well assembled constructs. The plasmid was again extracted from the selected clones on the plates and run an agarose gel electrophoresis after a single and dual cut diagnostic digest with EcoR1 and Pst1.
In the above Gel-Red stained Agarose gel, in which construct (pBAD_ompT_xylE) and construct (pBAD_xylE) are the cloned modules which have the bands at the expected size of 3278 bp or 3.3 kb and 3218 bp or 3.2 kb respectively after single EcoR1 digest.
Also faint bands of the backbone at 2 kb were obtained but the fragment DNA wasn’t well stained (maybe due to low amounts) and very faint bands of fragments of size 1.2 kb for (pBAD_ompT_xylE) as expected of 1208 bp/1.2 kb and ~1.2 kb for (pBAD_xylE) as expected 1148 bp/1.15 kb were observed.
This diagnostic digest confirms that the cloned fragments are of the desired assembly and the clones of these DNA constructs are used for further analysis by protein characterisation.

-Modeling collaboration-
Our team collaborated with iGEM 2016 team Tokyo_Tech(Tokyo Institute of Technology).
We requested help from them to create a mathematical model for our project. We felt so thankful to our collaborator for bring such strong contribution to our project.
In our project, we planned on increasing the production of Bacterial Cellulose (BC) produced by the bacteria A. xylinum. To increase the production of Bacteria Cellulose, we take the cellulose synthesis pathway into account.
Fig 1. Cellulose synthesis pathway of Acetobacter  Based on the mechanisms of this pathway,
We planned to increase the amount of the production of cellulose by decreasing the amount of G6PDH and PGI enzymes by using the antisense method.  In order to create a mathematical model for our project, team Tokyo_Tech took the principal reactions taking place in this production into account.
When antisense genes are expressed, an mRNA molecule is produced that is a mirror image of the targeted gene. The two, opposite mRNAs bind to one another, disrupting their function and making protein synthesis impossible. In effect, the targeted gene is blocked and transcription is prevented.
Therefore, we are using the antisense method to prevent the production of the enzymes G6PD and PGI. So, by representing the binding of the antisense mRNA to the nucleotide sequence with a Hill equation, they got the equation below.
Where αn,Kn and nn are constants from the Hill equation, And the concentration of the mRNA depends on the conditions of the experiment.
After applying the mathematical model above, they got the following graphs.
(a) Concentrations without applying the antisense method
(b) Concentration while inhibiting G6PD enzyme
(c) Concentrations inhibiting PGI enzyme
(d) Concentrations inhibiting both G6PD and PGI enzymes
(e) Concentrations strongly inhibiting both enzymes
The graph above shows that the more we inhibit the enzymes G6PD and PGI, the more the production of BC increases. Therefore, we can assume this model is correct. However, we cannot assume that this is the most appropriate result since it has not been corroborated with the experiments.
At last, we would like to thank our collaborator (Tokyo_Tech) once again for"

Module III - Isobutanol production
Overview

Isobutanol pathway
Outlook
Isobutanol pathway
Building on the results shown in the section Isobutanol pathway further analysis could follow. We could show via SDS Page that potentially all proteins are expressed. Furthermore we could demonstrate that bacteria carrying our constructs produce isobutanol.
Intermediates
It turns out the the cultures carrying the construct BBa_K1465307 (adhA containing) produced less isobutanol than cultures carrying the construct BBa_K1465306 . Regarding this we conclude that the used AdhA did not improve isobutanol production contrary to the literature. To detect possible causes for this phenomena, it would be helpful to analyze the intermediates of the used pathway. ( Atsumi et al., 2008 ) There might be a difference between the amounts of the particular intermediates which could explain the different production rates as well as help detecting metabolic bottlenecks.
Conditions
Furthermore an increase of the production rate would be an aim of further experiments. Therefore optimized conditions have to be identified. Maybe a temperature between 30°C and 37°C could be tryed out.
Pathway
A further approach could be the implementation of other genes for the 2-keto-acid pathway, such as the kivD from Lactococcus lactis in our isobutanol production pathway.

But, what did our colleagues learnt about the most intimate fears, expectations and opinions held by those people who will ultimately share the benefits or bear the burdens of our work?
We believe these approaches are incomplete. It doesn't matter how many schools you visit, or how many interactive expositions you put up, or how many times you appear on the news… Regardless the amount of people you reach, when science communication is unilateral and not a correspondence, the project is at risk of falling into the 'deficit model' of science and science communication, which is not a ""correspondence between peers"", but a unilateral transmission of ideas and knowledge. It is indeed important that the information is passed through, as a way to level up the scientific literacy of the general population. But there are things that us, as scientist, can also learn from them.
The strategy we implemented in this Human Practices project has been allowing us to identify the expectations, fears and hopes of our Mexican fellow citizens about the issues raised by Synthetic Biology in particular and Science in general. To achieve this, we developed two lines of action:
1. Create a preliminary diagnosis about the concerns, hopes, hypes and fears that are actually present in our community.
2. Establish through on-site and off-site science communication a dialogue with members of society, with the goal of creating a mutual understanding and correspondence, acknowledging that as future scientist, we do form part of society as well as others.
And this is the reason why most of the work presented in this Human Practices page is in Spanish. We are not doing this for anyone else but our people. Therefore, creating material or collaborations in other language than the one spoken in Mexico would fall away from the goal we have set up for ourselves.
The activities implemented to achieve these objectives include the following activities:
1. Who is Mrs. Lupita Cohnnie, PhD?
2. Bio-SintetizARTE (in Spanish and in English )
3. Outreach videos
4. Talk and surveys
5. Symposium on Science Communication
6. Future Work
7. Our Partners, Sponsors and Collaborations .
Welcome to the Human Practices approach of the Genomics Mexico iGEM team of 2012. We hope you like this new approach and that you decide to join us in this new paradigm.

The blue lines show systems using the normal CFPS supplement premix, and the purple lines show the systems with supplement premix with ‘optimised’ magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate as identified above. The system utilising extract from the same batch used in the SRD testing had a higher CFPS activity with the ‘optimised’ premix (purple) than with the original premix (blue), whereas the system utilising extract from a separate batch had higher activity with the original premix.
Screening Design for CFPS Supplements
Following the success of using a DoE approach to optimise CFPS systems focusing only on salt supplements, the JMP software was used to create a screening design for all 15 components of the CFPS supplement solution. The 15 components were made into 13 factors for the design, with UTP, CTP, and GTP being combined. The experiments determined by the design are shown in Table 3 The experimental design was performed on two different extracts; one with a moderate CFPS activity (D2), and one with a low CFPS activity (B2). For this set of reactions, cell extract was added such that 1.5 mg (30 mg/mL) of total cell extract protein was present in each CFPS reaction. This was done so that the factors predicted as being important could be compared between cell batches, without any small differences in total protein concentration potentially affecting the results. Figure 8 shows the contrast values (used here as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response) for each supplement in CFPS systems using the moderately active cell free extract (D2), and Figure 9 shows the contrast values for each supplement in CFPS systems using the low active cell free extract (B2).
While some conclusions can be drawn from this data, care should be taken as the inherently low activity of systems using this data resulted in a high noise-to-signal ratio. Nonetheless, the DoE screening design identified 7 out of 13 factors which may have a negative effect on CFPS activity. This might have been expected because the CFPS system had a very low activity, which suggested that the supplement solution was far from optimised for that extract. Three of the factors with an inhibitory affect were potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate, which, as has already been explained earlier, is not unusual as cell extract require specific amounts of these salts for high activity"

Building the sensor
So we built our own light sensing system using Arduino microcontroller. We got the idea from iGEM 2010 Cambridge team. The sensor used was model TSL238T. Product developed by Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions.
So.... what do you need?? Basically the following
- Arduino Uno USD$25.95- TSL238T High-sensitivity light-to-frequency converter. USD$5.80
- 0.1 uF capacitor USD$9.70 (cost of a pack containing many capacitors)- USB Cable USD$4.37
- Breadboard USD$14.80- Lots of wires USD$2.95
Total cost: USD$63.70 not so bad, right?
Now that you built your sensor according to instructions provided in code below, it should look something like this:
Running the program
Here is the sensor datasheet containing all technical specifications.
Our code. Written by Juano Venegas.
//Analog reading test. Data send to serial port.  //Sensor connections // According to pin numbers given in TSL238T datasheet. // Pin 1 -> Ground // Pin 2 -> Ground // Pin 3 -> 5 Volts.  // Pin 4 -> Pin n° 2 Arduino. //Also, a 0.1 uF capacitor would be suitable to wire between ground and 5V. The closest possible to the sensor //(it reduces noise). // Instructions down below  // Pin definition const int lightsensor = 2;   // Light sensor port  // Variables unsigned long pulseCount ;  // Counts pulses given by sensor  void setup() {   Serial.begin(9600);      pinMode(lightsensor, INPUT);     attachInterrupt(0, add_pulse"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html,"ic operator was too large. The distance was a result of our cloning strategy and would likely be suitable for E. coli promoters. However, the T7 promoter requires the operator to be very close for an efficient repression ( Karig et al. 2012 ).
In addition, we performed an experiment in which the arsenic repressor was not present in the reaction from the beginning, but was encoded on a second plasmid. The plasmid concentrations we used had been predicted by our model. In accordance with the aforementioned results, we observed no clear repression and addition of arsenic showed no effect. This experiment is discussed on the Modeling pages .
To summarize
The arsenic sensor is the most prominent example of heavy metal biosensors. Our results confirm that it is possible to detect the safety limit of 10 µg/L arsenic with a cell-based arsenic senosor. The results of the tests in our CFPS indicate that this approach is suitable for the detection of arsenic as well. However, we believe that the genetic construct requires further optimization.

Accordingly, initial \(T_2\) is related to the initial GTP-dimer quantity. All these promoters are initial conditions in the experiment.
We consider a kind of initial conditions of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\). Actually, any initial \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the experiment can be modeled and we can predict the numerical trends. The solutions of one of our example are given in the following charts.  (initial \(T_1\)=50000, initial \(T_2\)=3000, initial \(G_{11}\)=3000, Initial \(G_{21}\)=1000)
Fig.6 ODE numerical solutions results
What we can get from our ODE model is \(G_1\) and \(G_2\), which indicate the quantity of filaments with GTP-cap and Taxol-cap, which is equal to the number of GTP-dimers at endpoint and the number of Taxol-dimers at endpoint. Sum of them is equal to the whole filaments units number in this dilution system. Since it should be proportionate to quantities of microtubules only by a coefficient"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Functionalisation_-_-_TEXT.html," , please see their part pages ( BBa_K863111 a and BBa_K863101 ) for detailed information. CBDclos is from the cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium cellulovorans and CBDcex originates from the cellulolytic bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. This is the same organism as for CBDcenA; cex is from the exoglucanase gene and cen is from the endoglucanase gene.
Double CBD (dCBD) with N-terminal linker
This part, BBa_K1321340 is based on the double cellulose-binding domain construct synthesised and characterised by Linder et al1996, who found that this double CBD had higher affinity for cellulose than either of the two CBDs on their own. The main difference is that our part contains an additional linker sequence on the N-terminus of the protein.
The two CBDs are from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) Exocellobiohydrolase (Exoglucanase) I (cbh1), uniprot ID P62694; and Exocellobiohydrolase (Exoglucanase) II, uniprot ID P07987 (cbh2); with a linker peptide between the two CBDs and at the N-terminus of the protein. Both linkers are the same amino acid sequence and are based on the endogenous linker sequences that exists in cbh1 and cbh2 genes. The linker sequence is PGANPPGTTTTSRPATTTGSSPGP which is the same as used by Linder et al 1996. The first three amino acids are from the cbh2 endogenous linker, and the rest is from the cbh1 endogenous linker. CBDcbh1 is placed C-terminal to CBDcbh2 because naturally CBDcbh1 is a C-terminal domain and CBDcbh2 is an N-terminal domain. Both CBDs are from the CBM family 1 . The precise location of the CBD within the cbh genes was slightly different according to the uniprot annotations and the sequence used by Linder et al 1996; we chose to use the sequence from the paper since the protein was expressed and characterised successfully.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Issues in cooperation
“It is sometimes difficult to communicate, however, more often than not I think collaboration between fields is just an advantage.”
- A 1st year Biomedicine student
Cooperation between modelers and people doing the experiments is a major challenge in applying modeling to synthetic biology. Very many respondents considered communication between these groups difficult. Three reasons to communication problems were mentioned multiple times.
Firstly, as modelers often have a mathematical background and experimentalists a background in life sciences, the  knowledge gap makes cooperation difficult. Biologists have a better understanding of how life works, but on the other hand they have a hard time understanding modeling, whereas modelers are in the opposite situation. Especially respondents doing mostly modeling stated that understanding other fields sufficiently takes a lot of time.
Second difficulty mentioned was the different vocabulary used by modelers and experimentalists. For instance, two people may refer to the same experiment or concept with different names, creating confusion and making cooperation more difficult.
A third and according to some respondents the hardest barrier was that modelers and experimentalists have a different way of thinking, a different perspective.
Solutions to cooperation issues
“We have been dealing with this by talking with no hesitation, exchanging ideas and experiences and accepting that our knowledge completes each others'.”
- A physics student working mainly on modeling
General meetings
To resolve the challenges in cooperation between modelers and experimentalists and enhance communication, teams had different methods. In some teams questions and problems of all fields were discussed as a team, which was also seen as a good way of getting all team members to better understand different fields. Some teams have weekly meetings where issues are presented and discussed, other teams have meetings each day. Thoroughly explaining models or the biological systems to people not very familiar with the question at hand was considered time-consuming, though.
Modeling meetings
Some teams have separate meetings for modeling. In these cases, having experimentalists take part in the modeling meetings and vice versa was seen as a good way to enhance communication. Sometimes instructors also take part in the meetings.
Working together
In quite many teams, the cooperation was enhanced and the knowledge gap narrowed by taking the modelers to perform the experiments in the lab together with the biologists, in some cases only for a short time in the beginning of the project. Some teams have people who work both in the laboratory and in the modeling team with full-time modelers to answer their biology-related questions. This was also seen as a way to avoid communication problems between the modelers and the rest of the team. In some teams, the modelers and experimentalists work tightly together"

Starting the     afternoon Alena told the pupils about iGEM, synthetic biology, our own project and why     we do the workshop. Then Ariane took over to give them the theory behind the soon-to-     be done experiments, covering what a gel electrophoresis is, how it works, why biologists     use it that often, what one has to do to extract DNA and where the difficulties lay.

After these theoretical 20 minutes, we started the practical work, supervised by Hannah,      Bastian, Leonard and Ariane from our team, with preparing the gel run. We poured the      gels before the workshop started, as this would have taken too long to have it done by      the pupils. First the pupils had to be introduced to the microliter pipettes and train their      pipetting skills. Therefore, we gave every student a stripe of parafilm with three drops of      water on it, which they had to pipette up and down until they felt secure enough to take      on the task of loading the gel with our DNA sample. After adding the loading dye to every      sample, each pupil had to fill two gel pockets and the last to do so also had to start the      gel run. While the gel ran, the DNA extraction was to be done. To get good results and as      much visual DNA as possible, we decided to use strawberries, an octoploid organism. The      protocol we used, was given to us by Dr. Hanh Nguyen, an employee at our university,      who has already done this experiments at a school and could share her experiences with      us. For this we want to thank her. In contrary to the gel electrophoresis, which had been      done in groups of three to four, did their own DNA extraction. We proceeded step-by-      step, every step followed by an explanation and depiction of what has been done and      what it has been done for. Right in time to stop the gel run, we finished the DNA      extraction, luckily, or probably more because of great work by the pupils, with good      results, seeing strawberry DNA in almost every experiment. To visualize the results of      the gel electrophoresis, we used an UV-transilluminator. Ending this afternoon of      practical biological work, the pupils analyzed the DNA samples and determined the length      of the plasmid used. After tidying up and"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html," cell-free expression system based on crude cell extract works very well on paper. Furthermore, it is very amenable to these conditions as well as to other environments (see robustness section ).
We demonstrated that conduction of a CFPS on paper is still possible after 6 days of storage at 8 °C, a fact that is of outstanding interst for our final application. The fluorescence signal was lowered by about 50% compared to the directly started reaction, however, storage conditions can easily be adapted to maintain activity, as has been proposed for example by Pardee et al. 2014 .
With a smartphone and our measurement device , we took pictures of the fluorescent paper discs and evaluated the results with our app . Click on the nearby picture to take a look on these pages for more images, details and lots of interesting stuff!
No colonies grew after streaking our lyophilised paper discs (round dots) onto LB plates, even after two days at 37 °C. Little stains resulted from paper disc streaking.
Biosafety issues
For our final application, we applied cell extract and all compounds needed for protein synthesis on paper and lyophilized it. We were able to prove that absolutely no E. coli culture survives this process by placing the paper onto an LB plate and putting it into a 37 °C incubator for 2 days. We could not observe any colony forming units, not after any approach of extract lyophilization. This is consistent with recent findings from Smith et al. 2015 who showed that sterile filtration and lyophilization are methods to free cell extracts from any cells. Lyophilisation was preferred due to stable expression thereafter, which fit to our results.
Robustness
Our CFPS system occured to be very robust towards different substances. In particular, 5% of EtOH and 9% lake water instead of RNase free water had little and no effect, respectively, on final fluorescence signal, as was the case for tap water when rehydrating lyophilized extracts (see section CFPS on Paper ).
CFPS sufficiently resists to 5% (v/v) Ethanol. At 15% (v/v) Ethanol nearly no fluorescence signal arises.
CFPS sufficiently resists to 9% (v/v) lake water.
As our cell-free system is designed to work outside the lab, we dealt with the question if it is possible to conduct sfGFP synthesis at temperatures other than 37°C. The optimal temperature for cell-free protein synthesis depends on the protein and the system itself ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ).

Say Yes to Stress
Bacteria that make us ill are very clever. Through natural evolution, they constantly develop new strategies to arm themselves against our antibiotics. These resistant bacteria put all of                                                     mankind at risk. In order to ensure humanity’s future                                                     health, we must develop new strategies to deal with bacterial infections.
To combat these resistant bacteria we need new antibiotics, but scientists have been unable to discover new marketable ones. To tackle this problem, we came up with an innovative                                                     approach:                                                     bacteria that can show us what kind of stress they are experiencing by changing colour. Stressful substances are not deadly to bacteria by themselves, however, the right combination                                                     can"

Student Fair
Our first exposure to the public was at the 26th International Fair for books and press of Geneva , 25-29 April 2012, in which there was a part dedicated to student formation. Various Swiss universities held a stand at the fair including Geneva, Fribourg, EFPL and Swiss Italian universities.
We made a presentation about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project at the EPFL stand which was visited by prospective students of all ages as well as curious parents. We stood by the poster in order to answer questions and hand out surveys on synthetic biology to evaluate the awareness of people.
People appreciated the concept despite not being too fond of GMOs, mostly because some imprecise knowledge on the subject and publicity. A lot of people linked synthetic biology to textiles.
Burier high school talk
We then held a presentation introducing synthetic biology at the Burier high school in Montreux, Switzerland. We gave a lecture for 2nd year students in an artistic track. They had little to none background in biology. The lecture went well overall. We asked them to imagine a few ideas that might be realizable with synthetic biology after the presentation. The answers that came out were creative and showed they had understood the main points. The involvement of designers and other visually oriented fields in our projects might give an overall aesthetic sense that might otherwise be absent.
Beaulieu high school talk
We gave a presentation on synthetic biology at the Beaulieu high school in Lausanne for two classes of 2nd year students, this time with a scientific orientation (extra classes in biology and chemistry). The response was also very enthusiastic. Students were curious about the engineering approach to biological systems and the question and answer session lasted for a while. It was interesting to notice that these students with a biological background were actually more cautious towards genetic engineering and current pharmaceutical and therapeutical approaches than the art students.
After these three talks, the paper surveys were analyzed.
Online survey at EPFL
We sent our survey about synthetic biology to the whole EPFL student community. We got a very positive response."

Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.

Blog #12 - Glowing Vanilla pudding
By NBailly 16:16, June 02 2014 (CDT)
The topics of today's double lesson was quorum sensing as well as measurement of fluorescence. At the beginning of class, the students form 6 groups and start an experiment dealing with fluorescence: Each group weighs and dissolves 4g of vanilla pudding powder in 50mL of water. While conducting the experiment, each group is supervised by a member of our iGEM team.
While we give the powder some time to dissolve, René discusses the worksheet about quorum sensing that we gave out to the students last week. In doing so, the students learn what quorum sensing actually is, how it is used in different ways by a variety of bacteria, and how we want to use this function for our project.
Meanwhile the powder had dissolved in the water. Excess powder accumulated at the bottom of the beaker. Using a syringe, the students suck 2mL of supernatant out of the beaker, and press it through a filter into a cuvette. A part of our project involves the development of a fluorescence measurement device named ""Cellock Holmes"". Each group of students at a time places its cuvette in the ""Cellock Holmes"" prototype, and notes down the values displayed on the cellphone display. Of course, each group also measures the fluorescence of a positive (pure riboflavin in water) and a negative (chalk dust in water) control.
While the other groups wait for their turn, their supervisors explain the background of this experiment: The electrons in some molecules change into energy states when irradiated with electromagnetic waves. When returning to the normal state, the electrons"
