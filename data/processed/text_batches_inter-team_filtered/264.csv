This should give them enough information to calculate the enzyme activity. We didn't want to wait, so we started immediately with our standard activity test. Our tested ABTS concentrations were: 0.5µl, 1µl, 2µl, 4µl and 8µl. We got nice activity curves but also noticed, that the activity saturated quickly and therefore the initial activity of our laccase can not be measured accurately. Of course Team Modeling got our data just in time, but we also want to start new activity tests with half of the amount of laccase. So we are still trying to keep our lovely Team Modeling satisfied.

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
We sent different plasmids for sequencing.
We got another E.coli strain (Rosetta-gami 2) from our supervisor Dr. Christian Rückert. The cells carry a chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid, pRARE2, which supplies tRNAs for seven rare codons, AUA, AGG, AGA, CUA, CCC, GGA and CGG under the control of their native promoter. We want to use this strain for the expression of TTHL and BHAL hopeful that some rare codons are the reason that the laccases can’t be expressed by now. So we need the genes under control of a constitutive promoter because this strain has no T7 polymerase and we can’t use our inducible constructs. Further the plasmids need to have AMP resistance, because otherwise we can't select on"

The filter could be used in conjunction with the colour sensor, or with a basic light sensor and LED’s.  It is going to take various tests and trials to determine which option is the most logical and successful and will provide accurate results for this important test. In order to construct our circuits, we purchased a soldering station which will potentially be useful for teams that come after us.
In regards to the beginning of quantitative modelling we are breaking the system into smaller parts and starting to model each small part with the potential of combining all of these parts to model the entire system and the parameters. We are going to being with the reporter RFP which has already been plated and is ready to undergo testing, we are currently waiting on our purchase orders with our materials to see if the colour sensor is able to accurately detect this colour, as well as determine the true sensitivity of the device so that this is not a limiting factor.  Additionally we are going to look at every reaction and process taking place biologically in the system and start dissecting the system and working backwards from the reporter.  After this has been completed we are planning on finding the most sensitive components that will have a positive impact on time and are the “bottleneck” of the device.  Using these discovered factors we are going to apply them to the system and measure to see if any change has taken place and if our model is an accurate representation of the mathematical processes occurring.  Additionally we are are planning on looking more literature of modelling biological systems and into some of the build in features of the Simbiology toolbox.
Our plans from next week consist of contacting another lab that has a plate reader that will be able to automatically measure absorbance and RFP cell count in the bacteria culture transformed with RFP.  This will give us initial data from the reporter to begin working with.
Week 9: June 30th - July 4th
We started this week by exploring how our colour sensor operates, so when we receive this component, we can begin testing immediately. Additionally, we discovered a tutorial using the ColorPal sensor with Arduino Uno which included the sample code. (http://learn.parallax.com/colorpal-arduino-demo).  In order to easily convert the output of the sensor to colours, we downloaded the ColorPal Color Matching Program. The program has the capability to assist with calibration of the sensor when detecting black and white surfaces. The sensor has its own LED light and it shines red, blue, and green light onto to the surface."

We tried out SegmMan module to automatically split designed yeast_chr07_4_51 into 2k minichunks in command line.
After run the flow shell, SegmMan analyze the exited enzyme site along the sequence of yeast_chr07_4_51, and finally splited it into about 2k minichunks, so that we can synthesize these fragments and assemble them into whole.
The following is the final result of segmentations. yeast_chr07_4_51 is split into many 2k minichunks. After these fragments are synthesized, they can be assembled into whole step by step, from 2k to 10k to 30k to whole, according Gibson, Goldengate, Telomere Assembly.
On 2k and 10k level, they also have vectors homologous region and designed enzyme site, so that they can be preserved and cut out to use quickly.

So we had 4 different fungi, 6 of our fungi were A.fumigatus, it is to be noted that these 6 fungi all come from the same soil sample.
Quercetin degradation assey
As the standard error bars in the first quercetin degradation assey were really bad we decided to test another time the quercetin degradation after 4 days.
We did a first measure after 2 days  :
We noted that A.niger was able to degrade quercetin very fast.
We were able to see a difference in quercetin degradation by the different fungi. We were also able to see a difference between the fungi and P.putida.
We wanted to have a picture of each of the fungi in plates so a little ball of mycelium was inoculated on quercetin plates for 3 days
We can see the plate becoming transparent where the mycelium have grown.
Week 17th-19th October
We made some kinetic of the most promising strains to see the evolution of Quercetin degradation. All the culture were made in triplicate.
As you can see, there is some variations in the absorbance that makes the curve non linear.
Here we chose not show the standard deviation to make the graph more clear.
To make the graph easier to understand, we chosed to normalized every daily absorbance by the control: Abs(strains)Tx/AbsTx(control).
Thanks to that we get an easy graph to read.
On the Y axis, we can read the % of Quercetin remaining.
We sent to genome sequencing the strains FS_M75(Lysinibacillus), B2(Stenothrophomonas maltophilia), B3(Oerskovia Paurometabola), FS_M121(Microccocus Luteus).
We would like to compare, between theses species, the enzyme commonly responsible for Quercetin degradation.fimage
To finish our project, we assayed two strains FS_M75 and Pseudomonas putida with real wine stain on cotton fabric.

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". I directly felt that I liked protein engineering and found that engineering biological system was very cool. But synthetic biology was at the very start, and during my studies I didn’t hear much of it. There wasn’t any iGEM team in ETH yet. Then I did my PhD at the University of Cambridge where I performed directed evolution of proteins and also worked on methods for doing this efficiently, namely using microfluidic water-in-oil droplets.
In each droplet you can have a separate compartment, so instead of having a 96-well plate you can have like a million droplets. So basically, in each droplet you can have a different library member. For example, if you want to create a library on an enzyme, you introduce mutations then you select out the members out that do want you want. But then, you have to find a method for screening them.
So we took a quick look at your publications on google scholar. (giggling) We noticed that the past couple papers you published are really pertinent to synthetic biology. One in 2015 about the changing expression in gene regulatory networks when you introduce new links between pathways and another one in 2014 where you were able to create an AND gate. How did you move from doing something more like biochemistry into synthetic biology?
So after my PhD, I wanted to move from engineering individual proteins to engineering gene regulatory networks. My main post-doc project was published in 2014 (A unified design space of synthetic stripe-forming networks) where I built stripe-forming gene regulatory networks. We first used computational methods to screen every 3-node topology and asked if this network could form a gene expression profile of a single stripe in a gradient of inducer. Once we have we had all the possible topologies, I build like 4 representative topologies that achieved the same phenotype but with different dynamical mechanisms.
After that I moved to Zurich as a junior group. In my group we use synthetic biology to improve our understanding of gene regulatory networks and their evolution. For example one of the question I am asking is “do networks with different dynamical mechanisms have different potentials to produce novel phenotypes?”
To answer this question we introduce mutations in the regulatory region of the networks and ask what kind of phenotype we get now. We do that for different networks and what we find is that depending on the network we start with we get a different a distribution of phenotypes. This implies that the dynamical mechanism puts a constrain to what it can evolve to.
We use synthetic biology to address evolutionary questions. I think it’s a nice approach because you can easily"

Early biophysical work shows that homodimer is the active form of MerR. The metal binding domain lies at the C-terminal half of the protein, as predicted by earlier genetic, biochemical, and biophysical work, while the Helix-Turn-Helix DNA binding domain locates at the N-terminal (Fig 1A). To be specific, MerR can response to as low as 10-9 M Hg (II) even in the presence of 1 to 5 mM competing thiol ligands[1] ,which indicates that MerR may act as an effective mercury accumulator in aquatic environment.
However, since MerR is a transcription regulator, over-expression of MerR in bacteria may lead to some unpredictable side effect. Earlier work suggested that the truncated peptide only consisting of the metal binding domain can form a stable dimer with its mercury binding affinity remained [2]; and DNA binding domain and metal binding domain can function individually ["

USER cloning attempted in pSB1A8YL backbone, no luck.                                   Sequencing of the original biobricks from the distribution kit/registry showed inconsistent prefix/suffix in BBa_K530001 and BBa_K530002, which might explain our troubles assembling the parts.
Proinsulin
Assembling pTEF+proinsulin, pTEF+CFP and pTEF+YFP pSB1K3 constructs into linearized pSB1C3 and pSB1A8YL with 3A. Growth was observed on the pSB1A8YL:pTEF+Proinsulin, pSB1C3:pTEF+Proinsulin, pTEF+CFP and pTEF+YFP constructs. pSB1A8yl:pTEF+Proinsulin was transformed into Yarowia lipolytica PO1f Δku70 strain. After 2 days of incubation colonies were tested for fluorencence, however no signal was observed.                                   3A assembly for: a) pSB1A8YL:TEF:hrGFP, b) pSB1A8YL:TEF:eCFP c) pSB1C3:TEF:hrGFP, d) pSB1C3:hrGFP (using hrGFP cut with EcoRI and PstI). Restriction analysis of pSB1A8yl:pTEF+eYFP confirm obtainig a proper construct. pSB1A8yl:pTEF+eYFP and pSB1A8yl:pTEF+proinsulin were transformed to Y. lipolytica.                                    pSB1A8yl:pTEF+eYFP was tested in both fluorescent microscope and in fluorometer, but no clear signal was observed.                                   3A assembly for: a) pTEF:hrGFP, b) pTEF:CFP and c) pTEF:YFP in pSB1A8yl.

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#RichardNotebook#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"ick Studio will be very much like the interface for Spectacles; the demo that Cesar showed us is almost like what I originally envisioned for Spectacles. The overall design should turn out something like Mike's Lego CAD , with a parts selection interface on the left and a workspace/information interface on the right. We'll be meeting again at Stanford next Friday after more work has been done on Spectacles.
Week Seven - 7/13
Back to random weekly updates... over the weekend I added code for context menus in the workspace. I plan on making the context menus the same as the Edit menu on the main menu bar; right now the context menus only appear when right-clicking on widgets in the workspace.
Friday: We're at Stanford today! I'll add Spectacles updates and a breakdown of today's doings, but first: Spectacles !
Week Eight - 7/20
...Oops. Stuff that belongs under the previous header: we presented Spectacles and Eugene to Professor Drew Endy, Cesar Rodriguez, and some other folks at Stanford. The Spectacles demo we showed isn't fully functional; there are problems when modifying a Eugene file imported into the workspace with that build. Most of the properties are editable, although changing the names of certain parts will cause problems. I'll put up a newer build towards the end of this week. Back to the trip- partway through our presentation, Drew showed us an example of how complicated a DNA sequence can be with respect to creating a clean and clear abstraction. He repeatedly stressed the importance of abstracting the system from devices from parts from the actual sequence, with emphasis on abstracting the sequence. As it is now, Spectacles is intended for use with parts and devices, and not so much with parts and sequences. After the presentation we sat in for a talk held by some graduate students presenting their projects, and then we went out for Italian food and gelato. I didn't get home until well after 11pm, but it was fun.
Ok, on to this week's stuff -
Monday/Tuesday: Spectacles now has a combo box that lets you drop parts by their text representations. Imports now get tabs with device names, and rearranging parts in a Eugene file works fine.
Wednesday: Spectacles now nags you about unsaved changes! An asterisk shows up in the title to indicate unsaved changes, and disappears after you save a file or export a device.

Looking at public engagement is important because it is the process that brings people from different backgrounds to address and attempt to solve big issues and to bring about social change. Public engagement is important because it lets us know how much people are interested in the exhibit and if they are willing to take action or think more about social issues. For this project, we hope that users can become more interested in synthetic biology and realize the various benefits and flexibility of the field rather than viewing it as a dangerous or unethical field. We also hope that after interacting with the exhibit, users can realize the importance of creativity and tinkering when it comes to solve big problems such as sustaining life on Mars or the Deep Sea. With this exhibit, we also hope that users can understand that inventions or bio-design does not happen in a day. We convey this through the wet lab, which conveys a sense of scale, time, and the reality of syn-bio.
Perception Issues
Our project aims to break away from the misconceptions that many people have about synthetic biology and its practices. Many members of the general public have misinformed opinions about what synthetic biology entails, and the exhibit was designed with that in mind. We chose to work in extreme environments (Mars, Antarctica, and the Deep Sea) precisely because they offer an uncharted territory that does not carry the negative connotations of modifying features of everyday life. All three of these environments offer exciting new challenges to conquer and explore, and help present synthetic biology in a positive light because of that.
Visitors of the museum can approach the exhibit without any preconceived notions, and interact with it in a game-like manner. This allows us to introduce key concepts of biotinkering and biodesign in a playful way.

Some of the submitted BioBricks have been successfully sequenced, and the data has been examined in order to verify that no mutations or incorrect insertions had occurred. The analysis of the sequencing data showed that all the sequenced Plug 'n' Play BioBricks had been correctly assembled without mutations. The sequencing and the characterization both showed that the system works as expected in A. nidulans and in the mammalian cell line U-2 OS.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description-backup_-_-_TEXT.html,"erts a cell killing effect. Combined with the figures 3 and 4 this data suggests the DsbA and Fla secretion tags function better at lower temperatures. For flagellar secretion, this data can be tentatively explained by high-temperature inhibition of flagellum synthesis.
Figure 7: P. putida incubated with supernatants in a 96-well plate at 27°C with 200 rpm shaking. The non-induced supernatant was prepared using the exact same steps as the induced supernatant, except Milli-Q water being added to the culture in place of L-ara.
Having shown that Fla-Art175 at 27°C kills host cells significantly, a culture was then expressed at a higher temperature (30°C) to sustain host cell growth while trying to maximize expression and secretion.
Figure 7 shows that the isolated supernatant of Fla-Art175 exerts effective cell killing activity against P. putida. This suggests that the Fla secretion tag is directing Art-175 for flagellar secretion across both cell membranes, and suggests that Art-175 is folded and functional in the extracellular environment.
Figure shows that YebF-Art175 causes host cell lysis even when induction is only started at mid-log. A lot of cell debris could be seen in the flasks.
As the construct is causing host cell lysis, we opted to upgrade the chassis to the more durable Yersinia enterocolitica. YebF-Art175 (pBAD/HisB) was transformed into Y. enterocolitica. IML421asd by postdoc Dr Diepold. Experimental steps involving live cultures of Yersinia all performed by Dr Diepold.
Figure 8a: Supernatant of expression culture of IML421asd YebF-Art175[pBAD] is able to kill planktonic cells of P. putida, shown by decreased cell density.
Figure 8b: Supernatant of expression culture of IML421asd YebF-Art175[pBAD] is able to kill persister cells of P. putida, shown by decreased intensity of crystal violet staining.
This data shows that the isolated supernatant of YebF-Art175 exerts effective cell killing activity against P. putida. This suggests that the YebF secretion tag is directing Art-175 for Sec mediated secretion across both cell membranes, and suggests that Art-175 is folded and functional in the extracellular environment able to kill the target cells but refrain from killing the host cells. We conclude that this part works as expected, with host cell"

Water pollution control China & World
Jul 12th
to Jul 24th
2017
The metal ions in water will change the water pH value, resulting in deterioration of water living environment. While the pollution intensity exceeds self-regulating capacity, they will eventually lead to serious due deterioration to the positive feedback regulation. The heavy-metal pollution with the characteristics of bioaccumulation, transformation process complexities as well as difficulties in forming insoluble complexes have arisen in Guangxi, Yichang, Gansu and other places in China recently.
Additionally, China plays an increasing role in the water pollution remediation work, within domestic and international circumstances. Consequently, a series of measures for preventing and controlling industrial pollution such as ""Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan"" and "" Water Pollution Map "" have gradually been perfected.
At the same time, we made clear requirements of the detection limits of various pollutants (See below). However, how to achieve a low cost and efficient detection of water quality is still a big challenge.
Detection Limits of Water (partly)
At present, the water heavy metal detection and processing method of the mainstream can be divided into physical, chemical and biological three categories, among which, the physical examination is mainly detected by different metal specific absorption spectra and emission spectra of qualitative and quantitative, and chemical detection method is the use of electrochemical method for determination of the dissolution potential quality and anode. However, due to the extremely low concentration of heavy metals in water, thus producing considerably weak signal, resulting in large errors. In addition, experimental requirements of physical and chemical determination are comparably high which means they cannot be applied to real-time detection in nature. Compared to these, biological detection had a lower threshold, with the a variety of the corresponding signal forms, can completely overcome the harsh natural conditions of field testing. The disadvantages of the traditional physical and chemical methods generally have higher cost, narrow scope, second pollution possibility. Biological treatment utilizes microorganism adsorptions, plant enrichment means which can effectively reduce the toxicity of metal ions. In addition, with the use of synthetic biology tools, engineering bacteria can better fit for heavy metal processing requirements.
By contrast, the public still concern about the safety and ethics behind biological control, to a certain extent, prohibiting the wide development of biological technology in water treating. In the aspect of the development of synthetic biology, all countries in the world have made clear GMO Safety and management regulations. See below.

We also searched for peptide toxicity prediction tools which could be integrated with the NRPSDesigner. One such tool, called ToxinPred [gupta2013], uses machine learning methods and a dataset of 1805 toxic peptides in order to accomplish this very task. Unfortunately, the current implementation only considers peptides consisting of proteinogenic amino acids and not the variety of modified or D-amino acids available to NRP-synthetases.

Figure 5. After the Lux pR promoter being activited, the M13 phage is produced and the sRNA cassettes is pakaged into it.
In our experiment, the M13 phagemid is constructed by the sRNA cassettes and a phage-derived f1 origin (M13ori) of replication. And the helper plasmid contains M13, coding all the machinery genes required to produce viral particles. When the phagemid and helper plasmid are co-transformed, the sRNA cassettes can be packaged into the particles, then the engineered M13 phage is able to infect the live E.coli via the F pilus [2].
The sRNA cassettes combine a scaffold sequence with a 24 base pairs antisense target-binding sequence [3]. The scaffold sequence contains an Hfq-binding motif. Hfq protein helps the combination of mRNA target and the sRNA, and then leads the target mRNA to degrade.
We supposed to design a aac(3)-Id targeted gene. Aac(3)-Id confers E.coli 0157:H7's resistance to gentamicin(Gm) and sisomicin(Sc) to Salmonella enterica. But for the source limitation, we chose a CAT-resistance E.coli as the targeted bacteria for our experiment to test the efficiency of sRNA silencing. In our experiment, the targeted gene was CAT, which leads the CAT resistance. The sRNA cassettes are competent to knocking down the expression of drug-resistant gene. When joint used with certain antibiotics, the drug-resistant bacteria can be killed.
Switch
Figure 6. The diagram of the mechanism that how the switch consisting of the cI gene and lacI gene works.
When the signaling molecules reach a certain level, the sensor will be activated and stimulate the responder. In order to have a better efficiency, we used a lysis gene to crack the cell for the responder releasing. And for a larger repression of the responder, we used the toggle switch to provide more time before the lysis [4].
Our switch contains the promoter regulatory lacI+pL ( BBa_R0011 ), lacI ( BBa_I732820 ), Pr promoter ( BBa_R0051 ) and cI ( BBa_P0451 ). The lacR protein produced by lacI can inhibit regulatory lacI+pl promoter, the cI protein produced by cI can inhibit the Pr promoter [3]. The lysis consists of Pr promoter and lysis gene ( BBa_K112806 ).

In order to conduct electroporation in the field, we developed a portable, 23-cent electroporator called the ElectroPen which weighs only 13g and does not require access to electricity. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the ElectroPen, we conducted proof-of-concept testing using a recombinant plasmid encoding the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and validated our device’s functionality through collaborations with TAS_Taipei iGEM and UGA iGEM. Through UV imaging and plate reader data analysis, we confirmed that in each trial GFP was successfully transformed and expressed by E. coli, and testing was additionally conducted on 3 different cell lines: DH5a, BL21, and Nissile 1917, further verifying the ElectroPen’s performance. With testing of the ElectroPen in different regions across the world in different settings, we further demonstrate the application of this powerful tool in enabling infield electroporation of isolated DNA on E. coli.

Biosensor Cells
Freeze Drying Protocol
These protocols are for using the Biosensor Cells in the field
Add 5 ml of sterile LB media and 5ul of chloramphenicol and ampicillin to a culture tube.
Obtain the desired plate. Take 1-3 colonies from the biosensor cells’ plate with a sterilized inoculating loop. Stir vigorously to ensure colonies are dispensed into solution.
Place culture tubes on a rack in the incubator. Set to shake and temperature to 36-38 C, and grow overnight.
Centrifuge liquid culture and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 5ml of Microbial Freeze Drying Buffer with tryptic soy broth.
Aliquot 500ul of the suspension into sterile vials with stopper.
Turn on the lyophilizer and start the condenser. Set the shelf to 4°C.
Center the vials on the shelf. Either manually or with programmed controls, freeze the samples down to -40°C.  This should take about 30-60 minutes, but it is very dependent upon the lyophilizer. If the rate of freezing can be controlled, a practical rate is to drop the temperature by 1°C per minute. The samples should be visually frozen.
Let the samples sit at -40°C for 1 hour to complete freezing.
Turn on the vacuum pump.  Within 10-20 minutes, the vacuum should be under 200 mill"

Introduction
Higher order self-assembling protein assemblies are commonplace in nature, such as ferritin, which carries iron in many single-celled organisms. Due to their encapsulating function and box-like structure, such assemblies are often called protein “cages.” Inspired by these natural sources, an abundance of research has been done into creating synthetic cages with new customized properties such as stability, size, and subunit types. Furthermore, while applications for cages have been suggested, many have not been tested experimentally.
An application that we have centered our project around is targeted drug delivery. By specifying the site of delivery, the effects of the drug can be limited to desired areas with maximized efficiency and we can avoid damaging undesired targets in the body.
Thrombosis, the process by which a clot forms in the blood stream, is associated with widespread diseases including stroke and many heart conditions. Anticoagulants prevent clot formation by interfering with clotting factors and allowing for smoother blood flow and restoring normal circulation. However, these drugs can have detrimental side effects, such as an inability to inhibit fatal blood loss through cuts or other wounds. By localizing the site of delivery and reducing the necessary drug dosage, we can mitigate these kinds of problems. A protein cage encapsulating an anticoagulant drug that would selectively release its payload at the site of a clot would fulfill this purpose. To specify the target, we should select an associated enzyme or byproduct of the clotting cascade. Thrombin, a protease present at blood clots, cleaves a specific amino acid sequence. This sequence, if properly inserted into a protein cage containing an anticoagulant, would result in disassembly of the cage, release of the drug molecule to the targeted area, and destruction of the clot.
The goal of our project is to modify protein cages that disassemble in the presence of thrombin protease. We are using two previously created synthetic cages, one composed of 12 subunits forming a tetrahedral cage while the other is composed of 24 subunits forming an octahedral cage. For each of these protein cages, we have designed mutants with inserted thrombin cleavage sites with the intention to induce disassembly of the cages by treatment with thrombin prote"

Neither the empty backbone nor the SDM 1 modified expression system did seem to cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could only be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated in the section of BioBrick K2020002 ). By demonstrating that this modification doesn’t result in a clearance of the skim milk plates, we were now able to prove that serine is essential for the proteolytic activity of the protease and that exchanging it would inactivate the enzyme. Hence, we demonstrated that exchanging serine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid will inactivate subtilisin E and therefore proved the principle of our project. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020004
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (S221X) This part is a variation of the BioBrick K2020003 . In opposition to the exchange of serine221 against tyrosine, the named serine was exchanged against an amber codon, the least used stop codon in Escherichia coli. The codon AGC of serine221 was substituted with TAG, which codes for DMNB-serine, if the corresponding aminoacyl tRNA/synthetase pair is added. So serine will be exchanged against DMNBS in the catalytic triade of the enzyme in the presence of the needed DMNBS tRNA/synthetase pair. By irradiation with light, this non-canonical amino acid can be converted to natural serine in the active site of the enzyme and the cleaved off photo-labile group. Thereby, the protease will reach its activity just by shining light on it and will be reversibly inactivated successfully. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as our proof of principle of exchanging serine against a larger amino acid namely tyrosine worked, it can be assumed, that this part will also operate correctly. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020005
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (Y77W) The BioBrick named K2020002 for the expression of subtilisin E in E. coli is the basic component of this new part. Therefore, it consists of the promoter BBa_R0010 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the leader sequence pelB"

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," targeted at the sirA gene from mycobacteria.
Results
Produced an E. coli strain which relies upon mycobacterial sirA, fprA and fdxA genes to survive in M9 minimal media.
Demonstrated that E. coli can survive with mycobacterial sulfite reduction pathway with Flux Balance Analysis.
Located drug target sites on sirA as well as identified high structural similarity between cysI and sirA through structural analysis.
Identified a potential anti-TB activity of Pyridoxine at high doses.
MycoSIR E. coli depend on our synthetic pathway for growth. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was deleted for cysI and transformed with the three genes of the mycoSIR pathway expressed from IPTG-inducible T7 promoters (red). Wild-type (blue), uninduced (purple) and pathway-minus (gold) strains were used as controls. Both time course growth curves (A) and final ODs (B) reveal that the complete, induced pathway is required for growth
Infiltrate
Background
Latent tuberculosis persists inside macrophages of the lungs, where it is partially protected from both the host immune system and conventional antibiotics.
Aims
To create an E. coli strain capable of entering the macrophage cytosol and delivering a lytic enzyme to kill mycobacteria.
Results
We expressed the enzyme Trehalose Dimycolate Hydrolase (TDMH) in E.coli and showed that it is highly toxic to mycobacteria in culture.
We expressed the listeriolyin O (LLO) gene in E. coli and showed that it is capable of entering the macrophage cytosol.
We co-infected macrophages with both mycobacteria and our engineered E. coli to characterize the resulting phagocytosis and killing.
TDMH expression kills mycobacteria in culture. We mixed E. coli and WT M.smegmatis in LB media. Plating assays were used to count specifically M.smegmatis after the indicated times. When TDMH-expression was fully induced, more than 98% of mycobacteria were killed after 6 hours (red line). Populations of mycobacteria alone (black line) and mycobacteria mixed with uninduced E. coli (blue line) were stable.
Sabotage
Background
One of the main concerns about tuberculosis today is the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains.
Aims
Our objective is to make an antibiotic-resistant bacterial population sensitive again to the selfsame antibiotics.

1.) pSac-CM isolated yield 200ng/ul
2.) Gel run of gradient PCR. All primers can amplify their fragments in all temperatures: 150alsTF+Rev amplifies 150bp fragment, 250alsTF+Rev amplifies 250bp fragment, 300alsTF+Rev amplifies 300bp fragment, and 500alsTF+Rev amplifies 500bp fragment. Optimal annealing temperature: 58 degree celcius until 60 degree celcius, for all primer sets.
3.) B.subtilis transformation yesterday was a success for pSac-CM. Both methods show transformants. For BBa_I742123: both methods show no transformant. This is not expected. Ask team Edinburgh?

Purified cDNA as [[Team:Groningen/Notebook/Wetwork_5July2012|previously]]. Concentrations far too low (22.1 ng/uL). RNA degraded? Wrong handling? --> Ask Arjan to repeat work on Monday.

System design
The above figure means that we want to produce spermidine after a certain time we add arabinose which can reduce the activity of Cre. Then the number of times of flip will decrease and we can expect to get more genes in state ‘B’ we want.  Below is the reaction we add to achieve the idea. Here

denote the production rate of s, the degradation rate of s, the degradation rate of Cre with the affection of s respectively.

The number of the genes in different states:
1 trajectory:
10 trajectories:
100 trajectories:
1000 trajectories:
Compare the result of the model with feed forward with the previous one without feed forward, we can easily find that: 1. The peak of the Cre distribution is narrower in the model with a feed forward part and the number of times of flip decreases a lot. 2. In the stable state that the number of genes in every state does not change any more, more genes have flipped from state ‘A’ to state ‘B’ in the model with a feed forward part. And this result is better than the previous one since we want the system to finally change from the ‘AND’ gate to the ‘OR’ gate which means it is better to have more genes in state ‘B’.
Stability analysis:
We then compare the stability of the system with feed forward with the previous one without feed forward by observing their phase trajectories and we can get the following result. System without feed forward:
System with feed forward:
Both phase trajectories of the two systems go straight to a point which illustrate that both systems reach to the stable state rapidly. But if we observe carefully, we can see some fluctuations in the Figure 4.8 and almost no fluctuation in Figure 4.9 from which we can get the conclusion that the system with feed forward is more stable than the one without feed"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," we used flow cytometry analysis.  The results presented in Fig. 11 show a positive signal in the rfp channel for the scAvidin and the eMA receptor bearing cells. As already observed in microscopy mRuby-fluorescence could not be detected for the BAP-receptor cells. But surprisingly about 40% where positive for Dy634, meaning that the A3C5 tag, against which the fluorophor labeled Fab is dierectet, must be present on the cell surface. This results suggest that there might be a problem about the folding of the mRuby beta-barrel leading to a loss of fluorescent activity.  For scA and eMA cells Dy634 signal has been positive albeit not as high as expected.  Another stain was the eGFP coupled with biotin giving a positive signal for scA and eMA to which the biotin binds. For BAP cells there was no signal since this receptor, is biotinylated by the BirA and doesn't cooperatively bind the Biotin. Moreover the biotin snd the dye are coupled via the C-terminal tail of the biotin leaving no contact point for the BirA to ligate the eGFP-biotin to the receptor's acceptor peptide.
Immunochemical detecton of functionalized membrane protein using Western Blot
Another way to verify the succesful transfection and protein expression is given by the two tags (A3C5 and Strep-tag II) that are included in the receptor design, which allow detection via Western Blot analysis.
After transfecting mammalian cells with the receptor constructs and selecting them for 2 weeks on hygromycin, we lysed the cells and checked for the presence of Strep- and A3C5-tag via western blot using primary antibodies (or a Fab for A3C5) against the respective tags und secondary alkaline phosphatase coupled antibodies (see methods). As the figure shows, the Strep-tag wasn't detectable via WB - however, the A3C5-tag-WB shows significant singular bands at the size of our proteins in the respective samples. This data corresponds with the flow cytometry results again showing that the BAP receptor is also present in the non-fluorescent cells.

EYFP measurement using Leica DMi8
Leica DMi8 is an excellent inverted microscope for life science research, which is utilized extensively in materials inspection and measurement. For live cell research, the DMi8 platform is a complete solution whether precisely follow the development of a single cell in a dish, screen through multiple assays, obtain single molecule resolution, or tease out behaviors of complex processes.
Combined with easy to use software, high resolution cameras, and brilliant LED illumination, these inverted research systems are flexible to see the expression of the fluorescent protein EYFP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through high speed imaging, using the external fluorescent filter wheels, we obtained fast and accurate fluorescent images as following show. It tells that our bacteria that we constructed express EYFP successfully and continuously in oscillating system. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity detected was very bright, indicating that the expression of EYFP was at a high level.

Wiki and Design Concepts
""Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."" - Steve Jobs
The communication of our ideas and project before the Jamboree is mostly done on our Wikis. Many of the judges, prior to attending a presentation session, will check the team’s Wiki to ready themselves for the technical talk and to gain a first look and a basic understanding of the project. Additionally, as it is accessible by all, the Wiki can be used as a platform to introduce projects and synthetic biology to the general public. How the Wiki is designed and how it conveys information is therefore extremely important not only for the iGEM competition, but also for how your project is perceived in society’s eye.  “When you do things right, people won’t be sure you’ve done anything at all.” When people visit your Wiki, you want them to read and enjoy the content you’ve provided. People can inherently tell if there is something off about your design. If your wiki delivers all the necessities and no one can point out a flaw, you’ve done your job. Designing a functional Wiki was one of the hardest things our team had to tackle. In addition to the complexity of HTML, Java, and CSS (to say the least) we also had to make sure our content was readable and fun to learn. Essentially, your Wiki is an extension of your presentation. Your Wiki is the first impression that you are going to give the judges and anyone else who happens to stumble upon the iGEM site. Your Wiki is important. It is"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we attended a workshop based on general molecular biology techniques.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. Also, the team members were assigned in different parts of the project such as TALEs as our detector, Ferritin as our reporter, Linker, Human Practices, Modelling and Business.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
We did our literature search for optimization of TALE binding affinity. There were conflicting results for the optimal truncation of the N and C terminus.

Then we achieved our goal to show the effect of IPTG concentration on the change of MIC by combining the Placactivity and the MIC change of wild type bcr (Fig. 3). We discovered that only a small amount of IPTG is essential to induce bcr and trigger similar antibiotic resistance compared with wild type. However, further increase of IPTG concentration has limited effect on strengthening antibiotic resistance. This is probably due to the saturation of IPTG in bcr induction where the bcr amount reaches the peak, while the concentration of antibiotics keeps increasing.

Usage of copper
Copper was one of the first metals ever extracted and used by humans, and it has made vital contributions to sustaining and improving society since the dawn of civilization.
Copper is easily stretched, molded, and shaped; is resistant to corrosion; and conducts heat and electricity efficiently. As a result, copper was important to early humans and continues to be a material of choice for a variety of domestic, industrial, and high-technology applications today. Demand of copper is increasing.
.
Copper mining
For meeting the increasing demand of copper in the world, the massive copper ores are mined every year.
The exploit of copper causes lots of contamination.
The main source of copper contamination to atmospheric is the emission of extraction of copper. The emission from factory to water and soil also polluted the water and soil.Copper contamination lead to negative effect on plants, animal and Humans. Humans ingest copper by breathing the contaminated air, or intake the plants grown in polluted soil or animal bred in polluted water. Extra hepatic toxicity is subsequent to the accumulation of copper in the liver. After that, copper appears to be redistributed from the cytosol to lysosomes, and it can be released into systemic circulation. Copper can then accumulate in select extra hepatic sites, such as the kidney and brain.
International standards for drinking water and daily copper intake
Less than 2.0 mg/L copper in drinking water
http://www.who.int/
Cases of copper toxicity on human
Some studies have reported cases of human copper poisoning. Mineral supplementation of 30mg/d for 2 years.Drinking tap water, o.4 to 5.5 mg/l, or 2.2 to 3.4 mg/L. Drinking hot water, 8mg/l through using copper blackened kettles. Well-water heated and stored in copper container, hot water measured 6.3mg/L. Feeding milk prepared in untinned copper containers, 10-63mg/L.

So many people are in the lab now! Because so many of our small lab teams have transitioned to lab work, the “Yeast Parents”, or team in charge of maintaining the yeast and the lab, gave everyone a tour of the space to keep everything organized (and keep us all in line).
Unfortunately, with great numbers of people in lab comes great margin for mistake. We burnt through a ridiculous amount of Q5 polymerase this week because we miscommunicated the concentrations needed to perform PCR. However, the team took this as a learning experience and practiced concentration math and master-mix-making. We are also going to begin a crowdfunding campaign to supplement the team funds when/if errors arise in the future.
Outreach is really cool! Three of us, plus our PI (of course), spoke to Martyn Smith, Managing Director of the Family Planning 2020 Secretariat, over the phone. He nearly gave us heart attacks when he offered to help us reach local agents familiar with the regulatory environments in the countries we wanted our project to extend to. Aside from the FP2020 call, two of our members have been diligently working on outreach at home. They’ve started to develop a game as an interactive way for high schoolers to join in when we present our project to them later this month.
After double checking that we were using the right volumes for our PCR reaction, we were able to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2. We then confirmed this by running it on a 1% agarose gel seen below.
We ran OE PCR reactions without primers for all five genes but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes. We discovered that the master-mix concentration was too high for all of the"

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We have contacted the Imperial IGEM group who are sending us the part.
26th September - 16th October
The part from Imperial arrived too late, so could not be used. We therefore concentrated on the pCpxR_pSB1A3 and the pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 parts.  There were three different pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 constructs to test, two using the pCpxR from MG1655 and one using pCpxR from TR235. Of these three, DH5alpha transformed with the TR235 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 construct and one of the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 constructs fluoresced after being placed on glass microscope slides (a longer form of pCpxR had previously been shown to be activated by adhesion to glass microspheres). Fluorescence in the TR235 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 transformation was mainly restricted to long filamentous bacteria, while smaller bacteria were seen to fluoresce in the MG1655_pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 transformation. Restriction digests confirmed that TR235 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 had been formed correctly with E0840 inserting in the correct orientation. There was some confusion however as the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 construct that fluoresced was suggested by the restriction digest to have an E0840 insertion in the incorrect orientation, while the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 that did not fluoresce was suggested to be in the correct orientation. All three samples, plus the two pCpxR_pSB1A3 constructs (one from TR235 and one from MG1655) were sent off for sequencing to confirm their identity.
Sequencing confirmed the identity of the TR235 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 confirmed its correct orientation, and showed an exact match to the target sequence. The restriction digest results were also confirmed, with the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 that fluoresced having the E0840 in the incorrect orientation, while the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 that didn't fluoresce having E0840 in the correct orientation, again with an exact match to the target sequence. It appears that E0840 in the incorrect orientation had been activated by another route, although this has"

Start with a call/teleconference survey and then recompile. o Stanford-Brown created a human practices website and an alumni website. Max Song did this, and we’re going to try to contact him for further information and collaboration. - Angela: update: she has all of the PUF protein sequences and the RNA/aa info. It can be synthesized by a company (time and money) or self-synthesize (2 weeks, little money). University of North Carolina is researching the PUF protein and so we could ask for a template DNA PUM1 gene from them. Jin’s lab could also PCR out the PUM1 gene that expresses the PUF protein. So overall there are 4 different sources to get the gene. Translational repressors are an application. GFP can be used to characterize. Small side project – design and optimize a construct for the project (to be presented in the next advisor’s meeting). - Divya: looking at things with microbial properties, but not plants. Maybe yeast. - Bob: Found a part that uses light to run an ATP pump. We could look into photosynthetic bacteria rather than interfacing the electro-animal/slug with bacteria. - Uros: There are fungi/bacteria that can degrade plastic via serine hyrdolase. Yale is probably going to do this project for iGEM. It’s a simple but pretty cool project. We can anticipate that this will be a popular idea. Collaboration with Yale is an option. - Anthony: Looked into the price of the substrate ARA, but is unsure about how much is needed. Also, there are troubles getting e. coli to take up the fatty acids. - Asha o Broad review of how tuberculosis is treated. Look for someone on campus who is researching on how to treat tuberculosis/bacteria. Look for a direction to research further. - Cara: o An Australian team has put e. coli in sewage water before. It would be a 2010/2009 team. So we can look into improving that project. What we will be further researching: PUF project – Angela, Divya, Asha Plastic degradation – Adi, Uros, Fatty acid producing e. coli – Anthony, Isiah E. coli waste management – Cara, Bob The next time these ideas are presented – genes and a schematic should be presented.

Systematic characterization of promoters
Overview
Significant knowledge gaps remain in the functional and dynamic characterization of several gene promoters, and engineering decisions depend on detailed quantitative information.
Comments
George, do you have any good papers about this? Chris.m.gowen 01:08, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
Yeah, there is a recent paper from Endy et al. titled Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard .  In addition, there is a promoter measurement kit that has been developed by Jason Kelly (Ginkgo Bioworks) that is distributed by the Registry (I believe it was used in the paper mentioned above).  More information, including a protocol, is available here . GMcArthurIV 15:18, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
Here is another good paper by Adams and Hatfield titled Effects of promoter strengths and growth conditions on copy number of transcription-fusion vectors .  This idea of quantifying promoter strength seems very interesting and important to the idea of standardization.  I also like the idea of using a reference promoter to minimize the variances in promoter strength due to environmental and instrumental differences. - Albergca 22:58, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Development of thermostable enzymes
Overview
Bacteria and Archea occupy nearly every nook and cranny on Earth; from deep beneath Arctic ice in the absence of light, to temperatures over boiling in Yellowstone. As thermodynamics tells us, reaction rates increase proportional to temperature. Therefore, an industrial enzymatic process normally carried out at 37oC, could be run at higher temperatures for a faster turnover. Additionally, incubating microbes is very energy-intensive, and the knowledge of thermostable properties can also be applied to utilize thermophilic enzymes in meso- or even psychrophiles. This could lead to Quiagen kits that don't require any incubation, yet can proceed at the same rate.
Comments
I think looking at homologous proteins across temperature preferences would be a good start. Usually dense G-C regions are more thermostable in terms of Tm, similar substitutions in amino acid sequences and tertiary/quarternary structure. Also, prions would be neat to look at, because they don't denature at 60°C,"

However, miRNAs present in saliva are less well documented. Saliva may also be less accurate as its composition can change depending on what was recently eaten so we didn’t look much more into this, but it could be a good area for further research.
Another cost involved in the test is the upfront equipment costs - see how we made a combined densitometer and fluorometer for less than £4 on our hardware page !
Screening cost-effectiveness model
To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

These were ligated together. The ligations were transformed into cells and the transformants plated on LB+chloramphenicol+IPTG+Xgal plate. The blue colonies (contain lacZ) were used for the following experiments.  Colony PCR screen of pooled blue Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase transformants with lacZ forward primer and reverse nitroreductase primer showed a band corresponding to lacZ-nitroreductase.
Figure 3: DNA gel with Colony PCR products of pooled blue Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase transformants with lacZ forward primer and reverse nitroreductase primer resulted in in bands around 1.2-1.3 kb which correspond  to nitroreductase (0.6 kb) plus lacZ (0.6 kb).
To confirm the presence of Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase in pSB1C3, the samples in the smallest pool were minipreped, digested with EcoRI and SpeI to check the size of the insert.
Figure 4: DNA gel with Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase which was digested with EcoRI HF and SpeI. The biggest band is likely to correspond to pSB1C3 around 2.2-2.3 kb, the middle band is likely to correspond to  Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase around 1.5 kb and the smallest fragment is unknown.
Figure 5: DNA gel with Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase which was digested with EcoRI HF to linearise the DNA. There are two distinctive bands, one around 3.0 kb and one around 3.6 kb likely to correspond to pSB1C3 with Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase and Plac-lacZ'.
This DNA was further purified to give a single plasmid corresponding to Plac-lacZ'-nitroreductase.

a) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Yes. May cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys. However, E.coli is not considered a human or animal pathogen nor is it toxicogenic. Any concerns for E.coli in terms of health considerations are mitigated by its poor ability to colonize the colon and establish infections.
b) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
The plasmids we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.
c) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
All the biological materials used in our lab are safe, and all the products of the coding sequences are innocuous to human, so the risk of malicious misuse is low.
A regular safety briefing and a lecture about the basics concerning of biotechnology and genetic engineering are basic elements of our education at the SCUT. The handling of biological material and safety aspects of chemicals are explained. A safety briefing was held for all iGEM students by Zhenwu Zhang who is the responsible person for our lab safety.

UCL,2016,Team:UCLouvain#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Ni2+). If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it possibly contains a porin for which the gate opening or closing is regulated by Zn2+ or Ni2+. The mutants selected through this step should be further investigated and characterized.
In the picture below (figure 8), 83 mutants obtained after the first selection have been spotted on 4 selective media to check their potential regulable behavior.
Figure 8: Second selection on selective maltodextrin media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+).
Here, we can already see some growth differences in several mutants that suggest an influence of transition metal ions present in the medium. However, we didn’t have enough time to replicate the data and further characterize these mutants.
Mutant screening
To analyze the potential regulable leaky mutants, we performed colony PCR reactions to amplify the pIV gene and then check the mutations introduced within the gates.
For the amplification, we used two primers that amplify most of the pIV sequence. This corresponds to 987bp and covers all the mutated regions.
Cycling conditions
Electrophoresis
Figure 9: Amplification of the pIV porin.
Sequencing
Due to a lack of time, we were only able to sequence over 16 leaky mutants that went through the first selection step, each presenting mutations within one of the two gates (see figure 10). For some mutants, we can observe a strong histidine enrichment within the 15 amino acids mutated region, which demonstrates the efficiency of the QuickLib method used for mutagenesis. We observed up to 7 histidines in one of the mutants and the actual porin is made of 12 identical subunits, which means a total of 84 histidines added right on the hinge of this door. Interestingly, some amino acids present in the mutated regions remain quite stable through mutagenesis, suggesting that they may be important for the integrity of the porin. Also, it’s quite surprising to see that the mutated regions are rather resistant to mutations, with some porins presenting more than 10 mutations in the gate.
Figure 10: Sequencing results of the mutated porins. Histidine mutations are shown in red and other mutations are shown in yellow.
These first results are very promising since a lot of colonies were obtained after the first selection step and the sequencing analysis shows mutants with many different amino acid combinations. With additional sequencing results, it will be interesting to do some statistical analysis of"

Summary
Our model includes two main contributions to the changes of the enzymatic activity due to temperature variation: transcription and synthesis rates. In the case of the GFP,  the folding free energy term is small and the relative enzymatic activity can be simplified to our master equation for stability $$ \begin{equation} \frac{Ac}{Ac^0}  = \frac{r_T}{r^0_T} \frac{r_P}{r^0_P} . \end{equation} $$
2) pH
Contrary to the temperature situations, internal pH hardly varies in E. coli when the external pH does. Therefore, we focus on the intrinsic E. coli element that may be affected by this type of stress, subsequently influencing Biobrick expression. The main factor is the number of free RNAP, which will be reduced due to the synthesis of stress response genes. We estimate the ratio of free RNAP under different conditions by the ratio of their growth rates $$ \begin{equation} \frac{r_T}{r^0_T}  = \frac{Prob_B}{Prob^0_B}  = \frac { 1+\frac{R^0}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }} } { \frac {R^0}{R}+\frac{R^0}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }}} , \end{equation} $$ with $$  \begin{equation} \frac{R^0}{R}  = \frac{growth^0} {growth} ."
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," can proudly say that we invested efforts to take the iGEM community to another level. We created a software tool which translates protein coding BioBricks in the registry to amino acid sequences, calculates various parameters and compiles alignments with data from various data banks. In the end all collected information for a BioBrick is exported into a standardized table which can easily be integrated into the part descriptions of BioBricks. We submitted a RFC for the AutoAnnotator which obtained the number RFC[96]. Besides this software toll we have written tutorials on wiki programming, creating animated gifs of protein structures and the usage of Arduino microcontrollers for future iGEM projects.

HUMAN PRACTICES SUMMARY
We separated our Human Practices into three categories: Research, Impact, and Outreach. Each category serves to guide and help us better understand our project. In addition to contacting professors, engineers, researchers, companies, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to compile information for our final constructs and prototype designs, we also reached out to the public to raise awareness of synthetic biology and nanotechnology.
RESEARCH
To understand how people view nanoparticles (NPs), as well as NP usage and current regulations, we gathered public opinion from our local community. We sought advice from researchers in the fields of nanotechnology and environmental science to learn about the impact of NPs on the environment and our lives. Lastly, we contacted NP manufacturers, waste collectors, as well as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in both urban and rural settings to learn about current practices and possible future applications.
Water System Services
Dihua Wastewater Treatment Plant
In order to learn firsthand about the effect of NPs in WWTPs, we visited the Dihua WWTP (迪化污水處理廠). Here, we were given a tour around the plant, and were able to ask questions to the managers and people who work there. They confirmed that the current facilities are unable to remove NPs from wastewater mainly due to their small size. In addition to this information, they kindly provided us with samples of sludge, effluent water, and the polymers they add during the wastewater treatment process. Throughout the year, we visited and talked to the Dihua WWTP several times about where and how our project could be implemented in their current system. These conversations and visits played a huge role in shaping our construct design, prototype design, mathematical modeling and overall purpose for our project. (Whole team activity)

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," will find use in a variety of applications, particularly those employing natural or synthetic bacterial consortia.
3. Future plans for the project
3.1. To Improve the robustness of AI-2 controllers
3.1.1 Further improvement of our chassis
To create robust synthetic devices, chassis should be genetically modified to ensure orthogonality. For AI-2 Consumers, native genes involved in AI-2 production should be knocked out while for AI-2 Suppliers, native genes involved in AI-2 processing and degradation be knocked out.
3.1.2 AI-2 Controller Device Improvement
Multiple metabolic engineering should be applied to further improve the function of AI-2 Controllers, such as promoter & RBS optmization.
3.2. Improvement on AI-2 Response Device A/B
3.2.1 Leakage expression of prmoter lsr
As is shown in Proof of Concept , though two AI-2 Repsonse Devices could function as expected, there was still GFP leakage expression in both of the two devices. We have mainly considered two ways to solve the leakage expression problem. One way is to optimize the chassis to reduce native AI-2 influence on the devices themselves. Another way is to engineer and modify plsr promoter region in order to realize a stricter expression control under the control of exogenous AI-2 signal.
3.2.2 From Qualitative to Quantitative
Establish a more precise mathmetical model
Establish more practical and accurate experiment protocols
3.3. To improve the biosafety system (monostable switches)
Actually realize the designed biosafety systems
Establish a more stable kill switch
3.4. Applications in diverse collective behaviors
AI-2 is a quorum sensing signal recognized by many bacteria species. We had demonstrated utility of AI-2 Controllers by modulating naturally occurring processes of biofilm formation. We will find more application in a variety of fields.
Fig.7: Natural phenomenon wherein AI-2 is involved
4. Project Achievements in this summer
We proposed a prototype AI-2 controller to manipulate cell-cell communication and collective behavior. Link
We have successfully constructed 8 AI-2 Controller Devices and characterized them. Link
We have constructed two AI-2 Response Device which could respond to different AI-2 concentration by emitting different intensity of GFP fluorescence. Link
We also designed a biosafety system in which essential protein can be degraded to lead the cell to death upon loss of the biocontainment signal. Link
We demonstrated that AI-2 Controller could alter heterologous gene expression and manipulate bacteria biofilm formation process. Link

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"lorescence fusion protein’s intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength under different taxol’s concentration treatments. The shape of experimental group emission curve and blank group emission curve are obviously different. That of experimental groups with different taxol’s concentration (final concentration: 0 μm, 0.5 μm, 5 μm, 25 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm, 250 μm and 500 μm) are basically similar except of the whole translation of wave band. Line graphs are shown here.
According to the picture above we can tell that adding taxol would influence the emission intensity of the fluorescent protein, which induces the shape and position changes of the intensity curve. Then we verified the influence of taxol to the fluorescent protein.
Because the interpreted variable is discrete, we use the Box Plot to describe the intensity of emission of microtubulin under the different concentration of the Taxol. According to the distribution of characteristic bands, we divide CPS value into four bands and use the Box Plot to describe them respectively. The specific four bands are as follows, 520nm-522.5nm, 522.5nm-525nm, 525nm-527.5nm and 527.5-530. And we get the following plot.
From the figure, we can see four boxplots. Each of them stands for a certain concentration of the TAX；the straight line in the box is the median of the data under a certain concentration, standing for the average of the light absorption value OD350 under this concentration. The upper line stands for the upper quartile of the data and the nether line stands for the nether quartile of the data. We can find that data have a big inner undulation under the concentration of TAX greater than 12.5, but when the concentration is between 5 and 12.5, the undulation of the data is tiny. In addition to this, the average of the light absorption value OD350 is high under the TAX’s concentration from 0 to 1 and the TAX’s concentration above 12.5.
2.0 - Theory of the one-way analysis of variance
By constructing the F-test statistics, we can use the one-way analysis of variance to study whether classification of the independent variable’s different levels can make significant influence on the variation of the continuous variable. If the levels have a significant influence, we can further give the 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels"

In order to use Julius, it is necessary to create a language model and an acoustic model.  Julius adopts the acoustic models and the pronunctiation dictionaries from the HTK software, which is not opensource, but can be used and downloaded for its use and posterior generation of acoustic models.
Acoustic model
An acoustic model is a file which contains an statistical representation of each of the different sounds that form a word (phoneme).  Julius allows voice recognition through continuous dictation or by using a previously introduced grammar.  However, the use of continuous dictation carries a problem.  It requires an acoustic model trained with lots of voice files. As the amount of sound files containing voices and different texts increases, the ratio of good hits of the acoustic model will improve.  This implies several variations: the pronunciation of the person training the model, the dialect used, etc. Nowadays, Julius doesn't count with any model good enough for continuous dictation in English.
Due to the different problems presented by this kind of recognition, we chose the second option.  We designed a grammar using the Voxforce acoustic model based in Markov's Hidden Models. To do this, we need the following file:
-file .dict:a list of all the words that we want our culture to recognize and its corresponding decomposition into phonemes.
Acoustic Analysis
Acoustic models take the acoustic properties of the input signal.  They acquire a group of vectors of certain characteristics that will later be compared with a group of                 patterns that represent symbols of a phonetic alphabet and return the symbols which resembles them the most. This is the basis of the mathematical probabilistic                 process called Hidden Markov Model.  The acoustic analysis is based on the extraction of a vector similar to the input acoustic signal with the purpose of applying the                 theory of pattern recognition.                This vector is a parametric representation of the acoustic signal, containing the most relevant information and storing as compressed as possible.               In order to obtain a good group of vectors, the signal is pre-processed, reducing background noise and correlation.
HMM, Hidden Markov Model
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective framework                 for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a consequence,                 almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech                 recognition systems are based on HMMs.
The core of all speech recognition systems consists of a set                 of statistical models representing the various sounds of the language to                 be recognised. Since"

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Suicide_-_-_TEXT.html," the positive controls (mixture without Colicin) was somehow less than the one with Colicin cells. We guessed that the problems are
The plates have more cells when they have more Colicin: the Colicin cells maybe took the Immunity/Cm-resistance plasmid
Less cells on the plate without Colicin (and very few cells overall compared to the theoretical calculation): the cells may have died because they loose the Immunity/Cm-resistance plasmid during the incubation without antibiotic (which we did to avoid killing the Colicin cells).
Therefore we still need to improve protocol to provide a more reliable quantitative data.
Testing the effects of colicin-containing protein extract on E.coli
We mix Z1 cells with the supernatant of centrifuged Colicin cells (exctract with the ColE2 protein). Therefore we can put the antibiotic during the whole experiment to avoid plasmid loss.
Experimental Setup
Cell types
colicin-producing cells
Z1 cells with immunity
Z1 cells without immunity as a control
Protocol
Grow overnight cultures of colicin-producing cells, Z1 cells with immunity and Z1 cells without immunity.
For the colicin-producing cells (protocol adapted from http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=06010401 ):
Centrifuge at 5000g for 10 mins
Weigh the falcons with the cell pellet and add 4mL of B-PER Reagent per gram of cell pellet. Pipette the suspension up and down until it is homogeneous
Incubate 10-15 minutes at room temperature
Pour the lysate into eppendorff tubes and centrifuge it at 15,000 × g for 5 minutes to separate soluble proteins from the insoluble proteins. Keep the soluble fraction: this is the protein extract containing colicins.
For the immune and non-immune cells:
Dilute the overnight cultures 1/100 into 10-ml cultures (with antibiotics):
3 x Z1 cells without immunity
3 x Z1 cells with immunity, induced with IPTG
3 x Z1 cells with immunity, non-induced
Grow the cultures for at least 1h, make sure that the OD is more or less the same for all cultures (tip: you can keep a culture with a higher OD at 4°C to wait until the other cultures reach the same OD)
Mix the immune/non-immune cells with the colicin extract, in different proportions (cells/colicin extract 9:1"
