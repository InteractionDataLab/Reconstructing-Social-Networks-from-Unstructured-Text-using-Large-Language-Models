Background
Latent tuberculosis persists inside macrophages, where it is partially protected from both the host immune system and conventional antibiotics.
Results
We expressed the enzyme Trehalose Dimycolate Hydrolase (TDMH) in E. coli and showed that it is highly toxic to mycobacteria in culture.
We expressed the listeriolyin O (LLO) gene in E. coli and showed that it is capable of entering the macrophage cytosol.
We co-infected macrophages with both mycobacteria and our engineered E. coli to characterize the resulting phagocytosis and killing.
We measured the effect of a range of pH (from 3 to 8,8) on M. smegmatis and the TDMH enzyme activity.

Introduction
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis (TB), spreads by aerosol and infects its host through the airways. The bacterium is phagocytosed by macrophages in the lung, yet often evades death in the lysosome. Mtb can persist for years or even decades inside macrophages by inhibiting phagosome/lysosome fusion and supressing the normal acidification of the lysosome.
An efficient treatment for persistent TB must enter infected macrophages and kill the pathogen there. In our system, E. coli is both the vector and the"

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," and Dopamine) are predicted to be produced even though the enzymes that catalyses both the reaction are different and thus the outcome could be expected to differ. The main constraint added in the non–native reactions is the uptake rate of oxygen and energy source, and due to the similarity of the added reactions (in both cases the levels of oxygen is essential) the model fails to differentiate between the two reaction and, thus, the same levels of compounds are predicted to be produced by the bacterial model.
Figure 17 L-DOPA (Red) and Dopamine (Blue) production at half the maximum growth rate of E.coli BL21 using different Energy Sources. The values shown are the synthesis rate of compounds in mmol gram of dry cell weight per hour (mmolgDW -1h-1).
Figure 18 L-DOPA (Blue) production as a function of increasing growth rate of E.coli BL21 using glucose as the energy source. A similar trend is also seen when the L-DOPA synthesis rate is obtained as a function of increasing bacterial growth rate using different energy sources.
Figure 17 shows the flux values where the survival reactions are constrained to half their growth rate. Unlike Figure 16 it can be seen that the compounds are produced using various substrates as energy source. This is because there are essential metabolites available for the non-native reactions to take place, since not all of the metabolites would be used for the survival reaction. This is further shown by Figure 18, where the bacterial growth potential was constrained to increasing level of percentage growth. The Figure shows a negative trend: as the percentage of growth rate increases, the flux value for L-DOPA production decreases.
The growth of the bacteria could be constrained by manipulating the genome of the bacteria, not only to induce the necessary enzymes and cofactors within them, but also to constrain their growth to maintain a certain density/population. The necessary compounds (L-DOPA) could be produced as a function of bacterial growth rate/ constant cell density and thus could be altered as per the dietary and dosage requirements of the Parkinson’s patients. Thus, this holds great potential in terms of being a novel therapeutic delivery system for the treatment of Parkinson’s.
Limitations and Future Outlook
There was no difference in the levels (flux values) of L-DOPA and Dopamine produced despite the fact that both are synthesized independent of each other and the enzymes responsible for their catalysis also differ. This is because the enzyme kinetics and catalysis are not part of this particular analysis (flux balance analysis), and there is only one major constrain added to the non"

Quorum sensing overview: Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression.
Our attack plan: Use quorum sensing to trigger transcription of genes that produce enzymes capable of degrading Vibrio cholerae biofilms.
Last year’s team started on this project and was able to clone the necessary quorum sensing related genes from Vibrio cholerae into plasmids in preparation for insertion into E. coli. After reviewing their info and data, we need to sequence their plasmids to ensure that the plasmids have the correct genes in the correct sequence. Once we are able to confirm that everything got into the plasmid correctly we can move the plasmid into E. coli and make sure that it is working correctly. To help with this, we are creating a map of the plasmid to use as our reference for our sequencing. We have a generic map of the genes and are using them to compile a cohesive nucleotide sequence.
We also compared research articles and data that we had gathered to discuss ideas on how to effectively destroy the V. cholerae biofilm. After our discussion we came up with a list of possible enzymes that we are going to research further before deciding on which enzymes we will focus our research on.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the road to market for open-source medicine. Rather than a single entity attempting to get approval for a patent, allow individuals and businesses to  invest in the clinical trials of open-source medication. Public stock exchange for investment in the approval of open-source medication. Once the drug is approved, investors receive their money and dividend from manufacturers.
ISSUES
Return on investment must scale the with relative risk of the medicine’s chance of making it to market.
Return on investment must be less than the current return on IP earned by pharmaceutical entities (else the price of drugs will increase).
These two points together suggests that the biosimilar market would be ideal for testing this business model, as no novel applications are involved.
5. Bathtub Insulin
BACKGROUND
Bathtub insulin would provide small-scale insulin manufacturing and purification equipment to local doctors in developing nations. This system, alongside suitable training for skilled medical professionals would help to create a grassroots pharmaceutical industry that could expand to benefit neighbouring countries.[4]
ISSUES
Regulatory and Safety Nightmare. Puts way too many people at unnecessary risk.
Considering economies of scale, it may be worth skipping this entirely and focusing on large-scale manufacturing projects in newly industrialised nations.
The profits will not benefit developing nations, but the industry efficiency would hopefully mean that they gain access to more affordable insulin.
6. Public Investment
BACKGROUND
Convincing public entities such as the Chinese, Indian or United States government to invest in insulin manufacturing and purification facilities. This could fall under a normal grant scheme, or through newly designed investment schemes for insulin specifically. This could be further enhanced by creating investment initiative programs, such as ‘matching’ any investment an ‘Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient’ manufacturing plant makes. Currently the expense to get a manufacturing facility GMP approved is prohibitive for small-medium sized business, and a major dissuader for large corporations. The Indian government has done an excellent job of lowering this barrier to entry without compromising on product safety.[5] In addition, the expense of operating in the American market results in pharmaceutical companies ameliorating these expenses across global sales, resulting in a far higher global price. Medical advertising reform in the USA/Europe would significantly reduce the price burden on the international market.  The managers of pharmaceutical benefits schemes can decide how large portions of the market directs its spending. Companies go to significant advertising expense to ensure their analogue is purchased in bulk. Insulin expenses are a public burden as well as an individual financial burden. By directing spending towards regular insulin/ open-source analogues, this public burden can be reduced. [6]
ISSUES
Capitalist governments are often reticent to invest"

Abstract
    Synthetic genetic oscillators have long been of interest to the scientific community. Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, blue and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.

Working with the plant: chassis selection in accordance with the phyllosphere
Overview:
The plant aerial surface, of which the leaves cover most, is home to many microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes).               This microbiota of the plant surface is called the phyllosphere, and it is truly fascinating because of its unique               characteristics1. The leaves are harsh environments for life and these organisms show interesting adaptive               properties. They are also able to interact closely to the host plant, forming what is called a holobiont.
Figure 1: the plant aerial surface, mostly occupied by leaves, is inhabited by diverse microorganisms, forming the phyllosphere
Learning about the phyllosphere was important for us because we wanted to know how our organism would survive on           the surface of the leaf. We want to predict how our organism will interact with the leaf microbiota. Indeed, just like           any other microbiota, the phyllosphere has a fragile balance and perturbing it with our organisms is the last           thing we want. While we were studying the phyllosphere, we had the pleasure of an interview with a phyllosphere           expert, Dr. Corinne Vacher (you can find the interview here) , who gave           us a lot of information and advice.
It is important to understand as much as we can about the environment we are going to work on to synergise with it           and maximise"
Birkbeck,2015,Team:Birkbeck#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," little clones have appeared on the kanamycin plates (containing cells with the assembly backbone); not so much luck for the chloramphenicol plates (which contain the shipping backbone). So for now, it’s time to set up some overnight cultures – we’ll just have to clone our gene over from the assembly to the shipping backbone for submission later.
The parts required for the payload were amplified by electroporation into E. coli 10β. Transformed E. coli 10β were plated on LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotic concentration and incubated at 37oC overnight.

After spending much of the week designing and redesigning a whole collection of primers and other DNA sequences to amplify our ORF314 gene (after all, we don’t want to run out, so the easiest way to amplify seemed through PCR) and to introduce a His-tag into the sequence. By the end of the day, we’re finally confident we’ve cracked it, and the order is put in. Now all we can do is wait until our order arrives!
Plasmids of overnight cultures of the payload circuit were harvested. Restriction diagnostics must be carried out prior to use.

SYNENERGENE The Hague
21-04-17
The first step in our Integrated Human Practices! The Rathenau Institute together with SYNENERGENE have launched a new version of their guidelines for Integrated Human Practices. The day in The Hague was a pilot project for the iGEMer’s Guide to the Future and gave the iGEM teams from the Netherlands the chance to start working with this guide. Moreover, this day also gave us the opportunity to talk to some experts: Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM), Dirk Stemerding (Biotechnology & Society), Virgil Rerimassie (formerly Rathenau Institute) and Marjoleine van der Meij and Wieke Betten (Athena Institute).
Since our project at that time was still under construction and very fundamental, we could still easily shape our Human Practices. From our talk with Virgil we learned that it is extremely important to have an ‘easy’ explanation of our project, if it can be used as a tool, what can the tool be used for? Dirk Stemerding told us that it is important to think about what our technique would add to modern research, why would people want to use it? Furthermore, it can be very helpful to look at previous projects for inspiration. From Marjoleine and Wieke we learned that it is important to think about the audience, that might change the story you want to tell. It is also very important to incorporate the views of other people into our project, have some sort of expert committee. Lastly, with Cécile and Korienke we talked about the risk analysis of the GMO’s: what is safety? When is a protein safe? Apart from safety in GMO’s, guidelines regarding medicines are also important to consider.
We learned a lot from this day and it was a good first step into thinking about our Integrated Human Practices.

This composite part combined with the B0010-B0012 part will yield the desired construct. Thus by rearranging the sequence of these functional modules 1 and 2 you effectively reduce the amount of cloning as seen at 1-2 arrangement from 3 cloning steps to 1 cloning step in the 2-1 arrangement.
Furthermore, the program implements a few filters for part quality, part availability and part experience. With these filters only parts containing the criteria which you selected are taken from the database and subsequently used in optimizing your cloning strategy.
The zip file containing the program, the manual and the source code can be downloaded here . After unzipping the zipfile read the manual for more information about using The Constructor.
Validation of “The Constructor”.
For the validation of “The Constructor” we contacted the following iGEM teams, with the request if we could test their cloning strategy. The results are depicted in the table below.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory. Meanwhile, we chatted with the researchers and conducted a small survey of their project idea.
By talking with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.
“A good beginning is half done. That is to say, a good idea of a genetic circuit design is half done of the whole project.” A researcher named Dong told us.
Since ideas are so significant to a project, where do researchers' ideas usually come from? We did a small survey of researchers in several labs.
Figure 15: The sources distribution of researchers' project idea.
From the figures above, we learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals ---- they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction. However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.
“We all hope to stand on shoulders of the giant, but it's hard at this stage to combine or transfer the senior's ideas in order to form my own ideas.” Researcher Dong said.
How to trigger one's inspiration? What if our software could help people with inspiration? This ""Inspiration"" inspires all of us. However, it is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure and specify. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.
Thanks to the inspiration flashed across our mind, we decided to create an onomatopoeia ""S-Din"" as the name of our project and software, as it sounds like turning on a bulb.
Needs & Functions Integration
Here are S-Din's core functions we developed for users' needs.
Integrated database
In S-Din's database, we standardize a new data format for different types of data: parts, projects, keywords and papers. Based on this format, our database is integrated into a unity, and accessible to set up interaction network and analysis. The S-Din search engine and S-Din Design are both working under this standard.
Keyword Tree & Network Analysis
In order to stimulate one's inspiration in synbio work design, we tried the following explorations: The tree of words, and network analysis.

An isolated colony was picked and inoculated in Lysogeny Broth (commonly referred to as Luria broth, an excellent growth medium for bacteria) overnight for 16 hours. Three colonies were picked, hence three start-up cultures were prepared. This allows us to selectively choose the one with the most optimal OD to continue with our plans to grow up an entire Liter of Tamura.
Procedure
Colony picked with micropipet and inserted into a culture tube containing 10 mL of LB and 10 ul of Ampicillin."

Intellectual Property Rights
As everyone knows, intellectual property rights are ultimately important in modern society due to its function to promote creativity and protect the owners from plagiarism. Almost every country and region would try their best to fight against plagiarism and promote the intellectual property rights among themselves. Being a renowned worldwide competition, iGEM also emphasises the significance of the intellectual property rights. After some"
Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," Pline. The GT iGEM team follows all the safety protocols and guidelines as described by the Georgia Tech Environmental Health & Safety here
Also, our project follows the policies and procedures governing the possession and use of Recombinant DNA as stipulated by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Biosafety Committee and as laid out in this document
Safety Issues Concerning the GT iGEM 2012 Project
As with any project involving culturing bacteria, appropriate saftey measure have to be taken with our project. Though none of the bacteria we are working with are human pathogens or environmental liabilities, it is possible that unwanted contaminants could be cultured in large volume unintentionally. Therefore, we treat every culture as if it were dangerous and take important precautions, such as wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), cleaiing up any spills with 10% bleach or 70% ethanol, and autoclaving all culture tubes and plates before disposing of their contents.
Bacterial Strains Used
When working with any GMO, it is imperative to make sure that it remains in the lab and is not spread outside the lab. However, for our project we are not working with any human pathogens, so out project has been classified as Biosafety Level 1.
Agrobacterium tumefaciens
The lab has ordered its DNA to isolate the TraR sequence from it. We also recieved Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the Ti plasmid taken out. A tumefaciens is a plant pathogen, but it's virulence factors are on the Ti plasmid. TraR itself is merely a regulatory factor.
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
The bacteria we used, BL21(DE3) E. coli, are non-pathogenic and thus not likely to cause any ill effects if released by accident. Transforming with plasmids containing TraR will not confer any benefit to them in any new hosts, save for the antibiotic resistance marker encoded on the plasmids.
Security Risk:
Biobrick Safety Considerations: The proposed biobrick of the Georgia Tech iGEM will consist of the basic parts of DNA of auto-inducer receptor TraR from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and a marker protein such as Green Fluorescent Protein. None of these parts have been documented to raise any safety issues.
Biosafety Regulations at Georgia Institute of Technology

We did SDS-PAGE to test the expression protein.
We promoted parts: we extracted plasmid in kit 2 and did enzyme digestion. We chose BBa_K934001 to assemble parts by enzyme digestion, ligation, transformation and plasmid extraction and separately ligated with the Arab sugar induced promoter(BBa_10500) and the heat sensitive promoter(BBa_K873002).
We re-did fusion PCR, and the α-nluc had the objective band. Then we sequenced gene.
We used the product of the LR reaction β-nluc to do bacterial colony PCR, and it had a high positive rate. So we did plasmid extraction(β-nluc, cluc-β), enzyme digestion and ligation.
Dry Lab
We exchaged ideas for the development of the dynamical model microtubule dynamic instability.
The mechanism of the taxol in the microtubules dynamic assembly process had important significance. In order to well study the taxol's influence in the dynamic assembly process, we divided into four steps on the dynamic process modeling.

Description
Protein purification is important to both biopharmaceutical production and scientific research. Producing recombinant  proteins with high purity is essential for protein drug-based therapies, protein structural analyses and functional studies. Most currently used protein purification techniques, such as commercial resins conjugated by various ligands, different types of chromatography and ultracentrifugation, require expensive investment, special device or tedious procedure. Meanwhile, they have different flaws in getting purified proteins, such as low specificity, long-term operating procedures and harsh conditions to sacrifice protein activity; thus, many of them, even with their combinations, cannot meet the required protein purity and quality for many applications. For instance, affinity chromatography is reputed for its high affinity, but tightly bound proteins typically require relatively extreme eluting conditions to disassociate from affinity columns; ultracentrifugation or size exclusion separates samples based on molecular weight difference, but they can co-purify other proteins and large molecules of lipid or nuclear acids. Thus, developing fast, easy to operate and economic approaches to purify recombinant proteins with high quality is urgently needed.
Fig.1 Purification progress by using the Nickel column
Our team developed a novel protein purification approach that eliminates most weaknesses of other techniques. Our method is based on the highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation between Spytag (a peptide with 13 amino acids) and Spycatcher (a peptide with 116 amino acids). We also take the advantage of a magnetic bacterium AMB-1 that can produce magnet particles, also called Magnetosome, covered by a bilayer phospholipid membrane, in which Mms13 protein is anchored. We generate Spycatcher-Mms13 and express this fusion protein in AMB-1 bacteria to make Spycatcher linked to the Magnetosome. A protein of interest with a Spytag at its N- or C-terminus is expressed in E. coli and present in bacterial lysate. The Spycatcher-Mms13-linked Magnetosome can specifically and covalently conjugate to the Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet. Due to covalent"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi"

Formal Lab Session - 20th August 2009
Overview
Metal Sensor Team - carried out mini-preps of BBa_J33206 BioBrick for the three colonies picked and then digested these mini-preps for analysis/
Stochastic Switch Team - performed mini-preps of the 5 BioBricks which were transformed in E. coli in yesterday's experiment
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
Mathew preparing the mini-prep solutions whilst Solution I + RNAse sits in the ice bucket
In yesterday's lab session, the metal sensor team inoculated 3 tubes of 3ml LB with the three transformant E.coli cultures grown on the LB + ampicillin plates (i.e. the E.coli bacteria which had taken up the BBa_J33206 DNA). In addition, 0.5ml of each of these three solutions was used to innoculate 3 flasks containing 50ml LB each. The initial inoculations of 3ml LB solutions is for today's mini prep; the subsequent inoculations of 50ml LB solutions is for today's midi prep.
Today, the team hope to firstly carry out a mini prep for the three transformant cultures. Secondly, it is intended that restriction enzyme digests are carried out on a sample of all three culture plasmids along with DNA gel electrophoresis to determine whether the transformed DNA is in fact the BBa_J33206 BioBrick. Thirdly, if time permits, the team hope to carry out a midi prep of the plasmids for later cloning. If all of these steps do not get completed today, they can resumed tomorrow.
Practical Outline
The Metal Sensing team hope to carry out the following tasks today"

We selected two restriction sites, BamHI and SalI, for constructing gene T1R2; SpeI and NotI for T1R3. And to confirm the expression and location of the protein, tag Myc and tag His were linked to T1R2 and T1R3 respectively.
The digested DNA fragments were cloned into plasmid pESC-Leu. Then we transformed the recombinant plasmid into the E.coli BMTop10 and screened positive clones by colony-PCR.
The recombinant plasmid in E.coli was extracted and transformed by LiAc transformation method into CEN.PK2-1C which contains the Pfus-mRFP-CYC1t(G418 resistance vector) gene circuit, a detection device.
With the help of auxotrophic selection marker Leu in pESC-Leu, the colony was chosen by the Leucine-defect SD medium containing 0.3% G418.
In this way, we got the recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae with sweet taste receptor and detection device successfully.
T1R2-T1R3 with His tag and Myc tag was designed to confirm the expression and location of T1R2-T1R3 in the CEN.PK2-1C, which was tested through the immunofluorescence technology.
Then we used the minimal induction medium to induce the Gal1/Gal10 promoter. After protein expressed, we incubated the primary antibody for His tag and Myc tag, then added second antibody for displaying the expression and location of receptors in yeast cells.

Project Description
Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is a leading cause of many pneumococcal diseases such as meningitis, septicaemia and otitis media. According to the World Health Organization, pneumococcal diseases are estimated to be responsible for 1.6M deaths every year. According to National Institutes of Health, 40% to 70% infected children are killed or disabled by this disease in developing countries. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, our team came up with ""Pneumosensor"", an engineered E. coli designated to work inside an in vitro diagnostic device that would detect S. pneumoniae.
Pneumosensor achieves its function by making use of quorum sensing pathway components in S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae secretes an autoinducer molecule known as Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP), which activates the comCDE signal transduction pathway and increases the uptake of extracellular DNA during the log phase of bacterial growth. Our team is migrating and rewiring this quorum-sensing mechanism into E. coli to sense and report populations of S. pneumoniae. Alongside this track, we are thoroughly cataloging and characterizing existing riboregulators submitted by previous teams. We believe that this will be useful for other synthetic biologists.
In summary, our team hopes to alleviate the health complications caused by S. pneumoniae by designing and constructing a whole-cell biosensor that can detect S. pneumoniae. Moreover, we are curating existing RNA devices for the benefit of other future iGEM teams and those working in the synthetic biology field.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Off targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," the kinetic model, loaded Cas13a can be in a number of states. It can be unbound, have formed n (correct or incorrect) basepairs with a sequence that is being probed, or have cleaved its target substrate, at which point it is also activated. The ratio between the forward and backward rates determines the probability of moving between states and can be determined by the energy difference in the free-energy barrier between going forward and backwards between the state (for each position n):
$$\frac{k_{forward}(n)}{k_{backward}(n)} = e^{\Delta n} \tag{1}$$
As mentioned above, functional and structural studies of Cas13a indicate a central seed region ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ; Gootenberg et al. 2017 ; Lui et al. 2017 ). Therefore, we can schematically represent binding process as depicted in Figure 2). We take the first bound nucleotide to be at position 12 (as seen from the 5’ to the 3’ end of the spacer), in the middle of the central seed region that ranges from nucleotide 9 to 15 ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ). We impose that subsequent binding events occur sequentially in both directions.
Figure 2: Model representation of Cas13a target binding. A) adapted Figure 1 from Klein et al. 2017 birth-death process
With these adjustments, we can follow the recipe given in ( Klein et al. 2017 ), we can now calculate the probability to cleave ($P_{clv}$) a target ($s$) with a given guide ($g$) once it is bound:
$$ P_{cls}(s|g) = \frac{1}{1+\Sigma ^n_{n=1} e^{-\Delta T(n)}} \tag{2}$$
With $\Delta T(n)$ the parametrization of the energy landscape: the transition state energy between the first bound state and the n-nucleotides bound state. Lastly, we make the simplifying assumption that the transition to the next state is favourable for correct Watson-Crick base pairing (with an energy gain of $\delta C$) and unfavourable for mismatches (with an energy penalty of $\Delta I$). The energy landscape is then only dependent on the number of correct ($n_c$) and number of incorrect ($n_i=n-n_c$) base pairs.
$$ \Delta T(n) = -(n-n_c) \Delta I + n_c"

Lambda Red recombination
Background
Recombineering (recombination-mediated genetic engineering) is an efficient molecular engineering technique used for gene replacement, deletion and insertion. Compared to the traditional technology like digestion and ligation, it’s based on the homologous recombination (HR) and can achieve DNA modification without the restriction enzyme and ligase.
The homologous recombination in E.coli is mediated by proteins called recombinase. The traditional way is dependent on the RecA protein. Nevertheless, there are some limitations like the requirements for long homologous region and the low efficiency of successful recombination. In 1998, a new technique based on Red recombination system is firstly reported to dramatically improve the capacity of gene replacement on the chromosome of E.coli [1]. In recent decades, Red recombination has been extensively employed in gene editing of E.coli due to its distinguished advantages, such as the high efficiency of recombination and the requirement of short homologous arms.
Mechanism
Cloning methods based on cleavage and joining reactions are used for DNA modification and amplification on plasmid vectors, but it’s limited to the gene editing on chromosome. According to the DNA double strand break and repair recombination pathway, the modified tool—“Red recombination” was created for efficient operation on chromosome [2].
To generate recombinant DNA molecules and achieve gene replacement, three steps are required. Firstly, primers containing 30-50 nt sequence identical to the target sequence are synthesized to attain the PCR product homologous with the target. Second, cells are induced for Exo, Beta and Gam function and are made competent for electroporation. Finally, recombination occurs between the amplified PCR product and the target site on chromosome after electroporation [3].
Application in our project
The phenomenon of plasmid lost is very common. To prove a new concept of plasmid quorum sensing, we need to adjust our design according to different situations. Typically, the losing of plasmid will happen both in low-copy plasmid and high-copy one. Since our gene circuits for sensing and controlling the plasmid numbers are also loaded on the target plasmid, we need to avoid the completely lost of plasmids or the system will not reach the expected effects"
SHSBNU_China,2017,Team:SHSBNU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," animals with an intact microbiota. Then, we found that thiosulfate and tetrathionate are two ideal targets in studying gut inflammation (Kristina N-M Daeffler, 2017). In order to solve the second issue, we decided to express the detection result by showing a different color. Thus, we are then able to detect and gut inflammation.
Abstract: Noninvasive gut inflammation detector
Because thiosulfate and tetrathionate are indicators of intestinal inflammation (Levitt et al, 1999), this system can be used to detect it noninvasively. Although the detailed process and reasons for their production are still unknown, it has been established that the level of thiosulfate and tetrathionate is directly proportional to the seriousness of intestinal inflammation. Until now, scientists were able to detect thiosulfate and tetrathionate using a detector based on a two-component system, which includes two parts: detector and reporter. The detector was derived from a marine Shewanella species, and previous experiments on the detection of intestinal inflammation used sfGFP to show the result. However, we thought this method can be further improved.
The SHSBNU_China team worked on changing the reporter part to display the results more clearly and visibly, not requiring specially-produced ultraviolet light or prolonged contact with oxygen. In our system, E. coli would produce a chromo-protein to change its color (even in an anaerobic environment). Furthermore, to enable the result to be observed more easily and to ensure its safety, we planned to produce a pill in which the modified E. coli is stored, with special walls that would only allow small molecules to pass through. In addition to the conventional chromo-proteins it can produce, we designed and produced an additional plasmid using violacein as the reporter. Violacein was successfully produced and the corresponding strain showed obvious purple color under anaerobic conditions. The special reason for choosing violacein is that this compound can cure or at least slow down the inflammation to some degree.
The two systems function as follows:
ThsSR system: pSB4K5-thsS+pSB1C3-thsR-sfGFP / BBa_K1033919/ BBa_K1033932/ BBa_K592009/ protoviolaceinic acid

Learning about iGEM
We have designed several posters about iGEM and Synthetic Biology for exhibition, introducing what is iGEM and what we are doing for changing the world.
iGEM Classroom
We set up a series of iGEM courses for High school students instead of simple lectures. As the saying goes “The best way to learn is to practice”, we held a summer camp with lab visiting and offer them a chance to do experiment themselves. Besides, we open up our iGEM classroom both online and offline for them to learn more about iGEM. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them establishing their own team.
iGEM Summer camp
We held a lab open day which attracted students of Chengdu NO.7 middle school. We introduced iGEM to them and showed them around in our laboratories, as well as introducing them our experiment equipment.
Then we began our class of Plasmids extraction. We guide them to do some basic experiments and they experienced the real life of lab. We also talked with them and received some feedback:
“A wonderful experience. I had never thought that it was such a hard work until I did it myself.”
“Thanks to your careful guidance! It is really exciting when my plasmid concentration was detected to be in a normal level.”
“Experiment needs patience, determination and circumspection. It is really a hard work, because you have to endure much failure during the experiment and go on to do it again…Of course it is me!”

Our Sponsors Event
Richard Huish College, Taunton
We organised a workshop on synthetic biology at Richard Huish College in Somerset, that presented the students, aged 16 to 18, with the case study for one of the projects we were working on at the time. The students were made aware of the steps that we went through, including choosing a suitable project, securing funding and explaining our work and ideas to academics.
Victor Valcovici School, Romania
A member of our team visited the Victor Valcovici school in Galati, Romania, where children aged 6 to 10 participated in our workshop, entitled “Scientist for a Day”. They were given activity packs designed by the York iGEM team that included leaflets with information on bacteria and synthetic biology, educational games and a file with paper bacterial organelles that they could use to invent their own useful bacteria. The kids were very receptive and ingenious, their ideas – some more realistic than others – ranging from using fluorescent bacteria as a compass to creating scented bacteria that can be used in the production of bio-perfumes.
Researchers' Night 2014, York
European researchers night is an annual family friendly event that takes place simultaneously in over three hundred cities across Europe. This year the event was on Friday, 26th September and York was lucky enough to be selected as a host venue for this event in the UK.
We were lucky enough to be asked to take part in this event and showcase our work for iGEM, this was done in several different ways.

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Achievement_-_-_TEXT.html," test, we designed a questionnaire to survey the public's opinion and experiences including general public, school teachers, policemen, judges, health care workers and our parents. Second, we hosted a wine drinking “party”, and the school military instructors and a police officer help us to perform sobriety test using the breathalyzer to the teachers and our principal. On the education part, we visited the top research institutes in Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Moreover, our advisors and instructors taught biotech skills in the workshops. In addition, we share the iGEM spirits to the junior students with lectures and lab experiments. We do a lot on Education and Public Engagement, we hope we can get the prize.”
Model
“We did make a lot of efforts on modeling with the help from BIONIME Biotech Corp, a blood glucose innovator. We performed experiments in electrochemical analysis, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry. We conducted CV to study the electrochemical properties of our enzyme. The results showed that our work is functional and the redox reaction proceed smoothly. After that, amperometry was used to monitor the changes of current in a given period. The results of amperometry provided the data needed for drawing a calibration curve describing the concentration of alcohol and the current generated. The results we acquired gave us a deeper understanding of the connections between the alcohol concentration and the current produced. That helped us design our prototype and create the ideal environment for the chemical reaction to proceed efficiently and effectively. For those achievements, one cannot deny that we are fully qualified for the prize.”
Applied Design
“This year we are focusing on the problem of drunk driving. We find out that the breath sobriety test contains many problems. We’d like to apply the idea of Blood Glucose Meter (BGM) to a whole new design. In BGM, glucose reacts with glucose oxidase (GOX) on the electrode to produce electron. As a result, the device can measure the glucose concentration based on current intensity. To measure alcohol in our project, we engineered E. coli to produce alcohol oxidase (AOX) to catalyze the oxidation of alcohol just like GOX dose on glucose. Furthermore, we made a fusion protein with Lpp-Omp that make AOX displayed on the bacterial surface without need to purify the protein. After the electrochemical studies and prototype design, we created a noviel iGEM Blood Alcohol Meter (iMeter), which is portable, easy-to-use, accurate and time-saving compared to the sobriety test system used today.”

In biological world, when information flows through gene-regulatory networks, it may cause noise. Through the information theory, we use modeling computation and wet lab work to realize biological significance of recurring parallel designs in nature. Therefore, we combined the research theory of biology and automation. We are composed of 2 students from department of biology and 11 students from department of automation. Different from the other teams, because most of us are from department of automation, our project has a lot to do with information theory. We use the knowledge of probability theory, information theory, cybernetics, and so on to predict and verify the experiment. Not only most of our experiments verified the theory, but the predict is almost the same with our experiment result. Compared to other teams who use biological experiments to finish the actual operation and practical application, we focus on realizing the knowledge about life world, which is more like theory research. Both application and theory research are the two important keys in biological research. Our work is divided into experiment, modeling computation, human practice, web page, etc. Following is our members and works:

We got sequencing results. It was found that the medium control RBS, Normal control RBS, LacI generator sequencing failed. But the locks and keys and negative cascade plasmids were partially confirmed. The Riboregulator plasmids has sequence similarity but not fully correct. Hence we think it is good to drop Riboregulator since we have no time to correct its assembly in which time we can concentrate on characterising the negative cascade"

WHU-China,2015,Team:WHU-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"UST-China and HZAU-China. Experience Sharing:
Every team has its own way to overcome the difficulties throughout the project. Thus inspiration could be gained by listening to the stories and experience of each other. In the experience sharing section, we drew attention to difficulties in lab work, human practice, mathematic modeling and operation of the team. The following parts describe the conclusion we made that day in details: Fig.3 Discussion during the break.
1. lab work:
Key Problem: The unexpected failure of some experiments troubles all the teams a lot. On the one hand, even a single operation in the experiment could lead to such failure and thus experienced members are needed to give instructions at the critical time. On the other hand, the inadequacy of control tests makes it ambitious to reason the failure out. Inexperienced members don't know how to set adequate control test during molecular cloning experiments for too many details should be involved. Details include whether the enzymes or antibiotics work, the efficiency of competent cells, the purity of the DNA, etc. But generally speaking, most of team members lack experience because few of the experienced members from the team of last year would remain in the team this year and that's the point of the problem.
Meet Up
Page 3 of 4
Solution: Seek for help more frequently! More face-to-face talk with professors in College of Life Sciences and senior students in the lab! Though seeking for help online is useful and convenient sometimes, but it's hard to make your problems clear by chatting online. Talking to those experienced lab workers face to face, you can not only convey your problems to them unambiguously and get the solution but also learn how they design their experiments and estimate an experiment.
2. Human Practices:
Key Problem: Some of our projects focused on putting forward some brand-new concepts to promote the development of a subject. Because the projects are a bit far away from daily life and cannot be put into use at once, how it would affect our future remains unknown and the importance of it would be hard to convey to the public. Therefore, we must think different when designing meaningful and feasible human practices for such projects. Solutions: Do some research related to your project and prepare for the future use of your project in this way. For example, chatting with scientists who might get interested in that emerging field and get idea about the role your project could play in that field.  Cooperate with local science museums. Science museums are places where the public gains knowledge of science. Lectures or other activities held there might impress the public and change their mind about the field that your project is in.

Overview     Peptide YY     Population Control
 
     Early in the planning stages of The Citadel team's project,  it became apparent that, while production of PYY3-36 by E.coli would be a great accomplishment, for the peptide to be an effective candidate  for microbial supplementation and use in a brain-gut appetite control system  such as we envisioned, it would need to be under strict regulation.  Overproduction of the peptide ought to be  prevented by a module secondary to the original peptide production  component.  This new module would work to  maintain a specific, desirable level of PYY3-36 production.  The team set out to create such a device.
     The system that the team chose to accomplish a limitation of  PYY3-36 production is simple in principle, built off the concept  that the most effective way to prevent a cell from producing a peptide is to  eliminate the cell.  With this in mind,  the team constructed a poison-generating module that becomes activated only  once the colony of cells has reached such a density that additional PYY3-36  production is not required. 
     Three key features make this population limit possible.  The first is inter-cellular communication, or  quorum sensing.  The AHL family of  molecules is produced constituatively by all cells in the colony.  These molecules accumulate within the cell  and diffuse into the extracellular space.   As the colony grows, the concentration gradient is reversed, and uptake  of AHL into the cells dominates.  In this  way, AHL acts as a broadcasting system for the density of the colony as a  whole.
     The second feature required for the team's population  control module is the sensitivity tuner.   Thanks to work done previously by the Cambridge iGEM teams from multiple  years, the Registry now boasts a set of parts designed to fine-tune the level  at which transcription of a given downstream sequence can begin.  When coupled with the AHL inter-cellular  communication system described above, these parts allow the designer to  construct a device which sets a precise threshold marker for population size,  the attainment of which triggers the transcription of downstream sequences in  the circuit.  Essentially, sensitivity  tuners have allowed The Citadel team to set up a gateway, through which only  sufficiently dense colonies can pass.

4. Anti-antibiotics gene
This year we use mammalian cells as carriers. So in our plasmids, there are several kinds of anti-antibiotics genes which are used for eukaryotic cell screening. Some of them are very useful but no team has submitted related Parts before. We kindly hope these resistance gene can help the following team researching on mammalian cell.
The gene bla express Blasticidin S deaminase. This gene is from Asepergillus terreus. It can inactivate blasticidin S HCl, the nucleoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces griseochromogenes which inhibits protein synthesis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We commonly use 10μg/mL in cell line selection.
The gene zeo is the resistance gene to antibiotic phleomycin D1, a kind of bleomycin. It is primarily used in selection of eukaryotic cell lines. [7] In our project we use the concentration of 400μg/mL.
The gene puro is corresponding to the antibiotic puromycin, which is an antibiotic that is a protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting translation. Puromycin is selective for either prokaryotes or eukaryotes, but poorly active for E.coli. We usually use 3μg/mL in cell culture.
Usually, we will not use anti-antibiotics genes alone. We often use them together with some core protein such as GECO. However, it is monocistronic in the eukaryotic cells. There is a DNA sequence called 2A which connects two coding sequence and then both two call be expressed by the same promoter. We design primers and do PCR of this anti-antibiotics genes coding sequence together with 2A sequence and ligate it to pSB1C3 backbone. These promoter can be directly linked to protein coding sequence if other groups need.
5. Mutated sfGFP
In our lab, we usually use sfGFP as a reporter for molecular experiment. Some of our backbones contain recognition site, KpnI, a commonly used restriction enzyme. We need a single KpnI site, while sfGFP coding sequence contains a KpnI site. So we do site-directed"

CHOICE OF MATERIALS
crdS, crdA and crdC genes
✵ crdS gene codes the Curdlan synthase.
✵ crdA gene codes a protein which assists translocation of nascent polymer across cytoplasmic membrane.
✵ crdC gene codes a protein which assists translocation of nascent polymer across the periplasm.
crdA, crdC, crdS genes occupy a contiguous 4,948-bp region in Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749.
N.B. We tried to work on these three genes. However, amplification attempts by PCR were unsuccessful for crdA and crdC genes. So, in a first time, we focused on cloning crdS gene only.
OsmY promoter
In Agrobacterium sp.ATCC31749, Curdlan production is started after a nitrogen starvation in stationary phase. So we decided to use OsmY promoter (BBa_J45992) characterized by MIT 2006 iGEM team which is active in stationary phase and under high osmotic pressure condition. This promoter imitates Curdlan biosynthesis in E.coli without the nitrogen stress.
Figure 1: Growth dependent regulation with three promoters
(Property of MIT 2006 iGEM team)
M63 and LB media
Curdlan production was carried out in two different media: LB medium and M63 medium.
✵ We worked on M63 medium because a mineral salt medium is used on the literature [1]. M63 is a minimal, low osmolarity medium for E.coli, resulting in slower growth rate of these cells.
→ With this medium of known composition we were able to control parameters for the production of our molecule of interest.
✵We worked also on LB medium because this is the most common medium used in the laboratory.

Mentoring
Taking part in the iGEM competition can be a bit overwhelming at first. That is why we helped out our compatriots from Louvain-La-Neuve , who are participating for the first time. We reviewed each other's work, and provided useful input on each other's projects. Also, in the last week before the big Jamboree, we met up to review and discuss about each other's presentation and posters.
Apart from helping each other with the projects, we are also planning to organize a conference on synthetic biology together. In this way we can present our projects to the Belgian public, and educate them about iGEM.  Who knows, maybe we'll inspire a new generation students who will take part in the iGEM competition with their own, unique projects!
Interviews
Marie Matos from the EPFL iGEM team contacted us in September if we would be interested in a collaboration through an interview on Skype. Always interested in the projects of the other teams, this gave us an ideal opportunity to gain information on their project by the team members themselves. We also had a chance to talk about our own project, with a subteam consisting of three of our master students, and our advisor. Not only was this interview a lot of fun to do, and did we meet two new awesome people, they also published the interview on their igem.today site, where we are team of the week of 21 September.

Two plasmids are used as a basis prK415 P. Our advisor, Miguel, already has isolated DNA and this DNA will be used to transform and to have a  the plasmid reserved. 2ul of the plasmid and competent cells treated with calcium chloride. The theory says that positive ions are attached to the membrane, so the membrane has a positive charge. As DNA has a negative charge, once they are mixed at 4 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, we are going to take the tube and put it at 42 degrees centigrade. This stress produces holes in the membrane and many things will be capable or entering or exiting through the membrane, including DNA. Then it remains 2 more minutes at this temperature. The we return it to ice for 5 more minutes to recover. Later, the cells are placed in 1ml of rich medium (LB) were they are allowed to grow at 37 degrees for one hour at 300 revolutions per minute (this allows them to recover).
 
100ul are taken and used to plate in petri dishes with the antibiotic. It is left to grow for an entire day and at the end, isolated colonies should appear.
Bacteria with kanamycin 5ml of two strains, one with a deletion in rcnA and another one with any deletion except for rcnA . For 6 hours, the bacteria will have an exponential growth. Genomic DNA will be extracted.
 
The contents of the tube will be put in an eppendorf, we centrifuge and then we withdraw the liquid medium with a syringe. Before we lyse de cells, we need to wash with TE 10 1 (Tris 10uM EDTA 1uM), with pH 8. Vortex, to separate and disintegrate. Again, we centrifuge and remove supernatant. To lyse, we add 400-450 ul TE5020pH8 and SDS 10% and K proteinase. We leave it at 37 degrees for 20 minutes. The medium goes from an opaque color to a light color when lysis happens. We add  ethanol 100% once we have lysed the cells and we vortex. In the presence of ethanol DNA is precipitated, so we add 1ml of ethanol. Then we centrifuge for"

  Chemical detoxifying technique
It could preserve the feed longer by eliminating mycotoxins. However, pig are disgusted by the taste, so the Feed Conversion Rate of the livestock is lower than the ones that do not use this method.
Mycotoxin adsorbents
Silicate minerals, activated charcoal, polymers and chlorophyll products adsorb aflatoxin, so that the toxin would not be absorbed in the intestines. A drawback is that it would also absorb the nutrients that the livestock take in, which means a large amount of feed is required to maintain nutrition for the pigs. Plus, pigs reject the taste so the feed would not be cost-effective.
The advantages of “Aflatoxout”
After pigs take in the Aflatoxout, the yeast will release the enzyme that could degrade aflatoxin. It is a fundamental way to decrease the amount of aflatoxin in the pigs that tackles with the source of the problem. Besides, Aflatoxout is made of yeast so pig would not reject the taste since yeast is already a common ingredient in swine feed. We will be able to lower the costs through synthetic biology methods, effectively producing large amounts of this enzyme.

The Brixells Modeling Tool, has been created to assist Team Warwick to predict the probability of bonding of 3D structures built with E. Coli expressing Zinc fingers and DNA strands. More details are available on the collaborations page.
Conclusion
Modeling can be very useful to optimize the design of P. Putida as it is very sensitive to glucose toxicity. This framework can help in optimizing the lifetime of the glucose-sensing capsule and should be considered in the alginate formulation. This model is to be combined with a population level glucose toxicity model for agent-based modeling in BSim.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#ProjectDiscription_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then appropriate topology candidates for needed function were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish expected bioreporter or bioabsorbent function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. Therefore, We opened up an alternative approach to efficient and robust biosensor and bioabsorbent engineering.
    We analyzed the function and operation of a MerR family TF, MerR into detail via bioware experiments and modeling. We found that the TF expression level in cytosol and the binding affinity between TF and its operator site have great influence on bacterial sensitivity to mercury. Then, rational design of genetic circuits was conducted to confer mercury sensor and regulator components high efficiency and robustness. As is expected, these constructed bioreporters are capable of discriminating mercury concentration ranging from 10^-8 M to 10^-6 M in water, regardless of incubation time and bioreporter activity in a wide window. In other words, there is no necessity to calibrate before detection. This means that the field application of bioreporter can be carried out without costly equipment while fidelity and sensitivity are still conserved.

    Meanwhile, we took a closer look into the structure of MerR family TFs(Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005). The metal binding domain of MerR is a 48-residue, named alpha-helix 5(Guo et al.; Song et al., 2007). A strategy to engineer MerR TF proteins was developed baedsed previous work (Qin et al., 2006; Song et al., 2004). We directly fused two copies of metal binding domain into a single-chain, antiparallel coiled coil, called Metal Binding Peptide ( MBP). And then high-performance bioabsorbent was implemented by expressing MBP on the surface, in periplasm and in cytosol of E.coli, former 2 of which were accomplished by fusion of MBP with special translocation protein, OmpA and DsbA. The following function test results showed that our bacteria can absorb more than 50% of 10-6 mol/L Hg (II) in 2 hours; WHICH IS in consistent with previous work that artificial MBP chain can simulate the in vivo metal-binding ability of dimeric, full-length MerR.

    Additionally, we noticed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domain (Brown et al.,"

Introduction
This summer we were busy introducing synthetic biology and our software to freshmen of our school and high school students as well as other people. We promoted synthetic biology and iGEM mainly by giving lectures, uploading a video and making brochure. The publicity of synthetic biology has a long way to go. And we are on the way.
Lecture
Shenzhen Experimental Senior High
In Sep 25th, we went to Shenzhen Experimental High School to give the students there a lecture, and we answered their interesting questions.
The public course included the history of synthetic biology, and we described it in a simple way for them to understand. Then we talked about the basic idea and knowledge of synthetic biology, and helped them to understand how we can build a new circuit (Link to technical standard 2). After that, we focused on the safety and humanity of this new subject, which is the most important part to let average people accept this mysterious thing. The last part was about iGEM, and this was the most interesting part; those students were very interested about it.
They arose a lot of questions, such as “Why do we need to use E. coli to be the basic part of synthetic biology”, and “Has a project been commercialized”. We answered these questions in detail.
And they showed lots of interests in iGEM high school competition. We gave them our brochures, so the students who didn’t have the chance to take part in the public course could know and learn things about synthetic biology and iGEM.
Shenzhen Senior High School
In Sep 26th, we went to Shenzhen Senior High to give the students there a public course. What is more, we had a communication with their teachers and we finally had a common view of cooperation in synthetic biology in the future.
The public course was just the same as we had in Shenzhen Experimental Senior"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," was contacted to request the plasmid that contains the mutated gene. The conversion step carried out by DszB is the major bottleneck in the 4S pathway and if a strain or sample containing this mutation was obtained, it would significantly bolster our later testing efforts on DBT, as well as other compounds such as thiophane.
Denitrification
This week we reviewed the primers listed in the database and also designed some new ones. Primers for CarAa, CarAc, and CarAd were designed individually, while primers for CarBaBbC and AntABC were designed to encompass multiple genes in a sequence. These primers were designed to be used on Pseudomonas putida which we decided to use as our gene source since it was available to us as opposed to ordering Pseudomonas resinovorans. We also designed a primer for the AmdA gene from Rhodococcus erthyroplois. In addition to ordering these primers we also ordered the nitrogen containing compounds that we will need to test these enzymes on. We decided on using carbazole to make sure the enzymes can perform their natural function as well as pyrrolidine to test them on a similar ring structure. We also ordered cyclohexamine in order to independently test the function of the alternative AmdA pathway. Finally, we decided to eventually order 4-Piperidine butyric acid hydrochloride to test how the enzymes will work on nitrogen containing naphthenic acids. However, we decided since it is a very expensive compound we would wait to make sure the enzyme's work on more simple compounds before ordering it.
We also started our work in the wet lab by plating colonies and making an overnight culture of -80 freezer stock Psuedomonas putida on Thursday. We also resuspended the primers for CarAa, CarAc, CarAd, AntA, AntB, and Ant C that were already in the database. We were able to use the colonies that grew on the streak plates to start a colony PCR to attempt to isolate each of these genes on Friday.
Ring Cleavage
We started looking into more organisms that can carry out cyclohexane degradation and found one called Brachymonas petroleovorans. This organism is capable of both hydroxylating cyclohexane and carrying out cyclohexanol oxidation.   We are also hoping to find evidence that Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pf-5 has genes that can cleave aliphatic rings, however, first we have to determine if Pf-5 can"

2 Objectives
2.1 Improve awareness and understanding of Hearing loss
2.2 Investigate social reality of Hearing loss
2.3 Increase our own social reach and personal values
3 Lab Project
4 References
This year, we designed an audiogenetics system to explore the secret of sound sensing inspired by the status of hearing loss issues all over the world. Our human practice naturally focused on the combination of our lab works and prompting global concern about hearing-impaired people.
We educated people with synthetic biology concepts in a multi-dimensional manner. We also designed and distributed questionnaires and booklets for investigation, propagation, science popularization and call on awareness, which addressed the importance of our project. Through a series of interviews , we harvested many information about hearing loss including policies, medication, research and philanthropy. The knowledge about hearing formation also helped us promote our project.
More importantly, we tried to organize commonwealth activities and cooperate with accessibility App developers to further extend our social impact.
Human practices made us to rethink the relationship between we researchers and the public. Countless people has given us tons of new ideas about our project during our campaigns. We are truly thankful to all the people who supported us with their words and gestures. Without them, this project would have never been what it is like now.
Background
Hearing loss, also known as hearing impairment, is a worldwide problem. There are about 360 million hearing-impaired people around the world, accounting for 5% of the world’s total population. [1] In China, people with hearing impairment take more than 1.67%, ranking at top of the whole disabled groups.
Fig.1 Worldwide hearing loss status Asian hearing-impaired population accounts for a large part of the overall group with hearing loss. The number of people with hearing loss increases by year. [2]
However, after communicating with relatives or friends that suffer or have ever suffered hearing impairment, we found that, although the concerns by the international community are rising, there is still few efficient way to cure such problems.
Though many contributing causes of hearing problems [3"
UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#Formation_-_-_TEXT.html," vitro (4) . This could be carried out thanks to the characterization of the Carboxysome operon, which contains all nine essential proteins for its formation: the two subunits of RuBisCO, large (RbbL) and small (RbbS), the CsoS2 (a protein associated to the shell, necessary for the formation of the BMC), the Carbonic Anhydrase (CosS3), the major constituents of the shell (CsoS1A, CsoS1B and CsoS1B) and the lower constituents (CsoS4A and CsoS4B) (4,5) . Heterologous expression of this type of microcompartment in E.coli produces some important features: first, is that the cell takes a filamentous form. Second, Carboxysomes get evenly distributed across the cell and is possible to see protein aggregates at the ends of the cells (4) .
The formation and assembly of Carboxysomes in the bacterial system is not completely known. Moreover, it is postulated that the assembly is a highly complex process that requires intermolecular interactions between the subunits of RuBisCO and the proteins of the shell, forming a kind of lattice in its early stages of formation (5) . Carboxysome stability and the correct stoichiometry of its parts are also fundamental for a correct assembly (4,5) .
Experimental Design
pHnCBS1D plasmid was cloned and optimized by Bonacci Et al. It is a high copy plasmid that has a size of 13.242 bp, in which the whole Carboxysome operon (7.686 bp) and the coding region of CsoS1D, a protein located outside the operon and that has been reported to aid in the assembly and function of BMC, are located (4) . The operon is under the regulation of an IPTG-inducible promoter from the lactose operon and has a replication origin of the pUC19 plasmid family. It also has resistance to chloramphenicol and the LacI repressor. Our team got this plasmid thanks to the collaboration of David Savage, from California Berkeley University. Since this plasmid is optimized for the heterologous expression of this microcompartment, we decided to use it. The construct of Carboxysome was sent as a BioBrick in the specified format.
Because Carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment of a size close to 10nm (6) , one"

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Sustainability#Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," not everyone has access to a variety of food.
Fermented dishes such as Idli or Dosa are not always eaten because it is the only affordable food (meaning they are not the only food basic for some populations), it is noteworthy to see that when we asked people if they ate this two food and why, they replied they liked the taste, smoothness and their special consistence. This shows that the people we asked had the choice to eat it or not.
Graphic 2: Graphic showing the most eaten ingredients per person.
When asked if they would try our idea of adding vitamin-producing bacteria, most of the people said they would try it, as long as it is harmless for human health and proven efficient. We noticed that a slight change in the making of the recipe was not a concern about the participants; a step such as adding a little cube or powder in the recipe doesn't raise issue, as long as the taste is not modified (around half of the persons said that a change in the taste for the worse would be definitely not accepted).
Conclusion :
The main concerns raised were definitely about safety, either from professionals or from citizens. In our project, we used antibiotic markers and we plan to remove them if the project go on to make it safer for consumption. The use of a microorganisms that will be steamed is also a way of making sure that there is an active sterilization and this is why idli was our first choice for the project. Food grade vector are also a good solution to ensure safety, and we consider using it if it works with our vitamin pathways, and maybe get easily to the clinical trials."
