Fundamental circuit
Once the specific AHL molecule binds on the receptor, the complex will activate its corresponding promoter. At this time, fluorescent protein (reporter) would express. It is a simple input-output circuit.
Two kinds of arrangement of biobricks were made. They truly had difference! It was shown in Result.
Positive feedback
Based on the fundamental one, we involved a positive-feedback loop in this time. A QS receptor gene was added in between the QS promoter and the reporter.
Positive feedback circuit
After activation by AHL, more QS receptor would be produced. According to Le Chatelier's principle with the equation
$$ AHL + receptor -> AHL-receptor complex $$
If we have more receptors (on the left side), more complexes (the right side) will be output. More complex means that the promoter will be activated more completely, leading to stronger fluorescent signal even though AHL are still at low concentration.
The same problem about the position of reporter might exist in this circuit. Again, we let the region under the regulation of QS promoter (contains reporter) either in front of or behind the constitutive-expressing region.
Negative regulation
The purpose of positive feedback design is for higher sensitivity to AHL. But how about the reaction time after turning on the circuit? Transcription and translation are two indispensable steps for producing a fluorescent protein (reporter), yet sometimes the procedure lasts too long. Referring to a paper in 2005, the negative regulation design involves CI gene in the circuit, using a pre-produce mechanism rather than post-produce to reduce reaction time. And still, the positive feedback of QS receptor is reserved in this circuit.
Negative regulation circuit
At normal time, CI promoter (pCI) can be viewed as a constitutive promoter, so fluorescent proteins are continuously produced. When our array detects target AHL molecules, QS promoter is activated, starting produce CI. CI is the repressor of pCI, making the production of fluorescent protein stopped. In this situation, the total signal would slowly weaken since fluorescent proteins are degraded. Besides, bacteria keep on multiplying their population. The denominator (cell number) increases while the numerator (fluorescent protein) doesn’t; as a consequence, the fluorescent signal in a single cell gradually drops.
The negative-regulation circuit has three levels. With similar principle, we assembled them in two ways. One followed the regulative orders, and the other put reporter region foremost.

Future prospects and sustainability of the Project
The project ""supercell"" is a fictional supermarket offering speculative products which are all based on Synthetic Biology. As our aim is to improve public awareness about Synthetic Biology and at the same time foster a debate on how we want to see it manifested in our everyday lives, super cell doesn't end with iGEM Competition 2010. Rather the Jamboree is the starting signal for an intensive presence in public with which we want to guarantee the sustainability of our project. To achieve this three things will be focussed:
1 The webshop ""Super Cell""
The web shop ""Super Cell"" will be available all over the world. People can experience a world in which products that are enabled by synthetic biology belong to our every day life.  In the shop included are products that come from the art context and tend to start a societal discourse, unconvertible today but with a clear biology background that proves that in (far out) future they might become reality. But the shop also highlights products that are based on previous iGEM projects, with already working mechanisms of the synthetic biology. Conceivable is to keep on working on the super cell web shop and to include over the years more and more possible products that come up with the iGEM competition.
2 Exhibitions
As ""Super Cell"" is an art project it will be presented in exhibitions. Enter the synthetic biology supermarket, smell it, touch it, feel it. Buy and change your life.  In the exhibition the already existing and far-out in the future applications are put next to each other – on supermarket shelfs, in walk-in environments and access points to virtual representations. The first exhibition will take place in Weimar, Germany in spring 2011. Starting from the the exhibition will travel to Heidelberg and should be shown afterwards in various places in Germany and all over the world.
3 Presence in Media and the press review
As far as we can say now, media has a great interest in our project. The well known german radio station WDR is producing an feature about ""super cell"", the newspapers ""FAZ"" and ""Die Zeit"", both read in germany nationwide want to report about our project."

Team
The third-ever Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team is composed of four undergraduate students majoring in biology, biochemistry and biomedical engineering. With the help of two mentors, Dr. Joe Jez and Dr. Gautam Dantas, and several graduate students (Brian Landry, Bert Berla, and Larry Page), the team developed and carried out a project of its own devising – namely, the synthesis of the components of saffron in the vector Synechocystis.   This year’s team was assembled at the beginning of the spring semester.  Through weekly Wednesday morning meetings, the team brainstormed ideas with the mentors, eventually forming a concrete plan to be implemented over the summer. With most of the planning done during the semester, the team was free to spend the summer first ironing out the finer details of the project and then implementing the project.

The Video
This year, for the human practices portion of the iGEM competition, the Penn State team developed a video that explains synthetic biology in an understandable way for any general audience. This video is titled “(Re)designing Life” and addresses many topics surrounding the implementation and execution of synthetic biology. These topics include misconceptions generated by misinformation from the general public, the techniques used to perform synthetic biology, ethical issues surrounding genetic engineering research and the future applications of synthetic biology. Through this video, the Penn State team aimed to bridge the gap from the technical jargon used by today’s scientists and the general public understands of common biology. As a result, the misconceptions surrounding these technologies will be eliminated, opening a new relationship between synthetic biologists and the population they wish to improve through research.
Why This Video is Unique
While previous teams have made synthetic biology informational videos for their human practices project, this video differs not in content, but in audience. Most of the previous videos and workshops submitted to iGEM have been directed towards elementary and secondary schools, as well as college students. The Penn State team developed their video with the elderly in mind as the primary audience. The residents of Foxdale Village, a retirement community in State College, PA, were given the opportunity to view the video submitted by the Penn State team. The age range of these residents spanned about 40 years, from 65-104, a demographic previously ignored by the iGEM competition. From this viewing and a short discussion following the video, the residents were able to gain a better understanding of genetically modified organisms and their relation to synthetic biology.
Why the elderly?
In addition to their role as an untapped demographic, the elderly provide an open audience available to give feedback and opinions regarding the synthetic biology video. While the elderly population will have difficulty adding to the ever expanding technology that allows genetic engineering and synthetic biology, this demographic can still have a lasting impact on the scope of the scientific world. The elderly remain active in the political landscape through voting. According to the report summarizing the 2008 presidential election voting patterns, about 20% of all voters were above the age of 65, while only 10% were between 18-24. The latter age group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now…  GMOs are defined as any organism whose genetic"

MODELING
We attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
Overview
We perform deterministic and stochastic mathematical modeling alongside wet lab experiments, and the calculated channel capacity values from models and experimental data fit well with each other. The ability to precisely transmit information is crucial for biological process, which is quantitatively evaluated by channel capacity, a novel concept in information theory. Structure differences of gene regulatory circuits give rise to different capacities and, in turn, different levels of information certainty and reliability. Specifically, although splitting the expressed protein into two halves that can assembly to form dimer provides more flexible functions and other regulatory benefits, it curtails the information capacity compared to expressing the undivided protein. Adding intein sequence to the two parts, however, compensated for the loss of capacity by making the association process irreversible. Simulation results tie in with data measured from synthetic gene regulatory circuits, showing the same conclusions. Furthermore, our models predict several conclusions under conditions we not yet have time to carry out, or even hard to achieve experimentally, and illuminates the way for future research and design.

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge#RNAi_-_-_TEXT.html," predator to ensure it will not take over and proliferate in the ecosystem itself, as well as non-target testing to ensure beneficial species will not be targeted [6]. Testing is initially done in the lab; once there is enough data supporting the efficacy of the predator, field tests are done. Field tests give a better representation of what to expect post-release. Upon government approval, the predator is released into the ecosystem. Potential downfalls of biological pest control include predatory species becoming an alpha predator in the food chain, or becoming an invasive species itself [7].
Mechanical Pest Control
Mechanical pest control involves the use of physical means to control pests. Some examples of mechanical pest control methods include insect traps, physical barriers, or weed pulling. These control mechanisms are advantageous in terms of minimizing off-target effects, and are generally environmentally friendly. However, these methods can be laborious and are often not feasible for implementation on commercial crops. Recent research has aimed to decrease the amount of labor required to pull weeds from commercial crops by using computer vision-guided machines [8]. Initial results with computer guided machines has shown promising results, producing weed reductions in the range of 62-87%. However, this research requires more development in order to be mainstream in commercial agriculture.
Crop Rotation
Crop rotation is an agricultural method in which different species of crops are grown in the same area of land to promote nutrient renewal within the soil. In addition, crop rotation aids in crop yield, soil quality, and controls the build-up of weeds, pests, and other diseases that might be specific to the crop. However, crop rotation can limit the variety of crops a farmer is able to grow in their field due to specific rotation patterns. Each season, these crops need to be monitored in order to control the likelihood of diseases being carried over to the next crop. This may be limiting for farmers because of the constraints associated with which crops they are able to plant and at what time they can be planted. In addition, certain crops require specific machinery which may be expensive for farmers [9].
An example of an important crop produced throughout the world is canola. It is used to make canola oil which is a key ingredient in many foods, cosmetics, and biodiesels. When canola crops are rotated with barley, oats, or wheat, the lowest number of diseases carry over from the previous crop which in turn increases yields of the canola crop. Most other crops such as corn, flax, potato, and sunflower require wait times of up to three years before they can be planted to prevent a buildup of diseases common to both the respective plant and canola ["

Then, this vector was linearized and transformed by electroporation. And it was plated on agar with or without IPTG. Also, overnight cultures of transformants in both LB liquid media w/IPTG and w/o IPTG was left overnight. And as theoretically expected, we saw that bacteria lived and reproduced in media which contain IPTG, while they cannot reproduce in media which do not contain IPTG in both liquid and solid media.

CHARACTERIZATION OF PROMOTERS
We have done the characterization of three promoters as models. RFP genes were transcribed using these promoters and the amount of RFP molecules were modeled by considering their brightness. The results are as follows:
1- K606040: Promoter Hyperspank B. subtilis & E. coli (iGEM11_Paris_Bettencourt)
We simulated the production of RFP under two different IPTG concentrations to observe its basal and maximum transcription rates.
As seen in the graph, when there is no IPTG with the increasing LacI expression, the RFP amount becomes constant and this means there is no more production of RFP.
 
 
 
 
 
As seen in this graph, with 5000 IPTG molecules, LacIs form complexes with IPTG. Therefore there is decreased inhibition on K606040 and RFP production continues and the amount keeps getting higher.
2- K823003 Pveg (iGEM12_LMU-Munich)
 
We did alignment by using CLUSTAL W between two Pveg promoters; K143012 and K823003. The result is as follows:
K823003 sequence has 237 bp and K143012 sequence has 97 bp as seen in the figure. We can conclude that K823003 includes K143012. After BLASTing the remaining part of the K823003 which is not same as K143012 there were no results for specific sequences for polimerase, activator and inhibator binding. This shows K823003 has alike promoter strength as K143012. Only the primers were desinged further from the main promoter region. So for this promoter we can use the promoter strength of the K143012.

Autonomous cell reporter system for non-invasive real-time blood diagnosis
People around the world are growing awareness to their health condition. To monitor the health condition, a wide range of biomarkers-- special substances in the bloodstream representing the physiological and pathological states-- has been used in clinical   diagnoses1. Blood test is one of the most common way for detecting biomarkers but it suffers from several inevitable drawbacks such as invasiveness, time-consuming procedure, demand for medical staff service, non real-time tracking and so on. These   disadvantages may discourage people from the periodic medical checkup. Indeed, according to a survey (of 1862 samples) pulled by our team, nearly half of the participants took blood test less than once a five-year frequency (Fig. 1), which is impractical   for early detection and early treatment of diseases. In terms of non-invasive real-time health monitoring, great varieties of wearable devices and smartwatches, working as personal daily fitness trackers, have been developed. The global market of wearable   medical devices is estimated to reach $35 billion USD soon. However, most of the current devices are only capable of measuring heart rate, steps taken, calories, quality of sleep and a few other personal metrics. These limited diagnosis information   provided by current devices cannot precisely represent the physiological states relating to many diseases. To address this long-standing worldwide issue, we aim to develop a new tool, a non-invasive or minimally-invasive real-time tracking system for   the level of specific biomarkers in bloodstream.
To achieve the goal, our team proposed Biowatcher, comprising of a bioluminescence-detecting watch (Biowatch) and most importantly engineered reporter cells that enable detection and autonomous report of the level of almost all kinds of biomarkers in   bloodstream. The sensing parts of the reporter cells are powered by nanobodies, the single-domain antibody that can be engineered to detect different biomarkers2. Binding of biomarkers on nanobodies triggers our synthetic gene circuits and in turn induces   autonomous bioluminescent system3 as a readout for wearable devices to detect. Our real-time bioluminescence-detecting watch, Biowatch, will track the level of risk factors by measuring the bioluminescence intensity and record the data as numbers and   graphs. It will send alert to users once the level of the risk factors is too high. Meanwhile, there will be suggestions of nearby hospitals according to the users’ location. The system will also upload and attribute the data to public"

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have one of the highest cancer mortality rates in Canada due to difficulties in tumour diagnosis and treatment1. Common anti-cancer therapies used today can lack specificity and have off-target effects, damaging the body in the process2. Our goal is to develop the foundation for a novel form of GI cancer immunotherapy that exploits commensal gut bacteria to specifically target GI tumour cells for destruction by the immune system. Our bacteria of choice is Lactobacillus brevis, which has been designed to bind and aggregate towards Her2+ GI tumours through the use of a cell-wall anchored, anti-Her2 DARPin. Like antibodies, DARPins constitute high-specificity interactions that have the potential to mitigate many off-target effects3. With sufficient bacterial density, a quorum sensing mechanism (Lux and Las) triggers the production of a vital T cell activating cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), to recruit tumour-specific T cells for an anti-cancer response. Future steps will include simulations of the bacteria in a possible tumour environment, which will help drive quorum-sensing design (e.g. promoter sensitivity).
Ethical concerns were addressed through research into the feasibility of such a treatment, particularly into methods to minimize health risks, make the treatment financially accessible, and abide relevant legislation.

Thus far, our project has developed a successful PCR amplification protocol for both the Lux and Las quorum sensing systems. Both parts were de novo synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies via funding from iGEM. Future experimentation will serve to validate the function of these two quorum sensing systems through the concomitant expression of the mCherry red fluorescent protein (BBa_J06504) upon activation of the quorum sensing pathway.

The most important is that we want to have a preview of the behavior of the three circuits mentioned above. Thus, we can compare them and prove that our final design can attract bacteria efficiently and send out the information of atrazine to bacteria around these regions to make their movement more valuable rather than walking aimless.
Results
These three models were all coded in MATLAB (all can be download here ). As mentioned above, we have just changed several statements in the second model to construct the first and the third. Finally, we have got how the distribution of bacteria changed with time, which can make us catch the major difference among three circuits more directly.
Then, we have made census of the number of bacteria within the atrazine region in different circuits respectively. Finally, we have considered the randomness of their movement. We have introduced the Markov chain into the model. We have also counted out the effective aggregation rate, which will dem-onstrate the value of the movement.

Let's see the characteristics of each circuit respectively first. Bacteria with circuit 1 move randomly all the time, so thay can aggregate much faster than other two. The results of bacteria with circuit 2, meeting our expectation, demonstrate the dull response of the complex circuit. As to circuit 3, this kind of bacteria gets together in the region of much atrazine gradually.
Circuit 1 is the classical design, which is proved by so many researchers to have a good result of attracting bacteria.
Compared to circuit 1, circuit 2 need too much time to respond.
Circuit 3 has speed up the respond time of circuit 2. Besides, circuit 3 can attract the bacteria around the atrazine step by step as circuit 2.

Batch Purification
A new method of protein purification is discovered when searching online databases. Compared to gravity filtration through a nickel charged column, the advantages of this new method become apparent. Specifically, this method drastically decreases the amount of time needed to purify proteins, and allows for more homogenous mixing of sample with reagents added (binding, wash, and elution buffers). Batch purification shares the same general idea as column chromatography. Instead of a column, Histidine resin is placed in a Falcon tube and centrifugation is used to mix and separate contaminant proteins from our Tamura proteins. Instead of collecting what drips through the column as our fractions, after centrifugation, the supernatant is decanted from the tube and collected as fractions.
RESULTS
Our first attempt at batch purification appeared to be successful. After adding elution buffer (250 mM imidazole), we intended to take this supernatant (Fraction 5) and give it the members on the Materials Processing team to try to combine with recombinant silk to co-spin out silk fibers. However, Fraction 5 appeared to have a significant amount of precipitation and coagulation, mostly likely resulting from resin and excess protein residues. Fraction 5 also contained a great deal of thin, stringy white fibers, suggesting that our silk had ""crashed out"" and no longer solvated in Lysis buffer. Fraction 4, in comparison, was less cloudy, less precipitation and coagulation, and more transparent, indicating better solubility in buffer. Therefore, Fraction 4 was delivered to the members on the Materials Processing Team to do a preliminary co-spin with recombinant silk. Refer to Materials Processing, July 9 notebook entry to see images results! Overall, when checked under a UV box and a florescent microscope, our silk glowed green. The silk we extruded with the aid of a sy"

HAFS,2018,Team:HAFS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," and blood pressure. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin, and Type 2 may require insulin and/or other medications. One such group of medications are called sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas are used to treat Type 2 diabetes as they bypass the normal glucose-sensing mechanism to initiate insulin secretion. As a result, blood-glucose levels lower and the risk of secondary complications decreases. Unfortunately, prolonged treatment eventually exausts the insulin-producing beta-cells leading to a loss of blood sugar regulation. The mechanism by which chronic sulfonylurea treatment affects beta-cells is poorly understood.
    In their article, Remedi and Nichols injected slow-release pellets with a type of sulfonylurea called glibenclamide into mice. They then monitored the mice’s blood sugar levels. They found that the mice progressively developed diabetes and were unable to secrete insulin. After the drug was washed out, insulin levels rebounded. This study may seem simple, but it tells us that sulfonylureas do not cause irreversible damage or beta-cell death, and exhausted beta-cells can recover to produce insulin again. This study also utilized normal mice rather than genetically-modified mice, which alleviated concerns about potential defects in pancreas development in mutant mice. Future work should address the precise mechanism of reversible suppression of insulin secretion by sulfonylurea treatment.

Worst Gel electrophoresis Scrapbook
    In the entire course of iGEM, gel electrophoresis was one of the experiment that we dreaded the most. Gel electrophoresis did not only confirmed that our pcr, miniprep, and cloning was successfuly, but also often confirmed the very opposite: our failures for everything. As a team leader, I was always harrowed by nightmares the day before conducting gel electrophoresis and roll in bed the night after enzyme cutting. In fact, we do have heaps of photos that showcase epic FAILURES of gel electrophoresis.
Yes, we've been there. And Many times.
    From the same spirit, UNebraska-Lincoln coordinated a collaboration project named ""Worst Gel Electrophoresis Scrapbook"" and asked for iGEM teams to share the photos of some of their failed electrophoresis results. Being an expert at failing, we couldn't help but to participate. In fact, we had so many photos that we ended up sending two photos!

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

E. Chrono
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in Escherichia coli to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.
The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals:
Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design.
Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices.
Fabricate and test microfluidic designs.
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.

FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"Take Zika for instance, it is spread mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes species female mosquito (Ae. Aegyptus and Ae. Albopictus). These mosquitoes bite human and animals during the day and night.  Mother-baby transmission, sex and blood can also transmit the Zika virus. According to the latest Zika situation report of WHO, since 2015, mosquito-borne Zika virus infections have been evidenced in 73 countries or territories including 56 areas have ever occurred outbreak as Figure0. And all the continents have reported infection cases. There is no need to emphasize the damage of Zika virus because the news about damage has been known around the world by media reporters.
Recently, America and Brazil have agreed to strengthen cooperation on research of Zika vaccine. But actually, it takes a long time for the drug development. Therefore, the best way to reduce the spread of Zika is to kill the vector mosquitoes. In addition, CDC (Center for Diseases Control and Prevention) suggests that we can
(1) use EPA (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered insect repellent
(2) wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants
(3) stay in places with air conditioning or window and door screens
(4) remove standing water around your home,
(5) as for pregnant women, they should avoid travelling to epidemic areas.
 
Figure0: Countries, territories and areas showing the distribution of Zika virus,2013-2016
Dengue is the most epidemic virus in the tropics and subtropics area. Dengue is now epidemic around over 100 countries including Africa, America, Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific areas. One research estimated that about 3.9 billion people may be infected with dengue fever yearly and 96 million people included may have serious or mild clinical symptoms. Actually, dengue can infect not only babies, children but also adults, but cannot lead to death commonly. Undoubtedly, the most effective protective measures are those can avoid mosquito bites. The best way to reduce mosquitoes is to eliminate the places where the mosquitoes lays their eggs, like artificial containers that hold water  in and around the house. Outdoors,containers like pet and animal watering containers, flower planter dishes should be cleaned frenquently or cover water storage barrels.  also,it is necessary to look for standing water indoors such as in vases with fresh flowers and clean at least once a week.

Custom Display System
Problem
The underlying design of the streptavidin display constructs in the registry has the displayed protein bound close to the cell membrane. This constraint could be preventing streptavidin on the surface of the cell from forming tetramers lowering its effectiveness at binding biotin. Furthermore these existing display systems prevent the addition of another protein into them, preventing the user from displaying other proteins.
Idea
The first goal of making a new display vector was to incorporate a GS linker between the displayed protein and the OmpA protein anchoring in in the cell wall. However when reviewing the construct we decided to add some other useful features as well. Maintaining the Lpp tag (to direct the protein to the periplasm) and the OmpA trans-membrane regions (for anchoring the construct) of the original 2006 parts we added:
GS Linker (Gly4Ser)4 - allowing for more space between the protein and the cell wall
TEV  - Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease site allowing for cleavage of displayed proteins
NheI restriction site - allowing for the insert of any BioBrick protein into the display construct
Current Status
Custom Display Vector:
1 trans-membrane OmpA: BBa_K215200
5 trans-membrane OmpA: BBa_K215201
We submitted the Custom Display Vector to the registry as BBa_K215200 and BBa_K215201 (for 1 and 5 trans-membrane OmpA).  We are currently inserting GFP into the display system to verify that the OmpA display system is working, but we will not have any data by the jamboree.
Custom Display Vector with wild-type monomeric streptavidin inserted:
1 trans-membrane OmpA: BBa_K215210 (equivalent to 2006 Harvard iGEM: BBa_J36848 with an extra linker between OmpA and the streptavidin)

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description-backup_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.
DspB ( BBa_K1659200 ) is an enzyme produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a species of bacteria found in the human oral cavity that grows almost exclusively in the form of biofilms. Structural analysis of Dispersin B showed that the enzyme only works specifically against the β-1,6-glycosidic linkages found in poly-N-acetylglucosamine, which is a polysaccharide structural element found in the biofilms of E. coli but not in P. aeruginosa. An additional enzyme would need to be used to target the polysaccharide component of P. aeruginosa biofilms.
Micrococcal DNase ( BBa_K1659300 ) is an endo-exonuclease that non-specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of single- and double-stranded DNA under basic conditions and in the presence of Ca2+ ions, and is known to be able to speed up DNA hydrolysis by up to 1016 times [ 17 ]. We are using DNase to break down the extracellular DNA component of biofilms.
Killing the Bacteria
Although antibiotic resistance is not absolute, it does pose a very big threat to the effective treatment of many infections. The insensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics can also be attributed to increasing antibiotic resistance. As described above, antibiotics also have many side effects that reduce patient quality of life and decrease the likelihood of completing a course of antibiotics. With all of this in mind, our solution does not only break down the biofilm, but also kills the bacteria embedded within so as to provide an alternative to antibiotics.
Art-175
Art-175 ( BBa_K1659000 ) derive their name from “artificial endolysins”. Endolysins are bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases that pass through the cytoplasmic membrane, degrading the peptidoglycan layer and inducing the lysis of the infected cell.
MccS
MccS ( BBa_K1659100 ) is a type of microcin, a subclass of antibacterial proteins known as bacteriocins. Microcins are small, enterobacteria-produced bacteriocins that exert antibacterial activity against closely-related species, and MccS is produced by E. coli present in the probiotic drug Symbioflor 2 that has been shown"
Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," one hand, we consider nature as fragile and in need of protection whereas on the other hand we see it as strong enough to provide all the resources we need to survive.
In the previous decades or centuries, our vision of nature was more pragmatic and focused on the fulfilling of our needs. Today we tend to “mummify” it in order to preserve it. This change in attitude brought along a defiance towards everything that aims at modifying nature.
Modifying living organisms:
Numerous products synthesized through the modification of microorganisms (reprogrammed bacteria…) are currently of great significance. For example they can be used to synthesize drugs, or produce biofuels…
Modifications can appear on organisms without the intervention of human beings. Microorganisms actually possess diverse means enabling them to evolve in order to adapt to new environments. Among these, we can name horizontal transfer, a phenomenon that happens between bacteria from different lines, from the same species or not. This way, the bacteria that receive the genes develop new characteristics such as resistance to an antibiotic.
These mutations appearing without the intervention of man are accepted by society because they are considered as natural. Synthetic biology reproduces this mechanism while reducing the time normally required for it to appear.
Can we put a patent on life?
Another ethical issue that was raised by the concept of modifying living organisms was that of intellectual property. If patenting an organism were possible, it would lead us back to the perception of life as a machine, or a chemical factory, with no sense of wonder or admiration. GMOs are new creations in that a genetic modification gives a new strain, but this strain has been obtained from organisms coming from nature. Thus it does not seem moral to reduce life to a trading object.
However, patents on living beings do not patent the organism in itself, rather a specific technique or modification. Therefore the patent does not grant a property right on the biological material.
Does having the power to act on DNA and thus to modify the characteristics of a microorganism change our relationship to nature? Working with living organisms induces all kinds of emotions, be it wonder, curiosity or even fear. Contrarily to what one could think, feeling fear as a scientist is essential and should not be overlooked since this is what makes us be more cautious and take a step back to study the implications of our work.
Ethical considerations about our project:
Bees have an essential role as pollinators, that’s why their preservation is a major social and environmental concern.
One might ask if the importance we give to protecting bees does not have its roots in anthropocentrism since bees produce honey, wax and propolis"

An LED panel with an emission wavelength of 470 nm was aimed at the incubator, providing an irradiance of 110 µW/cm2. These are saturating conditions, ensuring the maximum possible response from the promoter systems. The cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C. They were subsequently diluted into new tubes of LB (two for each system, OD600 = 0.004). One tube for each system was covered in a coat of aluminum foil, blocking all incoming light. The new cultures were then placed in the illuminated incubator and grown for 17 hours. The OD600 and fluorescence (excitation: 576 nm, emission: 601 nm) were measured in a 96-well cell culture black microplate.

BBa_R0082 Experience: (together with BBa_R0083 and BBa_R0084)
Both PCR and Extraction of plasmids suggest a correct size of those 3 promoters once, but we failed to get the available and reliable sequencing report since the seeds seem to be unstable and the size of them is too small.
Division Inhibition
The antisense FtsZ, protected by hair-pin structure and termed TBY or BBa_897720, is regulated by T7 promoter and regarded as the core part of our project. The antisense FtsZ sequence mainly aims at silenting the FtsZ gene and control the self-renewal and differentiation of E.coli. Since the antisense FtsZ gene in BBa_897720 is regulated by the T7 promoter that is specifically combined with T7 RNA polymerase, a endogenous protein in BL21(DE3) strain under the control of the lac UV5 promoter inducible by IPTG, the number of colonies is expected to decrease with the an increase in IPTG. The confirmatory experiment below verifys the validity of TBY and our hypothesis.
After integrating the plasmid with an insert of BBa_897720 into BL21(DE3) strain, we cultivated those bacteria on the surface of solid LB medium in 4 dfferent IPTG levels. The conditions was strictly controlled at the temperature of 37 ℃ and it last for 10 hours.  The controls aims to rule out the possibility of damaged to the bacteria from IPTG. Details are illustrated below:

TBY  *0.1

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," loop structure forces the system to converge to a lower steady state. We used an explicit Tau-leaping method (Cao et al., 2006) to perform the stochastic simulation here instead of the classical stochastic simulation algorithm, since the high reaction rates made the classical algorithm ineffecient. The stochastic simulation result reveals that there is a weak oscillation in the negative feedback loop stage. And we ascribed this phenomenon to the delay of gene expression and noise in the systems. The steady states we predicted were consistent with our qualitative and quantitative results from wet lab (Fig. 9).

The small picture is our experiment result. The two bottom pictures are the qualitative results from the fluorescence microscope.

●
The liquid cultures were spun down and VP showed color in culture, but the colony PCR gel we ran yesterday did not show a band at the correct length of ~1200 base pairs so we are re doing the colony PCR today and running another gel to see if the correct insert is amplified and if its not then something probably went wrong with the Gibson assembly
●
The plates from the 4 chromoprotein-CBD-His-tag began to show color and so we used these colonies to re do the colony PCR and liquid cultures
●
If this gel shows the correct amplification we will send the PCR in for sequencing.
●
The gel showed bands at the correct length ~1200 base pairs but also many other bands at different lengths and the primary band was at ~300 base pairs. This means we have some of the correct product getting amplified but also other things as well. We will send in for sequencing and see if this helps reveal what is going on
●
We concentrated our 4 purified chromoproteins (TP, VP, CP, PP) by using centrifugal filter units and spinning at max speed for 10 minutes, discarding the flow through, and then flipping the unit over and spinning at 3.8 rpm for 3 minutes
●
We began heat testing on the 4 concentrated chromoproteins
●
First we pipetted 3 ul of the concentrated protein onto a sheet of cellulose paper with wax wells printed on it. After it dried we pipetted another 3 ul into the same well. Once it was dry for the second time we put it into the oven that was pre heated to 55 °C. CP, VP, and TP lost their color at this temperature but after 2 minutes PP still has some of its color so the temperature was raised to 60 °C. It took 1.5 minutes for the over to heat up to this temperature and by the time it got up to 60 °C PP has lost its color. We then took the chromoproteins out of the oven and let them sit on the bench. After sitting for 3 minutes they had regained none of their color, but when rehydrated with 1 ul of milliQ water they regained their color. These chromoproteins were then heated again but instead at 40 °C for one minute. No color change was observed and so the temperature was raise to 45 °C and CP, TP, and VP lost their color in between these temperatures around "
Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Modeling#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"3 (blue), although it appears as though expression of S3 is limited by this.
Circuit (lack of) Reset
In the original design of our circuit, we had hoped to create a resettable circuit. We speculated that the circuit would become stuck in the ultimate and penultimate states. Unsure of the activity of our circuit beyond the fourth state, we turned to our model. Simulating a cell with multiple light and dark phases, we observed the following, which validated our earlier thoughts that the circuit would be 'stuck' in states 3 and 4 and would only enter the first two states once.
Speculations
In order to obtain a fully functional circuit, our mathematical model implies we must pay attention to several details:
We should utilize directed evolution, placing the Mnt-repressable promoter behind a kill cassette, and select over several generations for increased repression. This would solve our state disorder problem. Alternatively, we could allow state 4 to 'be' state 3, although this would require more modeling and physical experimentation to ensure robustness.
We should introduce a reset feature; this could be accomplished through the addition of a CI434 gene to state 4.
We should (ideally) generate parameters for our system with our own experimental data to ensure its accuracy.
We should model our system with a stochastic method to ensure both mathematical systems exhibit the same behavior, the we could be more confident in the robustness of our system.

E. coli that glows in paucity of phosphate - at a glance
A. E. coli engineered with BBa_K1682013 or BBa_K1682015 functions as a phosphate biosensor. High concentrations of phosphate indirectly represses PphoA and PphoBR and decreases the expression of GFP.
B. The phosphate sensing promoters BBa_K1682013 and BBa_K1682015 can both detect a gradient of phosphate concentrations. Its activities at 0 and 250 μM were reported in Relative Fluorescence Level (a.u.).
Phosphate associate with essential growth factors for plant root development as well as seed production.
We improved on PphoA, PphoBR. The data provided dynamic range of these promoters.
PphoA , PphoBR and our engineered phosphate sensor BBa_K1682013 and BBa_K1682015 - the full story
Phosphorus is an essential plant macronutrient as it associates with various growth factors for plant root development as well as seed production. Deficiency in phosphorus will result in stunted plant growth. Our aim is to engineer a phosphate sensor in Escherichia coli and detect phosphate level in soil. To this end, we obtained different sequences for PphoA or PphoBR and fused it with gfp (gfpmut3b). The promoters are activated under low phosphate condition, so green fluorescence will be produced to show phosphate level in soil.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html,"Nanowires From G. sulfurreducens Have Higher Electrical Conductivity Than E. coli
Even though we could not accomplish implementation of nanowires in E. coli, nor optimise the nanowires in G. sulfurreducens, we still found it relevant to test the G. sulfurreducens wild type nanowire efficiency, against previously used methods for extracellular electron transfer in MFCs in the iGEM competition. For that reason, we tested the electrical conductivity of G. sulfurreducens PCA wild type against E. coli ER25663127 containing OprF , a membrane protein, which helps carrying electrons to an extracellular electron shuttle in form of methylene blue.
Figure 28. Single chamber, three electrode systems were used for measuring the electrochemical current generation. The measurements were done with an electrode potential at -0.2V(vs. Ag/AgCl KCl sat.). Starting from the left: E.coli with OprF , E.coli wild type, and then G. sulfurreducens wild type.
The results achieved from this experiment is shown in Figure 29, which shows that by using nanowires as the electron carrier, it is possible to tremendously increase the electrical current compared to the extracellular electron shuttle used previously. As seen for the E. coli wild type, the current decreases over time, which indicates no activity. E. coli containing the membrane porin OprF shows a rapid increase, followed by a gradual decrease over 6-8 hours. The current of E. coli remains low, while G. sulfurreducens' current starts increasing after 20 hours, unfortunately the experiment had to stop due to time constraints.
Figure 29. Illustration of the microbial current generated from G. sulfurreducens wild type, E. coli ER25663127 wild type, and E. coli ER25663127 containing OprF . The measurements was done with an electrode potential of -0.2V (vs. Ag/AgCl KCl sat.). Ten minutes before the measurements, IPTG and methylene blue were added to the E. coli containing chambers to achieve concentrations at respectively 1mM and 0.1mM. Acetate was added as electron donor to achieve a concentration of 10 mM to the G. sulfurreducens ten minutes before the measurements.
This shows that the electrical current is limited by time for the E.coli with OprF , which Bielefeld also concluded. They measured the voltage over time, and their results showed that it reached the maximum after 30 mins."

New part-Target
Introduction
This part aims to simulate the circuit of the Target part, which will be turn on when S. mutans is too much or phage is unable to control the S. mutans quorum.
LuxI coding sequence is controlled by nlmC promoter and threshold terminator. When the quorum of S. mutans is too much, the LuxI will be expressed and generate AHL-synthase. LuxR, on the other hand, is generated by E. coli constitutively. The LuxR and AHL can form a complex that can activate the pLuxR promoter. In our design, pLuxR promoter in E. coli can activate the lysine protein that can kill S. mutans only.
We model this part to see how the circuit works if phage is unable to control the S. mutans quorum, so the initial state of comE, the molecule that triggers the nlmC promoter, has a certain amount, which means the S. mutans is out of control.
System
(1)
Circuit triggered by nlmC promoter. When S. mutans quorum is out of control, the amount of comE will increase and offset the effect of threshold terminator. luxI will be expressed. $$\frac{d[\text{luxI mRNA}]}{dt}=P_{nlmC} \frac{[\text{comE}]^{n1}}{K_{d1}+[\text{comE}]^{n1}} (1-a)^x - K_{deg\_mluxI} [\text{luxI mRNA}]$$          $$\frac{d[\text{luxI}]}{dt}= K_{t1} [\text{luxI mRNA}] - K_{deg\_luxI} [\text{luxI}]$$ 1.  $P_{nlmC}$:max nlm"

Achievements
Our iGEM project is the result of seven months of team effort. Every member of our team has different qualities, which lead to division of the tasks. After finishing different subjects everything was discussed plenary, so everybody's point of view was integrated. We decided to do as much as possible with the team and minimally rely help from non-members of the team. The research that we conducted was based on previous findings of the Molecular Microbial Physiology Lab. In the table below the different subject are displayed with the members who were responsible for this and at the bottom of the page are some people we want to thank.

Only the inducible UV light promoter (BBa_I765001) had no colonies (as well as the negative controls).  Liquid culture plasmid preps were done on the plates that grew.  In attempt to make more GFP+Term composite parts which we will need to combine with the various RBS and promoter parts, I did a restriction digest, gel electrophoresis, and gel extraction.   It will be ligated later today and then transformed along with our new parts tomorrow.
WEEK 3: 6/20-6/24/2011
6/20: This morning I set up the QIAcube to do minipreps of the liquid plasmid cultures of our transformed reporters (RFP BBa_E1010, EYFP BBa_E0032, ECFP BBa_0020, BFP BBa_K156010) and composite parts (GFPc BBa_E0240 and YFPc BBa_E0430) as well as a promoter (BBa_R2000) chosen for the composite parts.  The DNA quantification was good, with most numbers around 30-50 ng/ul.  In anticipation of needing more promoter and RBS plasmid DNA for our constructs, I used the transformation plates from 6/15/11 to make liquid plasmid preps.  The rest of the afternoon was spent planning for our BU iGEM meeting and what we would present as a wet lab team.
6/21:  This morning I prepared minipreps of the promoter and RBS liquid cultures from yesterday for the QIAcube to run.  Today was our BU iGEM wet and dry lab meeting.  As our first one, it involved an overall presentation on what has been happening in each of the teams.  As a wet lab team, our presentation was more group as a lot of what we had done, everyone had been apart of.  We discussed our initial contamination problems, the parts that we have chosen, and our current success.  Also we developed a timeline of events:

For this reason, the iGEM HQ offers various opportunities to obtain information like the safety policies, safe lab work guidelines or the white list of allowed organisms. Further, many teams are working on the development of multilateral biosafety systems to prevent the release or at least the survival of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the environment. With the intention to summarize all relevant levels of biosafety systems, we worked on our biosafety review article: Auxotrophy to Xeno-DNA: An Exploration of Combinatorial Mechanisms for a High-Fidelity Biosafety System for Synthetic Biology Applications. Biosafety can begin on different levels, starting from a bioreactor to a complete synthetic DNA. In our review, we describe different containment approaches previously attempted by former iGEM teams.   As the report is currently under peer review, it cannot be printed here. Instead, we composed a shortened version of its content, which can be accessed here .
Online Ethics Discussion – iGEM Uppsala Team 2017
In August the iGEM team 2017 of Uppsala hosted the “Online Ethics Discussion” separated into the three debated: “Genetic Engineering”, “Social Responsibility”, and “Intellectual Propery Rights”. Our team members Christopher and Olga participated in the Social Responsibility discussion on the 15th of August. Together with the iGEM teams DTU Denmark , Wageningen , Technion Israel and Grenoble-Alpes we talked about three topics. The first topic dealt with reporting our project accurately and responsibly in media and informing the public about the science we are doing. The second topic asked about our particular niche insofar as to whom we want to report to, either other iGEM teams, journalists or the general public. The third topic dealt with how we want to convey our project to reach our particular niche using specific media or language while talking about our project.  First the teams introduced their projects to give the other teams a broad overview about their work. After that every team got an aliquoted amount of time to give their opinion about the topics. At the end the teams could ask each other questions to further understand the points made. The whole discussion can be viewed here .  We thank iGEM team Uppsala for the interesting discussion topics and we thank the other participating iGEM teams for their point of views. It was really fruitful talking with you.

Sample 2 - Negative control, USER mix + 7 uL water
USER reaction was performed in PCR machine with programm: 37C for 40 min and then 25C for 30 min.
To 100uL of chemically competent E. coli cells 10 uL of USER mix after USER reaction was added.
Incubation of cells on ice for 30 minutes, heat shock at 42C for 90 sec. and 5 min on ice. Addition of SOC medium and 2 hours of incubation at 37C. Plating on plates with LB medium with Kanamycin, overnight incubation at 37C.
Colony PCR to extract the Nir operon directly with USER-primers
We had to try to extract the Nir operon with USER-primers directly because we could not get anything useful with the Nir-template that we made with the flanking non-uracil containing primers.
Conclusion
We have USER fragments for RFP and AraBAD which was verified with the first gel but Nir operon is another story. The Nir primers seems to make lots of unspecific products. We tried to do the colony PCR with the USER primers directly and this gave fragments longer than expected but not with unspecific product though. We will try and transform this fragment into E.coli and see what will happen and then we will send the construct to sequencing so that we can see whats causing the elongation of the fragment.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#InterLab Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," maximum accuracy. Once set up, the plate was incubated at specified temperatures in a plate reader with double orbital shaking, taking readings every 10 min for 24 h.
Temperature
Growth in Test 2 was affected differently in LB and SOC (Fig 3). In LB, there appears to be a slight increase in max OD reached as temperature increases, however at an alkaline pH the device appears unable to grow well in higher temperatures. In SOC, there is no distinct pattern in how temperature affects growth, however it is clear that the bacteria grows better as pH is increased, suggesting pH and temperature have a combined effect.
Figure 3 Max OD reached by Test 2 in (A) LB and (B) SOC media over 24 h at 31C, 37C and 43C.
Fluorescence levels were affected differently at different pH levels as temperature was increased (Figure 4). 37C appears to be optimum temperature for both media, as there are decreases between 37C and 43C at all pH levels apart from pH 7.20 in LB media. However, we can see a dramatic increase in overall max fluorescence levels in both LB and SOC when pH is increased to an alkaline level.
Figure 4 Max fluorescence reached by Test 2 in (A) LB and (B) SOC media over 24 h at 31C, 37C and 43C.
pH
Growth was affected significantly by changes in pH, which can be seen in figure 3. In SOC media, a distinct increase is seen in max OD as pH increases. In LB media the opposite is seen, where as pH increases, max growth decreases (figure 6).
Figure 5 Max OD reached by (A) Test 6, (B) Test 5 and (C) Test 2 in SOC media over 24 h at 31C, 37C and 43C.
Figure 6 Max OD reached by Test 5 in LB media over 24 h
Fluorescence was affected by pH particularly in SOC where an increase was seen with an increase in pH; In LB there was little change in fluorescence until an alkaline pH was reached at 43C, where there was a substantial decrease (figure 7).
Figure 7 Max FL reached by Test 2 in (A) SOC and (B) LB media over 24 h
Overall, it is clear pH and temperature have an impact on the growth and fluorescence of the devices, and this raises the importance of maintaining conditions specified in InterLab instructions. It is"
Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Schistosoma_-_-_TEXT.html," However these conditions, like cercarial dermatitis often go unnoticed in endemic areas.
Once inside the human body, the cercaria travel through the blood via the lungs into the portal vein of the liver where they develop into schistosomulae. After a maturation period one to one and a half month after which they mate. The way Schistosoma have evolved to mate is unique amongst the trematodes in that there is a significant sexual dimorphism, which also inspired their name which translates from Greek to 'split body'. This name describes the male anatomy as there is a long groove, called gynecophoral canal, along its body in which the female is held.
Adult males are between 10 to 15 mm long whereas females are longer, between 16 to 22mm, and thinner. Both sexes have two suckers – one on each end – to hold onto the walls of blood vessels where they feed on blood and globulins through anaerobic glycolysis. The debris is regurgitated in the host’s blood. After mating they migrate to their perivesicular (S. haematobium) or mesenteric (other species) destination where the female releases her eggs. With an average life span of 3 to 5 years, although up to 30 years is possible, The theoretical reproduction potential of one schistosome pair is up to 600 billion schistosomes (Gryseels et al. 2006) .
Pictures of Schistosoma. Top: Electron microscopy of Schistosoma couple Link . Bottom: Artistic impression of schistosome parasite in blood vessel Link .
The eggs themselves secrete proteolytic enzymes that allow the eggs to reach their destination: the bladder (S. Haematobium) or intestines (other species) from which they are released by the host into the environment, allowing the cycle to continue.
Impact on human health - Acute symptoms
The first signs of infection can often be observed directly after penetration of the skin causing a temporary rash that can persist for days as paulopruriginous lesions. This occurs in particular after primary infection with the parasite frequently found in migrants into and tourists returning from endemic areas as a study by Bottieau et al. 2006 showed.  The more progressive stages of schistosomiasis, often referred to as Katayama fever, are also rarely diagnosed in the endemic population, maybe as a result of under diagnosis, but more commonly found in migrants and tourists also. The trained immune system of healthy people living in endemic areas will often be able to"

WashU_StLouis,2016,Team:WashU StLouis#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," livestock manure that is plentiful in the midwest. They noted that there is little movement in the local and federal legislature to slow the growth of the agricultural companies that pollute the most – therefore the MCE travels all over the country to lobby for the reforms they promote. From this experience, we learned that the runoff crisis stretches further than simply a dearth of new agricultural technologies. While we were still motivated by this original application of our research, we began to seek out new venues for its use.
Industry
Finally, we sought out advisors who could comment on the use of our supercells beyond an agricultural setting. We wanted to know how ATP overproduction could specifically be utilized to produce recombinant proteins, improve cell growth, etc. We began by visiting Monsanto, whose largest research facilities are centered about St. Louis. There, we spoke with over a dozen scientists about our super cells and received comments about potential applications. One suggestion was that our cells could output ATP in a reactor for other cells’ use. In a way, our cells could act as a source of fuel for ATP-intensive processes in other cells. A scientist also suggested we search for ferredoxin and flavodoxin via a spectroscopy analysis. While our lab was not equipped for the method he suggested, we were inspired to use our spectrometer to get a rudimentary idea of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations.
Intrexon, another sponsor of the WashUStLouis iGEM team, allowed us to speak with one of their lead microbiologists. He offered insight into some of our unusual results. The reddish coloration of our cultures overproducing ferredoxin was likely the result of reduced cytochromes in our cells. In future work, we think a cytochrome assay could prove more indicative of reduced electron donor concentration than a biotin assay. In addition, he suggested new applications for our super cells. Sulfur-containing polypeptide chains would benefit from higher ATP concentrations, so our cells could potentially be utilized for specialized recombinant protein production. From his advice, we recognized that our strain had varied applications in industry as well as agriculture.
Engagement
Throughout the course of our project, we sought to apply our knowledge of synthetic biology through education wherever possible:
We led two synthetic biology workshops for Washington University’s  pre-engineering institute. This summer program allows a group of approximately 30 students to do an experiment in each of the engineering school’s main divisions.
We discussed our project with local teachers participating in a BioBuilder workshop. We found that the teachers were enthusiastic about including synthetic biology in"

The core of all speech recognition systems consists of a set                 of statistical models representing the various sounds of the language to                 be recognised. Since speech has temporal structure and can be encoded                 as a sequence of spectral vectors spanning the audio frequency range,                 the hidden Markov model (HMM) provides a natural framework for                 constructing such models.
Basically, the input audio waveform from                 a microphone is converted into a sequence of fixed size acoustic vectors Y[1:T] = y1, . . . ,yT in a process called feature extraction. The decoder                 then attempts to find the sequence of words w'[1:L] = w1,...,wL which                 is most likely to have generated Y , i.e. the decoder tries to find.
w' = argmax{P(w|Y)} for all the words w considered
operating this (Bayes rule) the likelihood p(Y|w) is determined by the                  acoustic model and the prior P(w) is determined by the language model.
Language model
Language model refers to the grammar on which the recognizer will work and specify the phrases that it will be able to identify.
In Julius, recognition grammar is composed by two separate files:
- .voca: List of words that the grammar contains.
- .grammar: specifies the grammar of the language to be recognised.
Both files must be converted to .dfa and to .dict using the grammar compilator ""mkdfa.pl"" The .dfa file generated represents a finite automat. The .dict archive contains the dictionary of words in Julius format.
Once the acoustic language and the language model have been defined, all we need is the implementation of the main program in Python.
Arduino
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
The Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.
Revision 2 of the Uno board has a resistor pulling the 8U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier"

We prepared cryo cultures of the overnights of the empty backbone and purified the plasmids from the cells. Afterwards, we checked the size of the plasmids via agarose-gelelectrophoresis.
Figure 3: Agarose gel picture of the empty backbone pSB1C3 (column 1-2). DNA ladder #SM0312. Both clones are positive.
One of the samples that showed the correct size was sent in for sequencing.
Day 4
One of the samples of the PCR extracted expression system in BBa_J04500 that was sequenced beforehand and also the sample with the empty backbone showed the correct sequence and could therefore be used for further experiments.
To analyze the expression level of subtilisin E we prepared 20ml pre-cultures of the positive sample. In addition, we prepared pre-cultures of the E. coli BL21 wildtype and the pSB1C3 empty backbone in E. coli BL21 as controls.
Day 5
The pre-cultures from the day before were used to inoculate two 50ml main-cultures each to an OD600 of 0.1. This main-cultures were then incubated at 37°C, 250 rpm until OD 0.3 was reached. Then, the main-cultures were induced by adding 0.5mM IPTG. Afterwards, one of the main-cultures was incubated at 30"

Why are we creating a modular toolkit for SSR?
SSR is ideal for genetic engineering and synthetic biology
Site-specific recombinases are highly specific. Recognizing relatively long target sites, site-specific recombinases                 minimize the extent of off-target effects, as longer target sites are less likely to be found in the genome                 by coincidence. This makes them fit for synthetic biology purposes on top of genetic engineering, as their                 highly predictable activity allows one to create genetic constructs in a bottom-up way. Considerable effort                 is also put into protein engineering to minimize off-target effects in certain chassis, and into the discovery                 of new site-specific recombinases.
Site-specific recombinases are also very simple to use. Unlike other genetic engineering methods such as CRISPR/Cas                 system, TALEN and ZFN nucleases, site-specific recombinases require only the recombinase protein and two                 target sites (and occasionally some extra protein factors), and does not require any host processes for genetic                 engineering [4]. On the contrary, all the aforementioned systems rely on the host DNA repair and homologous                 recombination machinery to perform knockout and knockin, in which the mechanisms are likely to be error-prone,                 and are different from species to species. Indeed, site-specific recombinases have been shown to be able                 to perform genetic engineering in all domains of life, whereas the CRISPR/Cas system cannot be readily adopted                 in prokaryotes, because prokaryotes generally lack robust DNA repair systems that are found in eukaryotes.                 This highlights how site-specific recombinase could be superior to alternative genetic engineering methods                 in terms of organismal flexibility.

Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add three volumes of buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg   gel – 100 microliters)
NOTE: the maximum amount of gel per spin column is 400 mg
NOTE: for >2% gels, add 6 volumes of buffer QG
Incubate at 50 degrees Celsius for 10 mins
Vortex the tube every 2-3 mins to help dissolve the gel. After the gel slice has dissolved   completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow. If the color of the mixture is orange or   violet add 10 microliters of 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The mixture should then turn   yellow

Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample   volumes > 800 microliters, load and spin/apply vacuum again.
If the DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection,   add 500 microliters Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column vack into the same tube. (If the DNA will be   used for salt-sensitive applications, let the column stand 2-5 min after addition of Buffer PE)
For a concentrated solution, add only 30 microliters of Buffer EB (rather than 50 microliters).

(b) Designing tabletop model- The hypothetical prototype has the following components
1.A small Heat Exchanger: Since the temperature of the exhaust gases would be very high for our engineered bacterium to work, we have decided to use an heat exchanger for reducing the temp of the exhaust gases.
2. Bioreactor: It is the most important part of the design where the reduction of the harmful gases takes places. The genetically engineered E.Coli is immobilized in the bioreactor and responsible for all the reduction of gases inside the reactor. The gases pass from the bottom and the medium is sprayed at a very slow rate from the top of the reactor. The immobilization material is polymeric material with a positive zeta potential. The prototype design is a proof of the concept, which can undergo various changes on the basis of the requirements of the industry. The concept of reduction of harmful gases using genetically engineered bacteria can be used in automobiles, thermal power stations and various other industries. The size of the device needs to be manipulated according to the industrial requirement.
3. A medium tank: This includes a solution having all the nutritional requirement of the bacteria. Thus it will contain a minimal medium required by the bacteria for its growth.
The relevance and expected outcome of the proposed study
✔ Our project integrates biochemical engineering and synthetic biology.Synthetic biology is the revolutionary science of the future. Although the organisms reducing the harmful nitrogen and Sulfur oxides exist in nature, the reason of using genetically modified bacteria is to increase the efficiency and the rate of reduction of the oxides by the bacteria. Our proposed biological system has significant benefits over current removal methods. It would be substantially cheaper to use, as it would not need high temperatures required for other methods, nor would it need the costly catalysts used in Selective catalyst reaction (SCR).
✔ The absence of SCR catalysts from our system would also mean that it would lack the potential toxicity that can arise from metal by-products of catalyst degradation. In addition, being operated by genetically modified bacteria, our system could be more flexibly implemented, since provided optimal growth conditions, they may be operated on a variety of production levels and in a variety of mechanical systems. For example, many waste water purification systems already use batches of bacteria that degrade a significant proportion of pollutants present in waste water, and so our modified bacteria could be added into this batch to improve NOx clearance.Our project aims at reducing the emission of harmful Sulfur and nitrogen oxides by industries. These oxides are harmful as they are the main reason of the present day acid rain which leads to a number of"

Results
The gene that encodes for OBP2A was first successfuly placed into the pSB1C3 biobrick vector and transformed into E. coli JM110. It is from there that OBP2A was separated into two parts. This was done so that we could first characterize the interaction of the two separated parts and prove that under normal conditions the two constituents would coalesce back into a completed OBP2A protein in vivo. This was done through the use of primers designed to amplify the different sections of the protein that were to be separated.  It was decided through observation of the amino acid sequence and through OBP2A crystal structure that a proline at position 118 in the amino acid sequence would be the position of separation for the two parts of OBP2A.
To characterize the interaction between the two separate parts of OBP2A the bacterial two hybrid system (BTH) was implemented and β-galactosidase assays were done.  This meant that these separated gene fragments had to be cloned into BTH vectors: pUT18 and pT25. These vectors contain gene fragments for the production of adenylate cyclase (an enzyme that is required for the production of active cyclic-AMP) that becomes active when the integrated gene fragment’s products interact with each other in vivo. This allows us to quantify the interaction through the use of the β-galactosidase assay. Once the gene fragments of OBP2A were successfully cloned into the BTH vectors, both vectors were transformed into MG1655 (Δcya) E. coli strain – a strain that lacks the necessary genes for the production of adenylate cyclase. It was from here that multiple β-galactosidase assays were performed and the miller’s activity( a measure of the level of interaction) was calculated for each control and sample.
Figure 1 - Calculation used to determine the level of interaction between two proteins in vivo.
As of yet these assay have indicated that the two subunits of OBP2A aren’t interacting in vivo. One suggestion as to why this may be the case is that the proteins when separated have exposed hydrophobic residues that cause an alteration of the protein structure of the two parts making them incompatible with each other. It is important to point out however that of the β-galact"

Nanjing_NFLS,2015,Team:Nanjing NFLS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," well. Having done many research in Physics and taken part in Physics competitions in the past a few years, Biology to me is indeed a new thing. Reading news on recent achievements in Genics and Neural Biology, I expect Biology to have great impacts on our way of life in the next decades. That’s why I read extensively about Biology and accepted my friend Figo’s invitation to join this iGEM competition. I was very glad to find out that some of my knowledge in Physics and Mathematics in fact donated help to our study and experiments, for sciences are interconnected and share similar principles. This experience turned out to be inspiring too, not only in terms of subject knowledge but also in terms of team work and cooperation, which should serve as a good preparation for our future studies and careers. I'm Yuqing Zhang from Nanjing Foreign Language School, senior 2. It would be my great pleasure to attend the igem competition with congenial youngsters this summer. In school, I not only shoulder the responsibility of biology' TA but also actively take part in numerous biological clubs, especially organizing the school project of Plant Tissue Cultivation. We arranged detailed experiments to discuss different nutrient profiles' effects on green vegetables and videoed the whole process, which was later presented on NFLS's official website. In my free time, I also attended several lab projects in university. The hot topics of golden rice and effects of transgenic food really inspired my great interest in this subject as well as strengthened my personal lab skills. During the preparation of igem, I did learn a lot about vaccine and spread out meaningful information to my surrounding family and friends who used to embrace kind of misconceptions. Those evidence mentioned prove my great passion toward igem, one of the most influential competitions for young people all over the world. My name is Xu Chi. I am a senior from Nanjing Foreign Language School. Academically, my favorite subjects are Physics and Biology because I really love the feeling of discovering and doing experiments. Researching on topics of such scientific subjects is definitely what I always pursue for. Other than that, my biggest hobby is playing basketball. Furthermore, I’m the captain of the basketball team of my school and have led the team to win consecutive 2 regional championships in recent two years. I really appreciate the chance of Participating in iGem and I really learned a lot from this experience. My name is Di Chen, a senior two student from Nanjing Foreign Language School.I am a science kind of person and I am really fascinated by the experiments and stuff. I love iGEM for it provides us with opportunities to cooperate with"

Mito: La aplicación de la biotecnología a cultivos y alimentos es muy diferente a los métodos de agricultura tradicionales.
Realidad: La biotecnología es una evolución de los métodos tradicionales de agricultura. En los últimos 10, 000 años, la gente usa rutinariamente sus conocimientos para mejorar la producción de alimentos. Los agricultores mejoraban una planta cruzándola con otra que tuviera una característica deseada, para agregar o eliminar rasgos específicos genéticos de una planta. Pero este método era inexacto ya que para que se lograran transmitir de una generación a otra la característica deseada tenían que hacer muchas cruzas.
Ahora con ayuda de la modificación genética, es más eficiente y preciso lograr los beneficios del mejoramiento en los cultivos; usando nuevas tecnologías, los científicos tienen la posibilidad de precisar el gen específico responsable de un rasgo en particular, para poder extraerlo o añadirlo a una planta específica.
Regularmente toma mucho tiempo hacer que una planta exprese una característica deseada, a pesar de ello, han sido capaces de generar plantas:
• Resistentes a sequías, pesticidas y enfermedades.
• Tallos más fuertes para resistir fuertes vientos.
• Rendimientos más altos.
Para más información, visita el sitio actionbioscience.org y lee el artículo Biotechnology in crops: Issues for the developing world y también el artículo Crop Biotechnology: Feeds for Livestock de la Universidad de California.
MITO: La producción de cultivos resistentes a ciertas plagas y malezas dará lugar a “superinsectos “ y/o “supermalezas” que son inmunes a los métodos existentes de manejo de plagas y malezas.

25 uL from the mix is put into PCR tubes and we only add the template (0.3 uL if plasmid 2uL if genomic DNA) to our samples, while the control has everything but the template.
The reaction is carried out by the PCR machine according to NEB Q5 DNA polymerase PCR reaction protocol.
If the product is going to go under restriction enzyme digestion, the procedure for it is detailed above.
Gibson Reaction
We add 50ng of our vector to 15 uL of Gibson Assembly Mix (already prepared in PCR tubes 7.5uL each stored at -20C).
We add DNA at 1:1 ratio but this can change depending on the length of the DNA and the length of the vector as well as number of different DNA pieces.
The reaction is carried out at 50C in the PCR machine in 1 hour.
The product can be directly taken and transformed into competent cells.

Notebook for Sept.6th
    
    Tonight,  Prof.He invited Dr.Huang from HKU to join our meeting. Dr.Huang was the instructor for HKU during 2010&2011 iGEM competition, so he had a lot of experience to share with us. He mentioned that the selection of iGEM members in HKU started in March and each candidate was required to submit a proposal. In July, experiment officially started. However, from previous experience, experimenting efficiency is quite low due to new member’s lack of proficiency.
    To solve this kind of problem, universities such as London Imperial College began to prepare for this year’s competition since last year. In addition, he reminded us to prepare answering questions reasonably and logically from the judges who must be very familiar with synthetic biology. Later, our team summarized our recent work. Jiang Yiqi and Guo Jingyao have assigned tasks (designing leaflets, preparing presentation, writing a new song) for volunteers from freshman. Zhu Mubing has solved the problem of non-public API of our first project. Zhang Junqiu and Fan Zili has completed their parts of the second project. Zhao Yujun and Pan Deng have made some progress in optimizing our database. Finally, almost all the team members went to Prof.He’s office to finish their registration to HK.

July 20th, Li Yaqi and Yu Si, representatives of Team Tsinghua-A, along with main members of Team Tsinghua had a meet-up with Liu Dong, Chen Guoqiang and other professors of the School of Life Science. Design and difficulty in recent experiments fully discussed during the meeting, questions we raised answered respectively by professors, senior schoolmate willing to help, we benefited greatly as the bond between both teams strengthened.
July 20th, Team Tsinghua-A borrowed TE buffer of Team Tsinghua’s lab.
August 3rd to 17th, both teams got visas in chorus, gave each other suggestions and set itinerary. We settled to attend the 5th CCIC (Conference of China iGEMer Community) in Shanghai.
September 20th to 30th, guided by professor Wang Xiaowo, Team Tsinghua-A got in contact with Zhang Lei, Tsinghua school mate and principal of China Science and Technology Museum. Member Guan Ai made draft plan of exhibition between October 4th to 7th in the museum. Delicate of team, Li Yaqi bargained with the museum and decided the final plan of exhibition. Afterwards, Huang Tianze, leader of Team Tsinghua proposed a joint exhibition plan with Team Tsinghua-A.
October 1st to 4th, Team Tsinghua-A borrowed E. coli strain which steadily express YFP, GFP and RFP fluoresce protein, and cosign it to Team Tsinghua to cultivate, and inoculate to solid medium.
October 4th to 7th, exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum took place as arranged, daily watched by at least four members from Team Tsinghua-A and three members from Team Tsinghua.
In the impending future, Team Tsinghua-A and Team Tsinghua should accomplish the final task in Giant Jamboree fabulously in joined hands.

This  is the first year for me to be an iGEMer. I joined it as soon as I came to my college because I really like it where I can have a good method and skill in the experiment. What's more, I enjoy the atmosphere when we cooperate with each other by means of group discussion, seminars and doing experiment together. Honestly speaking, I  learned a lot in this year and am planning to go further and deeper in this interesting area.

It's my first time to take part in the iGEM. In summer, I stay in the lab for a month. I have never worked for a long time in the lab before and this is really a valuable experience in my life. I have learned how to keep everything ready so our work won't be delayed frequently. Also, I gained many interesting friends and found many delicious foods around my collage : ). To me, iGEM is an excellent chance to do our own experiments but never worry about the funds and results. Thanks to iGEM. Thanks to SCU. Thanks to the Lifescience school.

Undeniably, when it comes to the most unique experience I have gained as a freshman, the time I spend on iGEM should be mentioned. Worked in acetate metabolism and human practice groups, I'm glad to acquire so much synthetic biology knowledge, experiment skills from responsible seniors, and get used to teamwork. iGEM provides us with an excellent stage to design, demonstrate, and present the project, which deeply attracts me. When we design the project with inspirations and creativity, the synthetic biology is definitely brought to life.

It's my honour to become an iGEMer as a freshman in SCU. Not only do I improve my experimental skills,but also make new friends and really get fun. The comprehensive help given by senior, the cheer with partners in human practice and the felling of designing something now--these are what I love that attract me. And I wish I will always keep my passion going along this road.

The gameplay was designed for a high school aged audience, to provide a fun introduction to synthetic biology. We also designed an additional function where the player could access an encyclopaedia, targeted for undergraduate university students, where they could learn more advanced concepts, for example restriction enzymes and transformation, in an interactive manner.
We designed the Escherichia coli main character to be pink to represent its gram negative staining and movement mechanics were designed to show how flagella work. To ensure we were as scientifically accurate as possible, we consulted a microbiology expert Dr Sasha Tetu who confirmed E. coli was peritrichous with flagellum protruding in all directions.
Players navigate their E. coli via controlling its flagella to collect nutrients to remain healthy and undergo cell division, thus increasing the swarm. The swarm survives hazards through force of numbers. A single survivor can complete the level, but the player will be rewarded with more nutrients if they can keep a higher number of the swarm alive. The idea of controlling a swarm and the difficulty to keep them all alive, often ending a level with a few or even just one, was designed to reflect low transformation efficiency levels seen commonly in molecular biology experiments.
Throughout the levels players would collect BioBricks, and at the conclusion of the level, enter a mini-game where they would use the collected BioBricks in a drag and drop manner in the correct sequence to undergo transformation. The character would then enter the new level with added functions gained from the BioBricks.
Our own project would be introduced with a level requiring the collection of our designed BioBricks, with the player needing to produce hydrogen gas to replace polluting elements. We also considered the potential for using our game as a platform for collaboration with other teams. The game was designed so that we could easily dedicate a level to another iGEM team’s designed BioBricks for the character to collect and display their own projects function.
Due to time constraints we were unable to complete and release the game for use before the iGEM Jamboree. However, with the substantial progress we did achieve, we hope to see it implemented in the future.

Practices and Policies
There are much more to a good iGEM project than the work in the lab. An important pillar in the foundation of iGEM is also to raise public awareness of synthetic biology. In aim to do so we gave a presentation at the Danish Youth Association of Science (UNF) annually Biotech Summer Camp, regarding synthetic biology, iGEM and some ethical concerns.  During the presentation we asked what their opinion was on the discussed topics. You can read more about our visit at the UNF ‘s summer camp under Education .
The youth are one of our  outreach target groups. We hope that the young generation can provide the public with some new aspect on the use of synthetic biology.
To reach out to children, we have authored a children book. This book provides teachers and parents a good basic tool for educating children in Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). To read more about the creation of this unique book and to download our own free copy, please go to A Children’s Book .
The different between right and wrong is important to keep in mind when working with living organism’s DNA. A big part of our project have"

The genetic code is a degenerate one; there are more 3-part combinations of nucleotides than there are amino acids. The topic of codon optimization-that is, the cell's preference for one codon sequence over another in translation-has been heavily researched in an effort to determine the optimal genetic sequences for an organism. This project looks at the effects of repeated amino acid sequences of varying lengths and codons and their effect on the cell.

Circuit Model
Initial Design
To test the effect of repeated codon sequences on cell protein expression, we altered a plasmid available in the Richard lab to contain a promoter, ribosome binding site, and an AHL leader sequence, followed by a non-coding repeated sequence placeholder flanked by restriction enzyme sites. A mCherry and GFP reporter allowed us to test each repeated codon sequence.
Sources
The initial construct was partially assembled by a Ph.D student formerly working in the Richard Lab at Penn State named Mike Speer. This project was designed by Mr. Speer, but never completed. The Penn State iGEM team worked closely with Mr. Speer to successfully complete the initial construct.
Assembly
This part was assembled using Amplified Insert Assembly, a technique developed in the Richard Lab by the 2011 Penn State iGEM team. AIA utilizes the complementary sticky ends left by certain restriction enzymes to ligate inserts and vectors with benign scars.

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Medal Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"prisingly, We have succeeded in its mass-production by terpene precusor mass-production device. Our new biobrick device worked as expected. Because we validate this fact  by ubiquinone thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis experimentally. We have documented and submitted this new Biobrick device( BBa_K1653024 ) to iGEM Registry .
We want to make the E. coli produces farnesol and geraniol which are one of the terpenes. To produce great quantity of terpenes they need many terpene precursor. E. coli produces a small amount of the terpene precursor in MEP pathway. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes (ispD, ispF, idi, dxs) which are speed limiting enzyme for terpenes precursors produce in E. coli. In order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into E. coli to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP in a MEP pathway. To confirm increased production of terpene precursors by Terpene precursor mass-production device. We put attention on ubiquinone. Ubiquinone 8 is made from Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) which is one of the terpene precursors. quinone is one of the electron carrier present in the cell membrane of prokaryotes. And also they glow when exposed to UV rays. In the measurement of production of quinone it was measured by thin-layer chromatography. (TLC silica gel)
Result:  (fig1) The left lane is analysis of ubiquinone 8 by thin-layer chromatography. The right lane is JM109 /Terpene precursor mass-production device with IPTG  Left lane is JM109/Terpene precursor mass-production device IPTG minus . Both it was 2μl spot. The right of the figure,Estimation of ubiquinone-8 content instead Each intensity of spots indicating the content of ubiquinone-8 From two figures, those which are overexpressed in reintroduced to E. coli four genes, it is better to have overexpressed were many production of ubiquinone 8 as compared with those that do not overexpress
Discussion: From this result, the amount of ubiquinone 8 of the final material by the increased amount of terpene precursors is increased by re-introducing the four genes are over-expressed in E. coli. Therefore, it considered could strengthen the MEP pathway.

PLANT CHASSIS
Bacterial systems were the first chassis chosen due to its simplicity. However, complex proteins (i.e. glycoproteins) need many post translational modification in order to provide the native structure. Therefore, yeast and mammalian cells were studied to spread SynBio possibilities.
Finally, plants arose as a new and interesting chassis in SynBio progress. They are one of the main primary sources of biomass as they can provide basic nutrients and valuable secondary metabolites. Furthermore, plants suppose an advantageous platform for recombinant protein production which can be very useful for laboratories and researchers.
Plants’ interactome is far more complicated due to its complex metabolism, difficulting the prediction of circuits behaviour. However, Plant SynBio offers multiple purposes such as making molecular pharming easier and more efficient, reprogramming metabolisms or dealing with plant stress conditions.
ChatterPlant proposes a new sustainable agriculture for any desired plant species. However, N. benthamiana was chosen in our proof of concept due to its fast growth and easy genetic manipulation. In this way, agroinfiltration procedure provides a straight-forward and relatively fast method to test genetic circuits by transiently introducing heterologous genes inside plant cells.
GENE CIRCUITS DESIGN
This year, our team proposes ChatterPlant, a SynBio-based solution that works as human-plant interface to allow this bidirectional communication. An optogenetic circuit and a genetic AND gate were designed to control both development and behaviour making crops more accessible and sustainable
The communication channel between humans and plants is comprised by a designed optogenetic circuit which is triggered by the red/far-red light inducible switch.
HOW DOES RED/FAR-RED SWITCH WORK?
Figure 1: Graphic design of human-plant circuit. a)  The transcriptional factor, PIF6, is fused to a DNA-binding domain (E) and PhyB is fused to the activator domain (VP64) and a nuclear location sequence (NLS). Both genetic expressions are controlled by plant strong promoters. b) When irradiated with 660nm light, PhyB changes its conformation and this complex is recruited to PIF6 at the promoter site. The polymerase III will recognize the activation domain and the transcription will begin. Only upon absorption of a far-red photon (740nm) the interaction between PhyB and PIF6 is terminated, resulting in a shut-off of gene expression.
Furthermore, the Phytochrome B (PhyB) is fused to an"

Would we have to do something like this before we can use the RPU measurement talked about in this paper? Is that what the kit is for? Also, it is still unclear to me as to when this type of measurement is needed. - Trentay 15:01, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
I think the measurement of relative promoter strength as well as the measurement of absolute promoter strength are both useful tools in characterizing promoters.  Obviously reducing the variation in the measurement of promoter activity is important when working towards the standardization of quantifiable information.  However, it is also important to characterize the absolute strength of promoters based on environmental differences, which only an absolute measurement can accomplish. - Albergca 15:27, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

HUMAN PRACTICE
Introduction
Human Practice is, as mentioned in the iGEM official webpage, a crucial element in the project that requires students to question about the relationship between our livelihood and synthetic biology. This year, the Hong Kong_HKU Team would like to pay its focus on education and ethical issues regarding to the synthetic biological technology, which are frequently discussed in Hong Kong nowadays. Therefore, the team held a series of events, including School Visits, One-Day Workshop, and Brochures delivery in summer to share more knowledge with the general public about this topic.

iGEM meets CASLMU
1st Meetup of the German iGEM Teams
Regional jamborees or the annual congress of Initiative Biotechnology 2020+ have always been perfect networking platforms for iGEM teams. As neither of these events took place this year, we decided to host our own meeting. Encouraged by the Center for Advanced Studies of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (CASLMU), our team organized the meetup on the weekend before a CASLMU-based workshop focusing on Synthetic Biology. We invited members of all German iGEM teams to spend the weekend from Saturday to Monday (May 24-26) in Munich. Fortunately, members of 11 teams and in total about 70 people could attend the event.
The first day at the Biocenter was predominately intended to get to know each other and to listen to the inspiring keynote talks by Prof. Dr. Friedrich Simmel (TU Munich) and Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher (LMU Munich). The speakers introduced the concepts of Synthetic Biology and gave insight into their"

Ptet Characterization
Since we are using the Ptet promoter in combination with TetR in our reporter systems, it was useful for us to characterize the Ptet promoter only. This characterization was done with the J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmid.
The characterization was done in DH5alpha E.coli strain, which should not express TetR in normal conditions. We add increasing concentrations of ATC to these cells in order to evaluate to which extent these cells still express TetR; we also want to know the highest RFP expression we can get when Ptet is fully induced.
ATC induction
Description
The DH5alpha cells can still exhibit a basal level of TetR expression, even if the plasmid we transform doesn't contain TetR. By adding ATC, we are able to inhibit this basal expression of TetR, revealing the full power of Ptet as a promoter sequence. The action on ATC on our cells is depicted in the following cartoons:
Cells without ATC:
Cells with ATC:
Experimental results
There is a clear difference between cells not treated or treated with high doses of ATC. Still, this difference is not enormous, showing that our DH5alpha cells don't normally express much TetR. The basal expression of RFP is about 23'000 normalized RFUs, whereas with ATC we go up to 28'000 normalized RFUs.
Dose-response curve
The dose-response curve doesn't seem to saturate at the highest values of ATC added, indicating that some TetR proteins were perhaps still acting on the Ptet"
