OUR PROJECT
I can talk about what has happened in the last two weeks.
We did PCR with C. stercorarium as template to get gene of XynB.     Then we connect it to T-vector. So we can build some T-vector which contained our target gene. We     were using blue-white selection method for our experiment. The     experiment went well and we have cultivated some E.coli which     contained our target gene. We are going to do plasmid extraction     and splice our target gene from T-vector to the expression vector.     We also get some expression vector from another lab in our     college. However, the amount was not enough for our project. So     we did some common experiments to make it enough. Our project is about using an enzyme to biobleach paper pulp.
Plan for future steps: We need to build an expression vector to verify our expectation     and we will build vectors which is based on pSB1C3 for iGEM     submitting. We want to set up a line chart about the bleaching effect of enzyme     and the concentration of the enzyme. This task will be done by     GAO Jian. We also want to call some paper factories and take a visit. In that     case, We can find out what bleaching method is really being used     in manufactory. And we will study the cost-effectiveness of our     method.

OUR TEAM
2006 was the first year that Purdue participated in iGEM, entering the      competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisers. Purdue      continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost      every year but never anything more. Due to lack of interest, financial support,      and time, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately,      the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team      in 2012, but receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition      at MIT for the first time in the team’s history. In 2013, the Biomakers were ranked regional finalists with their project: “Back      to the Basics of Synthetic Biology”. They also received the award for Best New      Natural BioBrick, and advanced to the international competition!

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Ferritin Results_-_-_TEXT.html," N-terminus is positioned on the outside of the ferritin cage.
For protein purification we choose a commercial intein tag which cleaves itself of after protein purification was performed only leaving back the desired protein (see Intein IMPACT protocol ).
The resulting PCR product was inserted via Gipson Assembly into pTYB11. pTYB11 is an commercially available protein purification vector which contains the intein tag which cleaves itself of during the protein purification process. Using the intein purification tag has the advantage over his tags that during purification the tag detaches itself and stays behind bond to the column while the protein of interest gets released. This way we could produce ferritin mutants with different functional proteins on the outside and don't had to worry that the tag influences the function of our mTagBFP for example.  pTYB11 was than transformed into E. coli Dh5α for high copy plasmid production. Plasmid iso was performed and the plasmids were retransformed into the protein expression strain E. coli ER2566.
Correct Folding And Assembly Of Mutant Ferritin
Using the impact protein purification protocol, we were able to purify our blue fluorescent ferritin shown in figure 3 the top right of the picture.
Figure 3: Top right ferritin with fused mTagBFP glowing blue under UV light indicating successful expression of fusion protein. Just behind it glowing red the mRFP tagged ferritin mutant containing 4 copper changes and also missing the E-helix and DE turn.
We also performed a fluorescence scan using the Tecan reader to validate what could be seen under UV light with the naked eye. Excitation and emission values specified for mTagBFP where in agreement with our measurements.
SDS page with the purified mTagBFP tagged ferritin was performed to validate the promising results we achieved with the fluorescence scan using the Tecan reader. The gel shows a band at around 45 kDa which agrees with the size prediction of the modified ferritin subunit (1236 bp ; 45,7 kDa).
Figure 4: SDS gel shows the right bands indicating successful expression of our fusion ferritin.
Interestingly the SDS gel might also be used as an indicator for successful mutant ferritin formation.  Because the ferritin is a large round cage only a subset of subunits which have an intein tag attached to them should interact with the column allowing the rest of the intein tags to stay unbound and be released after cleavage.
The intein purification tag has a size of 55 kDa and should therefore be present as a band above the"

Filters the user can set by various conditions (e.g. year submitted, team name, category)
Can be accessed from anywhere, anytime from a web browser without installation
Methods
What we have done in the process of developing ""BioBrick Search"" can be roughly subdivided into 3 parts:
Retrieving data
Establishing a searching and sorting method
Designing a user-friendly UI
1. Data Retrieval
In order to achieve practical search latency, we need to retrieve and store data in our own server that performs the search. The source of data we utilized in ""BioBrick Search"" includes the basic information of each part obtained from the partsregistry.org API (http://) and the contents of wiki pages for each BioBrick on partsregistry.org (using MediaWiki API).
We combined the data from these two sources and converted them to JSON format to use for the search.
Partsregistry.org Database API
We utilized the partsregistry.org official API to obtain basic information such as a part's name, ID, description, nucleotide sequence, inclusion relationships between parts, availability, and so on.
This API allows us to obtain basic information of specified parts in xml format. We acquired a list of all part names at DAS Parts Server entry point ( http://partsregistry.org/das/parts/entry_points ) and, by querying for each BioBrick on the list, gained information on BioBricks. By this methodology, we successfully obtained information on 14,831 BioBricks.
Partsregistry.org Wiki Pages
As the data contained in the partsregistry.org database has little information as to what the BioBrick does and how to use it, we thought it would be quite useful if the data on partsregistry.org wiki pages could be used, in addition to the basic data in the database, as cues for searching BioBricks. Luckily for us, MediaWiki, a software that partsregistry.org Wiki Pages are built upon, provides API ( http://partsregistry.org/wiki/api.php )that allows us to retrieve all the pages for each BioBrick.
2. Searching and Sorting Method
Search engine
As writing a search engine from scratch is quite time-consuming, we adopted the open source software called ""elasticsearch"" ( elasticsearch.org ) as a backend search engine.
elasticsearch can handle complex queries on structured data quickly and this characteristic of elasticsearch allowed us to build a sophisticated and responsive search tool.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the recording plasmid corresponding to the time point when the stimulus occurred, an MfeI site is created by the base editor. In addition, there is an MfeI site at a different location in the recording DNA. To visualize if a stimulus occurred, the recording plasmid will cut twice, creating a fragment of DNA.
To achieve better band resolution when running the recording plasmids on a gel, since repeating units are only 10 bp long, we carefully placed the other MfeI site at staggered locations to better distinguish the time points it occurred. For example, for the 1 frame recording plasmid, there is an MfeI site 100 bp upstream of the recording DNA sequence, for the 2 frame recording plasmid there is an MfeI site 200 bp upstream of the recording DNA sequence, and so on. After the recording process has occurred, the prepped DNA samples can be digested with MfeI and run on an agarose gel.
Modeling the Individual gRNA System
After completing the design for the individual gRNA system, we looked into modeling to see if we could obtain a clear readout of base editing on the recording plasmids at each time point [3]. Since tracking time through the shifting of frames by base editing is an important part of our design, we wanted to see if the frames could shift in a predictable manner. Ideally, the presence of a stimulus at a given time point would correspond to a distinct edit at only that time frame, and after that time point, there would be no more editing at that frame. However, modeling results demonstrate that a distinct readout is difficult to achieve. The model represents how much editing is happening at each time frame over time. Instead of seeing a digital signal for each time frame, there is no temporal resolution.
Oscilatory gRNA System
After modeling the individual gRNA system, we came up with another design to improve the temporal resolution in the readout. By utilizing an oscillatory gRNA mechanism to keep track of elapsed time in the system, we are able to obtain a more digital readout at each time frame. Compared to the individual gRNA system model, there are distinct peaks of editing that would allow us to correspond the editing at the time frame to the time it occurred.
In our oscillatory gRNA system, there are three parts: 1. Base editor plasmid 2. 4-gRNA plasmid 3. Recording plasmids with 4 repeated target sequences

BBa_K2764000
The gene alkL codes for the outer membrane alkane channel protein known as AlkL. Derived from Pseudomonas Oleovarans, the sequence of 693bp has already been codon optimized for an E.coli chassis. The AlkL is able to collect alkanes thanks to an extracellular domain that has a high binding affinity to hydrophobic molecules. Once collected, the alkane makes it way through the hydrophobic core of AlkL before exiting into the periplasm through a small lateral opening in the protein. Hence, the AlkL, which penetrates the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane, may allow alkanes of larger molecular size to enter the cell.
For more details, check out BBa_K2764000
From literature, we know that the AlkL protein is toxic. As such, we used Anderson promoters of different strength to determine which expression level would be optimal. The Anderson promoters selected were J23104, J23107 and J23110 were intended to form an expression level gradient for this purpose.

Choosing Target Substrates and PCR Primers
Possible target substrate:
Single Colonies
Bacteria Solution
Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction
Use agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA to validate the reaction.

We still need to design the primers for making iGaussia
Miscellaneous:
Take a look at the team wiki; update your information and photo
We need to make sure that our protocols are all organized in the way that we are going to carry out processes (ie: transformation, miniprep, inoculation, etc)
We should be making work flows for these
When performing minipreps, always make sure that you tilt the snap cap tubes to allow for more aeration. This will increase the yield of your miniprep
We are going to begin using the bubbl.us website as a way to prioritize what we are doing.  As things are accomplished, change the color, date, and initial.  This will allow us to determine how long it takes things.  Ultimately, we would like to add in sequencing to the flow chart, we want to have protocols attached to each of the bubbles as needed, and we want to include side notes like making glycerol stocks for particular substances so that we don’t forget
Add bacterial sender sell as an option on the flow chart
Once we get the sequence for the pRRL vector, we can begin designing primers
Dan might have stock primers for inserting components into the vector
We should be able to use the same primers for all of the things sequenced with pRRL vector because the primers rely on the backbone
700-800 bases can be sequenced at once (<1300 means that you can just use one forward and one reverse primer)
we have to go to airgas.com to buy CO2 tanks for the incubator (coming in next week)
a pre-freshman program wants us to talk for about 2 hours about synthetic biology to a group of 15 students who are predominantly first generation and have limited background in math/science
each week we should create a to-do list based on the priority constructs
CZ: is still powder.  It is in the Chen Lab. –Arielle Clynes
PCZ: it is currently in pENTR5-dTOPO. We are going to gateway it together tomorrow so that we have pRRL-PCZ.  This hasn’t been sequenced yet but we have run it through a gel and it is likely that right construct.  Make sure that you sequence this before you transfect!

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html,"menopausal woman with metastatic breast cancer at the Michigan Cancer Foundation. It was observed, however, that cell lines used in different laboratories vary greatly in their biological characteristics, so that it is suggested that they were derived from different patients [2] . MCF-7 cells are estrogen-receptor positive and require estrogen for tumorigenesis in vivo. 17β-estradiol induces an TGFα-like activity [3] , which promotes tumor growth and progression [4] . Furthermore the cells express receptors for and respond to several other hormones including androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, insulin, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, prolactin and thyroid hormone [2] .
HeLa
The cells were originally derived in 1952 from Henrietta Lacks, who suffered from an adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The HeLa cells were the first human epithelial cells established in long-term culture [5] . There are three main characteristics of the genome of HeLa by which they can be recognized: hypertriploid chromosome number (3n+), 20 clonally abnormal chromosomes and the integration of multiple copies of HPV18 (Human Papilloma Virus) at various sites [6] . It has been shown, that the HeLa genome has been remarkably stable after years of subcultivation [6] , but it is also possible to select strains of HeLa cells with certain properties by putting them under selection pressure [7] .
U2-OS
U2-OS, formerly known as 2T cell line [8] , were derived from a 15-year-old girl with a moderately differentiated osteogenic sarcoma of the shinbone. Cell culture of U2-OS started at the time of amputation of the left leg on September 3, 1964 [9] . U2-OS cells express adhesion molecules such as integrins, Ig-CAMs and chemokine receptors as well as growth factors which are either constitutively expressed (such as IL-7) or inducible (such as TNF) by PMA (phorbol ester) or ionomycine. The adhesion molecules and growth factors support the growth of CD34 progenitor cells [10] .
Transcription factors

NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) is a transcription factor (TF) which regulates many different target genes resulting in the expression of various proteins. In most cell types (with the exception of B cells and Dent"

Figure 1: Limitation of cloning a fusion protein by standard biobrick assembly
IMPROVING AN EXISTING PART
Existing part from NCTU-Formosa in 2015:
BBa_K1694002 : Lpp-OmpA-NcoI/pSB1C3
Improved part by Mingdao in 2016:
BBa_K1991004 : Lpp-OmpA-BamHI/pSB1C3<
BBa_K1991007 : Pcons-RBS-LO-BamHI/pSB1C3
Lpp and OmpA are outer membrane proteins of E. coli. Lpp-OmpA (LO) hybrid can direct heterologous proteins to bacterial cell surface. In 2015, NCTU-Formosa used it to display scFv (single chain fragment variable) antibodies on the surface of E. coli. They found that a fusion protein cannot be possible to be created under the standard BioBrick assembly rule, that is EcoRI(E)-XbaI(X)-GENE-SpeI(S)-PstI(P). The A part of EX-LO-SP and the B part of EX-scFV-SP, for example, are connected by cutting and ligation of SpeI plus PstI for the A part and XbaI plus PstI for the B part. The SCAR generated by XbaI/SpeI (ACTAGA) will form a stop codon just in front of the ATG start codon of the scFV protein of the B part. This situation has been officially mentioned by the BioBrick standard assembly .
Therefore, in 2015, NCTU-Formosa created a novel part ( BBa_K1694002 ) putting NcoI site between the LO part and SpeI site. However, when considering cloning, we found that an extra NcoI site is present on Cm resistance gene making it difficult be a vector for gene cloning.
In 2016, Mingdao improved the part by replacing NcoI site with BamHI site ( BBa_K1991004 ). Also, we’ve confirmed and prove the function of LO directing a fusion protein"

Also, we set up two E.Coli overnights for miniprep on Wednesday. As part of our presentation on Friday we plan to present the results of whether our plasmid is functioning to detect cholera or not and why. We are still waiting for the sequencing results to come back to us. We also will present the research we have done on Lambda.
- KP I worked with kendall to set up an overnight so that we can do a mini-prep tomorrow to continue our sequencing of our plasmid. After we completed our overnight prep, we set up an experiment to test to ability of our plasmid to give off a color response to cholera. We prepared the 5 tubes that Kendall explained above, we then put them in the 30 C room overnight and we will check on them tomorrow.
-CH Set up transformations with pJG78a (inserts2,5,3,6,4,7,1), pJG79a (2,3,4,5,6), pJG80a (2,3,5,6), pJG81a (2,3,5), and a control (no plasmid added). METHOD: 1ul plasmid prep added to 25ul of purified plasmid on ice 5mins, heat shock 1 min, recover on ice 3min, add 1ml of LB then put at 37 for 30 mins, plate 50ul of each sample on LB-Amp, put at 37 overnight. RESULT (4/9/13): control plate was empty. Lots of colonies from the other plates. So many I could bearly find a single isolated colony. The transformation from pJG81a was a nice green. All of the other samples showed little or no green fluorescence. Will have to set up more transformations with all the other stepping stone plasmids to see if anything will have RFP expressed.  I also mapped out how the completed construct should look on paper with all the inserts. I did this using the information on the QS primers document. If everything is cloned in using the exact primers and following the sequences provided then the GFP protein was cloned in in the reverse direction and HapR was cloned in without a promoter.

As a negative control 25 µL of sample obtained in the same way as the previous mentioned sample, however from an E.coli BL21 without additional construct, was placed into another well. In order to compare measurements taken on different days, to another well 25  µL of Bper was added. To a measurement buffer (200 mM mannitol, 2mM HEPES, 2mM Tris, pH 7.4) 0.09 % (V/V) BBMVs (from T. molitor, as prepared in the protocol for incorporation of 6-carboxyfluorescein into brush border membrane vesicles) or 0.3 % (V/V) BBMVs (from V. destructor, as prepared in the protocol for incorporation of 6-carboxyfluorescein into brush border membrane vesicles) was added. From this solution, 175 µL was added to the 10 µL sample present in the wells. Directly thereafter the plate was placed in a microplate reader. The program with the following settings was started: Shaking: 10 seconds. Duration: 5 to 6 hours. Interval between measurements: 30 seconds. Excitation wavelength: 489 nm. Emission wavelength: 523 nm. Slit: 9.0 nm. gain: 50.
Varroa Isolates
Identifying Isolates from Varroa destructor
One of the methods we used to find our own Bacillus thuringiensis isolate was based on a combination of the procedure used by Rampersad et al. 4 . and Alquisira-Ramírez et al. 5 . It combines the genus’s ability to form spores with a Coomassie stain that allows for visualization of Cry toxins and protein-rich parasporal bodies. This protocol was used for these results .
The most important aspect of this protocol is a source of fresh Varroa mites. The longer they have been dead, the more dessicated they will be. This will complicate the sterilisation step. The easiest way to handle the dead mites is with a fine, wetted brush. This will prevent damage to the mites.
To promote sporulation of the isolates, sporulation plates were prepared. These are regular LB agar plates with the following salts added"

Premix Pfu-PCR
For 1 PCR reaction:
• 5 µL Pfu-buffer + MgSO4
• 1.5 µL 10mM dNTP mix
• 1.5 µL 10pmol/µL forward primer
• 1.5 µL 10pmol/µL reverse primer
• 0.5 µL Pfu polymerase enzyme (add just before PCR run)
• 40 µL H2O
Total vol.: 5O µL
Premix TAQ-PCR (no proofreading):
For 1 PCR reaction
• 2.5 µL 10x TAQ-buffer + MgCl2
• 0.5 µL 10mM dNTP mix
• 1.25 µL 10pmol/µL forward primer
• 1.25 µL 10pmol/µL reverse primer
• 19.25 µL Water
• 0.25 µL TAQ polymerase enzyme (add just before PCR run)
Total vol.: 25 µL
The TAQ polymerase has no proofreading, and should therefore only be used for size determination of DNA fragments. When PCR-product is to be purified and used for further experiments always use Pfu polymerase!!! Make enough premix for your number of colony +1.
Protocol
Colony PCR:
1. Select and transfer a single colony to a PCR tube with a pipette tip (afterwards use the same for plating out on plates)
2. Add all of the H2O used in the premix to the PCR tubes and place them in the microwave at full power for 2 min. with an open lid.
3. Make the premix"

Function Test of E7 Lysis system
The construction of E7-pUHE21 contained strain w3110
BBa_K117000 which contains E7 lysis gene is found out from iGEM 2014 registry and primers are design to PCR the target gene(the sequence of the primers are shown below) BBa_B0034 is contained in the upstream primer, which is a strong RBS.The plasmid pUHE21 is a commercialized one that can be extracted from a modified strain of E.coli(part of its sequence is shown below). EcoRI and PstI are used to cut both the PCR product and the pUHE21 backbone. After purification and ligation with T4 ligase, the reconstructed E7-pUHE21 plasmid is transformed into competent E.coli strain w3110. The positive clone with right DNA sequence inserted is screened out and referred to as strain E7

Sequence of downstream primer: AACTGCAGGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTACTGCGTTTCCACTCCG
The construction of pUHE21 contained strain w3110
In order to make a negative control of this experiment, pUHE21 is transformed into competent E.coli strain w3110 and the positive clone is screened out, referred to as strain BB(short for backbone).
IPTG induction and OD measurement
Inoculate 3 Erlenmeyer flasks (referred to as E7-0, E7-1 and E7-2 separately) containing 100ml LB medium with 1ml of saturated overnight strain E7 culture, and at the same time inoculate 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (referred to as BB-0 and BB-1 separately) containing 100ml LB medium with 1ml of saturated overnight strain BB culture. All of the broth are cultured to OD=0.5, then IPTG is added to E7-1, E7-2 and BB-1 to make their IPTG concentration reach 1.0mM, 2.0mM and 1.0mM, respectively. After induction"

The prototype
Initial ideas
From the beginning of the project, the idea to create a prototype that could be used for a potential screening program seemed very inviting. By creating such a device, it would also be necessary to truly consider the potential use of the project. The features found most important in a good final product were safety and ease of use, low rate of misdiagnosis as well as low price and thus availability to many in need.
To get started, a prototype brainstorming meeting enabled different ideas to be discussed and the best alternatives are presented in this paragraph. One conclusion made, was that the accuracy of the test is less dependent on the prototype construction than on the system design, which can be read about in the Project, description . This part of the wiki focuses on how to make use of the system in the best possible way.
The first question faced in the brainstorming was whether the sensor should be possible to use at home or if it should only be used in a controlled environment such as a hospital. The initial idea was to have a yeast filter which one could exhale through, exposing the yeast to potential VOCs. After careful consideration this alternative was deemed too riskful. For people without proper knowledge, handling genetically modified yeast might pose too much of a risk, especially since the yeast would be close to the mouth. Therefore it would be better if the test was handled at a hospital by personnel with appropriate education. One problem with this idea could be that doctors or nurses generally are not used to working with yeast and thus extra personnel would be needed. Also, with the yeast on a filter it would still be close to the mouth. Since it was decided that simplicity and safety are important characteristics of the device, the conclusion of the initial thoughts was that it would be preferable if doctors or nurses not were required to handle the yeast and that the yeast would not be located on a filter. With this in mind, a new idea took form.
The sample bags
Commercially available sample bags that could be used to collect and store VOCs from the exhaled breath were found after some research. If such bags were used, the risk for patients and doctors to come in contact with yeast would be eliminated. After filling the bags with exhaled air they would be sent to laboratory facilities where incubation with the yeast would be conducted. This idea appeared safer and more practical, but new questions arose. How would the yeast be exposed to the VOCs? How much air would be needed to give enough VOCs for"

Consider How to Connect
The leaders at Camp Launch and SEP requested an in-lab experience for their students. To make meaningful connections our team needed to focus on framing the science in a context that was engaging for the students. We designed an overarching “lunch thief” story line to get the students to get excited about gel electrophoresis, and then encouraged students to brainstorm what futuristic bacteria they would like to create with synthetic biology techniques to get them excited about DNA editing.
Although developing technique proficiency requires being in a lab for practice, learning about the potential careers in STEM doesn’t require a lab. For the second half of this partnership we decided an interactive powerpoint presentation would be the best way to reach a large group of students and share with them the many STEM careers available. This type of program would allow us to connect with all 60 students at one time.
One special consideration with this group was that the students in Camp Launch are middle schoolers. To keep students focused and to prevent lab tools from becoming lightsabers we created a fast paced program and kept student to instructor ratios close to 3-4 students to 1 instructor.
Search the Database & Adapt
Thanks to the heavy collaboration between Camp Launch coordinators and the Activities Booklet from last years team we did not feel the need to utilize the outreach database for additional ideas.
Implementation
On June 29th 17 of the SEP 8th grade group came in to complete a DNA extraction, learn about synthetic biology and gene editing, and create some bacterial art with our edited RFP and GFP E. coli before solving a gel electrophoresis mystery.
On July 20th two groups of 20 Camp Launch students came to develop micropipetting skills by completing a gel electrophoresis mystery. We also discussed the potential uses for synthetic biology and the ethical implications of our work before completing a RFP/GFP bacterial art project. To conclude we had students complete the strawberry DNA extraction, allowing them to take DNA home to show their parents.
On July 21st we presented Careers in Science to more than 60 Camp Launch participants who weren’t necessarily in the STEM section of the program. We broke down STEM careers down into a set of values and skills rather than attempting to list every potential career path. Those values were Problem Solver, Communicator and Inquirer. The powerpoint can be found here
To keep students engaged throughout our presentation we had interactive questions, a few funny comics and a video that connected to our learning objectives. We also had a problem solving challenge at the beginning of the session which energized the"

Interview with Dr. Levy
Dr. Levy is the director of the Center of Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. He studies how Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells adapt to environmental signals and hazards. Currently, Dr. Levy is studying the efflux of the Tet Protein and Tetracycline use.
Dr. Levy thinks that the fight against antibiotic resistance should be multifaceted. Treatments to aid conventional antibiotics should be developed, as well as new antibiotics. From his knowledge, Dr. Levy thought that are proposed gened editing therapy was feasible and that ""young individuals should be able to try out new techniques"". As an afterthought, he mentioned that a easy way to fight antibiotic resistance is swap out your toothbrush multiple times a year, especially after sickness.
Takeaway: Our interview with Dr. Levy gave us confidence that our project could potentially be feasible. Dr. Levy was very encouraging and supportive of the scientific process. However, he gave us advice to do failure analysis on our solution. Often times, treatments improve in some areas over their predecessors and fall short in others.
Interview with Special Agent Mahlock
Scott Mahloch is a former member of the Navy turned FBI agent. After entering the FBI in 2008 and completing training, Mahloch was assigned to Milwaukee Division’s Kenosha Resident Agency, where he worked on a variety of cases. He currently is the Chicago Division’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Coordinator.
Special Agent (SA) Mahloch didn’t have to much to say in relation to antibiotic resistance or the specifics of our project. However, Mahloch did highlight the use of biological threats when it comes to weaponry. He emphasized the importance of being vigilant and aware of ones surroundings while working in a lab and reporting potentially suspicious activity. Mahloch helped us understand that the FBI was not a regulatory agency but is often the eyes to make sure that everything is working smoothly and safely.
Takeaway: There isn't much we can change about our project from Special Agent Mahloch's presentation. However, our team is more aware of the dangers of biology and how it can potentially be used for nefarious acts. If we see something we will definitely say something!

Education and Public Engagement
Synthetic biology is the application of engineering design principles to biology in order to develop tools and systems that will benefit society. In order for such engineering projects to be successful, they must not only be physically and technically feasible, but also be socially acceptable. With this in mind, the UNSW iGEM team sought to engage with the wider community, to open conversations about how our project would be received, and inspire further interest in synthetic biology more generally.
During our project, the team developed a variety of activities and resources that aimed to encourage public engagement with synthetic biology research. From speaking to academics our peers, and high school students, we ensured our project was being tested and considered by a wide audience, with our team discovering (and exploiting) many creative points of interaction between our project and public interest.
By taking to the stage in our research symposium and presentations , we were able to share our story, but also challenge the general public to question and consider current ‘synbio’ technology. This work was continued with our published article which summarised our project (and synthetic biology more generally) for a wider audience to consider. We also worked to inspire the next generation of scientists by running a school workshop to bring our project, and the relevant school topics which underpin it, to a group of high school students. Alongside this effort, we developed a package to assist teachers deliver standard high school ‘in-class’ instruction. This enabled us to develop an outreach and education strategy which would have a sustainable impact on the engagement of schools in synthetic biology, that could be built upon in the future.

Gaston Day School
We began our collaboration with Gaston Day School last year for the 2016 Jamboree. This year, Adam and Emma attended the Southeastern Mini Convention hosted in Gastonia at the beginning of August. At the convention our two teams briefed each other on our respective projects. After discussing potential pitfalls in each project, our representatives tried to help the high school troubleshoot some of their problems.
One way we helped the team was by teaching them about Q5 mutagenesis. We discussed the procedure at length and upon returning to Durham, we sent the team literature as well as tools to help them design and perform their own Q5 mutagenesis (including designing their own primers).
In October, Parth visited his former high school and team and was updated on the progress they had made. Below are several pictures from his reunion! While there, Parth helped the Gaston Day Team troubleshoot further problems that had arisen and suggested using competent cells from one of our strains to increase miniprep DNA yields.
When Parth returned, our team also thought of a way to help the Gaston Day team characterize their part further. We have the ability to run a time course assay and in this manner would be able to provide more data on their cells. Gaston Day attempted to send their samples to us but were unable to deliver any product to us before the deadline.

Conclution
    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.
1. The final concentration of chloramphenicol is not clearly defined in the experimental protocol. Although we have made the experiment proceed smoothly based on experience, we believe that accurate antibiotic dosage requirements are still necessary;
2. Regarding the use of the plate reader: although there are some descriptions in the experimental protocol that explain the experimental design and a simple explanation of the plate reader, we used the plate reader incorrectly at the beginning of the experiment, leading to a invalid data. So we still expect more instructions on the setup and use of the plate reader;
3. Regarding the preservation of competent cells: we have transferred the competent cells position between buildings due to the change of the laboratory position, which took about 10 minutes. And in the transformation experiment, the competent cells stayed outside for too long. These improper storage of competent cells made the bacteria grow very unsatisfactorily after plating. Therefore, the preservation of competent cells is very important.

Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". coli cell in a spherical approximation, this constraint on buoyant force influences goals in the wet lab by setting a minimum requirement for observed buoyant force in modifying ARG1 for optimized flotation performance.
Once ARG1 is optimized for flotation and an estimate for FB is obtained, the maximal carrying capacity can be obtained as follows:
$$m \leq \frac{F_B - 6\pi \eta R_{\mathrm{E. \ coli}} v_{\mathrm{max}}}{g}$$
Equation 15.
Here m = mE. coli + mbound (sum of cell mass with mass of bound particle). Solving for mbound:
$$m_{\mathrm{bound}} \leq \frac{F_B - 6\pi \eta R_{\mathrm{E. \ coli}} v_{\mathrm{max}}}{g} - m_{\mathrm{E.\ coli}}$$
Equation 16.
Diving by the molecular or atomic mass, denote this mparticle of the substance to be sequestered we have the following value for maximal carrying capacity δ in the bioreactor model:
$$\delta = \frac{1}{m_{particle}}\big[\frac{F_B - 6\pi \eta R_{\mathrm{E. \ coli}} v_{\mathrm{max}}}{g} - m_{\mathrm{\textit{E. coli}}}\big]$$
Equation 17.
However, in the bioreactor model, the effluent is pumped from the main reactor in such a way that cells will not sink, so vmax can be set to 0 and we see:
$$\delta \approx \frac{1}{m_{particle}}\big[\frac{F_B}{g} - m_{\mathrm{\textit{E. coli}}}\big]$$
Equation 18.
See §2.3. This could influence the choice of expression levels in future cell surface engineering techniques. Too many surface receptors could result in accumulation of too much particle mass, eliminating the ability for flotation.
4. Growth Dynamics
4.1 Objective
Our objective for this section is to describe the growth dynamics of BL21 E. coli strain in lysogeny broth (LB). We have obtained two sets of observations from our wet lab team:
25 observations with Δt = 30mins
40 observations with Δt = 30mins
4.2 Approach
To model all the observations, we will use the Gompertz function[10], which can be expressed in the following"
Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," government. Even with this rapid growth, it is likely that cost inflation is mitigated by contractual agreements between major pharmaceutical companies and the PBS.
Figure 1. The PBS publishes a recommended ‘order of prescription’ for doctors treating new diabetic patients. The layout of this treatment is determined by PBAC (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee) and is likely influenced heavily by cost/contractual pressures.[10]
Figure 2. Increased coverage by the PBS for Diabetes-related medications accounts for some of the price increases that can be observed. In addition, more than 100,000 Australians developed diabetes in the last year alone (2016).[11] This would only contribute to a portion of the 200% increase in insulin expenditure described by the PBS[3] - a direct impact of rising insulin prices on Australia’s taxation burden. As such, improving access to insulin and limiting the rise in price would provide a very clear benefit for developed nations as well.
New Zealand - Encouraging the BioSimilar Market
Diabetes New Zealand recently reported that; “The number of New Zealanders living with diabetes has doubled from 125,000 to 250,000 in the past 10 years, with 40 new diabetes diagnoses every day.” [28] What’s more, they go on to estimate that “1.1 million people have pre-diabetes and a high risk of developing the condition.” Similar to Australia, NZ’s PHARMAC is a pharmaceutical benefit scheme that reimburses a significant portion of medication cost to the consumer - shifting the cost to the taxpayer.  In a statement inviting public comment on the usage of biosimilars, PHARMAC notes the advantage they might provide: “Biosimilar competition for insulin glargine presents PHARMAC with an opportunity to reduce the costs of insulin glargine and improve health outcomes for New Zealanders.”  Figure 12: While the cost per vial of Insulin glargine to PHARMAC is not readily available, the use of biosimilars can offer the New Zealand Government a significant reduction in expenditure. Such an integrated approach that involves public discourse and institutional reform provides an excellent example for the rest of the world.[28]

Method
Getting anaerobic promoters
We get these promoters in two ways. One is from the E.coli K12 which is found in papers. We use PCR reaction to get more promoter products for the following experiments. Another is from the iGEM committee. We get plasmids from E.coli and cut off promoters by restriction enzyme.
Using molecular cloning technology to construct new plasmids
After we have these promoters, we ligate each of them with luciferase by the molecular cloning technology. We use two different methods to link the promoter and reporter. One is to use the plasmids that have luciferase gene to be the plasmid bone of our parts. In this method, we use enzyme EcoRI and XbaI to switch off the plasmid that has luciferase gene, and use EcoRI and SpeI to cut off the promoter that was cloned from E.coli. The other method is used to deal with promoters that come from the iGEM committee. We use XbaI and PstI to cut the luciferase gene, and use SpeI and PstI to cut the plasmid with promoter. Then we use T4 DNA ligase to sew up the two strands. After this, we transform these plasmids into E.coli Top10 strains. And we get plasmid DNA production using alkaline lysis method.
Screening promoters with aerobic incubation and anaerobic incubation methods
We transform the constructed plasmids into E.coli for incubating , then we select monoclone to another medium to incubate again. After incubating these monoclones , we use alkaline lysis method to get new plasmids and transform them into S.typhimurium VNP20009 respectively with electroporation. Based on our experiments design, after aerobic and anaerobic incubation, we can know the expression level of each promoter in different incubation environments and select more advantageous promoters to do the following researches. From the results, we find out that the activities of these promoters were several times enhanced when the culture condition was exchanged from aerobic to anaerobic.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html,", SP., Loira Calvar, I., Catchmark, J.M. et al. Cellulose (2013) 20: 2191. . Cellulose is produced from the resource glucose-6-phosphate. This phosphorylated glucose is a key intermediate in the core carbon metabolism of bacteria given its importance in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway Joanne Willey LS, Christopher J. Woolverton. Prescott’s Microbiology. 9th edition 2014. . Even though the pathway, where glucose and glucose-6-phosphate is converted into cellulose, only includes few steps, it requires a great amount of energy. Not only does the cell spend energy on forming UDP-glucose for cellulose biosynthesis, it also uses glucose, which otherwise would have contributed to generation of ATP Florea M, Hagemann H, Santosa G, Abbott J, Micklem CN, Spencer-Milnes X, et al. Engineering control of bacterial cellulose production using a genetic toolkit and a new cellulose-producing strain. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2016;113(24):E3431-40. .
The ability for G. xylinus to produce cellulose nanofibers from UDP-glucose, crystallize, and secrete it, is controlled by genes in the Acetobacter cellulose synthase (acs) operon acsABCD. This operon encodes four different proteins: AcsA, AcsB, AcsC and AcsD. A dimer, known as AcsAB, is formed by a catalytic domain, AcsA, and a regulatory domain, AcsB. This dimer is responsible for synthesising the cellulose nanofibers from UDP-glucose, whereas AcsC and AcsD secrete cellulose and form an interconnected cellulose pellicle around the cells Mehta K, et al. Characterization of an acsD disruption mutant provides additional evidence for the hierarchical cell-directed self-assembly of cellulose in Gluconacetobacter xylinus. Cellulose. 2014;22:119–137. , as illustrated in Figure 6.
Figure 6. The AcsAB dimer synthesises cellulose nanofibers. AcsC and AcsD mediate the secretion and formation of an interconnected cellulose pellicle.
Other genera, including some E. coli strains, secrete cellulose as a component of their biofilm. Even though cellul"

Collaboration with AHUT-China
This year, our iGEM team developed cooperative relationship with the AHUT-China team, the iGEM team from Anhui University of Technology. We have reached an agreement to help each other check the model.
We first checked the feasibility of the models and analyzed their feasibility. Then, we improved these models. The AHUT-China team helped us test our translation software to identify any bug and provided us helpful suggestions. See more details (AHUT-China) .
Collaboration with UESTC-China
Our iGEM team also developed cooperation with the UESTC-China team, the iGEM team from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. We have reached an agreement of helping examine the effectiveness of DNA carriers.
First, we cloned EGFP cDNA from pEGFPN2 vector using primers containing NheI and BamHI. Second, we used EcoRI and NheI to cut pesc-trp plasmid, and then inserted the EGFP coding region and the FUS1 promoter into pesc-trp plasmid to construct pFUS1-EGFP carrier. UESTC-China used EcoRI and NheI to digest the pFUS1-EGFP carrier, and helped us to verify the DNA sequence of this plasmid. And we also help them verify the validity of the plasmid containing GroES gene. We digested the plasmid with BamH I-Vsp I and Bcu I-Vsp I to verify the validity of the plasmid. After digestion, the results they wanted to see were obtained"

Aim of Experiment: To determine the millers activity of the two interacting subunits of OBP2A in vivo as a basis of the level of interaction between them. This was done using the β-galactosidase assay.
Protocols Used: β-galactosidase assay
Results: Figure 8
Next Steps: As it was the first attempt at a β-galactosidase assay, subsequent assays will be performed utilizing more controls.
14/8: Preparation of overnight cultures of controls and samples in preparation of performing a second β-galactosidase assay
Aim of Experiment: To perform overnight cultures of the controls and samples that will be necessary for doing this second β-galactosidase assay. This assay will include two positive controls which are known to have a high level of interaction - these are NarG-NarJ and Zip positive controls. There will also be two negative controls, an empty MG1655(Δcya) chassis and pUT18-OBP2A with NarJ. Finally there is one regulatory control: which contains two empty vectors of pUT18 and pT25.
Protocols Used: Overnight Cultures
Results: N/A
Next Steps: The next stage of experimentation will be to prepare samples for use in the β-galactosidase assay.
Week Beginning 17/8/2015
Summary
Second attempt at determining the protein interactions of the two OBP2A subunits using the β-galactosidase assay and subsequent cloning of OBP2A into the bacterial two hybrid vectors in switched order.
17/8: Preparation of the controls and samples for use in the second attempt of the β-galactosidase assay
Aim of Experiment: To prepare cultures for use in the  β-galactosidase assay, this requires a small subsample of each overnight to be inoculated into fresh LB, two done for each colony. Then left to grow until the O.D of each culture is between 0.3-0.5. Once an O.D of 0.3-0.5 has been reached then 3 replicas of 1 ml samples are taken from each culture before being spun down, the supernatant then subsequently removed and the pellet frozen.
Protocols Used: β-galactosidase assay
Results: N/A

12-mer Expression, cont.
The two start up cultures are taken from the shaking incubator and the OD checks are 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. The start-up culture with the higher OD is poured into a L of LB with 1mL of Chloramphenicol. The contents are put into a shaking incubator at 37 degrees Celsius and left to incubate for 3hours. A 1mL sample is taken from the flask, and IPTG is added to a final concentration of 0.5mM. After IPTG addition, a 1mL sample of culture is taken every hour after IPTG addition for 4 hours total. The samples will be used in an SDS PAGE to check for verification of over expression of the 12-mer proteins. The contents are then left to incubate overnight for approximately 17 hours.
Observations
Before IPTG addition, a 1mL sample of culture is extracted form the flask and pipetted into a 1.5mL micro centrifuge tube.  The contents are spun with a balance at 3000 rpm for a minute. However, no visible cell pellet appeared at the bottom of the tube. Only LB supernatant was observed. This happened again when a 1mL sample of culture was taken 1 hour after IPTG addition. 2 hours after IPTG addition, a 1mL sample was spun down and a small pellet appeared at the bottom. Two cell pellets were successfully recovered 3 and 4 hours after IPTG addition. When taking the OD after IPTG had been induced into the cells for 4 hours, the OD value was 0.2, significantly lower than expected when compared to previous 9-mer expression. This might have been because IPTG was added 3 hours after initial incubation whereas IPTG was added "

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#transformandtranslate_-_-_TEXT.html," in a fun way, that lots of people can relate to, an audience which may before have been disengaged can be reached.
Engagement is the Key
One of the most important things I took away from speaking to Spencer was that it is not just communication between scientists and the public that influences engagement, but also a more deeply embedded relationship. Sometimes, an image of disparity can exist between new technologies and the public– the people these technologies will ultimately effect. It’s completely understandable to be disengaged with new technology, even distrustful of it, if you feel like it is being controlled in a way you do not understand, or developed in a process you have no involvement in. Thus, increasing and encouraging engagement with a project from the people it will affect, from its start to end stages, is vital for its success. This advice has influenced our iGEM project- we are having discussions with stakeholders and end users throughout the design and development process, and completing public engagement activities.
Thank you for the great conversation and the inspiration, Spencer!.
Dissecting the Dialogue
A barrier between Science and the public? August 11, 2017
After learning about the gap between biosensor production and actual biosensor use, my thoughts jumped to language. Could a deficiency in communication between developers and users of biosensors could be a contributing factor to the lack of commercial success?  Also, on a more general level, how is science communicated with the public?
This summer, while most of the iGEM team members work on transformation with DNA in the lab, I’ll be in the library focusing on how science is transformed from the petri dish to paper. As the cells that are cultured are undergoing the process of translation to make their proteins, I’ll be investigating what it takes to translate a science project into a commercial success.
Science communication is a really broad and interesting field- over the next few weeks I’m going to use techniques such as discourse analysis and corpus linguistics to study it, and discuss the research here. By exploring the field of science communication, we hope to achieve a better understanding of how synthetic biology, and projects born from it, can impact the world!
Making Sense of Biosensors

We can conclude that the three toehold switch pairs are working as intended and show little to no cross-interaction. These switch pairs can further be used in CAT-Seq in order to measure the orthogonality and strength of these pairs in a high throughput manner, and therefore assess the accuracy and precision of Catalytic Activity Sequencing.
3. Library encapsulation into droplets
Pico-liter volume droplets, housing In vitro transcription and translation reagents, DNA template and substrate nucleotides are produced by perpendicular excising the constant flow of water phase with fluorinated carrier oil.
Movie 1. 10 pL biomolecule synthesis droplet generation. Movie shows considerably slowed down generation of 10 pL water in oil emulsion. Horizontally arriving water phase housing In vitro transcription and translation reagents, DNA template, substrate nucleotides are excised by perpendicular flow of fluorinated carrier oil at a rate of 20 x 106 droplets per hour.
The formed emulsion is collected into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and incubated off chip in 37oC incubator for 4 hours to synthesize the biomolecule which catalyses the conversion of substrate nucleotides.
4. Catalytic biomolecule production
The effect of DNA circularization
In-vitro protein expression kits, encapsulated in the droplets together with only a single DNA template per droplet show extremely poor protein synthesis efficiency, as the template DNA concentration is very low. The DNA template was circularized without and omitted of any transcriptional terminators in order to initiate the rolling cycle transcription described by literature (Diegelman and Kool, 1998). Please read more about the rolling cycle transcription in the design section of the CAT-Seq project. The effect of DNA circularization on transcription and thus translation rate was measured by employing In vitro transcription and translation kit with two different DNA templates. Both of the templates encode an esterase gene flanked by T7 RNA promoter and RBS, however one of them was circularized and had no terminator sequence. Two differently synthesized biomolecules (one linear, and one circularized) were mixed with N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphates - the Substrate Nucleotides. The hydrolysis rate of substrate nucleotide was tracked by measuring the decay of absorbance with spectrophotometer. As seen from data showed in 7 Fig., the"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Sequencing_-_-_TEXT.html," observed from all mutations on our reporter plasmid causedby the error prone, wild type polymerase in E. coli JS200 or our reporter plasmid in E. coli Top10, respectively.
The mutational spectrum of the error prone polymerase I was investigated by Troll and coworkers (Troll et al. 2014) using a total of 123 sanger sequenced clones.
Figure 9: Mutagenic spectrum of the error prone polymerase I as determined by Troll and coworkers (Troll et al. 2014).
In comparison to the published results our experiments revealed a different picture of the mutagenic capabilities of the error prone polymerase I. We found a prevalence for transitions, while Troll found 83 % transversions.
The difference between both results can probably be explained by the different methods applied. This assumption is supported by vastly different mutation spectra previously observed by comparing different methods (Badran and Liu, 2015). When investigation the rpoB gene of forward mutants in a rifampicin assay with sanger sequencing and a small sample size (n < 215) the mutation spectrum differs very strongly from the one determined with NGS and a much larger sample size (n < 112580). Generally, NGS is a more reliable method due to the high  amount of observed (mutation)events. Furthermore, NGS is independent from different selection strategy like selection of the occurrence of an antibiotic resistance. This preselection before sequencing is needed to filter out the very large amount (>99 %) of unmutated sequences. However, this selection  introduces a mutational bias. Therefore, NGS with a high sample size and the possibility to sequence a library, which was created by mutation without any kind of selection pressure, is the optimal way to determine mutation spectra. Nevertheless, there are some biases in NGS data generation as well. The GC content of the fragment was shown to effect the mapability of a ultra short NGS read (Dohm et al., 2008). However, most of these effects do not impact the results significantly anymore due to an increased read length and improved sequencing chemistry.
Genome wide mutator
Our genome wide mutator system was analyzed via NGS as well. We used the M6 mutator and the dnaQ926 mutator gene alone. The plasmids were used from a corresponding reversion experiment.
The experimental setup was as following:
The M6 mutator BBa_K2082117 or the dnaQ926 device BBa_K2082116 were cotransformed with the reporter plasm"

iGaME: Synthetic Biology for Gamers
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.
Recommendations For Our Site
New Database Language
A new language called MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is proposed for automatic modeling of biological system. Due to introducing of novel concepts of species and reaction templates, which are two main components in MoDeL, interactions between species need not to be completely provided and thus making automation possible.

OUR TEAM
Our team first participated in iGEM in 2012. In 2013 we received a gold medal at the European Jamboree. We are made up of biologists, biochemists, mathematicians and computer scientists. We are mostly undergraduates. We work closely with IGM (Institut de Genetique et de Microbiologie), which conducts research in genetics and microbial genomics.
OUR PROJECT
Certain ideas that would have been called nonsensical now are widely accepted as fact, such as Galileo’s vision of Earth, or the theory of evolution. Such paradigm shifts have vastly changed the way we understand and define various phenomena. What about synthetic biology then? Will it change the way we perceive the representation of life? To further reflect on the matter, iGEM Paris- Saclay has decided to take part in the new Art and Design track. We believe that art is a great vehicle to share our ideas with the general public. The physical manifestation of our thinking is… a lemon. Allow us to elaborate before you scratch your heads in confusion. We intend to recreate a lemon that will smell like one, look like one and even “ripen” like one, yet not be one. Basically the “lemon” is E. coli that will express lemon colors and smells. We will mold agar to obtain a lemon shape. The discussion that will follow is quite multifaceted. If we have a “fake” lemon with exactly the same characteristics as the natural version, would you say that the two are equivalent? Would you be willing to use these genetically engineered “lemons” in your food? What sort of impact would such lab-grown food have on the market? If we can modify bacteria to create artwork, could we consider moving on to"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#london_-_-_TEXT.html," The new measurements were performed with 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), 158 µL sample and 0.01 mM ABTS for 5 hours at a temperature of 25°C. This sort of sample preparation led to oxidizing activity of the laccases and therefore to an increase in oxidized ABTS (see Fig. 6). After 5 hours both laccases <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> and <partinfo>K863005</partinfo> showed high activity and oxidized  around 8 µM ABTS. Since both laccases derive from the same organism they both show a similar reaction behavior.
Figure 4: Activity measurement of <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> and <partinfo>K863005</partinfo> using ABTS over a time period of 40 minutes. No increase in oxidized ABTS was detectable.
Figure 5: Activity measurement of <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> and <partinfo>K863005</partinfo> after 2 hours incubation with 0.4 mM CuCl2 using ABTS over a time period of 5 hours. No activity of both laccases could be detected since there was no increase in oxidized ABTS.

Sucrose Test
Aim:
To check whether the colonies on the Cm plate with B.subtilis 168 containing Groningen 2012 integration plasmid actually contained transformant cells rather than a random mutants/contaminant.
Methods:
Following from the protocol indicated on July 1st , we checked the pH of the solution of cells from the Cm plate with Groningen 2012 integration plasmid incubated in sucrose rich media overnight to check for presence of acidic metabolites of sucrose and hence the activity of AmyE.
Results
The results were as hoped, as the pH of both the samples we prepared was the same as the pH of the +ve control (Bacillus 168 cells):4.7, 4.8, 5.04.
Transformation
Aim:
To transform B. subtilis with Groningen 2012 integration plasmid.
Methods:
We transformed B.subtilis 168 cells with Groningen 2012 integration plasmid and with pGMP (+ve control) and no plasmid at all (-ve control). Plated the colonies out according to the protocol and left to grow over night.
Results and Discussion:

Figure above modified from [5]: The nitrogenase enzyme is deactivated in the presence of oxygen
Figure: Bottles of LB used for innoculating E.coli strains
Due to the oxidative properties of oxygen, most nitrogenases are irreversibly inhibited by dioxygen, which degradatively oxidizes the Fe-S cofactors. This requires mechanisms for nitrogen fixers to protect nitrogenase from oxygen in vivo. Hence in our experiment, we firstly selected anaerobic condition as part of preparation step for the nitrogenase activity testing.
Results:
In the minimal M9 media, all possible combinations of parameters listed above were tested.
None of the concentrations of glucose had any aﬀect on the growth of E. coli. It was expected that as the concentration of glucose increased, the growth of E. coli also increased. However, the variation between the concentrations of glucose may have been too small for a noticeable increase in E. coli growth as the concentration of glucose increased. Also, even the maximum concentration of glucose tested, 100mM, may have been too low to aﬀect the growth of E. coli to an observable extent."

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.
