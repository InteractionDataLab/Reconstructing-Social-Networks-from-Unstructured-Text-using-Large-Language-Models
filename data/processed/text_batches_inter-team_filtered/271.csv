Margaret Barbero
Maggie, born and raised in wild and wonderful West Virginia, was always at home in the forest. She’s happiest when halfway up a tree with the birds, but decided to try something new! Working in the lab, though less airy and spacious, has been an exhilarating challenge. Maggie is a sophomore majoring in Bioengineering, and is in love with biology. She wants to become a researcher influencing the future of medical science, making iGEM an ideal stepping stone. Even though she is very busy, she can always find time for chatting with some friends, enjoying a good Sherlock Holmes story or dancing to her favorite Spanish music. Her optimism and good cheer has found a fine home at UIUC and especially in our Wetlab iGEM team.

As part of our collaboration, we characterized two biobricks from the Newcastle team (whom we met in person at the iGEM Scotland and Northern England meet-up). BBa_K1895000, also known as “Electrically induced promoter system v1” consists of the heat shock promoter BBa_J45504 driving expression of a two-gene operon made up of the rpoH Sigma-32 transcription factor and superfolded GFP. BBa_K1895001, also known as rpoH, is the wild-type RBS for the rpoH Sigma-32 transcription factor.
Colonies were picked and grown overnight at 37 °C, 250 RPM in 50 mL conical tubes in 10 mL of LB medium containing 34 ug/mL chloramphenicol. Cell density was measured in a Jenway 7305 spectrophotometer and the obtained data was processed using Excel. Cells were then subcultured into opaque-walled 96 well plates and adjusted to OD600 0.05 in 290 µl of LB medium supplemented with relevant antibiotics.
Plates were then placed in the Fluostar omega microplate reader from BMG labtech, and grown at 37 °C for 20 hours at 300 RPM. Aside from monitoring OD600, fluorescence was determined by measuring emission wavelengths using a fixed excitation filter (485nm) and a fixed emission filter (538nm) every 30 minutes. Six replicates were performed. The data is presented in relative fluorescence units.
We want to thank the Newcastle team for helping us in the characterization of our improved phytobrick iLOV.
Thank you to our sponsors for their support

UESTC-Software,2018,Team:UESTC-Software#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," player sequentially goes to the laboratory to extract the target gene, the Research Institute to construct the expression vector, the Processing Plant to introduce the target gene into the recipient cell and the Inspection Station to detect whether the target gene was successfully introduced into the recipient cell. The player who first completes this process wins!
Throughout the process, we also designed a lot of interesting parts. For example, if player stepping on ""Obstruction"" will make the opponent to retreat to the latest process, while stepping on ""Lazy"" will make the opponent to move to the next process. And if player stepping on ""Study"", he can move on to the next process. Stepping on ""Too Acid or Alkaline"" will make you back one process. In addition, position ""Check"", “Grocery Store”, “High Temperature”, “Ultraviolet”, ""Exchange"", “Port” and “Science Park” on the board, making Bio-Chess more funny and exciting!
PC version:
In order to better promoting our game, making people who may not be able to experience physical chess can experience the fun of Bio-Chess, we also made a PC version of Bio-Chess. In the PC version of Bio-Chess, we made some minor adjustments to the rules, but this did not affect the synthetic biology thoughts and fun contained in it. The Bio-Chess PC version has been released to the online platform so that the public can easily download to play. Click to Download Bio-Chess for PC.
Promotion
Bio-Chess debuted at CCiC (Conference of Chinese iGEM Community). We introduced the Bio-Chess to the audience and judges at the Panel Session and received wide acclaim. At the first iGEM Festival in University of Electronic Science and Technology, we combine Bio-Chess with our carefully designed synbio quiz game. Participants need to complete two consecutive sessions where they have a deeper understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Future
We will continue to promote our Bio-Chess through social media, whether online or offline. And improve it based on feedback from players. In addition, we also hope to cooperate with educational institutions to use our chess as a tool to assist in teaching and to show   its greater value. We believe that our work can really affect the people around us and make them pay more attention to synthetic biology.
iGEM Day ‘Gene Go’
Of course, it’s hard to let children understand synthetic biology but cultivating their interest is important. We teamed up with Sichuan Science and Technology Museum and UESTC-China and organized a ‘Gene Go’ iGEM Day to provide a good opportunity"

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

This year, to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K133"
DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"anyl Diphosphate Synthase and Phytoene Desaturase, respectively,  both from the wildtype strain of xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous used in the biosynthesis of beta-Carotene.
When looking into the specifications of these BioBricks, we realized that both genes contained illegal restriction sites.
BBa_K530001 contained an AgeI restriction site making the part incompatible with the RFC25 Freiburg Standard. The RFC25 standard allows for in-frame assembly of protein domains. BBa_K530002 contained the illegal restriction site BglII making the part incompatible with the RFC21 Berkely Standard, which enables in-frame assembly of proteins.
We wanted to overcome these obstacle by removing the illegal restriction sites from the above described Biobricks.
How did we do it?
The illegal restriction sites were removed using site directed mutagenesis with primers containing nucleotide substitutions in the two restriction sites (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: Primers overlapping the restriction sites are designed with a single nucleotide change to disrupt the restriction site. The primers anneal to the template plasmid and replicate while introducing the point mutation. The elongated plasmids are digested with the enzyme DpnI, which cleaves at the methylated sites breaking down the circular template, resulting in a higher transformation efficiency of the linear PCR product.

DESCRIPTION
The new plasmid, BBa_K2117012 , with the removed AgeI restriction site was double digested with the enzyme and SpeI to test if we had successfully removed the AgeI restriction site.

Each bar represents a different DNA molecule added in the sample solution from either plasmid or linear DNA of different lengths.

Applying the fusion protein: targeted adapter integration
Design: We designed and tested DNA adapters, compatible with ONT sequencing, to be integrated by the Tn5 portion of our fusion protein. We targeted the integration of these adapters on EPO coding sequence in plasmid DNA.
Results and interpretation: The initial assay for adapter (~30bp) integration on plasmid DNA with EPO coding sequence (BBa_K2643004) was not successful ( notebook ). Based on this result, we hypothesised that it might be necessary to work with linearized DNA, so we digested EPO plasmid with EcoRI enzyme and repeated the adapter integration. Adapter integration with sgRNA ( sg001 ) targeting EPO at around 232th bp should result in fragments of ~250 bp and ~430bp. We PCR amplified the products of integration using EPO and adapters’ primers. The results in figure 22, (Lane 1,2,5, and 6) indicated a correct integration of both adapters in a specific position in EPO cds molecule. The absence of these bands on the negative controls without sgRNA (lane 3,4,7,8) confirmed this specificity further.

Andres Lassus
I’ve always questioned how the world around me works and why. Since I joined iGEM in December 2017 I have been able to feed my curiosity by exploring this field in depth. I am planning on studying a science liberal arts program for university where I will continue to further understand the world around me.
Nicolas Gonzalez
I find iGEM to be a very inclusive activity, regardless of how complex or high-level the content may be. I enjoy learning advanced procedures and theory for synthetic biology that we would never have a chance to do in grade school, or even in the IB diploma program. I joined iGEM in December 2016 and am now Vice Team-Leader here at team ColegioFDR_Peru. I am graduating as part of the Class of 2019, meaning this is my final high school level iGEM, and I’m determined to make it count!
Daniela Gioia
I have always loved science class, and explanations as to why the world works the way it does have always fascinated me. I decided to join iGEM in order to expand my knowledge In microbiology, and I firmly believe that it has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I’ve made so many friends and I’ve learned so much more than I expected to about science. I am so incredibly happy with my team!
Gabriel de Romaña
Throughout my life, it has always been hard to find a place where I truly feel welcome. Well, science people are not common in a world full of sports, TV shows, and more distractions. However, I believe that having joined the ColegioFDR_Peru team in September 2017 has allowed me to pursue my passion for learning and get to know amazing people with similar interests. I am extremely grateful because I couldn't ask for a better team!
Karina Vestergaard
I’ve been living in Peru for six years now and I joined iGEM in December 2016. iGEM has been a way for me to explore different areas of science, but I am particularly interested in veterinary medicine due to my passion for horses.
Kia Cuba
I joined the ColegioFDR_Peru team in September 2017. I knew I always wanted to be part of this club because I have a big interest in science, especially biotechnology and how it solves everyday problems.

Local insights
Through a Skype meeting with iGEM USP-Brazil we really got to know the local situation in Brazil. We gained valuable insight into the measures being taken by the government and the population to prevent infection by mosquito-borne diseases. We learned that the government does not put enough effort into stopping the spread of the diseases. It is advised to wear long-sleeved shirts in the evening and at night, which is the time mosquitoes are most active. Furthermore, individuals should spray themselves with an anti-insect solution. Moreover, as mosquitoes are located close to water sources (e.g. ponds and lakes), the removal of still water would aid in reducing the mosquito population. However, in the rainy seasons, this is nearly impossible. The bad water distribution system makes people store their water in boxes that are breeding places of the mosquitoes. Waste is also a problem, as every bottle cap can be a breeding place after the rain.
We also learned that in Brazil, you can go to the doctor for free. However, most doctors do not have the equipment to perform diagnostic tests. Also the limited production capacity of tests is the main bottleneck. A diagnostic test for viral diseases that is cheap and can be used by these doctors would be beneficial, especially to test pregnant women or decide on further treatment options.
Current serological diagnostic tests and other point-of-care tests are not reliable enough. More tests, like PCR and ELISA-based tests are needed for confirmation.
Due to this Skype meeting and the information from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we realized that many people are affected by these terrible diseases and everyone in Brazil knows someone who at least is, or has been, infected by viral diseases like dengue or Zika. These diseases have a great impact on the patient, the people close by and society in general.
Combining our projects into something bigger
The project of USP-Brazil covers fighting mosquito-borne diseases from within the mosquito. They engineer symbiotic bacteria living in the guts of mosquitoes that can fight the viruses when the mosquito is infected, during the so-called paratransgenesis. One issue is, however, that this symbiotic bacteria should only start to produce the toxins in infected mosquitoes. Our project can be a nice addition by combining our engineered bacteria with their toxin system of the symbiotic bacteria. The resulting fusion is then able to detect the virus with the affinity body on the surface, after which our downstream signaling pathway results in the activation of the symbiotic bacteria to fight the virus or kill the mosquito.

 Entrepreneurship award
From the very beginning, we had a startup approach that was developed in various ways. We build our project to continue after the contest and create a company. We went on the field, we talked with many biotech entrepreneurs in Europe, but also with regulators to find how our solution could fit the market. This quickly abled us to pivot and to adapt the scope of our project to build something scientifically strong but also with a possible go to market.
Our strong team & Advisory board
We started with a clear vision that highly drives all the members of the team. We strongly believed that having a shared core value will be the best motivation for our team. The first thing we do, was sitting down to talk about the problem that we wanted to solve on the planet. After few brainstorming we all wanted to solve an humanitarian large scale problem. We were also very concerned about the antimicrobial resistance. What if you could solve act in both field? Usually big pharmas and bio based startups do not find solutions for humanitarian field. It is not often big market and if does not worth to work in this field. But a contest like iGEM gave us the opportunities to strive for finding a solution.
We got the best of our 11 students hard working and  highly motivated team we knew the importance of having a structured and efficient collaboration approach. As any startups we used management tools, we established processes to be as efficient as possible. Everyone has his clear role in this venture.
Beside the team, we created an advisory board. It is constituted of key science entrepreneur, such as Victor Dillard (CEO of Desktop Genetic, Forbes 30 Under 30, MIT Innovator Under 35, who also came as a speaker on our conference). We also have entrepreneurship mentor such as Stephan Dehousse (serial entrepreneur, and CTO of Startup Factory), Bruno Wattenbergh (Strategy Professor at Solvay Business School) and Azèle Mathieu (managing director of the life-science incubator Lifetech.brussels). And also key researchers such as Jean-Paul Pirnay (from the Military Hospital, world"

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Ethics2_-_-_TEXT.html," a meeting on 31st May (with Ana in person!) and shooting sessions on July.
26/04/12 Skype meeting with Ana.
Aim of the meeting: We will discuss which are  the most relevant ethical issues that you envision in relation with your ""talking bacteria project"". We will also discuss the sources you can use to search and think of these issues. Finally, we will discuss how to translate those issues into a movie script.
Ethical issues discussed:
List of relevant issue in relation to talking bacteria project:
1. General issues/Bioethics:
a) biosafety (i.e. safety as related to lab practices)
b) biosecurity (uninteded consequences of biological research, i.e. bioterrorism, etc…)
2. Developing affective relations with your bacteria (ending up in addiction, physiological disorders, falling in love, etc..) 3. Colonization: bacteria becoming superior than us and taking over humanity 4. Autonomy: bacteria becoming autonomous/humans loosing autonomy 5. Control: Humans loosing control/Humans creating disorder in nature, how to recover balance in nature) 6. Issues related to nature/directed selection (again, autonomy/control) 7. Cyborgs/Robots ethics: humans loosing their identities: what is to be human? How are cyborgs different from humans?  8. Bacteria controlling human bodies and trying to imitate humans 9. What is artificial/what is natural 10. Bacteria can choose a human body (good looking, healthy, etc…): freedom of choice?  11. Bacteria becoming superior than humans 12. As bacteria become superior, issues of social segregation emerge (racism) 13. Bacteria living in human bodies (cyborg) become better than humans 14. Technologies will enable human-beings to transcend the limits of humanity: transhumanist ethics/Singularity)  15. Non-desired effect of scientific research: bacteria become conscious and autonomous beings.  16. Non-desired effects are related to uncertainty and the fact that scientists just do their work in an automated way and they do not stop to think 17. Uncertainty/non-desired effects: There are things that we do not know and things that we do not know that we do not know (known unknowns/unknowns unknowns 18.  Intelligent bacteria conquer the world subduing humans. They apply eugenic practices to bacteria population (selection of the best) and reverse eugenics to human population (selecting the most"

Today was a day of many debates! Unfortunately our transformation did not work once again. We had doubts, because the negative control was growing. We got to a conclusion on what the problem might be:
I) A mutation in Escherichia coli RR1  that makes it resistant to chloramphenicol;
II) Chloramphenicol  in our  lab is contaminated.

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Biodegradability_-_-_TEXT.html," by using a force plate ,and we found it unlikely that the impact of the crash would ever reach as high a pressure as 30 MPa, based on projections from the data we collected. (see graph below).
Figure 4. A graph demonstrating the relationship between impact pressure and height of crash.
In the graph above, we measured the pressure upon impact of an object similar in shape and weight to our UAV. We took measurements by dropping or throwing the object from various heights and angles. Based on our data, it is projected that even from a drop height of 10m, the pressure upon impact would not even be 1 MPa, making it unlikely that any crash would ever cause 30 MPa of pressure.
We next tried to initiate degradation using a light sensor, which would activate degradation in the darkness, allowing our UAV to have a flight time of one day. We planned to do this using the construct from the UT Austin and UCSF 2004 Coliroid project. However, the strain of E. coli (EnvZ) that we needed to work with to use this construct was resistant to all 4 of the main antibiotics we had in our lab, making the bacteria difficult and expensive to work with.
Finally, we decided to use quorum sensing as a means of creating a time delay for initiation of degradation. Two previous constructs, BBa_I13202 and BBa_T9002, when combined, create a quorum sensing cascade used to initiate expression of GFP. We ligated these two parts together to create our novel part, BBa_K1499500, which we used for our assays. We found that, in lac deficient cells, the quorum sensing construct can be initiated by induction with IPTG. After this induction, GFP expression increases with time, implying that the construct is doing its job. Our data for this assay is shown below.
Quorum Sensing Data

Flow cytometry is a laser-based technology that has a wide-range of uses, including multiparametric cell counting and cell sorting. In this study, we utilized the cell counting ability of the Life Technologies Attune® NxT Acoustic Focusing flow cytometer in order to determine how many of our cells were expressing GFP after being induced with IPTG (a lac analog). The three graphs and tables above represent the flow cytometer data obtained from three samples of lac-deficient E. coli cells. One of the samples was a negative control of LB-cultured E. coli cells (Negative Control), and the"

BUCT-China,2014,Team:BUCT-China#small-dialogpj4_-_-_TEXT.html," causes a further bending of the promoter DNA to itself, making it even less ideal for RNAP binding (Ansari et al. 1995). Once the MerR homodimer has bound to merOP, recruitment of RNAP to the mer promoter occurs (Heltzel et al. 1990), and MerR has been shown to cross-link to several subunits of RNAP (Kulkarni & Summers 1999). In the absence of Hg(II) the ternary complex of MerR, RNAP, and merOP represses transcription of the mer structural genes. In the presence of mercuric ions, one Hg(II) per MerR homodimer (O’Halloran et al. 1989; Shewchuk et al. 1989a) coordinates in a trigonal manner to three essential cysteine residues of the MerR homodimer, two cysteines from one monomer, and one from the other (Helmann et al. 1990; Utschig et al. 1995). Hg(II) binding to the MerR homodimer results in both a relaxation of the DNA bends induced by apo-MerR, and both DNA distortion (Frantz &O’Halloran 1990) and an allosteric under winding of the promoter sequence by approximately 33(Ansari et al. 1992). The underwinding of the promoter DNA aligns the-10 and -35 sequences, such thatRNApolymerase can recognize and bind to these sites, initiating transcription from PmerT  (Heltzel et al. 1990; Ansari et al.1992, 1995).
The current model describes a resistance mechanism whose expression is repressed until Hg(II) ions enter the cytoplasm of the cell, but is primed to initiate transcription of the resistance genes at very low levels of Hg(II), and to fully induce resistance gene expression across a narrow increase in external Hg(II) concentration.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
In order to prove the antimicrobial activity of abaecin, apidaecin and defensin 1,  antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for two different bacteria: Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pyogenes.B. subtilis was chosen because it is one of the best known Gram-positive microorganisms and S. pyogenes was chosen because it is one of the most important bacterial pathogens to humans. They both are widely known, commonly used, and thus allowed to better analyze the activity that the peptide has.
Being unable to isolate our peptides by affinity tag purification due to lack of equipment, crude protein extract was used in the experiment. In order to validate the experiment, different concentrations of the peptides and several controls were used; 12 ml of LB broth, with a bactericide agent or a control, were inoculated with 100 μL of the overnight culture of each bacteria. Afterward, OD600 was measured at 3, 6, 9, and 21 hours after inoculation.
Defensin 1
B. subtilis (figure 3a) was treated with 30.6 μg/mL (LC) and 153 μg/mL (HC) of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with defensin 1. Also, it was treated with 29.565 μg/mL (LC) and 147.825 μg/mL (HC) of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) for negative control. A culture of B. subtillis was used as a negative control as well. At 21 h, both concentrations of defensin 1 produced a decrease in OD600 compared to the untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) control. With the lowest concentration of total proteins with defensin 1 OD600 decreases in 14.23% and with the highest one it decreases in 16.28%.
S. pyogenes (figure 3b) was treated with the same concentrations as B. subtillis. At 21 h, both concentrations of defensin 1 produced a decrease in OD600 compared to the untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) control. With the lowest concentration of total proteins with defensin 1 OD600 decreases in 8.26% and with the highest one it decreases in 12.99%.

Normalization and re-organization of the part information at iGEM’s     web site was needed in order to develop our application, which will     automatically search the possible construct combinations. For the organization     and analysis of the Biobricks, we used part info for Spring 2010 distribution.     The information on all three 384 well plates distributed by iGEM scrutinized     and checked individually to specify the standards available and needed.     iGEM is providing so many parts within a hierarchical way, but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some of     the parts distributed are known to be nonfunctional. Web pages for parts     contain lots of information, but majority of them, are again not ordered.     Moreover, some additional information had to be removed or replaced     in such a way that the information for parts can be used effectively.     And removal of the redundant bulk information related with parts at     iGEM’s web site had been recommended for future.
Although, the final standardization, which we have suggested is not     for general public use and it was urgently needed in order to satisfy     the needs of our algorithm. But, still it will be a valuable resource,     since it summarizes the basic information about the parts.
As the first step to build the proposed standardization template,     the headings selected related to parts are listed on Table 1. Submission     of part IDs for individual parts is an accepted and quite valuable way     of tracking information. Although, every part has unique partID, for     every part there is a need to assign unique part names as official iGEM     names. Part names will have an important role as they will be providing     the short description about the part, which synthetic biologists can     immediately recognize and utilize during the construction of unique     Biobricks. Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify     the devices with more than one Biobrick in their constructs. Assignment     of unique and distinct names for parts describing their nature and content     will be helpful to researchers for the recognition of and search for     the parts.

Doubling time = LN (2) / Growth rate.
In contrast, RIOT sensors 7, p70-33-ALR-Terminator (BBa_K1897021) and 8, p62-33-ALR-Terminator (BBa_K1897024) with weak RBS appeared to exhibit very minimal leakiness (Figure 3). The transformed bacteria were unable to grow in the absence or at low lactate concentration (10-4 M). The addition of lactate at high concentration (10-3 and 10-2 M) rescued the transformed bacteria grown in media without D-alanine. And as expected, RIOT sensor 9, J23100-33-ALR Terminator (BBa_K1897027) which served as a positive control, was able to express ALR constitutively. According to Table 2, the growth rate of bacteria transformed with sensor 7 and 8 grown in lactate concentration of 10-4 M was not significantly different from zero. Moreover, RIOT sensor 7 exhibited an increase in growth rate or a decrease in doubling time from 92.7 to 79.5 minutes when lactate concentration increased from 10-3 M to 10-2 M. However, the growth and doubling time of sensor 8 were almost similar when lactate concentration increased.
In conclusion, we have characterized the output of lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 (BBa_K1847008 from ETH_Zurich 2015) in a new chassis which was E. coli Nissle ∆alr, a D-alanine auxotrophic mutant bacteria to detect lactate in tumour microenvironment. The characterization result of RIOT sensor 7 shows that we have successfully minimized the leakiness and enhance the sensitivity to lactate of sensor using the lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 promoter from ETH_Zurich without  adding LldP and LldR. Bacteria transformed with sensor 7 are expected to be able to survive in small numbers  in mild lactate concentration of the blood and once reaching tumour site, their growth will be increased by the high lactate concentration there, which will enhance the detection signal or the delivery of biomolecules into tumour cells.

As a member of the Trey Ideker lab at UCSD, I have spent the past year working closely with network biology and tools used in network biology, which has been important to the development of both the back-end database and the front-end application.
Additionally, as a new graduate student, I felt it was an excellent opportunity to begin sharpening my skills as a teacher and mentor to students not only on their projects but also their academic careers. I have found that I myself have a great love for teaching and lecturing, and it has truly been rewarding to see how far many of these students have come this year. This year, we have also been part of UCSD's very first iGEM team ever, which in itself, comes with a unique set of challenges. Our team did all of its own fundraising to pay for the registration costs of iGEM as well as the travel costs to Boston. Along the way, we have also pitched our team in addition to the project itself to several labs at UCSD in hopes of creating a sustainable team for years to come. However, even with these limited resources and barriers to our project's development, particularly in terms of our wet lab validation for this project, I am extremely pleased with what we've been able to accomplish this summer and I am proud to have been a part of UCSD's first iGEM team.

Advising for iGEM has been a fascinating engagement and a positive force towards my personal and professional development this summer.  I enjoyed discussing and formulating our project with the undergraduates. The novelty of their insight was exciting and fun. Their perspectives are untainted by the priors of the field and often stemmed new and exciting conversations.  Educating new students was also a great way to consolidate and confirm my understandings and preconceptions.  Revisiting details assumed in professional conversation is hard but ultimately beneficial.  I was delighted to discover several shortcomings in my current understanding of Synthetic Biology over the course of teaching this project.

We are the first undergraduate student team presenting a project at the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition that is exclusively focused on investigating the ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) issues attached to synthetic biology. We are very excited and feel fortunate to be allowed to add this facet to iGEM. Two of us began this project at the end of our first year in Health and Society and one of us had just finished second year in biomedical science.
The primary goal of our project this year is to comprehend how much government agencies, industry, NGO’s and academics are aware of synthetic biology and what they envision from and for this new approach to science. These groups are very likely to be dominant groups shaping the synthetic biology discourse in the future. We also wanted to see whether high school students are aware of the topic and what they think of synthetic biology will likely have to deal with the future outcomes of synthetic biology.
We also looked into what the synthetic biology vision is from our fellow iGEM participants.
Our goal was to inspire the minds involved in synthetic biology, to navigate through and be aware of the present achievements, future potentials and possible pitfalls that would limit the future potential of synthetic biology and its overall possible implications in our everyday lives.
Is the world prepared for Synthetic Biology?
Any  iGEM  participant could express their  idea  as to what they think synthetic biology  is, the approach that it could take to incorporate an engineering platform to life science, the possible importance and benefits of its current applications (in medicine, fossil fuels, environment and technology), future potential and an example for each of these aspects of synthetic biology. However  for us its less clear what the level of"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at"

Description
The world is changing and so are the energy needs of humanity. Fossil resources are being depleted and it is clear that the transition to clean sustainable energy has to be made. We believe synthetic biology can be an important catalyst in this process. Specifically, we engineer a Bacillus subtilis biofilm to function as a cation exchange membrane. Such a membrane can be used in Reverse Electrodialysis (RED), a technique to generate energy where salt and fresh water mix, for example where rivers flow into the sea. We call this application of the bacterial biofilm Blue Bio Energy. To make the Bacillus subtilis suitable for RED, we first make it more robust by overexpressing the biofilm genes tasA and bslA while preventing reversion to the motile state by knocking out the abrB regulator and overexpressing slrR, another biofilm regulator. Simultaneously, the amino acid polymer gamma-polyglutamic acid was modelled extensively to see if it could be used to make the biofilm ion selective. This was found to be the case. Experiments showed that Bacillus subtilis 3610 comI biofilms are slightly ion selective and, surprisingly, that ion selectivity is improved by knocking out abrB as well as by overexpression of bslA and slrR.
Growing biofilms
The word biofilm is used to denote a pleidae of different extracellular structures created by bacteria. The willingness of bacteria to stick together on a surface using secreted extracellular materials is usually considered the defining property of a biofilm, though it is hard to define a clear boundary between closely packed colonies and a low density biofilm. Biofilms are usually grouped according to the type of surface they inhabit, depicted in Table 1.

Protein concentration measurement
Both consider the accuracy and complication of the procedure, we did not use the western-blot or the nanodrop but the Bradford assay.
2014.9.2
Make the principle curve and compare the sample with the BSA data. https://2014.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen/Notebook/A-B_Toxin/Bradford#Protocol
Result
Their data look not so good, apart from the TEG elution3(A=0.198,c=2.6643ug/ml) and GD5 elution3(A=0.129,c=1.0096ug/ml),other all below the 0.050, and this can not be transformed to an effective value.
Primary Refolding(2014.9.4~9.6)
2014.9.4~9.5
Use the 0.3mM DDT to deal with the purified protein sample for 2hrs
for 2ml purified sample, add about 0.6ul 1M DDT to the sample.
Use the refolding buffer to deal with it for 2 days(the sample concentration must lower than 100mg/ml)
Composition
Refolding buffer: 100mM tris-HCl, 8mM oxidized glutathione, 0.5M L-arginine, 150mM NaCl
2014.9.6
Run the SDS-PAGE to test if the protein has activity or not.
Result
In this procedure, we got a mistake that we thought this process of just reduced the disulfide bonding as a operation of dilution refolding. So we haven’t gotten any effective results in this primary try.
Second try(2014.8.31~2014.9.4)
Background
Because of the first success (can purify protein at initial time), we decide to take forward, to search more suitable imidazole gradients.
Change
We change the gradient of wash and elution gradients, use a gradient of 10mM, 50mM, 90mM, 180mM, 250mM, 330mM.

Saline Experiment:
We plated the salt solutions that were made from about two weeks ago. The colonies on the plate that weren’t supposed to be fed LB were smaller, the plate had more colonies  than the other one, which has a smaller amount of larger colonies.
Lsr Operon
The Lsr Operon has RBS within its OFR/CDS, unlike normal circuits where the RBS is prior to the OFR.
This means that when a ribosome starts translation, it is makes 4 proteins from a highly conserved sequence.
This might be good for biological systems, but in terms of modular design it is not as efficient. Since the OFR contains a RBS, if you were to attempt to combine the various OFRs with a separate RBS, it takes twice as many RBS’s.
In Open Reading Frames, the start codon is the first three bases (AUG).
A Ribosome Binding Site, is what the ribosome binds and the OFR comes after. A common sequence is the Shine-Dalgarno that is usually 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG. The six-base sequence is AGGAGG.
In order to move around this problem and prevent using double the amount of needed RBS’s, we will change the sequence to code for the same proteins, but with different bases. Thus utilizing the degenerative nature of DNA.

I am Lai Peng from team SIAT-SCIE.I am in charge of the design of our website and some illustration. I like this kind of work from the bottom of my heart, maybe that's because I am an art student. This is the first time I have ever tried web design thus I will try my utmost to learn more knowledge about web design and synthetic biology to make our website more elaborate and special.
I am Huantong Chen from team SIAT-SCIE. I am one of the members who were mainly in charge of the wet lab work. Being a senior member in the team, I will contribute as much knowledge of synthetic biology as possible to our project. This is the first time that I do such a lot lab work, and I hope I can get invaluable experience during the work and together, we can accomplish our exciting project.
Hi, I’m Zeng Junyi. I like shrikes and bubble milk tea without sugar. I joined the team aiming to work in the lab but ended up making illustrations for the website. Anyway, It has been a pleasure working with my team members - they’re brilliant in their respective fields and I thank them for enduring my stupidity at times.
Hi, I'm Alexis. This is my first experience with iGEM, I couldn't be more excited about it. Throughout the preparation of the competition, I have learned much more about genetics and got to know this magnificent micro world. Later the experiment part provides us with a perfect opportunity to put the knowledge we learned into practice, therefore I have the chance to study how to use the precise instruments.  I believe that we are going to have an unforgettable experience with iGEM.
I joined the IGEM Club in our school one year ago and learn some basic knowledge of DNA Structure and central dogma. It was not until a few months ago I first entered the laboratory and began the practice. Doing experiments can be very time-consuming, I’ve experienced many times that whole-day effort being ruined by a tiny mistake.However, when we finally saw the desired result, all our effort paid off. The whole procedure and that sense of achievement motive me to keep on walking on this biological way.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Tools#Microfluidics#Tamagotchip_-_-_TEXT.html,", one with five manual twist valves and the other with twelve solenoid three-way valves. The solenoid valves are controlled by an EasyDAQ USB24mx relay card, connected by USB to a Thinkpad T43 running Ubuntu Linux 11.04. We wrote our own Python software to control the EasyDAQ.
The video stream comes from a our toy USB microscope (Celestron Deluxe Handheld Digital Microscope), connected to an Apple Mac Pro. The Mac encodes the video for live streaming through EPFL's Flash Media Server.
Software
When users points their browser to tamagotchip.epfl.ch, they are presented with a video player and a set of controls for the valves. The video player streams live video from the microscope, with a buffering delay of approximately five seconds. When they click one of the controls, the instruction is relayed to the hardware and the valves respond accordingly.
Since there is only one piece of hardware, but many users could log in at the same time, the web application puts users in a waiting line, with only the first person having access to the controls. The others can only watch the video stream. However, to give every one a chance to play, the user in control is swapped every minute, and the others are presented with a countdown of waiting time.
Fellow iGEMers can play with our setup from anywhere, using their web browser.
If another person is playing, the user has to wait in line, but can still watch the video feed.
For the geeks: details of the software framework
The entire software framework, code-named Muigi the Microplumber was written in Python, and is open sourced under the GPL license. The source code is available on github . The following lists all the packages used, from the hardware up.
Communicating with the EasyDAQ is done through the pySerial library. The EasyDAQ expects two-character strings to set the state of its on-chip relays. To provide a clearer interface to the card, a driver-like library provides a set of high level functions, allowing explicit opening or closing of valves, which are then used by the other layers. It also automatically reconnects to the EasyDAQ when it drops the connection. Overall, it provides an abstraction from the hardware, to avoid dealing with low-level hardware communication in the other layers.
On top of that, a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer provides the connection between the web application and the hardware driver, enabling the two to run on separate computers. All this is handled by the RPyC library and its registry server (which used by the RPC client"

Waterloo,2018,Team:Waterloo#Societal Considerations_-_-_TEXT.html," first appearance in 1989 and is promoted to be high in vitamins and calcium. In recent years, yogurt has become one of the most important ingredients to maintain a healthy diet, lifestyle, and balance work life. Optimizing yogurt consumption is an increasing need in an average household and the demand for different yogurt flavouring is slowly emerging. Further research in food and nutrition have found crucial microbes featured in many processes of yogurt production that will demonstrate health benefits including, but not limited to, lactose intolerance, food allergy, Crohn’s disease, and other acute infections in infants and children. With the use of optogenetic co-cultures, this system will allow us to manage the growth of two populations and in turn will give us the opportunity to control different yogurt flavours depending on the different stages of growth, acid contents, and volatile compounds during fermentation. Furthermore, with the ability to control the growth system of different populations, we will be able to identify and study cell-to-cell interactions and influence of probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus casei, that might be present. Being able to utilize co-cultures to further research and integrate findings into the yogurt industry to enhance quality of food will be a stepping stone into improving community health.
    The remaining question is, if one cell goes into apoptosis, how can we prevent the impact on the other cell? Will these yogurt products be affordable enough for consumers? Since co-cultures are natural interactions in nature between cells, this should not be considered a GMO product.

NTHU_Taiwan,2017,Team:NTHU Taiwan#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," our traditional agriculture. It’s a pleasure for me to learn this much about various industries in this visit.
The selection of water origin
The standard of water quality is not that high for common adult fish farming farms—the water source is mainly derived from the underground water mixing with seawater to a proper salinity. It controls the oxygen content through the cultivation of red and green algae, with a rare requirement of filtration.
The control of water quality
Generally speaking, the control of water quality is mainly the observation about the quantity of alga to judge the oxygen content; the green alga in water is excessive, which means the oxygen content is too high, while the red alga is too much, which indicates the oxygen is too low. When it rains, the rain would bring the air pollution or the frontal would take the germs from another area to the water, resulting in water contamination, requiring the pharmacy to cleanse the quality and sun-dried of the pond for sterilization.
The newest methods of water condition maintenance is to exchange the pond waters to make both automatic depuration with a method of biological capture; for instance, the water for mullet farming swaps with the one for conch cultivation, using the conch to clean the excreta or food residue and then drain to the gutters so that the water would not cause eutrophication.
The customer of fish farm
The main customer group depends on the types of the fish variety. For the ordinary fish variety, it will be sold directly to market or market makers, but for the rare type, like eels, it will mostly send to market makers. For more special type—indoor fish farming, it’s mainly for the fish with supper commercial value, especially for fry, such as eel larvae. This fish variety requires higher technique and expenditure; the relatively larger-scale farmers would own the pond and there are specific sale accesses.
[ Figure. 3.2-1 ] This field investigation to our potential customers. Many pieces of evidence show that aquaculture posts a lot of environmental  issues."

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a mass migration from nearby villages into the suburbs. The poor waste management due to lack of knowledge is one of the key reasons of transmission of Leishmaniasis into this region.
However, for the year 2014/2015, Sarlahi district only made up 8% of total 148 cases reported in the country. While, the district of Morang, on the far east of Nepal has had the highest number of reported cases in the past 5 years, it has significantly decreased over the years, from 175 cases in 2010 to 48 cases in 2015. This shows that the eradication programme has been majorly successful and this further accentuates the need for solutions to eradicate Cutaneous Leishmaniasis as well in countries in the Americas and the Middle-East.
Cases outside the 12 mainly affected and controlled districts are also increasing in numbers slightly. This highlights the importance of our discussion with Dr Acosta where along with new vector control strategies, biological vector survey needs to be carried out often to look at the indigenous transmission of the disease.
We researched the areas affected by Leishmaniasis, and debated which country would be most beneficial to visit to find these answers. Following careful deliberation, we decided to go to Honduras in Central America.
                                    Figure 1 Figure 1                          
We chose Honduras due to the immense numbers of reported cases of Leishmaniasis in the country and due to the current climate of governmental support for the disease. Last year, approximately 700 cases of Leishmaniasis were reported in the Choluteca county alone (South western Honduras), and the numbers of cases seem to be increasing exponentially. Also, due to focus on the arbovirus Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, governmental support is distracted from Leishmaniasis. Hence, the current lack of hope in Honduras in the battle against Leishmaniasis made it the perfect location to explore with our solution.
Suazo Hospital, Tegucigalpa
Our first task following arrival on Honduras soil was to visit the Alonso Suazo public hospital in the capital city, Tegucigalpa. We met with Dr. Cristian Valladares, who was working in the diagnosis laboratory for Leishmaniasis in the hospital. One of our team members, Yensi, could speak Spanish fluently, hence breaking the communication barrier with the staff. On entry, we were amazed by the differences between the laboratories that we were used to seeing at home in Ireland and the laboratory before our"

Figure 3: Design of future perspectives of how to use the sensor in daily life
The test itself will be provided as a handkerchief that is delivered in a bag with a pre stamped envelope. The bag contains the handkerchief, woven out of phage-integrated thread. The person that takes the test has to give a sputum sample on the handkerchief. To start the test, the tissue has to be put back into the bag and closed. By gently squeezing the bag, the integrated liquid vessel breaks and releases the X-gal solution which is needed to give an color output of the reporter. If the handkerchief turns blue, this means, that a specific gene e.g. a specific gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been detected. If it doesn't turn blue, this means the target gene is not present and hence in the case of the mycobacterium gene the person doesn't have tuberculosis. This sensor and test can in principle be used for every gene and organism and can also be modified to sense other pathogenic bacteria or specific genes like antibiotic resistances a strain carries.
Background
CRISPRs
   The mechanism we are using for our sensor is based on the CRISPR/Cas System. The CRISPR/Cas genome editing method, which recently became very popular, is derived from the bacterial “immune system”. CRISPRs are Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats that are part of the bacterial genome. These loci contain multiple short repeats. In between the repeats are so called spacers that are sequences derived from extrachromosomal DNA, e.g. from invading viruses or plasmids (Figure 4). Within bacteria, those CRISPRs are naturally used to detect and destroy foreign DNA that is saved in the spacers.
In total the CRISPRs and the spacers form a so-called CRISPR array that is transcribed as one unit. CRISPR associated proteins (Cas proteins) are involved in further processing and action steps of the CRISPR system. There are many different regulation systems, here we describe the Cas9 system that will be used for our purposes (Figure 4).
The transcribed mRNA is processed into so called crRNA (CRISPR RNA), which includes the spacer sequence of foreign DNA. Together with a transactingCRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), the crRNA forms a duplex that is cleaved by RNaseII. The resulting hybrid serves as guide for the Cas9 protein that generates double strand breaks at the position the RNAs"

The Event
Together with the iGEM teams from Bonn, Freiburg, Munich, Marburg and Tübingen, we decided to organize a nation-wide event in order to promote Synthetic Biology, the iGEM competition and, of course, our individual projects.  We picked September 7th for this “SynBio Day”, when every participating team set up a booth in their respective home town. In Bielefeld, we set up a booth in front of our town hall. There, we put up posters explaining the basics of Synthetic Biology, as well as our microbial fuel cell project.  A microscope, connected to a TV, enabled our visitors to examine appearance and movement of different microorganisms. To entertain and educate our young attendants, we also prepared several different experiments and games. We let them use pipettes to mix different kinds of food coloring in well plates. This allowed them to get a first impression of one of the aspects of labwork. With filter paper, they were able to do simple chromatography experiments with different kinds of felt pens/markers. We guided children through DNA isolation experiments using fruits and simple household materials.  The isolated DNA was filled  into small reaction tubes and sealed so that the children could take their self-extracted DNA home. The children were learning in hands-on experiments and were introduced"

Preparations for Mini-preps
Three colonies were extracted from the 200ul cotC-GFP-smtA transformant cells plate and used, under aseptic conditions, to inoculate 3 x 5ml LB+kanamycin tubes. In the same way three colonies from the 200ul kinA transformant cells plate was used to inoculate 3 x 5ml LB+kanamycin tubes. These six tubes were then placed in the orbital shaking incubator at 37C for overnight growth.
Preparations for Midi-preps
When setting up 50ml LB cultures for midi-preps it is usual practice to inoculate the 50ml of LB with 50ul of LB culture taken from an overnight growth. However time was running short so we decided to take a risk and inoculate two flasks of 50ml LB + kanamycin directly from plates; one flask inoculated with 1 colony of kinA transformants and the second flask of 50ml LB+kanamycin inoculated with 1 colony of cotC-GFP-smtA transformants. These flasks were too placed in the orbital shaking incubator at 37C for overnight growth.
Stochastic Switch Team
Today we miniprepped sac and ara and carried out a test digest (EcoRI and PstI) on the samples in order to check if the insert hed ligated correctly. We also digested Hanny and James' sleB miniprep which needed to be cut with NheI and EcoRI. As it happened clear bands could not be seen for the ara and sleB lanes.
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
Introduction
The transformation of sleB:pSB1AT3 did work with DH5-alpha strain, but no colony grows for JM109 strain. We need pick colonys for mini prep to check whether our transformation was right or not.Here I made a mistake , for I only pick up 1 colony for mini prep. After we got the transformation result, we should pick more colonys for mini prep because we can't assure that all colonys contains right clone. My single colony turn out to be the wrong one.

Our Vision
""Collaboration leads to a better and more accepted technology""
Consultation with both university specialists and beekeepers has pointed out the main cause of the Colony Collapse Disorder: Varroa destructor. Our collaboration with the Design Academy Eindhoven has led to a design of our final application, and in collaboration with Synenergene and Resource Wageningen we created a magazine of the future where we illustrated the techno-moral consequences of our technology. Two small research reports have been composed within Wageningen UR courses: an ethics report exploring the moral boundaries of do it yourself (DIY) synthetic biology, and a team building advisory report.   Finally, we invited the other Dutch iGEM teams for a national meetup.
We contacted the NBV, Dutch Association for Beekeepers, in order to understand the impact of V. destructor on bees and beekeepers. In addition, Bob"

Technion_Israel,2015,Team:Technion Israel#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," of this simulation is close to the result of the activity check .
Reaction rate vs. DHT concentrations
We simulated the system for varying initial concentrations of DHT at \[\left[ {NADPH} \right] = {150_{\left[ {\mu M} \right]}}\]. For each initial concentration we took the derivative of NADPH at t=0 (in absolute value), which is the maximal reaction rate for the set of initial conditions.
Figure 6 - Initial reaction rate vs. Initial DHT concentration. The behaviour is similar to the results .
The result from the simulation is very similar to the wetlab result, with the reaction rate saturating as the concentration of DHT increases. This can be explained by our model since we saw that for low concentrations of \(3\alpha  - diol\) and NADP the reaction is close to michaelis menten.
Enzymatic activity as a function of NADPH concentration
As noted in the results section, we observed a decrease in the reaction rate with an increase in NADPH concentration in presence of 3ɑ-HSD enzyme, contrary to substrate dependency. One possible explanation for this is cofactor inhibition - the addition of DHT to the lysate with the enzyme and NADPH was done 30 minutes after adding the NADPH to the lysate, in order for the reaction between NADPH and the lysate to reach steady state. During that time, there was a decrease in NADPH levels from their initial values. We hypothesized that some of the NADPH was converted to NADP, which in turn was bound to the enzyme. Since There is no \(3\alpha-diol\) in the system, the oxidation reaction cannot take place so the enzymes that are bound to NADP molecules cannot participate in another reaction. In this state, NADP inhibit the reduction of DHT.
In order to verify that the model can actually describe this result, we took the initial concentrations of NADPH from the experiment and checked those levels under 30 minutes. We made an assumption that most of the molecules of NADPH that broke down before the addition of DHT were converted to NADP. Under this assumption, we ran a simulation with the initial conditions of the wetlab experiment after 30 minutes:
Figure 7 - Initial reaction rate vs. Initial NADPH and NADP concentrations.
As can be seen in the figure, the derivatives were the high for the reactions in which the NADPH/NADP ratio was high, and vice versa.

Aim
- To share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school students.
Description
Our workshop targeted on future high school igem teams in Hong Kong. Prior to the sharing session, we got feedback that only a few high school students plan to join the iGEM in future. Our team was invited to teach them how to start an iGEM project.
We introduced a “Top-down Design” which is a common and easy method for high school students to brainstorm a project idea. We used the example of planning our summer vacation as a parallel comparison with the “Top-down Design” topic - building a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.
Achievement
The students were appreciated by the concept and had a brief knowledge on project-designing. The teachers were really impressed by the workshop and had a strong interest in recruiting HKUST iGEM team to mentor and advise these students in the future.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

filter_dramaOverview
The NJU iGEM team believes there are two main aspects of “Human Practices”: public outreach to the non-technical community as well as education engagement; and collaboration within the academic and iGEM community. For both sides, we participated in a series of engagement exercises, including consulting with patients and doctors about potential application spaces for our research technology, educational and investigating outreach to the local Nanjing community, and collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to improve their projects and presentations.
filter_dramaQuestionnaire and Propagation online
We believe science is everywhere and it is a part of each person’s everyday life. For most people without science background, synthetic biology and targeting therapy seems to be a very far-off topic. In order to offer better understanding about synthetic biology and the targeting therapy applied in our project, we did a grand scaled questionnaire on social network and then gathered data for a thorough analogy.
Conclusion of normal group questionnaire
Basic situations of the investigation group
● Effective investigation number: 780.
● Age distribution: 18~50 years of age accounted for the dominant.
● Education level: 66.67% for bachelor degree, the survey group basically has the education background of high school or above.
● Family economic conditions: the vast majority of respondents are of well-off level.
The respondents’ understanding of cancer is relatively simple, one-sided and inadequate.
The way of understanding cancer is limited. Most people learn about it from media reports, even though they are uneven in quality.
Figure 1. Rumor of Tumors…
● While the respondents generally recognize that if detected early, cancer can be treated and cured in time, the data notes that there are still nearly 15% of respondents identifying cancer as a terminal and incurable disease.
● The majority of respondents still have a fear of malignancy cancer, which is believed to be their nightmare scenario. Notably, among the 780 valid surveys, only 39.1% are aware of that, during the last decade in China, LUNG cancer made the highest mortality rates amid all types of cancers; 30.9% chose liver cancer, which is of the same high degree of malignancy with Lung cancer; the remaining 30"

Designing an RBS library with the constraints that were present in our constructs was very difficult and Iman helped us to understand and solve this problem.  Iman taught the Biodetoxification group the protocol for Gibson CBA and homologous recombination. Dr. Salis provided modifications to the protocol using the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid.
Wiki Support
Chiam Yu was helpful with advice. Ashlee spent a lot of time surfing the internet and found tutorials and resources for html and CSS. None of us have experience with creating a website prior to iGEM so it was quite a daunting task.
Presentation Coaching
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard both improved our presentation skills.
Kay Dimarco (staff) helped us to find activity kits from the previous iGEM team, which we ended up reinventing but were a source of inspiration for our presentation to the science teachers and the ScienceU students. Matt Johnson (staff) and Leah Bug (staff) gave us advice on our NewBio Teachers presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools.
Policy and Practices Support
Dr. Tom Richard helped us to refine and implement our ideas for human practices topics.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," optimize the production of PHB in E. coli (BL21) and modify substrate concentrations involved in the rate-limiting steps.
Week 8 & 9: July 10 - July 21
FBA:   For the flux balance analysis we found an e coli model for our strain, which is BL21 (DE3). The model was found from the BiGG database. We looked into the genes and reactions it contained and the reactions that have to be added to the model. The genes of interest that the model already contained are:
FadD
FadE
tolC
LacY
LacZ
We found that we needed to add the following genes and as a result their reactions:
PhaA
PhaB1
PhaC1
HlyA
HlyB
We also used a plugin called Paint4Net to visualise the pathways/reactions in the model. A zoomed in section of the visual representation of FBA analysis resulting from calling the ""draw_by_rxn"" command for the coli_core_model is given in figure 1.
Figure 1. A zoomed in section of the Paint4Net dray_by_rxn command on the ecoli_core_model.
Kinetic:   After deciding to do a kinetic model. We brainstormed what questions we would try to answer with our model.   We wanted to compare PHB production via the beta-oxidation pathway and the glycolysis pathway. Therefore we would create a model with phaJ and phaC and another with phaC, phaB, and phaA. We also wanted to compare overexpressing fadD and fadE and see which one had a higher effect on PHB yield. The following are two other systems we hope to model. Some other questions we considered answering with our kinetic model include: What is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of PHB? What is the rate-limiting step in the secretion of PHB?  With those questions in mind, we started searching for existing models for beta-oxidation and PHB synthesis. We decided to base the PHB synthesis part of our model on the one created by the 2013 Imperial team. [1] For the beta-oxidation part, since we could not find an established model we looked at the pathways for degradation of oleic acid (the main long-chain fatty acid in our media) via beta-oxidation (Ren et al., 2004).

COMPARISON WITH OUR METHOD
Y/N
 
Status: EXPIRED. Now this   patent has expired. Importantly – it   covers our
project as we have a heterologous protein being attached via a secretion tag   to the actual plasmid vector design.
 
Y
 
A method for producing a   heterologous protein in a bacterial host cell such that the protein is   exported from the host cell into the culture medium, the method comprising   culturing in a bacterial culture medium a genetically engineered bacterial   strain containing a fusion DNA sequence which comprises a first nucleotide   sequence encoding at least an N-terminal portion of a flagellin protein native to the bacterial host cell species and a second nucleotide   sequence encoding the heterologous protein, said first nucleotide sequence   being linked via its 3' terminus to the 5' terminus of the second DNA   sequence and said fusion DNA sequence being operatively linked to an   expression control sequence and wherein said N-terminal portion results in   the export of said heterologous protein.
 
 
 
 
Our plasmid falls directly   into this means of production. As this patent has since expired and we fall   under it – the   methods that are encoded are free to be used and thus not for law suit.

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," an article in 1999 in which they detailed the construction of a bioreporter that detected sucrose and tryptophan in soil using promoters that were sensible those compounds (Jaeger III, Lindow, Miller, Clarck, & Firestone, 1999). That same year, another group reported their results for a biosensor that produced Green Fluorescent Protein in the presence of L-arabinose using a pBAD promoter (Shetty, Ramanathan, Badr, Wolford, & Daunert, 1999). There were also reports of biosensors used to detect certain types of contaminants such as Toluene and its derivatives (Willardson, et al., 1998).
Bacterial bioreporters are the most common type of whole-cell bioreporters used today. Bacteria are preferred because they are easy to manipulate genetically and they are able to survive in a wide diversity of media. This versatility makes them very attractive because they have a number of applications in different areas. Biosensors can be great diagnosis tools in the medical industry, especially for compounds that are hard to detect using other methods. And, recently many people have begun to see their potential in environmental science because they can detect the presence of contaminants that could be hard to analyze using conventional methods. Kiyohito Yagi reports that biosensors can be especially useful to detect heavy metals, and genotoxic materials (Yagi, 2007).
The advantage of using a biological sensor instead of a chemical or physical sensor is that biological components have great specificity, sensitivity and portability, since they usually don’t require large and expensive equipment. However, within the industry, there are many types of biological systems that can be used as sensors, such as enzymes, antibodies, sub-cellular components and the whole cell. The advantage of choosing a whole-cell bioreporter is that they are far more versatile than enzymes and other biological alternatives. Enzymes often require long purification steps in order to reach the level of purity required for these types of tests, which often increase the price of the system. Besides, enzymes only work on certain temperatures and pH conditions. Using microorganisms permits a much greater flexibility. Since bacteria grow in such a great diversity of environments, it is easy to choose an appropriate strain to carry out the job that is required. They are also cheaper because they don’t require sophisticated purification techniques and they can be grown using inexpensive medium. A final advantage of whole-cell biological sensors is that they can analyze samples through processes that require many enzymes, something that is not as easy when using other systems (Yagi, "

iGEM at Sorbonne Université
Sorbonne University was born on January 1, 2018, from the merger of the Paris-Sorbonne and Pierre and Marie Curie universities. The purpose of pooling the strengths of these two institutions is to lead and train future players in world-class research, presenting the full range of disciplines in the fields of literature, the arts, the humanities and social sciences, the sciences, engineering and medicine.
As Sorbonne University students, we are proud to bring to the international scene of synthetic biology the values of scientific excellence and openness to the world of our university already rich in history.
The first iGEM UPMC-Paris team was created in 2016 at the initiative of students in the Master of Molecular and Cellular Biology who recognized themselves in the values of iGEM and allowed the creation of a second team in 2017 Both teams were able to lead with determination their projects ""Bee subtilis"" and “The BioMaker Factory” rewarded by a Bronze Medal.
We have set up a tutoring system between the previous teams and this year's team, which allows us to exchange and benefit from their experience of the competition, which with the help of our teachers gives us every chance to win the competition. highest award of the contest.
