1.1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
1.2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
1.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being fact"

Growth Curve Measurement
In order to determine the correct timing to co-culture our modified E.coli with Chlorella vulgaris, we evaluated growth curve of Chlorella vulgaris. We measured the OD value at 680nm by using the spectrophotometer and plotted the growth curve with R software.
However, we encountered some difficulties such as irregular measurement time and personal errors. Therefore, we decided to search for a better measurement method. Later, we borrowed a photo-bioreactor from Professor Ya Tang Yang, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, and used it to measure OD values from microalgae cultures.
The above line chart presents growth curve of Chlorella vulgaris. This measurement lasted more than 216 hours and the picture roughly meets our expectation.
Although the later part of growth curve shows violent fluctuating data, it may be due to effects from environmental nitrogen metabolites of Chlorella vulgaris.
The measurement result helps us determine the lipid production duration of Chlorella vulgaris, and the timing to add NrtA-transformed E. coli into the medium.
Automatic Measurement
In the photo-bioreactor, there are four light-emitting diode sources and two photodetectors. Once calibrated, the device can cultivate microbial cells and record their growth expression without human intervention. We measured two different kinds of microalgae during cell growth in the same culture medium, BG-11, respectively.
The photo-bioreactor was designed by Professor Yang. It was made with Arduino and some circuit components. Yang’s students also helped us assemble the device and taught us how to use this device. The photo-bioreactor itself can detect multiple units of organisms at the same time, it has pumps, fans, stir bars and some light bars. In Yang’s laboratory, we created a calibration curve for correcting and we confirmed that there was a very high degree of correlation between voltage and OD value. This can be observed in the charts"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," receptors by applying directed evolution to Tar chemoreceptors. To enable E. coli to perceive novel substances five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site were the target. Our method of choice is targeted saturation mutagenesis. In comparison to random mutagenesis, this has the advantage to specifically mutate the selected amino acid residues.
Chapter I: Preparing Tar for the Library
The amplification of Tar was carried out directly from the E. coli K12 genome. We introduced the BioBrick standard restriction sites by primer design (see sequencing primers ; Tar for + prefix & Tar rev + suffix). The amplified BioBrick part was then inserted into the vector pUC18. To get rid of BioBrick standard restriction sites in tar, a QuikChange reaction was applied. The XbaI site (nt 420-425) was exchanged from TCTAGt to CCTAGt while keeping the codon for the same amino acid. Our next step was to express the quikchanged tar (TAR_QC) under the constitutive Anderson promoters .
Figure 10: Promoter comparison through a chemotaxis assay. Eight promoters of the „Anderson“ collection were cloned in front of the gene coding for the Tar receptor inside the pSB1C3 backbone. Here, we compared the swimming behavior of these strains in chemotaxis assay with M9-swimming agar plates. The chemotaxis assay was conducted as described in the methods section. L-aspartate served as the attractant in the central Whatman paper. The numbers next to each halo correspond to the promoter activities reported by the Berkley University in 2006. (A) The constructs were transformed in the Δtar strain. The picture was taken after 3 days incubation at 33 °C. The halos of the strongest promoters (J23100, x2547 and J23104, x1831) had a slightly bigger radius than the other promoter constructs. In addition, slight chemotaxis could be observed for these strains. The drop of the construct J23106 was smeared during the application and is therefore not evaluable. (B) The constructs were transformed in the BL21 strain, that naturally expresses the Tar receptor. The picture was taken after 1 day incubation at 33 °C. In general, halo size did not vary strongly. The halos of the strongest promoters (J23100, x2547 and J23104, x1831) had the biggest radius. The halo of  J23106 (x1185) showed the smallest radius, although this promoter has"

Synthetic biology
“engineering microbial ‘polka dots’ toward synthetic biology”:
Synthetic biology uses only sequence info in order to implement an objective biological system. Biological systems engineering employs and modifies naturally existing biological systems in order to make them behave as intended.  iGEM tends to fall into the biological systems engineering category since we take existing parts and put them together rather than coming up with a sequence.
System design:
Parts vs device vs system
ie: radio vs radio+speakers.
protein vs multiple proteins (ie: repressors) to create an inverter vs multiple interacting inverters.
Principles in biological systems engineering:
1. Abstraction—provide a big picture without detailed characteristics of the intended system (part, device and system)
2. Standardization—enable interfacing among parts, devices, and systems. Predictable/reproducible performance. (we don’t have to worry about this so much since most of what we use is in biobrick format)
3. Decoupling—efficient way to deal with complexity. Getting rid of interference.  Considering other effects of utilization of the metals
4. What devices are needed for the system. Think about what existing devices to couple with the devices we want to make.
5. Connect the devices needed.
6. Implementation, detailed design of parts needed. What promoter, RBS, terminator do we want to use? What kind of regulation?
7. Part level system configuration—how all the parts interact in the system.
8.  Synthesis, compilation, DNA layout, sequence information.
9. Debugging the system. Looking at each part, testing if it works in the system, where something might have gone wrong if it’s not working. Individually test each part in the device by putting GFP downstream to receive output from each element and manually introduce input signal.
10. Final output and sequence information.
Intial simple modeling: Think about where the system will fail. Metal toxicity, low transcription/translation activity.
Make sure to provide good documentation of our device. Don’t necessarily have to get everything working.
Plan out objectives for the summer, steps for achieving the goal.
Research topics:
1. Metal resistance
2. Magnetosomes
3.  Metal mobilization
4.  Metal"

Promoter design, characterization and consequences
The generation of well-characterized genetic parts is a prerequisite for the rational design and construction of reliable genetically-encoded devices and systems.  However, most publicly available parts (including those in the Registry) remain largely uncharacterized.  Therefore, we propose a minimal measurement standard for the quantitative characterization of one of the most frequently used parts, promoters.  This approach uses both mRNA and protein measurements to provide a tractable and universal analysis of relevant promoter characteristics.  In an effort to elucidate promoter design principles, we have also designed and characterized new promoter and enhancer sequences.  Our goal is to contribute to the advancement of fundamental synthetic biology by evaluating the performance of new and existing promoters and enhancers, which may serve as a model for describing other basic parts such as ribosome-binding sites and transcriptional terminators.

Content of Registry of Standard Parts
57% of participants agree that the number of parts registered      in the Registry of Standard Parts is not enough for their projects.
55% of participants think that there are enough and      useful parts distributed in iGEM Plates that we can use in our projects.
Even though most agree the number of parts in the registry is impressive,     still they find it limited when it comes to design different devices     for diverse applications especially in different species other than     E. Coli. Participants believe that if there are more functional standardized     parts, especially protein coding sequences and promoter-RBS , they can     design devices according to the needs of the community instead of designing     what can simply be assembled into a device.
Encouraging development of vectors and standards for new species     and new standardized parts in different research areas is suggested.
Enforcing submission of right DNA sequences and working conditions     for each part is suggested.
Few recommend expanding iGEM into a collaborative effort rather     than an undergraduate tournament, which will increase the number and     the diversity of the parts designed and submitted all throughout the     year.
Submission to the Parts Registry
52% of participants said that they have not encountered      difficulties during submitting parts. Even though participants      are satisfied with the web interface of the registry, most complains      about the pSB1C3 as the new standard plasmid to submit DNA.
71% of participants are like minded with our team's      opinion, which is that The nomenclature of part IDs such as construct,      device, composite parts, protein generator, is confusing as there      is no consensus on how to use them correctly.
Terminology and categorization used on iGEM’s Parts Registry should     be re-described and correct use of terminology should be enforced during     the submission process.
75% of participants agree that different, specified      submission interfaces should be designed for contructs, promoter,      RBS, CDS and terminals is needed during Registry of Standard Parts. But, there are very strong and valid arguments against it such as,      losing the flexibility of the registry will not allow future submission      of unclassified parts.
We suggest keeping the parts submission interface as is, until     these concerns are addressed.
75% of participants agree that Out-dated, un-available      and not-characterized parts in the Registry of Standard Parts should      be removed to an archive after the consent of the designer.
“It would be great to see some sort of organization like this! I     agree that unavailable parts should be followed up on and removed"

YgiV
YgiV is a transcription factor that represses a second transcription factor called YncC. This second transcription factor blocks a third protein called YbiM. YbiM is a periplasmic protein that induces excess colanic acid production and inhibits biofilm formation.
By overexpressing YgiV, we hope to amplify the effect of RcsB while also preventing biofilm formation.

""No road of flowers lead to glory.""
To develop and optimise our STEP system to achieve the goal of efficient tumour marker recognition, we set out to test the whole system in human cell lines, and at the same time combine computational design and wet lab experiment to optimise existing receptors.
We successfully proved that the STEP receptors can appropriately locate across the cell membrane, and that they are able to bind to activate the downstream receptor when target ligand is added.

Kyoto,2018,Team:Kyoto#Furtherapplication_-_-_TEXT.html," annual loss of $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide [5]. Therefore, urgent measures are required. RNAi expression in plants is a powerful weapon against these pathogenic nematodes, so development of such technology has a strong potential for application.
The B. x. B. system we developed can be used as a preliminary RNAi evaluation system to target plant-specific pathogens, before initiating breeding of recombinant crops. If efficient breeding is carried out and countermeasures progress, many plant diseases will be abolished, which will have a strong impact on resolving current threats to global food resources.

SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," us promote our Mini Program by posting their story on it and giving us some suggestions on program design.
SUSTech_Shenzhen
This year we kept in touch with SUSTech_Shenzhen team. We came to visit their team and talked about our projects and problems we met. Later we were invited to visit their lab, and they shared their electron microscope with us as soon as we required it. They also gave us suggestions on downstream of our projects like fungal fermentation and model design. We characterized the part together and made sure the sequence of Biobrick part is correct.
SSTi-SZGD
Prior to last year’s collaboration, this year we had an even stronger collaborating relationship with SSTI-SZGD team. At an early stage of our project, we encountered some problems in the transformation of Bacillus subtilis strain. We had previous experience working with Bacillus species, so we set up a meeting to help them with the transformation as well as technical trouble shooting. They did manage to successfully transform our B.subtilis 168 based on their suggestions. In the later stage of protein purification step, we also lend a vacuum pump to them to be used in affinity chromatography.
In return, SSTI-SZGD helped us by sharing our iGEM Interlab kits as they ran out some of the key materials in their experiment. By providing silica Beads and Fluorescein Sodium Salt, we were able to finish their Interlab project on time. Additionally, they helped us promote our Mini Program by sharing the process of their team project on their program and giving us detailed feedback after using it.
Reference can be seen in the site of Collaboration site of SSTI-SZGD.
OUC-China
This year we collaborated with OUC-China in our public engagement. OUC-China made a 13 language translated comic book E.coli spacebook. We contacted them and asked for Chinese and English versions for our science popularization in Yueliangwan Primary School, with their supply, students at the primary school had a better understanding of synthetic biology. Reciprocally, we gave them a detailed feedback and suggestion on improving the logic of the whole story.
H14Z1_Hangzhou
This year, we made a new collaboration with the iGEM team (H14Z1) in Hangzhou NO.14 High School. They need to screen several compatible strains to produce their “smart yogurts ” with their constructed L. lactis together.

Glycerol Stock
Glycerol stock solution was created by initially grown the original sample strain on an agarose gel plate overnight. Colonies grown overnight were then picked and placed into LB broth solution containing ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 deg C on the shaker. The cells were formed into a pellet and resuspended in a 50:50 glycerol and LB stock solution mixture. Cells were then stored for later use in a -80 deg C freezer.
Digestions
Samples contained a mixture of water, buffer plasmid and appropriate enzymes. Samples were incubated at 37deg C with NEB or Promega restriction enzymes for at least 3 hours to ensure complete digestion. Samples were then run on a 1% gel to determine the band size and if the digest had occurred.
Agarose Gel
DNA grade agarose powder was mixed into 1x TAE and heated until fully dissolved to create either a 1% or 2% gel depending on the experimental parameters. The heated mixure is then poured into a mold and allowed to set. Gels were post-stained using Ethidium Bromide, then visualized with a UV transilluminator. All gels were run with an appropriate ladder depending on the size of the fragments.
In-gel extraction
Bands were excised with a scalpel blade viewed using a UV box removing all of the band with as little of the agarose from the gel.

Collaboration with Ecovative
Summary
Our collaboration with Ecovative proved challenging yet rewarding. Since few iGEM teams have partnered with a corporation in the past, we were faced with the task of developing a new approach to safely apply our research in synthetic biology to a consumer-ready product. Ecovative supported our efforts by giving us tours of their facilities and advice on protoplasting fungi. They also offered to grow our strains and conduct material testing on our genetically engineered product. Ecovative can begin to implement our research once it reaches completion.
TEDTalk by Gavin McIntyre, the co-founder and chief scientist of Ecovative
History of Corporate Partnerships
The iGEM organization has a strong history of developing tools to support industries in need. However, most of these results are lost post-competition as a result of a lack of funding and awareness. We believe that one of the novelties of our project is the direct collaboration with a corporation and the continuation of the genetically engineered product after competition. Our work with Ecovative ensures that Organofoam will continue solving a pressing environmental issue.
In previous years, teams have received corporate sponsorships but have rarely found a company willing to insert their research into a consumer market. Last year, our team had a very close relationship with the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative. OSLI is a collaborative network of companies operating in the Canadian oil sands that sponsored iGEM teams to develop new technologies to address challenges in oil sands extraction and reclamation. Teams had the opportunity to submit their research as a solution to Canada’s current oil sands problems. Although some teams did receive recognition from OSLI, the work has yet"

vi)Phage solution was allowed to sit and mix with E coli solution for 20mL. This will let phage attach to bacteria
2. Addition of agar and plating
i)Top agar was warmed/liquefied by microwaving.
Microwaving doesn’t see to work so well, a better alternative would be to use a warm water bath.
ii) 5mL of liquid top agar was added to test tube; mixed well with phage + bacteria solution
iii)5mL of the mixed solution was transferred to the LB plate. The top agar was spread to from a uniform layer.
iv)The same process were repeated the test tube 0-6.
3. Check up on phage + bacteria viability in 24-48 hours
Amber - T2 Arick - T5 Darren - T3
V) Results
We ran into several problems while doing the titer. After we had completed the titer, we found out that the pipet tips we had used were contaminated. When preparing the top agar, we had to melt it in the microwave which caused it to boil over. This could have caused some contamination. While filling my -5 plate with top agar, there was only enough to put in 4mL of agar instead of the 5mL that was called for in our procedure.
None of the plates had any phage. There was just a lawn of bacteria growing. This could either be because of the problems mentioned above or because the source of phage were bad. Seeing as nobody was able to grow any phage we believe that the source was old.

iGEM at Tsinghua University
This year, our team launched collaboration with the iGEM team at Tsinghua-A University.
Tsinghua-A’s iGEM project aims at constructing a synthetic biology circuit to seek insights into noise propagation as well as measure the capacity of parallel information channels. To better scrutinize the information flow mechanism, they planned run computational simulations on Matlab combined with the wet lab work. However, when they were simulating their system with Gillespie Algorithm, they fell short of computing power when it came to scanning the parameters. Due to the limited time frame, it was indeed a big challenge for them to deal with the difficulty shortly.
Knowing about their urgent need, immediately, our team decided to assist them by utilizing the equipment resources as well as team members with required intellect. Through a series of online conversations, we soon figured out the background information about their project and planned out a feasible solution to help them out. We actively communicated with several relevant research groups at ShanghaiTech as well as the nearby SARI (Shanghai Advanced Research Institute) to seek qualified computational platform. Then, we modified and operated the algorithm where we mainly scanned several key parameters, Ka (dimer association rate) and Kd (dimer dissociation rate constant). As later commented by the Tsinghua-A iGEM Team, it was our timely help that significantly boosted the efficiency of their project.
Meanwhile, benefiting from this connection, frequent team communications were raised as well. After exchanging the idea with regards of the projects, members from the Tsinghua-A showed strong interests in our Solar Hunter system. To better illustrate our biofilm-based platform strategy, the wiki-design team at Tsinghua-A depicted a brief mechanism of our project in a cartoon style, which provided us some inspirations to design our own big picture later on. The figure they drew is used and also can be seen on our Wiki page.

iGEM at Jiangsu Normal University
For this year’s competition, our team collaborated with the iGEM Team at Jiangsu Normal University.
JSNU’s project aims at applying anthocyan to a potential cancer therapy. Their early experiments were conducted based on the HEK293T where has a low expression of KLF4 compare with GES1. To better test their idea,various cancer cell lines were required for the further explorations. However, when they turned to work on the cancer cells, they realized"
Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," so we were cutting out ~50 base pairs of our chromoprotein unintentionally which is why the color was not being seen when we did the Gibson assembly. We will now use this information to create new primers and insert the fragment of the chromoprotein directly into our backbone and use the his-tag to PCR into next to our chromoprotein. Hopefully we will then see color when the Gibson assembly is performed.
●
Ordered primers for our Gibson assembly of our DNA 2.0 chromoproteins and flag-lumino his-tag. The primers are for the vector forward and reverse and the his-tag forward and reverse. We also ordered primers to linearize our chromoprotein with its ribosome binding site attached which then can be directly inserted into our backbone using Gibson assembly.
Monday, 8/29
●
Performed spectra readings the extracted and purified and concentrated AE blue - CBD - His-Tag. Blanked nano drop with the flow through from the concentration of the extracted protein. The blank did not work so instead we blanked with 1X TBS buffer and this worked a lot better. We saw a peak at ~ 590 nm which is the color orange. It is showing a peak here because it is absorbing blue and reflecting orange which is the reading we are seeing.
●
We then heated our AE blue-CBD-His-tag for an hour at 50 °C in order to gain a color change and perform spectra readings on this
○
After and hour no color change was seen so they were put in for another hour at the same temperature and no color change was observed
○
They were then put in at 70 °C for an hour and when taken out one of the AE blue was murkier blue and the other was a green color
●
We created more TBS to use in dialysis when purifying the chromoproteins
●
The primers we ordered on Friday came in so ran a PCR of all 12 chromoproteins to isolate them as a fragment and also ran a PCR on the His-tag to add the Gibson tails
●
Created a liquid culture of meffRed which we will mini prep tomorrow for use as our backbone
Tuesday, 8/30
●
Mini prepped the meffRed and then ran a PCR and PCR cleanup to isolate the vector and promoter we wanted
○
The PCR cleanup when nano dropped showed no product so something went wrong with the PCR or extraction because DNA was present after the mini prep.

University_College_London,2012,Team:University College London#HumanPractice#MOYM_-_-_TEXT.html," our research quickly revealed that these topics had been already been well-publicized and thoroughly discussed.  We decided to try and avoid the tired and abstract moral/ethical questions, and bring our debate into a more concrete setting by using a ‘crisis scenario’.
Crisis scenario
The crisis scenario was inspired by the Rathenau Institute’s Synbio futures ,  a series of ‘techno-moral vignettes’ – short stories imagining possible futures in which synthetic biology technologies have become commonplace.  Our crisis scenario, which is set in 2030, imagines the mutation of widely-used synthetic fertilizer, FertiBac, to produce a toxin that is spreading into crops and waterways.  See the full scenario here .
Using this crisis scenario we provide a framework for the debate by setting out a possible future in which the fears raised by synthetic biology have come true – to discuss the ‘what now’ rather than the ‘what if’, to debate in practicalities rather than generalities.
The debate
We are very pleased to have Annemiek Nelis of the Dutch Safety Board chairing our section of the Meeting of Young Minds.  We will also have a panel of representatives from the UEA Norwich and Paris Bettencourt iGEM teams, the Oxford Conservative Association, GreenLeft Youth Organization, and National Federation of Young Farmer’s Clubs, amongst others.
They will act as the ‘European Council of Synthetic Biology’, who will come together in a public hearing in the aftermath of the crisis. They will be responsible for deciding the best course of action to take and interrogating members of our team, as the scientist, manufacturer, marketer, and regulator of the failed technology.  We will also hear questions and suggestions from the public, of which the best three suggestions will be announced on the iGEM wiki and the Rathenau website.
Position Paper
As preparation for the debate, we were asked to write a 2500-word position paper.  The paper, which is available here , is divided into three parts.  The first part, ‘The synthetic biology present’, presents the current legal situation around deliberate release and transboundary movement of synthetic organisms.  Part 2, ‘Next steps’, questions the need for changes to the existing legislation, as synthetic organisms move out of the laboratory towards industrial applications, to reflect the new challenges – real or perceived – posed by truly synthetic (as opposed to simply genetically modified) organisms.   Part 3 ‘Into the future’, deals with the issues posed by our crisis scenario, looking at issues of liability and at how such a crisis might affect the future of synthetic biology"

Thursday September 13th
We miniprepped the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase with the aerobic mutations that we did a SDM reaction to fix the deletion. We also analyzed the sequences that we just received this morning. We began our replating of the EMS mutations. We scraped the lawns and then resuspended them in 500 uL of the buffer A. Then we took the OD and diluted it down twice to get a solution that would have 150 cells per 200 uL. We also transformed in the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, and R0010 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015. We will use these for testing in the Tecan later on. We sent more things off for sequencing. One of our members, Christine Olson, was so dedicated and stayed until 11 PM to do over one hundred PCR screens. What a dedicated iGEMer. From our genomic sequencing, we ran the qPCR to quantify our concentration. Successful screened mutants at this point were T96A, D98T, S101A, V212A and F125Y. All sent in for sequencing.
Friday September 14th
We analyzed the qPCR results of the Strain E-15 EG3 library preparation for trial #3, and the genomic library yielded 220pM of DNA. This yield was not high enough to continue with genomic sequencing, so another library preparation needs to be set up.  A gel was run on the PCR screens done yesterday, but this did not give any bands. So, another PCR screen was set up directly from the previous rep plate. The EMS dilutions made yesterday were accidentally plated on LB carb plates, and not on ethylene glycol, so more dilutions were prepared today. A digestion was set up to ligate J23101 and K206000 together with one enzyme, dehydrogenase. However, it was digested at the wrong cut sites, and so the parts were redigested. The parts were gel purified afterwards to continue on with ligation on Monday. Gel screens run on T96A and Y127A successful transformed colonies. Succesful screens sent off for sequencing.

Providing glucose only should inhibit gene transcription. While providing arabinose only, the downstream expression system could be active.
In our design, we are going to make a modulization workflow so that it could be applied to any targeted gene.
In order to test the practicality of knocking-in, we used mRFP1 as a reporter to build a consecutive workflow. In light of the limited time, we used the plasmid original targeted site as our knock in site located in poxB8 which encodes the Pyruvate Oxidase of Escherichia coli, it9 has been verified that the loss of this gene won’t influence the vitality of E.coli in normal culture condition. In addition, we use Modified Gibson Assembly (see notebook) to adjoin the long plasmid backbone with the small insertion part by short homologous arms in vitro.
Besides we chose universal primers between BioBrick prefix and suffix so that we can easily clone the prats from any registry for knock-in. Therefore, we prepared the part we are going to knock-in including GFP+RFP with PAM rich targeted promoters and GFP with PAM targeted promoters. As for dCas9 protein, we make 2 expression cassettes, one contains the only dcas9 protein, the other contains short homologous arms between dCas9 protein and GFP with PAM rich targeted promoters
Results
In knock in part, we used Modified Gibson Assembly to construct the donor DNA and backbone which is prepared by high speed PCR enzymes (Primer STAR○R GXL). To get a good electroporation transformation efficiency, we purify the reaction product by column (E.Z.N.A.® Plasmid Mini Kit I). After SOC culture at 30℃ for 1h, we plated the electro transformation production on plate with 1%(w/v) glucose, and 50ng/ul kanamycin. Finally, we selected several colonies for screening and re-plated them.
After successfully plasmid construction, we selected new single colony for amplification and cultured colony with solid L-Ara (1%) media overnight and selected colony randomly for colony PCR which we get 2 in 14 has knock-in feature.
Then we re-plated the colony on plate. Interestingly not all the colony turn red at the same time.

Cofactor
We attempted to check the intracellular levels of NADPH by performing lysis by sonication.  However, the fluorescence levels were negligent, and some were even lower than the blank! We concluded that the sonication method may have caused the NADPH to breakdown.
We performed a lysis experiment in which we check various lysis procedures in order to determine intracellular NADPH in E. coli BL21 with pUC19 versus E. coli BL21 with the zwf gene.  The results for each lysis method showed higher intracellular fluorescence for the strain with the gene than the control, hinting that our gene does, in fact, increase intracellular NADPH.  We decided to use either a freeze-thaw method or a short sonication method from now on, since those showed the best results.

Secret"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#20 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," these steps do not get completed today, they can resumed tomorrow.
Practical Outline
The Metal Sensing team hope to carry out the following tasks today:
Conduct a mini-prep of the plasmids contained within the three transformant E.coli cultures (i.e. plasmid pSB1A3 containing BBa_J33206).
Carry out restriction digests on these plasmids using EcoRI and PstI.
Run both the undigested and digested plasmids on agarose gel in DNA gel electrophoresis.
Conduct midi-preps of the plasmids if gel results are positive.
Procedure
Despite having plans to carry out all four procedures listed above, only the following occurred today:
The mini-preps were conducted
Restriction enzyme digests were carried out.
0.8% Agarose gel made up.
1) Mini-Preps for the E.coli containing BBa_J33206
The white precipitation caused when Solution III (containing potassium acetate) is added to the sample, followed by a few inversions of the Eppendorf tubes
Mathew carrying out the steps included in the mini-prep procedure
To carry out this procedure Dr. Aldridge's Mini-Prep protocol was used.
There were a few changes to the protocol:
Step 1 requires that 3-5ml of culture grown overnight be used for the mini-prep. In actual fact we started this procedure with 2.5ml of culture; this is because the team inoculated 3ml of LB for each transformant grown on the plate and then used 0.5ml of those cultures to further inoculate 50ml of LB each (for the future midi-preps).
In addition to this, the 2.5ml of LB for each transformant culture was split into 2 Eppendorf tubes (meaning a total of six Eppendorf tubes because three cultures were extracted from the ampicillin LB plates). This decision was taken because it enables the smaller yet faster centrifuge to be used.
During the whole procedure the 3 x 2.5ml of culture remained divided into 2 Eppendorf tubes; they were never recombined. This proved helpful as it allowed one Eppendorf tube for each culture to hold undigested plasmid DNA and the second Eppendorf Tube for each culture to hold digested plasmids (once restriction enzymes were added). This can be carried out because the plasmid pSB1A3 has a high copy number.

Hello everybody! I am a biologist in her last year of a Biotechnology master.
I was a member of Valencia 2009 and 2010 iGEM team and I enjoyed so much both competitions that I wanted to participate one more time.
I am eager to start my PhD next year and feel the suffering but comforting experience of making science.
My main hobbies are reading, writing,      drawing, bellydancing and when my budget lets me to do it, traveling.
Carles Palanca
Hi! I have always enjoyed abstract topics like music and mathematics. Somehow I got interested in something much more terrestrial like molecular biology and I      decided to study biochemistry as my main career. I was a member of the Valencia iGEM team in 2009 and I have so many good memories about the whole project and      the Jamboree that I wanted to be a small part of the whole thing again. Now I'm doing my PhD in structural biology. I love music, so you can always see me singing     or maybe playing in some pub if you are lucky.

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Team#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"4th semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
My curiosity and enthusiasm towards life sciences has been the driving force to start the undergraduate course molecular biotechnology at Bielefeld University in October 2005. After the receipt of the Bachelor's degree I studied molecular biotechnology as part of an ERASMUS program at the Royal Institute of Technology in the beautiful city of Stockholm, the true Venice of the North. Following this I continued my studies at Bielefeld University and will receive my M. Sc. this November. Afterwards I will start a PhD within the CLIB-Graduate Cluster Industrial Biotechnology.
In my far too short free time, I prefer to relax with my friends, watch movies, go clubbing and various different things as long as they don’t remind me of the work waiting for me in the lab. I also love to geek and to look out for new neat gadgets.
""Economically interesting possibilities of synthetic biology are among others the production of new products and the acceleration of product development. Currently products of great economic and social importance are already beeing developed, such as the malaria drug Artemisinin.""
Kirsten Tschapalda
Currently in her 4th semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
During my studies I tried to grab a bite of expertise in every branch of biotechnology. Therefore I worked with bacteria, fungi, algae, and mammalian tissue. I produced various proteins or DNA and analyzed it in various ways. And during all this I finally found my passion: Purification. I don't care whether it's DNA or protein. I am pretty much into developing strategies in order to get a product as pure as possible and finally doing all tests necessary to verify that it is. This mania of cleanliness completely falls of me as soon as I leave the lab. I spend most of my leisure time outdoors: Horse riding, dog training, hiking and travelling are my biggest favors.
""I reckon that synthetic biology hides a bunch of unexpected prospects and currently we are only scratching the surface of a very complex and fast developing topic. Who knows what chances will show up in future? It is definitely a very exciting part of research.""

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," the sequencing results were examined in further detail, and it was determined that the entire gene sequence for aldehyde decarbonylase (ADC) was missing. This explained why our sequencing results for the petrobrick yielded only 87% complementarity. Based on this, there were two possible justifications for only having the acyl-acp reductase (AAR)gene and no aldehyde decarbonylase (ADC). Either the parts registry did not have the proper petrobrick (containing both AAR and ADC) in the assigned well in the 2012 kit plate sent to us, or we had extracted from the wrong well in the kit plate, assuming that it was the well containing the petrobrick. It was determined that the latter was true. As such, the transformation for the petrobrick had to be redone, and if gene sequencing yielded positive results (high complementarity), we would try the production media protocol once more in an attempt to get hydrocarbon production.
Desulfurization
PCR was attempted to amplify the genes of the dsz operon utilising an adapted PCR protocol with purified Taq polymerase that had been isolated from the host organism. Eventually, some banding pattern was obtained between 1200 and 1500 base pairs when a gradient thermocycler was used with melting temperatures ranging betweeen 55C to 65C. This was assumed to be indicative of successful amplification of dszB; however, further purification and gel verification results were inconclusive and no yield was obtained when placed tested using a nanodrop machine.
Ring Cleavage
After the 8 day incubation the readings of the naphthalene assay were graphed and there was a definite increase in the cell growth of the cultures containing naphthalene as a carbon source with indicated that the bacteria were most likely were metabolizing the compound. A verification of another part, Alkane hydroxylase system, from the registry was started. The system consists of 4 genes that have been shown to hydroxylate C5-C8 cycloalkanes.  We thought that this part would assist in the degradation of cyclohexane and cyclopentane. The transformation was successful and the gel of the colony PCR showed one positive colony but since there was contamination in the gel we were not sure if we could conclude that the PCR had worked. Final GC readings on the butch and toluene cultures were taken and results were graphed.

The Quick LigationTM Kit joins two strands of DNA together in under 5 minutes, and is in an easy-to-use format that makes it perfect for use with Darwin Toolbox.
During DNA cloning, it is often necessary to check that the fragments of DNA amplified or cut out are the correct size and to purify them away from contaminants. In order to establish their size, a DNA ladder is necessary. The 1kb DNA Ladder is a suitable reference for a wide range of DNA fragment sizes, and so is an excellent match for use in Darwin Toolbox.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," team meetings for presenting and discussing progress and issues of every field take time, but ensure all team members stay informed and can voice their insights.
Students with a mathematical background are underrepresented in iGEM teams as compared to professional synthetic biology groups.
iGEM teams have relatively many biotechnology students, who often stand seem to act as mediators between the modeling and experimentation.
Software: HumHub report and Collab Seeker
Background
Finding new collaboration partners in iGEM is not easy, as finding information about different teams' projects is time-consuming and often difficult. On the other hand, communication with other teams as well as internal team communication can be difficult due to a multitude of platforms used, often cluttered with non-iGEM content. We wanted to do something to these issues to make iGEM even better.
Outcome
Worked with Stockholm iGEM team on HumHub, a collaboration platform for iGEM teams, and collaboratively wrote a report on it with them
Created a questionnaire on how teams found their collaboration partners and how they’re keeping in touch with them
Found that 22 out of the 23 teams that answered wished for better means to find collaboration partners with
Built Collab Seeker , a lightweight collaboration search tool, which helps find relevant collaboration partners using keywords and provides their contact information

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#expresults_-_-_TEXT.html,"ifluidic PDMS chip .
All cells contained riboregulated sfGFP followed by LuxI (BBa_C0161) together under the control of the pLux promoter (BBa_R0062) , and constitutively (BBa_J23100) expressed LuxR (BBa_C0062) . LuxI catalyzes the production of the autoinducer 3OC6-HSL, which is then diffusing from cell to cell. For initialization, the cells in one bead of the top row were induced with 3OC6-HSL before encapsulation. Imaging was implemented with a Biostep Dark-Hood DH-50 (Argus X1 software) fitted with a Canon EOS 500D DSLR camera and a fluorescence filter (545 nm filter). Pictures were usually taken every 2 min at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm with the standard Canon EOS Utility software. Time-lapse movies were created with Adobe After Effects CC software. 1950x faster than real-time, the video shown starts 10 h after the initiation of the experiment (however the time scale shown corresponds to minutes after loading of the chip)
Simulation of the propagation of the pattern in the millifluidic chip. Comsol Multiphysics Simulation software was used in order to simulate a detailed diffusion model including quorum sensing steps in colonies and cell growth. Overall GFP concentration in beads has been scaled in order to account for the high background of the experimental setup. Green Fluorescence Protein is produced earlier in the wells, but can be seen only above a certain threshold.
Accurate prediction of experimental data by the model has been achieved, with parameters from our own fittings or from the literature. Experimental observation combined with simulation enables to show that a pattern is able to develop in the millifluidic chip in a reasonable time scale. For precise equations and other dynamic results, check the Diffusion model page.

Quorum Sensing
For our Mosiacoli project, we were looking for molecular systems that allow orthogonal cell-to-cell communication in order to implement connected XOR logic gates . We decided to exploit the quorum sensing systems LuxI/LuxR, LasI/LasR, and RhlI/RhlR in order to achieve the required orthogonal cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model for these cellular information processing. Even though the corresponding inducer molecules are commercially available and the systems often used, in particular in iGEM projects (e.g. pLux (BBa_R0062) , ' Top 10 Most used promoters ' with 246 uses), potential"

Cooperation
Surveys
One of the most important activities of professional                         researchers is to collaborate with other teams.                         Collaborations provide benefits for both teams                         involved: they can test their designs, know opinions,                         obtain feedback, read about other projects, have other                         points of view…
In Valencia UPV team we believe that collaborations                         with colleagues participating in iGEM or with companies                         of the sector enrich our experience and allow us to                         broaden our minds, at the same time that we help other                         teams. That is the reason why we have been                         collaborating with other iGEM teams at any chance we                         had.

35s:GFP:Tnos we sent to Georgia Team. They proudly showed the package         on Twitter!
The grapes and leaves we sent to Paris Bettencourt team from         Requena-Utiel region
Georgia                         State team needed a control for they                         transformations. As we both work with Phytobricks and                         plants, we sent them a device with 35s:GFP:Tnos, for                         GFP expression in plants. We also advised them on the                         use of Goldenbraid standard to work with                         Phytobricks.
Paris                         Bettencourt team is working to remove stains with                         microbes. One of their objectives is to remove wine                         stains. As Spain is a country known by their wines,                         they asked us for samples of grapes, leaves and soil of                         vineyards, so they could search for microorganisms that                         could degrade wine stains. One of our team members                         lives in the region Utiel-Requena, a wine with                         Certification of Origin. The samples we sent them were                         from this region.
We made a program that can be used to convert from                         plain text to HTML. At the beginning, the program was                         made for our own"

Improving BBa_K1384000
In order to fulfill a gold medal requirement we successfully improved the design of Biobrick BBa_K1384000 . BBa_K1384000 was developed by the 2014 UCLA iGEM to be used in Iterative Capped Assembly. Early in our project, we attempted to use BBa_K1384000 to carry out ICA, but encountered difficulties due to non-specific ligation. For preliminary tests, we ligated pairs of monomers together to determine the efficacy of the old sticky ends.
Fig. 1 Ligation test using monomer pairs. A represents AB, B is BC, and C is CA. The presence of laddering bands indicates non-specific binding, showing that this Biobrick is unsuitable for use in ICA.
The expected result of this test is a single band corresponding to the ligated 2-mer product. However, the ladder of bands indicates that the sticky ends bind non-specifically. We believe this result is due to several factors: the GC content of the sticky end is 50-75% (2-3 out of 4 bases); there is only one base pair difference between the sticky ends, which does not confer sufficient distinction between each sticky end. The high GC content is due to the sticky ends encoding Alanine, whose codons are GCN. The high similarity between the sticky ends is due to poor design.
This summer, we redesigned and expanded the original part to become our Spider Silk ICA Part collection ( here and here )
We redesigned the sticky ends to overcome the two obstacles outlined above. Firstly, we decreased the GC content of the sticky by encoding alanine instead of valine. Alanine is coded for by GTN, which lowers the inherent GC content. We chose valine as a substitute for alanine due to structural similarity, so it would not interfere with the spider silk protein secondary structure. Secondly, we redesigned the sticky ends such that there was at least a two base pair difference between any two of the three sticky ends. Our final NEW sticky ends are:

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," law issues
While we were doing adjustments to our design in the lab, our team of jurists also researched how our device could be integrated into society given the current political and economic landscape in France. The use of GMOs, for the environment, food industry or medicine, is highly regulated in France and Europe. It is limited to design animal models of diseases and to produce large quantities of molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. The use of genetically modified bacteria inside the human body is not the subject of specific laws, which made our research on the subject difficult. We focused our research on the medical device’s regulation in order to see if our project could be marketed. At first, it appeared almost naturally that our project was a medical device, but as it has to be understood as a legal term, it responds to a specific definition. Working on medical devices’ regulations helped us to better define our project, classify it and analyze our project in the scope of European regulations. We also tried to cover some legal questions related to our project and tried to find answers from other legal systems such as the American one.
All these feedback from scientific experts, association members representing patients, and physicians/surgeons, allowed us to develop our project NeuronArch to what it is today. Without them, our project would not have been the same, and we really want to thank them for that.
Silver: Our Project in Society
One of the main concerns we had while developing our synthetic biology project was to determine in which way our biofilm could be used and who would be using it, in order to evaluate its impact on society. The field which would benefit the most of a nerves redirection while reducing the risk of infection, was orthopedic surgery, targeting patients suffering amputation.
Investigating Infection During Surgery
In medicine, surgery is a very common procedure. According to the data available, gathered by the Royal College of Surgeons, around 4.7 million surgical procedures were performed in 2014 in England; meaning that 7% of the total population is impacted by surgery.  In the United States of America, according again to data gathered by the 2010 Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCD), 48.23 million surgical procedures were performed in 2010. That’s around 14.8% of the total population.  5% of patients undergoing surgery develop surgical site infections (SSIs), which may cause substantial morbidity that can endanger a patient’s life, increase the number of days in the hospital and increase healthcare costs. SSIs are defined as infections that occur within 1 year if an implant"
Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," This leads to an ambivalent public opinion. On the one hand, biofuel production (“green” energy) via (usually genetically modified) algae or bacteria is widely supported, on the other hand especially synthetic engineered plants are hardly condemned.
According to that ambivalence in media and educational system, many people do not know that genetic engineering and synthetic biology are indeed part of our everyday life and have many different promising approaches to help our society or even safe life. As iGEMers it is our duty to change something about this deficiency. Our contribution was the Saturday Balloon Fever.
“Have you ever heard about synthetic biology?” – “Did you know that…?” were the two main questions we asked to passengers at this special event, which took place at august the 16th. We wanted to know, what people know about synthetic biology and also show examples for products of synthetic biology in everyday life. Therefore, we distributed cards with facts about synthetic biology in everyday life (for further information we added the URL of our homepage). Furthermore, passengers could get a free balloon attached to one of the cards in exchange for a small conversation with one of our members about synthetic biology. Since balloons obviously attract young and old, we had the chance to speak to people of all ages.
The conversations were very interesting and varying, but most passengers had several opinions in common:
Almost no one knew synthetic biology
Many passengers were positively surprised about the facts we told them
After the mention of genetic engineering almost every passenger rated synthetic biology as dangerous
Most people concerned about: uncontrollable super-viruses, bacteria, etc. accidently evolved in research and low biosafety standards in labs and factories that may set them free
These concerns were usually not funded
Based on these impressions we decided to gain statistically valid data about the public opinion regarding synthetic biology. Hence, we started an online survey about synthetic biology (LINK).
Furthermore, we decided to focus on biosafety issues, since a lot of people seem to concern biosafety (LINK).
A perfect example for the lack of knowledge about genetic engineering is Jimmy Kimmel’s recent video. This may be in the US, but it sums up the general situation in Germany, too. Enjoy!

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#insa_-_-_TEXT.html," People talks a lot of the progress on phones or computer but It is really amazing what now we can do with just bacteria and designed DNA molecules. That why I have done the iGEM. Furthermore, the iGEM kicks you out of your classic lab work to give you the opportunity to design your own experiment. Indeed, during the summer, my big job was to search, adapt, work on and sometimes create protocols for the characterisation our modified curli and also for its chelating power. That makes the iGEM a really funny and creative experience. Finally, the best part, the summer lab work allow me to dance and sing during the experiments...Oh that explain we had a rainy summer !!

I am a 4th year student in Biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I was a volunteer for the organization of the European Jamboree in Lyon in September 2013, and this made me want to participate to the iGEM competition as a student. I started my iGEM activities with the association “INSA AND Concept Club” and was in charge of the administrative side of the project. In the lab I participated in cloning and curli characterization. That was a great new experience and very educational. I loved working with all the team during the summer and had a lot of fun !
Except my passion for synthetic biology ;) I also like drawing and running.  I am very exiting about this Giant Jamboree and can’t wait to meet all the iGEMers.

Overview
S-Din (Search engine and Design platform for inspiration with Network analysis) is an integrated Search Engine and Design Platform, developed specifically for Synthetic Biology. Due to the exponential growth of published researches, many of them have never been fully exploited of their values. S-Din has been designed to integrate searching and designing seamlessly, finding exactly what users need and enabling users to edit simultaneously. What's more exciting about S-Din is that tree of words and various analyses were developed to inspire the user to generate a better idea. A simulation model was developed to help ensure the robustness of user’s design and wet-lab validation was conducted to validate its reliability. Our Github repo can be access from here .

Figure 14: Blueprint for our remediation raft
Such a solution has to be engineered cleverly. Robust to environmental influences, expendable, modular and handy, even when in use. It must provide an ideal environment for the moss to grow and set off an alert if such a setting is no longer provided.
Our answer to that is the remediation raft.
It consists of a triangular shaped tube in which a felt cloth is stretched. As a float, the raft raises and falls with the water level, so the cloth is always kept on the water surface. Our experiments showed that felt is a very good matrix for the moss to grow on and its roots maintain stable on the fibers.  The light weight and handy size make it mobile and and transportable and a higher quantity of rafts can easily arranged to a honeycombed structure. That makes remediation rafts very applicable at any location. In ponds, lakes and rivers; any scale is thinkable.

Once the moss is installed it filters until it's ""saturated"", assumed that the environmental parameters fit and a proper living space is provided. The main goal of our measurement device is to monitor these environmental parameters in real time.  Since the filter's costs should be kept as low as possible, the usage of ordinary lab measurement tools is limited. Looking one step ahead it is conceivable to use a moss-filter in order to clean ponds or streams etc. Places that are"

Oxidative Stress Researchers
Overview
Although for OxyPonics we chose to ultimately focus on the field of hydroponics, we did not forget the wide applicability our biocircuit might have in a variety of sectors. Our biocircuit senses relative levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in living systems utilizing fluorescent fusion proteins. By coupling these proteins with light sensitive expression of an antioxidant, we can respond to and regulate ROS levels to a setpoint we decide. This biocircuit can be used to optimize cell growth and minimize damage.
Cornell is an academic research hub with researchers studying oxidative stress in a range of contexts in multiple fields. We tapped into the accessible depth and breadth of knowledge on campus not only to evaluate and validate the conceptual aspects of our potential circuit, but to gain perspective into what other applications our ROS biocircuit could be adapted to. Furthermore, we learned what key considerations to keep in mind as we made decisions concerning our biocircuit and other OxyPonics components.
Key Takeaways
Oxidative stress harms living cells and limits what research can performed on them. Our oxidative stress quenching biocircuit could expand research possibilities in the fields of cell and molecular biology as well as biological engineering.
ROS can cause damage to DNA and high levels will be harmful to plants.
Oxidative stress is a feature of plants’ immune response and small amounts can promote plant health. Hence, a minimum level of ROS should also be maintained.
E. coli and plants may not be able to grow together. We need to develop a physical barrier to enclose the bacteria.
Plants can release oxidants through their roots when stressed, so this would be an ideal location for our biological sensor to be positioned.

Yeast
FERMENTATIVE RESPONSE
This construction has three parts: (1) a transcription factor binding site inside the promoter (UAS1), (2) a transcription factor binding site (UAS2/CSRE), and (3) the coding sequence which contains the yeast AP-1 protein (YAP1). We used the ADH2 promoter, which is regulated by two trans-acting elements, both necessary for maximal promoter activity in the absence of a fermentable carbon source [1].
When is the protein synthesized? Our construction is repressed several hundred-fold in the presence of glucose, so the transcription of YAP1 protein is initiated once the glucose in the medium is depleted.
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: there are two transcription factors which regulate the promoter, ADR1 a carbon source-sensor zinc-finger [2] and CAT8 [3]. In the absence of glucose both cis-acting sites in the promoter are bound cooperatively by the transcriptional activators. ADR1 binds to the UAS1 site while CAT8 binds to the UAS2/CSRE site and regulates positively the transcription of YAP1 protein by the activation of the ADH2 promoter [4]. The presence of glucose downregulates the levels of the transcription factors (ADR1 and CAT8) which results in the depletion of the production of YAP1 protein by the repression of the ADH2 promoter.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," and only about a fifth makes it to the food humans consume (2). Our project may exacerbate this issue, however, by continuing to provide phosphorus fertilizer. However, we feel that the ethical considerations (addressed below) outweigh this. We would attempt to counteract this by partnering with farmers on how to reduce the amount of phosphorus that runs off from fields in the first place. The experience of Dr. Kevin King is that farmers are often open to new, more sustainable methods and are limited by lack of knowledge rather than lack of desire (4). Some methods of reducing nutrient runoff are also economically beneficial to farmers. For example, cover crops can be beneficial to farmers and the environment or a financial and agricultural burden  The use of cover crops during the winter is estimated to prevent 6.2 pounds of nitrogen and almost .25 pounds of phosphorus per acre from running off the field (5). Planting cover crops can also decrease the loss of valuable topsoil; improve soil quality; reduce the need for herbicides and pesticides; fix nitrogen; mitigate soil compaction; host beneficial species; and improve tillage conditions. However, the choice of crop is important, and a poorly chosen crop can increase disease and pests in the soil and also cost the farmer for seeding, planting, management, incorporating the cover crop, and possibly planting delays of spring crops (6). As a result, information on how to wisely choose a cover crop is critical.
In order to eliminate the need for electricity to operate floating models of our PRM, solar panels were added to the design.
One of the two components to the beads in the PRM is tetramethyl orthosilicate, which can cause damage to eyes, lungs, kidneys, and the circulatory system (7). In order to be more environmentally friendly, future designs may consider switching to tetraethyl orthosilicate, which has similar properties and creates less toxic byproducts (8).
Ethics
If our product was implemented on an immense scale, it could theoretically disrupt the mining of phosphorus and the industries around that. However, getting to that scale would require time, and the easily accessible phosphorus is quickly being depleted. Our project also would not collect all phosphorus, even if widely implemented. As a result, our project should not significantly impact current mining jobs. It would continue to provide jobs processing and shipping phosphorus after mined phosphorus levels begin to decline.
Phosphorus fertilizer is required for modern levels of agricultural production. When the quantity of phosphorus available for fertilizer use decreases, prices will start rising. The farmers least able to pay for fertilizer"

Here's what the project is about

Description
In our project, we will use the UAS-GAL4 system within temperature controlling and the specific promoter control the expression of dopamine in Drosophila’s brain and finally construct a temperature-controlling courtship model.
Molecular Cloning
We constructed three plasmid, pleP-GAL4, pleP-GAL80ts and UAS-TH to control the courtship ritual of Drosophila. Which use the specific promoter pleP, transcription factors GAL4 and GAL80ts, regulatory sequence UAS, and coding sequence TH. They were all found on different papers and fruit flies websites.
After we constructed the plasmids, we asked the SIBS (Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences) to inject the plasmid into Drosophila egg using micro-injection technology. By doing that, we can get a stable strain of which we can control the behaviors of Drosophila such as male-male courtship more effectively.
Fruit fly screening and testing
We screened out the Drosophila in which our target gene was expressing stably.
To test whether our construction worked or not, we did some Molecular Biology (real-time PCR) and behavioral (male-male courtship and sexual preference change) experiments. Finally, we selected out the fruit fly which performed as expected and recorded their courtship behavior on video. Moreover, we designed experiments to compare the transgenic and wild-type fruit flies in terms of viability and fertility to test whether the reproductive function of transgenic Drosophila was normal.
Through eight experiments, we got the following results: [1] Dopamine levels are regulated by the temperature in the system and result in significant behavioral characteristics and [2] the reconstructed Drosophila is similar to the normal fruit fly in terms of survival and reproduction.
Model
We set up a mathematical model to predict whether our transformation of Drosophila can play a positive role in pest control.

Performed colony PCRs and analysed gels. Inconclusive results -  likely worked for P19 but not for GST -  hard to compare band sizes with LacZ as they are similar.
Sequenced PDF, PR, GST and P19 - GST ok, issues with the others.
Only those colonies miniprepped prior to PCR showed bands once the gel had been run.
Performed a digest on the biobrick containing the TSH to see if there were 2 bans on the gel, when we ran the gel there were no bands.
Level 1:
3LexA/4LexA/135S/35s plates showed both white and blue colonies. These growing in broth and Kan before PCR/miniprep procedures.
Performed colony PCR on white colonies, no bands.
Unable to do the procedures as the bacteria have not grown.
Inoculated broth with chl and IPTG to grow the level 0 NOS-T, 35s and Luc+ over the weekend at 22 degrees in the shaking incubator.
Made more competent cells using #3 as a starting point.

Grew up more of the lvl 0 p19 and GST colonies that were successful.
Set up sequencing reactions for the lvl 0 PDF and PR colonies.
Mini preps on all the colonies that grew over the weekend (level 1 reactions).
PCR on the level 1 mini preps using primers 44 and 56.
Mini prepped the level 0 35s, Luc+ and NOS-T.
Redid the digest of the level 1 (35s,xve,nos-t) and ran a gel of it. Again the resulting gel was not very conclusive, showing no correlation between any of the bands.

Characterization: KmLux and KmLas
Data
For the Quorum sensing module we used established experimentally determined parameters for the rate of formation of RLux (reference). Since, in the literature the other parameters were estimated or fitted to their data, we decided to determine the parameters specific to our system. Hence, we used our data for the remaining parameters. Our data was mainly a transfer function of normalized GFP concentration as a function of input LuxAHL concentrations. (link to data)
Assumptions
Assumption A
We assumed that the dimerization of RLux to DRLux is quick. Quasi steady state approximation (QSSA)  as follows
$$\frac{d[DRLux]}{dt} = k_{DRLux} [RLux]^2 - k_{-DRLux} [DRLux] - d_{DRLux} [DRLux] \approx 0\\$$
Assumption B
Further, from literature, we found that DRLux is specific to DNA and the dissociation constant is low (km = 0.1nM) {Reference}.  Therefore, we using QSSA again,
$$\frac{d[P_{LuxON}]}{dt} = k_{P_{LuxON}} [P_{LuxOFF}][DRLux] - k_{-P_{LuxON}} [P_{LuxON}] \approx 0\\$$
Solving, we get the rate of production of mRNABxb1 as
$$\frac{d[mRNA_{Bxb1}]}{dt} = L_{P_{Lux}} + \frac{k_{mRNA_{Bxb1}}[RLux]^2}{K_{mLux}^2 + [RLux]^2 }- d_{mRNA_{Bxb1}} [mRNA_{Bxb1}]\\$$
where
$$K_{mLux} = \sqrt{\frac {k_{-P_{LuxON}}}{k_{P_{LuxON}}}.\frac {k_{-DRLux} + d_{DRLux}}{k_{DRLux}}}$$
is a lumped parameter which we fitted to our data.
Similarly, lumped parameter KmLas was derived for the las system and fitted to a transfer function of normalized GFP concentration as a function of input Las-AHL.
Parameter fitting
We used MEIGO Toolbox to fit the parameters to the"

The genetic switch systems that are being characterised make use of two different reporter genes, namely green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP). These will give a visual indication as to the functioning of the parts being tested. The biobricks, BBa_I13521 and BBa_I13522 were transformed into E. coli and serve as positive controls for fluorescent microscopy. These two parts consist of the reporter genes, GFP and RFP respectively and are under the control of a constitutive promoter.

- Agreed, at least once a week.
Minutes 09.10.17
- nmt1 cloning underway, cyc1 is done, composite part and sfGFP still needs to be cloned into both their vectors
- Yeast cells short lived? Needs more planning. We should also ask WHY they're so short lived
- Thorlabs incoming in a few days, yeast needs to be timed properly
- Everyone needs to write stuff for the wiki. We'll assign different tasks to different people by the week. If you want to write on anything in particular, inform as early as possible (or even better, start writing on it
- We're starting t-shirt design now. Everyone at the meeting voted on which logo to use, and decided on the one Hilde designed. We'll get sponsors to pay for this
- Wiki. Write stuff. Shows up twice because this is really fucking important. Aman will organize workshops each week from now. We should aim to be over 80% done when there's a week left.
Minutes 16.10.17
This meeting was pretty short, so the minutes are pretty much as follows:
- We'll try to do A3-cloning on the composite part, and clone the sfGFP and nmt1 into submission vectors in paralell. The yeast cells should be done pretty soon
- Wiki stuff: mostly what I said yesterday, but everyone also needs to add what they've done to the attributions-page
- Someone needs to take responsibility for getting vectorized graphics for the t-shirts, and then ordering them. Suggested Elisabeth for this
Minutes 23.10.17
Agenda 23.10.17 Last week!
- We're nearly at the finish line, and there's still quite a bit of work left.
- As such, we NEED to devote as much time as possible to the project for the few remaining days. The key parts are related to the wiki and the remaining labwork, so that's where we should spend our energy.
-If anyone's unsure of what to do, PLEASE ASK rather than feeling confused and not doing anything because of that. Again, we need to spend the little time we have remaining effectively. Regardless, everyone should be trying to contribute as much as possible to either the wiki or the labwork now. One, the other, or preferably both.
Remaining labwork
- cyc1 is done, nmt1 is complete when we get the sequencing data. We should still ship these to iGEM HQ today.
- Gonna check if"
