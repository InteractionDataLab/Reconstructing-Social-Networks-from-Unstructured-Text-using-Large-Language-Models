Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html,", Toehold-GFP and Trigger RNA must be transformed into the same bacteria. Origin incompatibility prevents us to transform two different originated plasmids in the same bacteria. Therefore we decided to clone Toehold-GFP into a ColA originated plasmid and clone Trigger RNA into a ColE originated plasmid. PSB1C3 plasmid has a ColE origin so we cloned Trigger RNA into it. We designed this ColA originated plasmid for cloning Toehold-GFP sequence and named it ‘pColA’.
pColA-Toehold GFP CLONING
After cloning Toehold-GFP into PSB1C3 vector successfully, as we are planning to transform this gene into the same bacteria with Trigger RNA, we cloned it into pColA plasmid.  In order to do cloning into this vector, we removed the gene from PSB1C3-Toehold GFP plasmid by cutting it with NotI enzyme. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with ColA Forward and ColA Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 192 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, Toehold-GFP’s band should be at 1196 bp line.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check as a second control of cloning. We used NotI restriction enzyme for cut-check.
PSB1C3-Trigger RNA/pColA-Toehold-GFP Cotransformation:
To show And Gate system works properly, these two plasmids with different origins should be transformed into the same bacteria. T7 is the promoter which produces Trigger RNA and Toehold-GFP mRNA’s , so we assured that they were cotransformed into a bacteria strain including T7 RNA polymerase. BL21 served this purpose, and after cotransformation, we observed grown colonies.
Functional Assay:
We designed a functional assay setup in order to figure out if Toehold-Trigger RNA system is functional. The main goal of this setup is to show that; Toehold-GFP doesn’t give fluorecence alone but if it comes together with Trigger RNA, GFP fluores"

I am in Hong Kong now! Thanks to school of computer again! I obtain a chance to live and
study in Hong Kong for one semester! Though there is much to do and I have to get familiar
with the environment in Hong Kong, I try my best to find time for our project. I skim most of
igem teams in latest three years and list some teams whose work can show the advantages and
innovations of our database. Their works are about some biological reactions related to
light, temperature, PH, etc. Read a paper of Nature about synchronized Ecoli clock, try to
master the idea of it and list the reactions in it. It will be added into our database.

This was very exciting and it is nice to hear about their project as well. We have been all up in our own project lately so it is nice that someone came and burst that bubble for us.  The hunt for a microphone has been an adventure during the summer! During the spring we had the profit of using a microphone at Mjärdevi Creactive here in Linköping. Mjärdevi Creactive is a place where students can sit and study and they always have coffee available. Practically a dream for everyone with a severe caffeine dependence. But now, during the summer, we had to find another solution. Thanks to one of our teammates that sometimes is lost in the world of gaming and likes to record music, we found a solution to our problem.
We could not be happier with the result, since we sound no stupider than we normally do!

eColiBasic6
This chip was designed and routed in an improved version of Fluigi in which the updated design rules had been implemented.
This output is much cleaner, having significantly less unnecessary kinks and bends, and includes portions of the chip design not previously possible; for example, two ports were placed and routed in locations not previously possible in earlier iterations due to ports being pushed to the edge.
Besides these software improvements and updates, our 2017 work with Fluigi and Neptune brought other issues and suggestions to light as well. Many of these will be implemented in future iterations of Fluigi. A short list of these can be seen below.
Issues
Bend penalties are not clearly characterized
Random “kinks” will be added to straight channel connections
Channels will overlap when they are not supposed to
Primitives will overlap when they are not supposed to
Nesting trees within each other leads to spacing issues
Suggestions
Requiring all primitive dimensions to be evenly divisible by lambda (scaling value) so that scaling back up after routing retains exact primitive dimensions
Adding the ability to reflect modules horizontally and/or vertically
Through our work on Fluigi, the 2017 BostonU HW team improved upon both Fluigi and Neptune. We identified issues and limitations associated the Fluigi place and route tool, an  integral portion of the Neptune software workflow. By helping to improve Fluigi, we have also built upon  the 2016 BostonU HW project Neptune.

Summary
It all started on May 23rd.  A group of students, highly excited about the whole idea of Synthetic Biology and awesomely enthusiastic to make something real! May be we were low in experience, but we were high in zeal!
And by October 18th, we had developed a genetically cloned bacteria out of nowhere, developed the mathematical models of our prototype with detailed simulation, and designed our own prototype to implement our idea on a broader spectrum, spread awareness about the field of synthetic biology, came up with a book on pollution and even designed games on our Eco.Coli bacteria.
Seems too much, but all these did happen, and it was fun! Now, the most important question: How? Well, here lies the answer:
Eat, Sleep, Clone and repeat!
The Biotech UG lab of IIT Delhi served as our activity hub, where we were working at least 8 hours a day for the entire summers. The fun we had, and the joy after accomplishment of each of our targets was incomparable.

Timeline - Implementation
[September - October]
PROGRESS: After receiving feedback in the Ideation Phase, we modified our sketches and incorporated suggested changes. For the milking shell, we got rid of the flow sensor module and added an option for a blank module if a farmer did not want to purchase all of the modules. We changed the iodine spray module to a sponge applicator, since a spray could potentially contaminate the milk. We finished more of our app and updated the designs based on the feedback. We got rid of CowMD since farmers did not find it useful. We also modified cow data to show overall trends of the farm rather than focus individual cows, as DairyOne suggested. Finally, we polished our somatic cell counter designs to present a more user-friendly interface. We continued working on cloning bacteriocins in wet lab, in response to positive feedback. We went back for our final farm visits with a physical prototype of the customizable shell, along with a running app.
QUESTION: Would you buy this product? Why or why not?
FINDINGS: Though our product may be more expensive than the cheapest shells available, farmers would still purchase our product for the long term investment.

Muranda Cheese Company
Waterloo, NY
Blane Murray looked at our prototype and was interested in the product, but noted a few design changes. He noted that the temperature sensor could be an obstruction if the teats are too close together. He suggested that we remove extraneous components on the outside of the shell that could be damaged if the cow kicked. He also mentioned that we should try to get the modules inside the shell in a way that would not alter the liner.

Scipio Springs Dairy
Union Springs, NY
Bill Morgan of Scipio Farm gave us a thorough analysis of the various aspects of our project. He supported iodine application through sponges and UV exposure between milkings, because they would prevent growth and transfer of bacteria. Bill told us that he and other farmers would invest in a new device that would decrease the incidence of mastitis. Usually, shells are a one-time purchase and are only replaced when there is a better product in the market. Currently, shells cost about $40-$50, but Morgan said he would spend $100-$200 for what we were offering, which would still be less than some other products on the market. Each case of bovine mastitis can cost up to $300"

Procedure
Starting Bacillus subtilis transformations
The tube on the right, which contains B. subtilis cells (grown overnight) is slightly cloudier than the control
The team started the first stage of the Bacillus subtilis transformation process by carrying out the beginning steps of the ""Day of transformation"" section shown in the protocol . If the midi-prep test digest analysis shows that the ligations and the transformation of cotC-GFP-smtA in the pMUTIN4 plasmid have worked then some of the remaining midi-prep DNA can be used to transform B. subtilis when the time is right.
Designing primers for cotC BioBrick integration
It is key that if the team manage to transform Bacillus subtilis with the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick in pMUTIN4 plasmid, they can determine that the BioBrick has successfully integrated into the B. subtilis genome. We have designed the BioBrick so that it integrates within the cotC gene of the B. subtilis genome so any primers designed should flank this region. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, we didn't manage to carry this step out; it will be carried out another day.
Plating out TPA2 cells
It has been noted that the stock of competent DH5-alpha E. coli cells stored in the -80C freezer has been greatly reduced. To generate some more competent E. coli cells, some TPA2 cells (DH5-alpha E. coli) from the stocks freezer were taken and spread on an LB + agar plate. This is to fulfil the first step of the ""Pre-culture"" stage in the ""Preparing Competent Cells"" protocol . The plate will then be grown overnight in the 37C incubator.
Analysing midi-prep digests
The midi-prep digest, which we are analysing today, was carried out in yesterday's lab session . The team hopes that the midi-prep DNA is that of cotC-GFP-smtA ligated into pMUTIN4 plasmid and only an analytical digest will determine this.
Just as a recap: we had attempted to ligate the cotC BioBrick into pMUTIN4 and had attempted to transform DH5-alpha E. coli with this product. Several colonies were"

Injecting fluids: compressed air and tubing, pressure regulators
Close-up of the flow-layer tube: connected to a manifold, and plugged into the chip using a tubular pin
A microfluidic chip is a network of small channels for fluids. To inject fluid in, a small (.02"" inner diameter) tube is filled, then plugged into the chip through one of the punched holes (connecting them with a tubular metal pin).  On the other end, the tubes are plugged into a manifold, in turn supplied with air at about 0.2 bar (3 psi), as set by a pressure regulator. The fluid is thus forced into the channels by the compressed air. A syringe can also be used to fill the chip, but it is hard to keep an even pressure (plus you quickly run out of hands).
Controlling flow: on-chip valves and 3-way valves.
Our chips have a second control layer above or below the main flow layer. The layers are separated by a thin membrane of PDMS, and their channels overlap in specific locations. When channels of the control layer are pressurized, the membrane bends into the flow layer and blocks it. This creates a microfluidic 'on-chip' valve.
Our array of solenoid valves, on a manifold. These allow individual pressurisation of on-chip valves of the control layer.
The channels of the control layer are filled in the same way as the flow layer, but require much higher pressure to bend the membrane. We typically used about 2 bar or 30 psi. Each independant valve in the control layer is pressurised by a different tube, regulated by a three-way valve. These switch between high pressure (from mains pressure, and the pressure regulator) to low pressure (atmospheric pressure), and hence allow quick toggling of the microfluidic valve between the open (unpressurised) and closed (pressurised) state. Three way valves come in manually- or electrically-controlled flavours. The manual kind is simpler and more reliable; we use them for the MITOMI chips. The electric kind (more specifically solenoid valves) we use for the web-controlled setup.
Watching what's going on: the microscope
Our toy microscope and light-table
In our experience, the best tool to look at a microfluidic chip is a low-magnification rear-illuminated binocular microscope. However, we needed a cheap way of viewing the chip on a computer, to then stream the image through internet. We used a toy webcam microscope ($50),"

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Bioelectric-Interface#Microbial-Half-Fuel-Cells_-_-_TEXT.html," experiments. This can probably be attributed to the lower temperature of incubation as the fuel cells were incubated at room temperature. Despite the slower growth rate, the results we have obtained are encouraging. BBa_J33203 transformed cells in the presence of arsenate show a faster drop in voltage compared to other samples. This is especially important compared to the BBa_J33203 cells in the medium without arsenate. These results show promising prospect for growth-based biosensors. With more sophisticated measurement methods it would be possible to connect our system to a computer which would allow for automated and quantitative analysis of the data, allowing for simple and automated contamination detection.
Current results are encouraging but background growth is still present in the media and therefore further experiments are necessary to optimise the growth parameters. One possible improvement includes the addition of the cscA BioBrick that we have designed this year. Using sucrose instead of lactose may reduce background growth and allow for tighter control of the system.

Practice plate ligation
After seeing the results of our third oligo digestion yesterday, we were confused about why the reaction was not working. After talking with our teammates, we realized that we had been performing the reaction on single stranded DNA, instead of our double stranded PCR product. We performed the digestion again today with oligos 1 and 2, using the following recipe:
15 ul DNA
0.5 ul enzyme
85 ul buffer/BSA
After letting the reaction sit at 37* for about 45 minutes, we performed a PCR purification, and then ran the product on a gel:
We could see bands of the appropriate size, after digesting our PCR product. Unpure = cut without PCR purification.
Finally, we had gotten bands at the appropriate size! We noticed that there were multiple bands smaller than our uncut oligo. We figured the smallest band was the one we were looking for. The one that was slightly larger was likely the result of the enzyme only cutting at one end of our oligo. We wondered whether all of our product would have been the appropriate size if we had let the reaction sit at 37* for a longer period of time. Regardless, we decided to use this product in our ligation reaction. If both ends of the oligo aren't cut, then it should not be able to bind with the backbone.
We performed a ligation reaction with our cut CB Bottom and our digested oligos, using the following recipe:
5 ul ligation mix
4 ul backbone (~20 ng/ul)
1 ul insert (~15 ng/ul)
This would leave to a vector to insert ratio of 1 to 8, which is what is normally used for ligation reactions.
This is how we calculated the amounts of inserted needed for our ligation:
PCR product: ~60 ng/ul We want 1 ug of DNA to be cut, so that after the PCR purification, when we elute in 30 ul we will get a concentration of ~30 ng/ul.
In practice, we end up losing some of our product, so we ended up with 15 ng/ul.

Streak out another plate of HB101 cells
Another round of PCR in hopes of attaining higher yields than last time
Run restriction digests (for constructs) on gel, extract them
order another gel extraction or PCR cleanup kit (for the columns)
Discovered that the negative control for HB101 overnight culture was contaminated.  Also, the plate that had been made yesterday had no distinct colonies on it.  As such, decided to replate HB101.  Put this into incubator around 8:45 pm.
Also, innoculated a culture of HB101 from a plate that we had in the fridge from 7/28/08.  Placed this in the incubator at 9:55 pm.
Weighing out for making more media:
Need 0.7351 g CaCl2 dihydrate in 100 mL to make 50 mM solution
A - 25.0030 g YPD broth
B - 25.0040 g YPD broth
C - 25.0028 g YPD broth
D - 20.0025g Lennox LB broth
E - 0.7354g CaCl2
PCR:
Double checked the primers for the promoters, seeing as those did not work for either previous PCR reaction.  Discovered that the primers were, in fact, correct.
Note that one guide for PCR (http://www.fermentas.com/profiles/modifyingenzymes/pdf/protocols/protocolhotstart.pdf) recommends a concentration of 2 mM MgCl2 if one uses 0.2 mM dNTP to maximize PCR output.  Since 1 uL of 10 mM dNTP solution in 50 uL gives 0.2 mM dNTP, one should thus consider using 4 uL of 25 mM MgCl2 to yield a 2 mM concentration.
Will do PCR tomorrow using this information.

Also decided to remake the 20 mM solutions for the six primers that correspond to the promoters.  This is just in case the primers were somehow not included in the mixes for the other two PCR attempts.
Add 46 uL of this master mix to each PCR reaction. "

Handheld development:
Our handheld contains an Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroler which is connected to a HC-05 bluetooth module.Two LEDs are connected over 100 ohm resistances to digital ports on the Arduino Uno. One of the LEDs emitts radiation with a wavelength of 450 nm permanently during the detection process. The other LED emmits light of a wavelength at 575 nm but works as a photo diode. Sensing details are explained below.
Favorable for light intensity measurements, however, is to operate the LED in reverse direction. Here it behaves like a capacitor with a parallel light-dependent current source. The anode is connected to ground and the cathode is connected to an IO port pin of the arduino microcontroller.
The measurement is done in 3 steps:
1. LED charging by switching the pins on high and wait.
2.Moving the pins in high-impedance input (no pull-up!). The current now flows from the capacitor very slowly via the current source to GND. Therefore, the voltage drops steadily and drops so far that the microcontroller recognizes it as low.
3. The microcontroller measures the time, when the input falls to LOW
The shorter the time measured, the higher is the light intensity.
You can find our arduino code, open soure on the folowing site: Mycotoxin Handheld Arduino code
LED Sensing:
Light emitting diodes are robust, low-cost, and energy efficient. LEDs cover an increasingly broad spectral range from UV to near infrared.   LEDs can be both light emitters and detectors. For example, an LED that emits greenish-yellow light at the peak wavelength of about 555 nm detects green light at the peak wavelength of about 525 nm and over the spectral width of 50 nm.  Almost every LED is capable of detecting a relatively narrow band of wavelength, with different sensitivity. When an LED is subjected to light, it generates a backwards biased current, proportional to the light striking the diode, typical about 50pA.  A precise measurement of the LED photocurrent is possible, using inherent capacitance of the diode itself (typically picoFarads) and  microcontroller I/O ports with configurable internal pull-ups states and built-in digital timer-counter.

When the total volume is reduced by half (0.1nL), QS occurs at 10 hours. When it is doubled (0.4nL), QS occurs at 23 hours (but the transition is more gradual). The QS triggering time in these conditions depends linearly on the total volume.
Growth model description
How does a bacterial population colonize a solid surface? Are the dynamics similar to the liquid media?
According to [ 2 ], the growth dynamics are indeed very similar, the greatest difference being a more gradual transition between the exponential and stationary phases. We use the growth model III from [ 2 ]:

Figure 6: Population growth on an agar surface. The population grows exponentially from a small inoculum to the environment’s carrying capacity after a short lag period. This is the full growth model, but in the simulations we disregard the lag phase. Its duration can’t be modelled precisely and, more importantly, we don’t expect the bacteria to actively express the Lux operon at that phase.
The model can be seen as a transition function between 2 population levels. The steepness of the transition, $r$, depends primarily on temperature and to a smaller extent to nutritional levels; $m$ and $n$ are mostly fixed and $N_0$ is a parameter without a clear significance which only affects the duration of the lag phase. Here we ignore the lag phase, so $N_0=0$. In our simulations, we use the best estimates of these parameters for T=30oC and an environment with relatively few resources (agar with 1/25 the usual nutrient levels) based on [ 2 ]: r=1.5 [1/h], m=0.52, n=3.5.
The new equation is concatenated to the system that expresses the chemical reactions and supplies a variable dilution loss, dependent on the variable growth rate. The simulations with the growth model keep a constant culture volume, like the previous ones, but allow the bacterial density to increase, without any external dilution of the entire culture. However, the bacterial equations experience the same dilution term, which is a result of the cytoplasm constantly expanding during the growth phase. As"

Overview
Modeling is the art of description, estimation, prediction and optimization with limited knowledge and experimental data, which is exactly what we have to face. Our goal is to build engineering bacteria with antibiotics degradation and procedural suicide genes obtained via screening, and many parameters are not available or not easy to search. The industrial appliance of our idea would be seriously constrained if too many parameters have to be measured. Therefore, we employ ingenious tactics to build a practicable model of antibiotics degradation protein expression, bacteria growth under toxin-antitoxin coupling, and the overall circuit by in-depth analysis with least experiments.
We divide our model into 3 sections.                         In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy, and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods, to show the influence of toxin and toxin-antitoxin coupling. Part 2 deals with the expression of tetracycline resistance protein, we use piecewise linear method for simplification, eigen decomposition method to extract the dominant sector.                         In part 3 we integrate the two parts into a complete model, with which we do simulations to reach our conclusions.
Bacteria growth and protein expression are the most fundamental issues in synthetic biology. Our model minimizes the necessary experiments to get all necessary parameters, which is conducive to the industrial appliance and also propagable to modeling of other projects.
Growth With TA
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curve have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications [1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation [2] , Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models [3] [4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.

We add 1.5μL bacteria solution into 150μL LB culture medium at 310K and measure the optical density at 600nm every ten minutes, with medium being shaking all along. Growth rate are calculated by five-point method. Error bars show the standard deviation of fifteen parallel samples.

Introduction
As this year the main goal of the IONIS iGEM team was to popularized the Synthetic Biology, we have challenged other iGEM teams and asked them to create an one minute video introducing their project in the simplest way.        As well, during the French meeting in July, we came with our camera and recorded the other French teams.

SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," undiscovered problems, the total ability of sewage treatment had dropped 40%. To address this issue, we needed to develop a sustainable consumptive material.
III. Integrated Human Practice
By discovering shortcomings of traditional treatment method, we found some critical factors that were worth considering in our project.
a. Fixing Laccase to a Matrix
The first factor was the low concentration of bacteria/enzyme during treatment. A high flow rate may wash away bacteria fast, lowering the concentration of bacteria/enzymes as well as the chance and duration of contact between pollutant and enzymes. This reminded us to adjust our project in two aspects:
(1) Attach bacteria/Laccase to some fixed matrix, preventing them from being washed away by water flow.
(2) Use lots of small plastic beads to expand surface area, increasing the chance of contact between pollutant and enzymes.
In combination of the two aspects, we may achieve a higher concentration of laccase and longer duration of contact between pollutant and enzymes. Moreover, because the laccase can process the sewage without releasing toxic gas, it will eliminate the unnecessary cost of using extraction pump and extra employee payment, which as a result can enable factory to utilize the biggest advantage of biology method with inexpensive price.
b. Biofilm × Laccase
The second factor to consider was the competition among bacteria species. Through human practice, we realized that the composition of sewage disposal was very complicated. There were usually more than one species of microorganism competing in the same environment, which may negatively affect the growth of target bacteria. By allowing our bacteria to produce biofilm, they could get an advantage of growth by sharing nutrients and getting sheltered from competitors.
Finally, we came up with the idea, using PHA plastic beads coated with biofilm and biofilm producing bacteria, then display laccase enzyme on biofilm by adding SpyTag to Biofilm and SpyCatcher to CotA laccase. PHA can also act as a carbon source to bacteria, maintaining growth of bacteria and production of biofilm for longer period. This may further reduce cost by replacing biomaterials less frequently.
IV. Public Education and Engagement
Our public education includes two sections: on campus and off campus activities.
On campus, we design and implement a layered education system, starting from series of lectures to all students, interviewing some students and evaluating their potential of being iGEMers, then our synthetic biology club offering them training in genetic engineering.
Off campus, we established the collaboration with sewage plant for exchanging the instructive information including biology, plant and policy. We strongly believe that the practic"

Mentor-Mentee Relationship
To see the full feedback that we provided for the Purdue Biomakers, please visit Purdue's team Wiki!
Premise
The Iowa iGEM and Purdue Biomakers teams entered into a mentor-mentee relationship. In July 2017, we Skype called Purdue's iGEM team to discuss possible collaborations, seeking at first to find overlap between our projects. At the end of this Skype call, we quickly realized that the thing we needed help with most was actually getting some of our logistical targets off the ground. For example, we had no idea how to structure our organization (should we register as a student organization?) and we also were unfamiliar with the best training methods. How, in the start of the summer, could we bring all of our students up to speed? If we chose to create a formal course, what would be the best method to do so? Discussing these points proved crucial in navigating our first year as a team, and Purdue's shared materials and discussions helped us greatly.
Materials Received
After the initial Skype call, Purdue iGEM shared the following materials with us:
Purdue Constitution: details how Purdue's iGEM organization is structured and how roles are divided. Includes information on President, Vice President, Treasurer, Director of Club, Director of Science, Director of iGEM Team and Alumni Advisors, as well as their respective roles within the organization.
iGEM Internship Application: application form that interested members use to apply for the summer team. Includes detailed information on student eligibility requirements, time commitments, and what the internship provides. In return, it asks a series of questions that cover the applicant's interest in synthetic biology research, what sorts of projects they would propose, and what they hope to take away from the experience.
Learning Objectives for the Course: Purdue informed us that their faculty mentors offer an official synthetic biology course, while the students provide a sort of unofficial course, for new members. These are the learning objectives for the courses, which cover a High School Biology Review, How to conduct a review, Registry, team structure, systems biology, ethics, circuit design, plasmids and standard parts, genome modification, and common assays.

In the last part of our interview asked people about thei concepts of pollution and microcontaminats. When our team asked them if they knew what were micropolluants, a minority know what to answer. Yet, when we explained about the Brazilian situation and consequences those microcontaminants have on animals and human health, people saw it as a real concern. At last, we asked their opinion on the of GMOs on wastewater treatment and most of them found it a good idea.
Some of the information we gathered was something we already expected, based on the previous events we did on the city’s square. So, as a way to help on people’s knowledge about the topics questioned, we passed on flyers containing information on the WWTP of Lorena and explaining what are micropolluants, bringing to them a bit more about what our project wants to solve.
Also, we this event we were able to gain a new vision on some topics of or project, more specifically, related to biosafety. Most people saw the use of GMO on wastewater treatment as something good, once it is effective and safe. The first topic was already a concern for us, but the second made us re-think and change our project’s application.

The Slade
We wanted to reach out even further into the Arts community, to get people thinking about dyes and how they are used. We collaborated with The Slade School of Fine Art and with them unthreaded the chemical history of the dye industry. We constructed a timeline that peered back through time at the ancient and pre-industrial uses of pigments, to the rise of the azo dye, to help contextualise the Slade's installation in the UCL Wilkins Building, and highlight the terrific importance of azo dyes to the way we use colour.

ArtScienceBangalore,2010,Team:ArtScienceBangalore#NoteBook_-_-_TEXT.html,". So now the VISH-gene bacteria produces another chemical which ONLY the BRAHM-gene bacteria can read and this in turn activates the BRAHM-gene bacteria to produce a chemical to deactivate the SHIV-gene bacteria. Now there’s been too many bacteria killed so after a while of reproduction the optimum level is reached and ‘balance’ is restored. The subjects are happy and so are the gods. Soon after reproduction hastens up and there is over population again so the whole process is initiated making it a loop.
BRAHM-gene bacteria are identified with the presence of the BRAHM-gene. When the BBRAHM- gene replicates it does not transfer it’s genetic material completely, instead it retains one part of the gene, so the other bacteria now is the VISH-gene bacteria. When the BRAHM-gene bacteria replicates for the second time it does not transfer the BRAHM-gene at all making the new organism the SHIV-gene.
We’d like to think that this mythological concept, besides being fascinating will definitely find its way to a good purpose in the world of Synthetic Biology. So wait up until then."" Aaron
Samudra Manthan - The Churning of the Ocean
""This idea of the soma bacteria is inspired by the popular Hindu myth of the Samudra Manthan, commonly known as “the churning of the ocean“. The phrase “soma bacteria” comes from the drink of “soma”, which is a drink primarily behaving as an anesthetic in this famous mythical incident.
The soma bacteria are not just one bacterium but a pair of bacteria, which are co-dependent, unstable in the absence of each other. One bacterium is harmful in relation to the human body, whereas the other one is harmless, but it is to be noted that it is not of a curative nature. The habitat of these bacteria is common rust. While they live in their rusty habitat, they live in colonies but there is no activity of exchange taking place. The minute it comes in contact with the human body, the bacteria get activated at once. It commutes throughout the human body, causing harm. The minute it comes in contact with a white blood cell (WBC), the two bacteria start exchanging their genetic material rapidly. While the WBC recognizes that one bacterium is harmless, it also realizes that the other one is harmful. But due to the rapid state of exchange of genetic material, the WBC is unable to recognize the harmful one and try and kill it. While the harmless bacterium contains a protein, which the WBC cannot counter, it cannot kill"

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Project Design_-_-_TEXT.html," cells naturally contain a substantial amount of RNA. Moreover, their membranes endow exosomes with a specific cell tropism, attaching themselves to target cells by a range of surface adhesion proteins and vector ligands. Besides, exosomes are endogenous transporters, so they are unlikely to exert toxicity or immune response[5]. Hence, exosome is regarded as a potentially ideal siRNA delivery tool with advantages in three aspects: RNA-loading, targeting and safety.
placeiRGD
Moreover, exosomes can be endowed with the ability of targeting specific disease site through genetic modification of donor cells. In order to obtain exosomes with tumor-targeting ability, we redesigned natural exosomes by installing a tumor-targeting short peptide onto their surface. We chose iRGD, a tumor-penetrating peptide. Some studies have shown that iRGD homes to tumors by strictly binding to αν integrins which are specifically expressed on tumor cells and the endothelium of tumor vessels[6]. Meanwhile, iRGD peptide also own the ability of penetrating tumor tissue against interstitial pressure[7]. When combined with a drug, iRGD peptide can carry the drug deep into the extravascular tumor tissue.
whatshotiRGD-Lamp2b
We engineered our chassis, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, to express a fusion protein composed of the exosomal membrane protein Lamp2b and the tumor-targeting short peptide iRGD. Lamp2b (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2b) is a protein found specifically abundant on the surface of exosomes. By genetically engineering the iRGD peptide to the outer membrane portion of Lamp2b, Lamp2b can bring the iRGD peptide to the surface of exosomes. Then the iRGD peptide can guide exosomes to the specific tumor tissue. Through these modifications, exosomes will be conferred on tumor-targeting ability.
photoFig 2. We connected iRGD to Lamp2b using a glycine-linker to construct our fusion protein and promoted its expression by the promoter Pcmv. Then, our site-specific exosomes could deliver siRNA to tumor tissue.

During experiment, we transfected siRNA plasmid and target plasmid (coding our engineered fusion protein) into HEK293 cells to obtain exosomes with KRAS siRNA inside and iRGD peptide on their surface membranes. When the modified exosomes are injected into the bloodstream, the iRGD peptide will guide exosomes deep into tumor tissue and the exosomes will specifically recognize tumor"

Aptamers, originally having been conceived as an alternative to antibodies have proven notoriously difficult to properly select, against the multitude of targets available in nature. With our software [INSERT_NAME] you can find your own aptamer to target the ligand you want. To acheive this, we use an algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence minimizing the entropy of binding to the ligand. What enables this, is a combination of stratified sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. With this contact form, you can send us ligands, which for we will then compute aptamer candidates. To do this, we need crystal structures of those ligands, which have to follow a few rules for swift processing.
The format should be .pdb for proteins, and .pdb or .mol2 for small molecules.
In the case of small molecules, please take the time to run a semi-empirical quantum chemical calculation of its parameters using the following command in ambertools: antechamber -i [INPUT_NAME].pdb -fi pdb -o [OUTPUT_NAME].mol2 -fo mol2 -c bcc -s 2 where you substitute [INPUT_NAME] and [OUTPUT_NAME] with the respective filenames. Please then submit the .mol file.
The files should contain no waters, unless you need, for some reason, an aptamer for water (which would not work).
Protein files should contain no prosthetic groups or cofactors. This would require separate quantum-chemical handling for parameter estimation before processing.
Proteins should contain no nonstandard amino acids, not contained in Amber parameters.
For proteins, which are very large, please consider, if targeting a specific domain of that protein would be sufficient, or even beneficial to your project. Very large proteins could incur penalties on the software's performance.
For us to be able to efficiently process your requests, it"

However, we cannot identify significant changes of the ATP concentration on the TLC plate because of the low sensitivity of this method.
Fig. 5. Analysis of an in vitro transcription by thin layer chromatography.
ATP consumption during the transcription was monitored by TLC. ATP was converted to AMP by an apyrase reaction in order to separate it from other NTPs. Using TLC the consumption of ATP by the polymerase cannot be monitored properly.
Highly Sensitive Sensing of Small Molecules via Spinach in Biochemical Reactions in Real time
Fig. 6. Real time monitoring of the RNA synthesis using a Malachite Green Aptamer.
A
To analyze RNA synthesis in real time we applied a DNA template encoding for the RNA of interest (ROI) and a hammerhead ribozyme (HHR). Both fragments are inserted between the promotor (T7) and the Malachite Green Aptamer (MGA). Inducing the hammerhead ribozyme allows cleavage during the in vitro transcription. Hereby two RNA fragments emerge, the ROI and the hammerhead ribozyme fused to Malachite Green Aptamer (HHR-MGA). Using such setup, the emitted fluorescence of the HHR-MGA will be independent on the applied ROI. Thus the fluorescence is induced by the Malachite Green Aptamer that can be applied to compare efficiencies of different RNAs at the same time.
B
As a proof of principle we performed transcriptions and monitored the malachite green fluorescence signal in real time.
C
To confirm the results of the fluorescence measurements as well as the transcription efficiency is not hampered by the malachite green dye, all in vitro transcription reactions were analyzed using denaturing acrylamide gels.
Common techniques like TLC have a very poor limit of detection. Especially in our studies, a highly sensitive method is needed to visualize ATP concentration in biochemical reactions. Thus, we can apply our ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 system so sense consumption of ATP in real time (Fig. 6). To show the general feasibility of our system we titrated the T7 RNA polymerase concentration in in vitro transcription reaction. We monitored the fluorescence signal of the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 in regular intervals. In presence of a high RNA polymerase concentration we would expect the highest turn-off effect of the fluorescence. In Figure 6B we show the results of the"

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," addition, as part of the activated sludge process, WWTPs regularly cycle microbe-rich sludge back into aeration tanks to maintain the microbial population (figure 5-1). Ideally, this would stabilize the PR bacterial population in aeration tanks, allowing this system to be low-maintenance and easily adaptable to existing infrastructure.
To facilitate the application of PR bacteria in WWTPs, our modeling team created a calculator that informs WWTP managers the amount of PR bacteria they need to trap their desired amount of CC-NPs based on our experimental results and the conditions of their WWTP. Learn more about PR experiments and modeling!
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Applying PR in a WWTP Model
After we experimentally demonstrated that PR binds to CC-NPs, we wanted to test PR bacteria under conditions similar to a WWTP aeration tank. To learn more about those specific conditions, we visited and talked to engineers at Dihua WWTP, our local urban facility. At Dihua, wastewater is retained in aeration tanks for up to 5 hours, and a central rotor constantly churns the wastewater. To simulate these conditions, we built our own “aeration tank” using clear cylinders and a central rotor. Then, we set up three groups in separate aeration tanks: PR E. coli + distilled water, PR E. coli + CC-AgNP, or CC-AgNP solution alone (figure 5-4A). Finally, we turned on the rotor and churned the mixture for 5 hours.
In WWTPs, aeration tanks lead to secondary sedimentation tanks (figure 5-2), where flocculants—polymers that aggregate suspended solids—are added to accelerate sedimentation. During our visit to Dihua WWTP, the engineers gave us samples of their flocculants. After 5 hours of mixing, we stopped the rotor and added the flocculant powder used by Dihua WWTP to each tank (video 5-1). In the CC-AgNP cylinder, adding flocculants did not have any effect (figure 5-4B and C), suggesting that current wastewater treatment practices cannot remove NPs. In the cylinders containing PR bacteria, however, aggregated materials (including bacteria) settled to the bottom of the cylinder as expected (figure 5-4B). We then centrifuged the contents of each cylinder, and observed that the pellet of the PR bacteria + CC-AgNPs mixture was orange, reflecting the presence of aggregated CC-AgNPs (figure 5-4"

Based on molecular simulations run, linker 2 theoretically creates the most stable configuration of our circularized AFP construct. These results serve as the basis for the design of sequences required for experimental testing. This is not to say that this linker is the optimal option for this procedure, it simply provides the best option of those modeled for analysis.
AFP-SCAFFOLD DESIGN
The Ice Queen
Figure 5. Theoretical model of T3-10 scaffold. This 12-mer self-assembling scaffold is represented by the PDB file 4EGG.
Scaffold
A self-assembling protein scaffold introduces the ability to create a platform from which to create attachment between different subunits. Baker and Yeates have successfully created a number of such scaffolds with verified crystal structures4.
After examination of the different constructs available, we have chosen to use the T3-10 model (Figure 5). This single subunit 12-mer has a less complicated assembly procedure as compared to a 2-unit scaffold such as T33-21. The position of the C-terminus points away from the assembled structure enabling the attachment of an engineered part. Expression and assembly requirements are easily met at room temperature from a single vector. With 12 identical subunits, the scaffold could potentially house 12 antifreeze proteins.
Antifreeze Protein
The Type III antifreeze protein from ocean pout, the same used in the circularization project was selected for the scaffold system as well (See Figure 1). This is a well characterized protein, whose sequence was easily accessible by QGEM this year.
The E/K-coil system
We sought a strong, highly efficient means to connecting AFPs to the self-assembling scaffold. After considering our options, we opted for the E/K coil method used by Calgary iGEM 2013 . These non-covalent interactions are highly specific and should enable selective binding between AFPs and the scaffold subunit. Read more about coiled-coils on our Background page.

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Mondr6agón-Palomino O, Tsimring L, et al. A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks[J]. Nature, 2010, 463(7279): 326-330.
    Until now, we have got a stable single-period oscillation. But, instead of a simple 0-1 switch, what we need is a double-period oscillation. From the previous data, the phase difference between the concentration of aiiA and AHL is half a period. And then, if we let another quorum sensing substance -- gene DPD express with gene aiiA together (Fig.4a), the phase difference between the concentration curve of DPD and AHL is also half a period. By using this difference, we could segment another period (Fig.4b).
Fig.4a
Fig.4b
    We have got the double-period oscillation circuit already. But when doing an experiment, we could not realize a stable oscillation because of the continuous split of bacteria and the accumulation of autoinducers. In order to solve this problem, we use micro-fluid technology (Fig.5a). Microfluidics is science and technology using micro-channel to operate micro fluid. Using this technology, we can keep the quantity of bacteria at a certain level and take the accumulated autoinducers away, making the system a better coupling and could operate steadily. More details about this device could be found in Hardware page.
Logic gate
    We have achieved information input using light control system, and have decided the transformational rule using oscillation system. The following problem is how to combine these two systems together and we design an AND gate. The main principle we use in the AND gate is using tRNA to identify amber mutation. Protein T7ptag can activate PT7 promoter. When we make two amber mutations on T7ptag, the process of protein translation will be inhibited. After inputting exogenetic tRNA into E.coli, whose feature is to identify amber mutation, these two promoters controlling T7ptag and tRNA have composed the input of AND gate. And the output is the downstream PT7 gene.
Fig.5
    In the light control system, there has Plamada promoter and PcpcG2 promoter. In the oscillation system, there has Plsr promoter and PluxR promoter. Match these promoters together with fluorescence protein reporter gene, we can get four AND gate circuits:

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#KeepFresh_-_-_TEXT.html," reason, whilst our technology might be useful for ripeness monitoring, it would not replace the manual handling stage of this process. Instead, FPA suggested that perhaps a sensor that could remain in one of the cold rooms and send a live feed of ethylene levels to a computer in a cost-effective way would be a useful application for their context. For example, FPA handles shipments of kiwifruit arriving in Sydney on behalf of Zespri given they already have the facilities to do so. As part of this arrangement, there are temperature sensors installed in the cold rooms that send a constant temperature reading to Zespri in New Zealand, to ensure FPA are complying with Zespri’s required temperature guidelines. An ethylene sensor could thus serve a similar function.  Consequently, multiple designs were brainstormed and evaluated.
Design Options
Fruit sticker
A small, oval-shaped fruit sticker identical to current ones used to label the origin of all fruit produce could be applied to produce. The latex/cell-coated paper could be coated on the underside with an FDA-approved adhesive. These stickers could be applied to the produce at the same time as other sticker labelling, such that no extra processing would be required.
Scanner
A hand-held scanner device, designed for workers responsible for monitoring or handling fruit in the transportation or storage process. A slip of latex/cell-coated paper could be slipped into the front of the device prior to each use, and the device could be pointed at each crate/shipment/piece to measure the cumulative ethylene levels to which it has been exposed.
Curved handheld stick
Shaped like a spoon, with a narrow body designed to fit into the palm of the hand of the user and a slightly larger round head with a viewing window at the top, this sensor is also designed for workers monitoring storage rooms or shipments. A latex/cell-coated paper strip is to be inserted into the top of the device for each use, which can be seen through the viewing window.
Industrial sticker
A modification of the fruit sticker, this industrial sticker would have a more durable cellulose blend base and would be larger in size. It could also feature shipping information or labelling to reduce the packaging on a crate. This design is ideal for industrial use, such as in shipping containers or on produce storage shelves. It has the potential to give an average reading for a sample of produce, rather than an individual cumulative ethylene reading.
Plate
A small, thin square plate designed to sit in the corner of a storage room, this design has a groove for the user to slip a strip of latex/cell-coated"

A product safe for society?
In iGEM projects, final products and biobricks may have toxic or hazzardous features. The impilcations on society can be hard to assess but in many cases it comes down to common sense. In doubt the iGEM wiki safety page  suggest question sessions with  local laboratory supervisors. Another assessment approach is to raise questions about ethics. As open questions could identify concerns, they also cause discussions about safety of differnet aspects of final product.
Our team followed official guidelines and raised discussions about the safety of the Synthesizer-project and its impact on society. We considering unintended adverse effects of our tool and possible bioterrorism. The most prominent risk was the ability for users could design toxins peptide products for potential of bioterrorism. This raised a discussion about an implementation of a special blockade in the software to avoid the synthesis suggestions of harmful products. Still, the Synthetizer tool is intented to have positive influence on people's health by improving production of pharmaceuticals and reducing side-effects.

Support renewable energy
Renew earth’s future with BIO-E
problem
The use of non-renewable energy resources ,                              by greenhouse gas emissions lead to environmental                              problems and also put great strains on countries’ budgets.
vision
As we sought an alternative energy source,                              renewable, sustainable and one that will outrun fossil                              fuels our research led us to biofuels.
solution
Finally, we made use of bioethanol which is a                              renewable and sustainable green energy source that                              could be obtained from agricultural waste.
What We Did:
We investigated ways to improve bioethanol production since it's a non-toxic, biodegradable and cost friendly alternative                          to fossil fuels being about 20-30% more efficient and its carbon footprint being far smaller.
Doing so, we came across different bioenergy generations; first, second and third. We focused on second generation; energy                          from lignocellulosic biomass given that it's the most abundant, renewable and thus sustainable.
In the light of our research, we developed a second generation bioethanol production system aiming to decrease the economic                          and environmental consequences of energy production. Our system will increase the efficiency of ethanol production, ultimately                          its sustainability using the ethanologenic E.coli strain KO11 and two genes; FucO and GSH.

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#modeling Fine-regulation circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," with the application of FimE regulation circuit, pH Controller could regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid (Fig.12). LdhA could be replaced by other functional genes which could produce acid with different strength.
Fig.12 pH level change led by FimE regulation circuit. In alkaline environment, P-atp2 is induced, activating downstream FimE to invert the direction of J23119. J23119 conducts the transcription of LdhA which catalyzing lactic acid production. Eventually, extracellular pH is determined by strength of acid."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Gifu,2017,Team:Gifu#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," applied a lot of kinds of sake in Heian period. At that time, the sake was yet cloudy sake. From this period, “Sobosyu”(=sake produced by monks) started to develop till Japan government banned making sake by monks. The quality of “Sobosyu” was told to be high and their sake was so precious.
During middle ages, when commerce became more prosperous, the economical value of sake as a kind of goods is equal to rice. And in this era, there were three breakthrough renovation. First, it made a dramatically quality improvement to use white rice for both steamed rice and Koji. This is called “Moroshiro”. Using this way, brewers can make sake with high clarity. Second, brewers realized that making sake at winter, it took a little longer time, but they can produce pretty good quality of sake. Third, they made it possible to control the fermentation process by “Dankake”. “Dankake” is a kind of ingenuity. When they prepared, they added steamed rice and Koji rice and water in some steps. By doing this, they could increase the quantity of acid in stages.
Furthermore controlling their fermentation process they became to supply stable quality sake. In this way, mainstream of sake migrated from cloudy sake into clarified sake. In Edo period, some of innovative processing technology had developed. Here are some examples. To begin with, we will introduce the technology of “Hiire”(=pasteurization) which is most related to our team project. Pasteurization is a way to raise preserving property.
Another technology is the allegation medial of adding alcohol. These two technologies are means to avoid the risk of “Hiochi”. And from this period, sake became popular among common people because sake began to carry-out to whole Japan by ships. Though the innovative processing technology had developed, “Hiire” is not a complete measure to prevent “Hiochi”. So, there were many large scale of decays in Meiji period.
In 1904, Japan government established the National Research Institute of Brewing. NRIB was made in order to study yeast for seishu and improve brewing way. In NRIB, Kamajiro Eda who is a head of NRIB invented “Sokujyomoto”. “Sokujyomoto ” is sake mush which is used for fast brewing method by adding enzyme. Also he had improved the method of “Hiire”. Brewers do “Hiire” after they bottled their sake.

HKUST-Hong_Kong,2012,Team:HKUST-Hong Kong#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," B. subtilis but also because of its  advantage in safety. The employment of integration vector to some extent  minimizes the risk of antibiotic resistance spreading within the normal flora  in gut. In addition, since the exposure of BMP-2 to normal tissue can induce  adverse effect, integrating target genes into genome can reduce the chance of spreading  of BMP-2 gene through horizontal gene transfer and avoid non-specific drug  release in gut.
Protein secretion:
Comparing with E. coli, another commonly used  chassis in iGEM, Bacillus subtilis is  preferred because of its high capacity in secreting proteins to extracellular  environment. As a Gram-positive eubacteria, B.  subtilis lacks an outer membrane and only a layer of 10 to 50nm  peptidoglycan outside cytoplasmic membrane. Thus Bacillus  subtilis can secrete proteins directly into the extracellular environment. Since  we were aiming for bacterial secretion of BMP-2 out to the colon, this  property suits our purposes well. 
Peptide  displaying:
Lacking the outer membrane, Bacillus subtilis is ideal for peptide  displaying. The cell wall of B. subtilis is the surface of the bacterium and contains  approximately 9% of the total protein. The discovery and study in cell  wall-binding modules from cell wall-bound proteins provides an attractive tool  for surface display of peptide. (Pooley et al. 1996) Aiming to display the  tumor-binding peptide, RPMrel, on bacteria surface, we decided to take advantage  of the cell wall displaying system, LytC, in Bacillus subtilis. Thus, the ease of peptide displaying served as  one of our reasons to choose B. subtilis as our chassis.
Normal flora in  gut:
B.  subtilis not only exists widely in the nature, but also contributes to part of the normal flora  in gut. (Collin and Gibson 1999) Regarded as a probiotic, it has  been proved to have positive effects on patients suffering from gaseous symptom  (Corazza et al. 1992). Using B.  subtilis as our chassis, in theory, will not introduce any exotic species into gut as well.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#Project Adhesion_-_-_TEXT.html," can efficiently kill specific pathogens without disturbing other cells in its environment, an adhesion system could play a vital role. Getting our Bactissile to attach to its target, in our case Yersinia enterocolitica , could give important advantages in target specificity and delivering medicine in a way that ensures it reaches Y. enterocolitica in a concentration as high as possible.
Technical Approach
The idea was to manipulate our Bactissiles bonding to any of Y. enterocoliticas surface structures and thus preventing the pathogen from ever attaching to the gut wall. This could be done with a DNA construct coding for a membrane protein that either resembles the bonding that Y. enterocolitica makes to our cells or one that itself binds to Y. enterocolitica.
We studied the ways of infection of Y. enterocolitica and could determine that its main strategies of entering through the gut wall is by using its diverse membrane proteins YadA, invasin and Ail. YadA and invasin work together to bind to our cell membranes. While YadA binds to collagen, invasin structurally resembles fibronectin, that is present in the extracellular matrix, which is recognized by the fibronectin binding membrane protein integrin alpha-5-beta-1 in our cell membranes. [1] Y. enterocolitica uses our own cell-to-cell binding mechanism to find a target cell and trick it to endocytose by binding to the integrin and to the collagen outside and in between the cells. [2] At first glance we thought of manipulating our probiotics to also use the same bioorganic systems. That could be done by expressing collagen-like proteins and fusing them with an anchor protein that could transport the whole construct to the outer membrane and keep the collagen attached to the probiotic surface. [3]
By using collagen, and especially putting it on the surface of a bacterial outer membrane that is meant to enter the human body, is an extremely risky procedure. “As antibodies would be produced to target the collagen and anchor protein complex this could lead to an autoimmune reaction as they would also react on the collagen naturally present in our body” says Lars Hellman, a professor in immunology at Uppsala University. More about problems with Y. enterocolitica-adhesion and the development of autoimmune  disease can be found in this text .
Instead we took inspiration from our teams killing system which secretes a bacteriocin, CFY, which specifically binds to and ruptures the outer cell membrane of Y. enterocolitica. [4] The main focus of the"

This is what we want to build: phage with enzymes fused to the protein coat.
The project will use phage M13, which is non-lytic (does not kill the bacteria). The entire genome is known (e.g. here is the entire M13mp18 genome) so primers can be designed. New England Bioworks claims :
""The major coat protein pVIII is present at ~2700 copies per virion, of which ~10% can be reliably fused to peptides or proteins.""
We would infect our E. coli with wildtype phage. Our E. coli would have a plasmid coding for a fusion between an enzyme and pVIII. Proteins can be fused to pVIII at its amino terminal (i.e. 5' end in the DNA), according to Weiss and Sidhu, 2000 . pVIII has a leader peptide ( residues 1-23 ) that is cleaved out, slightly complicating fusion design.
To attach several different proteins to the phage, different fusions can be created and all of them expressed on the plasmid.

“Before attending the panel I had not thought about the issue of equity in much detail so my views haven’t changed so much as I simply learned enough in the discussion to form an opinion.” - Anonymous student
Synthetic Biology Workshop
The follow-up laboratory component of the workshop aimed to build upon the panel discussion and progress towards equality in synthetic biology by providing members of all genders an opportunity to develop their technical laboratory skills. We hoped the two experiments helped facilitate interest and engage participants in some of the fundamental aspects of synthetic biology. Students were assisted by iGEM members to conduct cell transformation and streak plating experiments.
Introduction and Lab Safety
Recapitulating on the topics of the panel discussion, the lab opened with an overview of the underlying gender equity issues in STEM fields before moving on to a discussion of the sciences and potentials of synthetic biology. As well, a section of the presentation was devoted to lab safety to emphasize the importance of following laboratory safety procedures. All University of Waterloo students are required to take WHMIS.
Part 1: Transformation Protocol
Cell transformation is ubiquitous in areas of biotechnology, genetic engineering, and molecular biology. Particularly in synthetic biology, transformation of synthesized DNA sequences that have been ligated into cloning vectors into bacterial organisms is essential to study the synthetic gene or system. We felt that the difficulty and relevance of the technique made it a good entry point to garner interests and spur curiosity in the area of synthetic biology. Not to mention that it is also a key technique employed in our team's (and many other iGEM teams’) experiments.
Members were informed on the necessary background information regarding transformation including plasmids design, cell competency, and standard transformation protocol. Members then performed their own transformation experiments using in the common cloning E.coli strain DH5-alpha.
Part 2: Streak Plating
Drawing on the success of the SHAD Valley workshop, the team felt it was important to also include a streak plating experiment in the synthetic biology workshop. Members were instructed to streak plate their own design and were encouraged to check back on their results afterwards at the iGEM office. The chromoprotein-modified ( Bba-K592012 biobrick ) E.coli adds a more visual element to further engage participants.

Figure 24: E. coli strain BW25113. Its size is (6 x 4) pixels. This corresponds to (1.34 x 0.90) µm.
Figure 25: E. coli strain BW25113. Its size is (9 x 6) pixels. This corresponds to (2.02 x 1.34) µm.
Figure 26: This sample contained wildtype E. coli and C. reinhardtii. It was provided by Dr. Laurence Wilson, captured using his own DIHM. The hologram was produced using our software and the size of E. coli was (6 x 4) pixels, which equates to (1.34 x 0.90) µm.
Figure 27: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sizes were as follows. A: (9 x 10) pixels, (10.1 x 11.2) µm. B: (9 x 9) pixels, (10.1 x 10.1) µm. C: (10 x 9) pixels, (11.2 x 10.1) µm. D: (10 x 9) pixels, (11.2 x 10.1) µm.
Results: These results show that our software is capable of producing holograms within which the shapes of organisms can be distinguished. In figures 24 to 26, the E. coli can be seen to be rod shaped, approximately 2 µm in one direction and 1 µm in the other, as expected [6]. In the figure 27, C. reinhardtii is approximately circular with diameter around 10 µm, also as expected [3]. These are promising results which show the potential for the technique to be used to distinguish between organisms within a co-culture, especially when there is a size discrepancy. This is exemplified in figure 26, most of all. Figures 24, 25 and 27 are also evidence that the quality of images taken with our hardware is sufficient for shape detection. As seen here , we also tested the ability to find the size and shape of organisms with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is of an intermediate size when compared with E. coli and C. reinhardtii. The S. cerevisiae was kindly provided by the iGEM Aachen 2017 team.

Overview
This year, our project is focused on hydrogen energy, which is a new form of energy. When it comes to new energy development, there are mainly three aspects that should be considered in our humble opinion, efficiency, technology and cost.
 
Efficiency mains that the development of this kind of new energy is worthwhile and bears advantages over traditional chemical energy. Thus we counselled experts in hydrogen production fields about current bottlenecks in hydrogen production.
 
Technology mains the techniques and principles used in hydrogen production that facilitate its utilization in industry. We interviewed chemists and biologists about details of the engineered bacteria, such as how electrons can be conducted across the plasma membrane.
 
Cost mains not only the expenses used in the development of hydrogen, but the time input as well. We must gain support from the public and government in order to afford the cost of new energy development. Therefore, we designed questionnaires at first to investigate the public opinion about hydrogen energy. We also propagated the advantage of hydrogen as new energy as well as our projects to the communities. We even opened up our lab to primary school students to attract more attention to synthetic biology as well as to promote education.
 
Besides these efforts, we also attended many conferences to not only keep in touch with iGEMers, but promoting our projects as well. These young scientists can always come up with interesting ideas! In addition, we also spare no efforts to help iGEM teams in China and even help two universities to establish new teams, which is very meaningful and exciting!
Questionnaire
We designed a questionnaire about general energy issues and our project both in English and Chinese versions. Finally, we have collected 573 samples, which qualified us to make further analysis about our topic.
 
 
1. Respondents
 
In order to get a comprehensive knowledge of people’s understanding about the background of our project, we collected a variety of respondents of different ages, different occupations and different knowledge levels. As to the age, respondents of 18-29 years old, such as university students, account for more than one-third of the total, so as the respondents of 30-49 years old, who are energetic to do their jobs or researches. The rest are people under 18 or above 50. Besides, as to the knowledge level, most respondents have received well-round education.

PASantiago_Chile,2017,Team:PASantiago Chile#project_-_-_TEXT.html," to LexA are the first to be fully expressed. If the damage persists or is very high, the concentration of the RecA protein increases and other operons are affected by being linked to LexA.
Normally, Reca is repressed at a basal level of 1000 molecules per cell. Once the LexA repressor is separated, is rapidly increased by 20 times the amount of the protein (10 molecules per second), reaching its maximum in an hour since the damage event occurred. Quantities of the RecA protein return to basal levels within 4 to 6 hours since the event. This decrease causes the elimination of signal-induced repair of DNA damage by removing the agent that activates the RecA protein, resulting in an increase of the concentration of lexA repressor. The repression of the SOS system is restored and the cell returns to its initial state. (Bianco & Kowalczykowski, 1998)
Why did we choose to work on this project?
The interest to improve the system of detection of radiation for people who work in the health area, it was mainly because there were some students of the team who were interested in the idea of studying medical technology or radiology, whereby, the majority know the risks and protocols of security which have to be maintained to minimize the possibilities of suffering serious damages due to the radiation emitted from the usage of medical devices, such as  the utilization of dosimeters, which measure the radiation of the medium. Thanks to this investigation, we have discovered that this area is the one that needs more help, because the devices already mentioned are very sensitive to the light, humidity and heath, factors that will modify the results.
Also, the most important point was that there was not an immediate delivery of information from the device, because, according to the Chilean Legislation, the dosimeters utilized in the laboratories have to be checked for the SEREMI, monthly, quarterly or even biannually, depending on the institution. And, in the case of the overexposure, will be a late advice and there will be a damage. In addition to information, the dosimeters of the best quality actually have a very high value, so not the most of the laboratories can be access to the devices.
In addition, the empty in the security for the radiologists and medical technologists, incentivized the team to create the system that will provide accurate information that will warn if the professional is at risk.
The bacteria detect ionizing radiation in harmful levels, and when this happens, a lemon scent and a purple coloring is emitted, warning the specialist is in a medium with harmful radiation"
