Overnight culture of Tyrosinase
I inoculated eight falcon tubes containing 12 ml LB and 24 ul amphicillin (50mg/ml) with the tyrsoinase site directed mutagenesis colonies number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8. These were incubated overnight in 37 °C with shake and will be miniprepped tomorrow.
Digestion of protein A (ZZ domain) and bank vector C
I cut a previously PCR product of protein A ZZ domain. The first digestion was carried out with the restriction enzyme NgoMIV. However since this enzyme is from New England BioLabs and has another buffer composition compared to the second digestion with the restriction enzyme AgeI from Fermentas (fast digest) I had to run a gel clean up before following up with the second digest after the first digest.
I also cut IgG protease in the bank vector C since I wanted to replace the insert of IgG protease in bank vector C with an insert of protein A ZZ domain.
First digest:
DNA vector with IgG protease 20 ul
Restriction enzyme  NgoMIV 1 ul
Buffer #4 3 ul
H2O 6 ul
DNA PCR product of protein A ZZ domain 10 ul
Restriction enzyme  NgoMIV 1 ul
Buffer #4 3 ul
H2O 6 ul
I incubated the vector in 3 hours and the PCR product in 1 hour, both in 37 °C.
After 3 hours of incubation of the vector I added 1.5 ul CIAP to this sample in order to dephosphorylate the vector to prevent the vector to couple back into a circle. The sample was yet again incubated in 37 °C for 30 min.

Measurarty
Measurarty is the evil player in the game of Cellock Holmes and WatsOn. Measurarty is the pathogen detection logic behind our project. Using our Measurarty algorithm, we want to automatically detect pathogens from the chip photos delivered by WatsOn, without human interaction. Besides reducing the risk of human errors, this makes our device usable by almost everyone.

Measurarty - An Introduction
Our device control software is able to take images of incubated chips inside WatsOn. Yet, that does not bring the user closer to the answer of the question:
What's on the chip?
In fact, answering this question seems trivial for a human: Just check whether a colony grown has grown on the chip and you're done. This task is even easier with our chip system, because these show fluorescence wherever a pathogen has been detected.
But is this an easy task for a computer? Actually not. The task of automatic detection is tried by several disciplines in computer science, from pattern recognition over machine learning to by medical imaging chairs.
Here, we would like to present a pipeline for this task that makes use of easy segmentation and classification algorithms. First, Measurarty segments the target image using Statistical Region Merging (SRM) in order to find regions of similar properties. After this step, we can segment the picture using histogram thresholding in HSV color space to find candidate regions for pathogens. Finally, a classification algorithm can detect the pathogen on our chips.
To demonstrate the algorithm, the following sample image will be discussed.

James Thorogood
I am in my second year of Mechanical Engineering with a biomedical specialization. This summer I had a blast with iGEM Calgary, where I have been responsible for the development of the biosensor hardware and software package. This is my first time partaking in research, and I have learned volumes about biology, genetics, engineering and more. After my time at iGEM, I am beginning to consider an engineering career path in/around these fields. I also learned that biologists are people too. In my free time, I play various sports, hike and cliff-jump in Banff, browse GrooveShark, lose to Colin in foosball, jam, and spend time with friends. I also devote my time to the position of Sports Director with the Engineering Student’s Society, and the team-lead for a youth engagement group in Engineers Without Borders.

Project Description
Project Goals
The goal of this project is to generate an Antifreeze Protein Library, built from a diverse range of organisms and quantitatively characterized in E. coli. Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs) have demonstrated biofilm inhibition, a recently discovered property which we thought beared investigation (Heisig et al. 2014). Biofilms are an important part of antibiotic resistance in some bacteria, their disruption could be an important mechanism to combat the rise of antibiotic resistant strains (Donlan and Costerton 2002). Heisig et al. described the properties of a single AFP, IAFGP, and we knew that many more existed. We decided to focus our project on gathering and characterizing a broad group of AFPs into a library. The library is quantitatively characterized with regards to the AFP’s effect on freeze survival and biofilm formation. We believe this library will give synthetic biologists an array of tools to use to control biofilm formation.
Overview
We searched the literature, including nucleotide and protein sequence databases, to find known antifreeze proteins. After generating a list of candidates we were able to select a number of AFPs which were well documented, of an appropriate size to clone into a plasmid vector, and which represented a wide range of organisms. We then took their sequences and codon optimized them for our host organism, E. coli. We then had that optimized sequence, with the biobrick prefix and suffix, synthesized.  We used Biobrick Cloning to insert our sequences into a plasmid backbone and transformed the final product into E. coli. The transformed strains were used in our Biofilm and Freeze Assays to quantitatively measure the effects of our AFPs on freeze survival and biofilm formation. The freeze assay involved slow freezing cells to -20C or -80C for 24 hours and comparing the survival rate to that of the culture they were taken from. The biofilm assay involved growing the biofilm forming strain EMG2:Kλ E. coli expressing our antifreeze proteins in a 96 well plate, staining the wells with crystal violet after the incubation period, and solubilizing the crystal violet in acetic acid to quantify biofilm"
IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Stochastic Model_-_-_TEXT.html," noises are always are of high frequency in nature, the low pass action provided by the process can attenuate such characteristics. As the γ increases the bandwidth increases and make the system succeptible to noise, that is why a ssrA tag protein expression is much faster (owe to the larger bandwidth) but becomes more noisy (as the system low pass action range is increased with the increase in bandwidth.)

Aim Grow transformed yeast strains for SDS-PAGE analysis of protein profiles
Strains are grown in Verduyn medium and induced with galactose
1 ml samples were stored at -20℃ at 0, 24 and 48 hours
OD 600 were measured of 10x diluted transformant cultures.
4mL of each culture was removed and spun down, the rest was left to grow diluted in 4mL of auxotrophic media.
Spun-down cells were resuspended in 5mL of their respective auxotrophic media. 260 uL of 40% galactose was added.
Samples were incubated overnight.
The OD measurements were found to be inaccurate halfway through the experiment, these were not taken into account during sample preparation, meaning that different concentrations of cells were exposed to the same concentration of Galactose.

The point of this activity was to show the students that bacteria communicate with certain types of molecules, ones only certain bacteria can receive. When these bacteria that can communicate get together in large groups, they have an advantage over the single bacteria because express new genes and alter their phenotypes. The rounds were to simulate the time lapse of bacterial communication in a large population. At first, everyone was mixed up and no one was in pairs. It took several rounds for the students to form a “quorum”, enough to express new phenotypes. However, after being given the ability to broadcast their shape and color, groups quickly found all their potential partners, winning the game.
After the activity, we explained the phenomena of quorum sensing and showed them a portion of the TED Talk by Bonnie Bassler, a professor at Princeton University and a driving force within the quorum sensing field, which can be found below.
Experiment
To give the students a real example of quorum sensing and give them experience with culturing techniques, we led them through an experiment with Vibrio harveyi, a marine bacterium that creates light at high cell density. In order to demonstrate quorum sensing in V. harveyi, we used one wild type and two mutant strains of bacteria.
The wild type strain has the ability to make the signal and receive the signal. One mutant strain will not be able to make the signal, but it will be able to receive the signal. The other mutant strain will not be able to receive the autoinducer, but will be able to make it. We had the students plate these strains side by side in different combinations to see if they luminesced. On the wild type plate, the whole plate luminesced. On the two control plates of sender/sender and receiver/receiver, there was no luminescence. However, on the sender/receiver plate, the receiver strain luminesced strongly in the center and faded toward the edges of the plate.
You can see the full experiment write-up here: File:QSExperiment.pdf
We had prepared plates the day before in order to show them how their plates should look in a few days. In small groups, one group member would take them into a very dark room and have the students explain what they were seeing. Some of the questions we asked were the following: Why is only the receiver luminescing? How does the autoinducer move across the plate? Why does the luminescence fade? What should the plate look like tomorrow?

What is a Riboswitch?
A riboswitch is a piece of mRNA that regulates gene expression. There are primarily two types of riboswitches: translational and transcriptional riboswitches. The fluoride riboswitch is a transcriptional riboswitch (Figure 2), which means that a terminator is formed when the riboswitch is transcribed that limits the processivity of the RNA polymerase transcribing downstream genes. When the aptamer (ligand-binding) region of the fluoride riboswitch interacts with fluoride, the terminator is not formed allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and transcribe the downstream gene.
Figure 2: Schematic of a transcriptional riboswitch
2015 Exeter iGEM Team, RNA Riboswitches
In our project, we will use the fluoride riboswitch. In Figure 3 you can see a crystal structure of the aptamer domain of the fluoride riboswitch. How can a negatively charged piece of RNA bind to a negatively charged fluoride ion? The fluoride riboswitch encapsulated three Mg2+ ions that can bind to the fluoride ion (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Crystal structure of a fluoride riboswitch
Aiming Ren, Kanagalaghatta R. Rajashankar, Dinshaw J. Patel “Fluoride ion encapsulation by Mg2+ ions and phosphates in a fluoride riboswitch” 2012 Nature 486, 85–89
In nature the riboswitch regulates the expression of genes that help the organism deal with high levels of fluoride. These genes are often pumps that allow fluoride to be exported out of the cell (Figure 4). In E. coli the gene crcB encodes a fluoride efflux channel that removes excess fluoride from the cell so that it is no longer toxic. In E. coli when the crcB gene is genetically deleted (ΔcrcB), the phenotype is increased sensitivity to fluoride and concentrations above 500μM are lethal. In our experiments we needed to utilize the ΔcrcB E. coli strain so that fluoride could accumulate intracellularly.
Figure 4: Crystal structure of a fluoride channel
Our Design
We constructed an operon that would enable us to regulate the expression of the gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase with the fluoride riboswitch, called CHOP (Figure 5). We ordered the synthetic operon from IDT DNA with overhangs that have homology to the pSB1A3 vector so we could clone our operon in with Gibson. We used the pSB1"

Digestion of DNA
Digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases is an important method in molecular biology. Restriction enzymes recognize 4 – 10 bp-long palindromic DNA sequences in a highly specific manner. For instance, the enzyme EcoRI from the Escherichia coli strain R recognizes the sequence 5’-GAATTC-3’. In the early days, the reaction samples to digest DNA were incubated for up to 20 h in order to obtain a fully digested DNA. Nowadays, many biotech companies sell hyperactive variants of the restriction enzymes that are commonly used in the lab. We will use FastDigest enzymes from Thermo Scientific. According to the manual from the manufacturer, 1 mg of DNA (for instance l phage DNA) are cleaved by 1 ml of the FastDigest enzyme within 5 – 15 min. With the same enzyme activity, 1/5 of a purified PCR product should be cleaved within 20 min.

We recommend incubating the reaction mixtures for at least 30 min at 37°C to obtain fully digested DNA fragments. After digestion, you can use the PCR purification kit from Qiagen to purify the digested DNA. Please keep in mind that you have diluted the DNA solution in the reaction mixture. For eluting the DNA from the spin column you should use 28 – 30 ml of sterile water. To dephosphorylate your plasmid DNA, add 1 ml alkaline phosphatase to the reaction mixture and incubate the plasmid for additional 15 min at 37°C. Watch out for star activity of the restriction enzyme in your sample (e.g. EcoRI)! Star activity depends on the enzyme amount, the pH value, the presence of organic solvents, and the incubation time (Wei et al., 2008).
There are different types of restriction enzymes:

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Coacervation_-_-_TEXT.html," of this equation, coacervation will occur, whereas if it is less, homogeneous mixing will occur. The value of $\sigma_N(\phi)$ can be interpreted as the minimum charge density that a polymer duo of length $N$ and volume fraction $\phi$ need to have in order to coacervate.
Now remember what we are trying to do here: we are trying to show that for a fixed charge density, longer polymers in solution coacervate, whereas shorter ones do not. In other words, we want to show that by chopping up one of the polymers, the system will go from a coacervate state into a homogeneously mixed state. Full mathematical treatment ranges beyond our scope, so instead we will take a graphical approach. We start by plotting $\sigma_N(\phi)$ for a solution containing polymers of effective chain length $N=400$ (Figure 2A). Say that the used polymers have charge density $\sigma=0.135$ and are present in a concentration $\phi=0.008$. Our system is thus at the point $P$ in Figure 2A, which lies in the region where coacervation occurs. Now what we do is chop up all the polymers from a length of $N=400$ to a length of $N=100$, without making any other change to the solution. The polymers still have exactly the same charge density, and the volume fraction is also unaltered. In other words, our system stays at the exact same point $P$. When we plot the same graph now for $N=100$, we see that the point $P$ suddenly lies outside the coacervate region, and in the region where homogeneous mixing occurs (Figure 2B).
Figure 2: The spinodal curve shifts upon decreasing polymer length. The spinodal curve shifts into the direction of positive σ when the polymers in coacervates are chopped up into smaller pieces. Here plots of $\sigma(\phi)$ are shown for polymer lengths $400$ (A) and $100$ (B). Where a solution at point P would be in the coacervate region for polymers of length $400$, it would not in the case those polymers would be chopped up into a length of $100$.
So there we have the coacervation method qualitatively explained. It can easily be shown that this explanation is general for any values $N$, and that we did not conveniently choose $N=400$ and $N=100$ to meet our statement. We saw in Figure"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of when their culture is ready for use. Cory Schwartz from UC Irvine donated the pHR-D17-hrGFP plasmid to us, which has homology arms to the Y. lipolytica genome. The plasmid can integrate into the D17 pseudogene of the Y. lipolytica genome by homologous recombination and has a constitutive expression of GFP [22] . We will add our short riboswitch sequence (219-222 bp, depending on the specific aptamer) in the 3’ UTR of the hrGFP reporter of the plasmid; this creates a one-gene reporter system contained within a  plasmid with ampR and ura3 selectable markers and an hrGFP reporter linked to a progesterone-specific riboswitch.
Figure 6: Design of our one-gene riboswitch reporting system. The absence of progesterone allows for continued activation of the hammerhead ribozyme, which cleaves the hrGFP mRNA at the 3’ end and causes accelerated degradation of the mRNA strand. In the presence of progesterone, the hammerhead ribozyme is inactivated and translation occurs normally. The frequency of translation events will be tied to the frequency of ligand binding events, allowing for concentration-dependent levels of fluorescence.
FUTURE WORK
Progesterone's direct precursor, pregnenolone, also has many beneficial aspects. It is the precursor to all steroid hormones in the body, such as cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol and aldosterone are adrenal cortex steroid hormones. Cortisol regulates carbohydrate metabolism and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Aldosterone plays a huge role in cardiovascular health, and helps maintain blood pressure and regulates the salt and water balance in the body. The pathway design we have created allows for the future creation of many beneficial steroid drugs by simply adding a few more genes.
Future optimizations for PoPPY-switch could include changing the location of our riboswitch so that high progesterone concentrations directly inhibit the progesterone production pathway creating an innate dosage-control mechanism. Another avenue of improvement would be to use the same riboswitch system, but with a constitutively inactive cleavage that shuts down the production of a survival-necessary gene upon binding to progesterone. The resulting system would then use senescence as an off-switch for progesterone production.

IISc-Bangalore,2018,Team:IISc-Bangalore#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," of the agent and the percentage survival after 2 hrs was quantified using a resazurin-based viability dye.
UV Mutagenesis
Phage mutagenesis was induced by exposing phages in a suspension to UV (298nm) for varying amounts of time before propagating them in a susceptible host. The particles obtained after the first propagation were purified from the whole cell lysate and a part of this was used for further mutagenesis. The other part was utilized for a plaque assay to check the viability of phages obtained at each step of mutagenesis and to check their efficacy on resistant bacteria.
EMS Mutagenesis
For chemical mutagenesis, phage particles were incubated with susceptible cells (OD600 0.6, 104 pfu/mL) for 20 mins followed by addition of Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). After propogation for 2 hrs, the phages were purified and propogated in the susceptible strain (to ensure amplification of particles that can infect the susceptible strain). They were then extracted from the lysate and were either used for further mutagenesis or to check the susceptibiity of T4 resistant bacteria.
mCherry Improvement
Truncation assay
To quantify the truncation from the internal RBS in imCherry (and mCherry), we used a combination of two strategies. Firstly, a rough estimate was obtained by comparing the band intensities directly from the gel electrophoresis of the total cell lysate after expressing the protein.
To get a higher order estimate on the truncation, we purified the protein using Ni-NTA and measured the fluorescence obtained in all (supernatant, wash, and elution) fractions. In an ideal case, the ratio of fluorescence obtained in the supernatant and elution fractions would give the fraction of protein that was truncated (assuming truncated and non-truncated i/mcherry is equally fluorescent). However, the process of binding of 6xHis to Ni-NTA is not perfect and proteins tend to run off into the supernatant and the washes. To get rid of this experimental error, we performed PAGE with each fraction and divided the total fluorescence of the fraction into two parts - truncated/non-truncated - using the band intensities. The fluorescence for truncated protein from each fraction was then summed up and was divided by the fluorescence of the non-truncated part to get the relative fractions of the two varieties.
The results for the improvement can be found on the Improve page.

The limitation of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas intensifies the need to find different sources to provide energy for a constantly rising world population. Renewable energy can be supplied by natural agents such as wind, water, plants or the sun. The conversion of solar energy in particular is a crucial issue as the sun presents an inexhaustible and easily accessible energy source for most inhabited regions of the Earth. Thus, optimizing the balance between efficient conversion of solar energy and the affordability and ease-of-manufacturing of solar cells is an important task for the future. In this regard, lower production costs will benefit manufacturer, customer, and the environment alike.
Commercially available silicon solar cells provide a decent solar energy conversion rate in combination with moderate costs. As with most technologies, these factors may be improved by imitating natural processes, in this case photosynthesis. Upon absorption of a photon, a chlorophyll molecule is excited and donates its high energy electron into a redox cascade. This principle can be applied to solar cells by adding dyes that transfer electrons to a transparent semiconductor. Possible semiconductors are zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), which are both produced in large quantities as ingredients of tooth paste, sun screen etc.
To reduce the production costs, a large area of the solar cell can be covered by autonomously working, living bacteria. Especially biofilms provide a promising approach because they can integrate metals into their structure and may be mineralized. Hence, the transparent semiconductor can be deposited by adding the initial salts to the bacteria solution.

We also presented our poster for the first time in London, with many teams commenting that they enjoyed our infographic style as it differed from all the other teams.  Feedback included that it was easy to read and follow; there should be more lab work and results present and that the layout should follow the presentation so they link seamlessly together.
Edinburgh Debate
We teamed up with the undergraduate team from Edinburgh to organise a debate regarding GMOs to help us better understand perceptions from non-scientists and what they main points are for arguing for and against the use of GMOs.  We enrolled the University of Dundee and Edinburgh debating unions to present and chair the debate, which was a massive success and contributed to our understanding of public opposition to GMOs.
The debate leaned heavily towards GM crops, as it does in Scotland, and focused on the profit that could be made by large companies such as Monsanto who develop GM seeds that outperform their natural siblings.  There is a fear that these companies would hold their seeds ransom for an extremely high price, with farmers obliged to pay due to their undoubted benefits.  This was countered with the notion that whilst companies such as Monsanto make a profit, it is not comparable to the saving of millions of lives due to these improved agrichemicals producing better yields, and in harsher environments.
Mentoring
The Dundee High School Team was the first from Dundee and first from Scotland.  They entered the lab with little experience and very basic knowledge of the correct procedures and protocols that they would require to complete their lab work.
We mentored them throughout their first month in the lab to develop their skills, grow their confidence and spent most of our days with them, either in the wet or dry lab, assisting in any way we could. Kieron, Chris, Holly and Rachel taught them how to pipette as well as carry out minipreps, restriction digests, ligations and transformations and showed them how to make and run agarose gels. We also made sure they were aware of the correct safety procedures and when to wear appropriate PPE. Fatima helped them to get to grips with mathematical modelling and Ummi helped them to design their poster and presentation.
UCL Testing
UCL are sending us their device to test in the stomach simulator. We tested their lycopene construct at pH5 in our stomach simulator, taking samples and measuring their absorbance every 15 minutes.

Biosafety
Biosafety is defined as the prevention of the unintended exposure or accidents involving genetically modified organisms or pathogens. It is the responsibility of scientists and companies to follow working policies that will guarantee that the biological sample will not cause harm to the workers, the public or the environment. Currently, there are many projects focused on developing biosafety tools for synthetic biology, mainly motivated by the concern that society, institutions, and organizations have expressed, but whose aim is to create a safe technology and not to please some sectors of the population [1]. The present efforts are a reflection of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, which was held in 1975 at a conference center at Asilomar State Beach to discuss biosafety and ethics issues related to genetic engineering.
In addition to this, a related confusing term to biosafety is biosecurity, which deals with the intended theft, misuse or release of harmful biological agents [2].
Synthetic Biology is a relatively new technology that can be still modified to make it more open and safer [3]. To achieve this, key stakeholders such as governmental institutions and the general public will have to engage in a public conversation with scientists and companies in order to develop the field.
Moreover, the synthetic biology tools have themselves the potential to make synthetic biology safer through the application of safety mechanisms on the biological devices developed. As synthetic biology is based on engineering principles applied to biology, the safety engineering applied in the usual technologies will"

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#labjournal manu_-_-_TEXT.html,"ocols Used: Plate reader experiments
Results: Figure 36
Next Steps: Repeat experiments with added chromate substances.
Week Beginning 14/09/2015
Summary
During this week the samples from the previous plate reader were retrieved and prepared for blotting against both GFP, and the 6-His - Tag of ChrB.
14/09: Western blot of plate reader samples MG1655 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp + pUniprom-chrB, and MG1655 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp + pUniprom-chrB (opt).
Aim of experiment: To identify whether or not there is any detectable difference in both, the level of GFP, and the level of ChrB, before and after induction with IPTG.
Protocols Used: SDS-PAGE + Western blot
Results: Even though the blot was very blurred, expression of GFP could be confirmed in all samples. There seemed to be no noteable difference between induced and uninduced.
Next Steps: Repeat the assays of the previous weeks by subcloning chrB, chrB (opt), and chrB (Bielefeld) into vectors with different expression levels and see how it influences the level of GFP expression. Then add different chromate salts and also probe the system with other substances, e.g. other heavy-metal salts.

I ran the PCR products from 9/4 on gel. There were no viable products.
9/6/2013
We set up PCRs with Desi with a variety of conditions to test all of the primers that we have been using and the new primers for the iGem plasmid backbone for both DspB and Savinase. This will allow us to see if the DNA templates that we are using are viable or not. If some of the PCRs work, but not all of them, then we know that the problem is with our primers, not the DNA templates we are using.
9/9/2013
We ran our PCR products from 9/6 on gel and got no results on any of them. This clearly shows that our DNA templates themselves are not viable. We will need to get new DNA templates to use for our DspB and Savinase. We ordered genomic DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana, which contains the DspB gene. We will also try to get purified Bacillus subtilis DNA from Dr. Robison's lab.
We set up new cholera overnights, seeding them with 50 ul of our previous overnights in 4 mL of SLB, and placed them in the 30°C incubator.
We set up sequencing on several of the Savinase and AmyA plasmids to check them:
1.  Savinase - Colony B with Forward primer     2.  Savinase - Colony B with Reverse primer     3.  Savinase - Colony D with Forward primer     4.  Savinase - Colony D with Reverse primer     5.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.
DspB ( BBa_K1659200 ) is an enzyme produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a species of bacteria found in the human oral cavity that grows almost exclusively in the form of biofilms. Structural analysis of Dispersin B showed that the enzyme only works specifically against the β-1,6-glycosidic linkages found in poly-N-acetylglucosamine, which is a polysaccharide structural element found in the biofilms of E. coli but not in P. aeruginosa. An additional enzyme would need to be used to target the polysaccharide component of P. aeruginosa biofilms.
Micrococcal DNase ( BBa_K1659300 ) is an endo-exonuclease that non-specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of single- and double-stranded DNA under basic conditions and in the presence of Ca2+ ions, and is known to be able to speed up DNA hydrolysis by up to 1016 times [ 17 ]. We are using DNase to break down the extracellular DNA component of biofilms.
Killing the Bacteria
Although antibiotic resistance is not absolute, it does pose a very big threat to the effective treatment of many infections. The insensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics can also be attributed to increasing antibiotic resistance. As described above, antibiotics also have many side effects that reduce patient quality of life and decrease the likelihood of completing a course of antibiotics. With all of this in mind, our solution does not only break down the biofilm, but also kills the bacteria embedded within so as to provide an alternative to antibiotics.
Art-175
Art-175 ( BBa_K1659000 ) derive their name from “artificial endolysins”. Endolysins are bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases that pass through the cytoplasmic membrane, degrading the peptidoglycan layer and inducing the lysis of the infected cell.
MccS
MccS ( BBa_K1659100 ) is a type of microcin, a subclass of antibacterial proteins known as bacteriocins. Microcins are small, enterobacteria-produced bacteriocins that exert antibacterial activity against closely-related species, and MccS is produced by E. coli present in the probiotic drug Symbioflor 2 that has been"

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#Construct1_-_-_TEXT.html," the system:
Modelling assumptions
In order to analyse a number of properties of the system, the model needs to be tractable. For this, a number of assumptions and approximations have been made:
UVR8-TetRDBD and LovTAP are conserved. This translates to a model not explicitly accounting for photoreceptor expression/degradation, as this will be the case for most systems in steady state anyway. Biological optimisation will instead focus on choosing the optimal ratio of promoter strength kP to degradation rate kdeg of the photoreceptors that effectively equal the steady state concentration of UVR8-TetRDBD.
All photoconversion processes are modelled as 2-state processes.
Degradation rates are identical for all proteins. While this obviously does not resemble biological reality, setting a degradation rate for every protein species individually is practically impossible, as such rate parameters are not ubiquitous in literature.
The negative feedback has not been modelled explicitly here, as it has been accounted for in the previous simpler UVR8-TetRDBD model. As no oscillations are possible, the negative feedback loop merely reduces the dynamic range of the switching.
Basal expression as fraction of complete induction is the same for all promoters (= 15% in our case).
ODEs
With the previous assumptions, the coupled system boils down to:
Find the parameters we used on our parameter page .
Results
Notice the vertical dashed bars at 4 h, these indicate a switch of conditions from beginning in darkness to a physical situation highlighted by the black light sources in each row. The horizontal dotted lines indicate the response threshold, where values above such threshold indicate a positive (1) response and values below indicate a negative (0) response. Note that only the values in steady-state have a meaning - dynamics of the system might temporarily lift some pigment concentrations above the threshold that will drop below it in steady state again (as is the case for the red pigment in situation [no UV, no Blue] and [UV, Blue]). The separation between conditions is comparatively small - this is due to the intrinsic basal expression that we have modelled.
Biological implications
The system has been tuned manually to maximise the dynamic range between conditions. This has resulted in promoter expression parameters that constrain the model:
This in effect requires the same promoter strengths to be employed in-vivo. While most promoters have a rough notion of expression strength attached to them, this will eventually boil down to a trial-and-error inspection of the correct promoter. From a informatics-heuristical point of view, we suggest working in a binary-logarithmic ""divide-and"

It is so easy to fall irrevocably in love with Science when one is around Khadija. She loves Biology for all its intricate details and the complexity that is so beautifully disguised. As a final year student of B.Tech Biotechnology, she strives for perfection in everything she does and believes that there is no substitute to dedication and hardwork. When she is not swamped with HP and Modelling work, she is at the iGEM lab lending her expertise to the wetlab team. In her downtime, she reads books, travels to new places, bakes the occasional cake and spends quality time with her dad. Ten years down the line, she hopes to be a successful teacher-researcher or maybe even manage her very own Science journal. However, some things will hopefully never change. She will probably still fancy herself some coffee ice-cream, read Jeffrey Archer's Kane and Abel for the 300th time, and still be befuddled by the beautiful mess that is Science.
Contributions: She works on wet lab and contributes extensively in the design and execution of modelling objectives.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Reproducibility_-_-_TEXT.html,", we were still not able to make the four monomers, consisting of 12 fragments, which we aimed for. This could be due to the streptavidin beads, which are essential when performing ICA. We found out that the beads had passed their expiration date. Unfortunately, we first saw this mistake too late.
These examples show the importance of scientific reproduction. This is also what research ethics is about: presentation of results and methods. There is bound to be mistakes in the ongoing research and scientific reproduction helps determine these and tries to correct them. As stated above, a falsification does not entail that the competing hypothesis is verified - it just is not falsified.

BLUE LINC, Biodesign Incubator at UC San Diego
We were also fortunate to meet and discuss some of the technical issues with some graduate students and faculty at the medical school by talking with BLUE LINC, an on-campus resource modeled after the Stanford Biodesign process. Several members of the cohort were able to provide their expertise with the process of medical device design and innovation. They were impressed with the thoroughness of our approach, but encouraged us to think more about the regulatory obstacles that could hamper our ability to bring this product to market. Because laboratory testing of a potential clinical test is of vital importance, we would have to comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA). Before we can test human samples for diagnostic testing, we must demonstrate the rigor of our approach and get a waiver from the CDC and FDA. For some members of the cohort, a larger concern that they had picked up on through their clinical immersion was the integration of our clinical test into existing routines . They explained that individuals are less likely to be early adopters, especially for medical devices, if it places too much of a burden.
Takeaway:
BLUE LINC helped really hone in on some of the regulatory work that would be necessary to take this product to market, and it really helped give us a realistic timeline with concrete steps for the actions that we would have to take. In addition, integration of our app and our assay into existing technologies would also be paramount going forward.

Building on our earlier interactions, Dr. Subramani put us in contact with one of his contacts in the TATA Board, Mr. Manoj Kumar, who oversees a $75 million grant to UCSD that is focused on advancing disease detection. He shared his vision for Social Alpha, a social innovation ecosystem centered in India that addresses some of the larger challenges that a developing nation faces. We were given an opportunity to discuss our idea with him, and he affirmed that an HCC liquid biopsy test would be helpful in low-resource communities . Talking with several portfolio managers at Social Alpha helped give insight into the challenges of entering the Indian market, and they also reiterated that it would be important to make sure that this would be available at a reasonable price point. The Indian healthcare system is not as robust as the American one, and there are far fewer localized hospitals; instead, most medical analysis happens at large, centralized government labs.

Part Collection
1.Parts Collection One (Engineered Biofilm Subunit CsgA with SpyCatcher and HisTag)
a) In order to realize covalent link of two proteins, we make use of SpyTag and SpyCatcher system (see our Linkage System on Biofilm Page). The SpyTag is fused to HydA of the hydrogenase system, thus a SpyCatcher on CsgA would enable Spy-tagged Hydrogenase to be covalently attached to CsgA In the meantime, to endow biofilm CsgA protein with additional functionalities (such as specific binding to QDs or Nanorods in our case), we append one or two HisTag  at the N- or/and C-terminus of the CsgA-spycatcher protein.  This lead to two new constructs, HisTag-CsgA-SpyCatcher-HisTag ( BBa_K2132001 ) and HisTag-CsgA-SpyCatcher (the former being sequence confirmed and submitted).
➤ CsgASpyCatcherHisTag (E. coli) - BBa_K2132001
➤ mCherry-SpyTag (E. coli) - BBa_K2132003
b) To determine if  expression of the two proteins is successful, we constructed mCherry-SpyTag to test the activity of the SpyCatcher on the CsgA. mCherry-SpyTag is thus submitted as BBa_K2132003 , sequence confirmed.
2.Parts Collection Two (Hydrogenase gene clusters)
We utilize [FeFe] Hydrogenases originally from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum (coding sequence: hydA, BBa_K2132004 & BBa_K2132005 ) to accept electrons and therefor enable catalytic production of hydrogen in our project. Synthesis of heterologous [FeFe] hydrogenase in E. coli requires co-expression of HydE (coding sequence: hydE, BBa_K2132006 ), HydF (coding sequence: hydF, BBa_K2132007 ), and HydG (coding sequence: hydG, BBa_K2132008 ).

When we added the 1.0mM Cu to bacterium solution，we observed the color change of the visible to the naked eye. So we tried to test the 1.0mM copper ion in LB medium. Then we found its fluorescence value and the value of OD600 with only LB medium samples differred greatly. So we decided to use the 1.0mM copper ion in LB medium as the blank samples of the 1.0mM control. The result shown in figure presents that promoter strength increases with the rising of copper ion concentration below 0.1mM, and then drops down once above 0.1mM.

The three devices used in our project are concerned with plenty of functions, such as repessilator, feedback and feedforward.

After revealing the nature of the experiment, we asked the students why they chose the cookies they did, and overall, they once again surprised us by being incredibly open to GM foods in a time when many people are wary of them. Rather deterring the students, the possibility of the cookies containing GM products was actually more interesting to them.
Some quotes from the students about the labeling experiment:
""I saw the GM cookie and thought, 'Why not!""
""I chose one of each to see if they tasted different""
""I don't really care if it's GM, so I took one of those because they were closer to me""
In a future survey, we would like to isolate the pro non-GM candidates and ask them privately why they decided to pick non-GM. We would also like to conduct studies with an older generation that has not grown up with GM foods.

In order to know all the points of view, we considered interviewing businessmen related to marine resources. Note: In this category, we also considered foundations.
To labor unions and fishermen
An important focus of our work was talking to fishermen's unions, groups that support each other in case of emergencies like this one. Understanding their way of thinking and working was very important for us especially for the design of our artifact, since they are the ones who possibly use it. In the other hand, we have the fishermen. It's curious because one of the things we discovered with the interviews with municipalities was that many of the fishermen were not associated with any labor union. That is why we made a separate interview model for them. Again, they are probably the people that could use our device, and their opinion its important to us. Note: In this case, we do not ask for their opinion on our device since we talked about it to everyone.
Also we have our travel log, document were are available some answers of interest (we are going to discuss that here, don't worry). You can find it here!
Analisis of the interview: an historical reconstruction of context
As we can see, there are many different points of view depending on the job of the person which we interviewed, but all of them agreed that red tide was a serious problem. First of all, big economic losses were generated in the area, both for companies (with the exit of important companies like Walmart) and fishermen: this lost income for several months which leads to not being able to provide money to their families. In case of labor unions, several of the affiliates also suffered due to the phenomenon. Even so they could support each other and move forward. The problem also reverberated in the people, there was a huge problem of disinformation, and fear even to eat fresh seafood (in some cases, until now). To all the above, there was a poor distribution of funds to the directly affected by red tide, insufficient investigation funds in municipalities, and worse, scarce resources to face emergencies like last year. This state of general chaos was reproduced in protests, barricades, among others.
There were also contradictions between the regulatory and national detection bodies, giving different results with each other to which the question arises whether there really was red tide in some areas or not. Finally, and this was a general opinion, all agree that the method of toxin detection currently used in our country is very slow and expensive: being three days implies that the extracted products that cannot be approved until"

From One to Scale
Developing a prototype poses an interesting set of problems, but manufacturing a new device at scale is a completely different challenge. Whereas we design, build and test our prototypes completely in house, our startup aims to achieve economies of scale for manufacturing. This is only possible with a suitable workflow; specifically we want to turn our prototype devices into technical implementations plans that can be sent to a number of different supplies and manufacturers. In turn, these partners assemble sub-components for us with maximal efficiency reducing our manufacturing works to assembly and testing of the final product.
Manufacturing Costs
Suppliers
During our prototype development, we identified the best suppliers for production scale-up, described in the following table.
Regulations and Safety Requirements
To manufacture electrical equipment in the UK, we must meet the Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1994 which covers all equipment designed for the workplace and domestic electrical equipment.

So, we will be doing the following transformations this week:
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
3. pRS304* + GliR reporter (Z0510)
4. GliR (Z0415) + pRS306
7. pRS304* + LexR reporter (Z0418)
8. LexR (Z0412) + pRS306
11. pRS304* + YY1R reporter (Z0511)
12. YY1R (Z0416) + pRS306

21. GliR (Z0415) into [ZifA & ZifA Report]
This will require 8 trp- ura- plates (not including an additional 2 plates for controls), as well as 9 triple dropout plates. This will also probably require growing two separate batches of W303 yeast cells for the transformations.  Since in the past we have managed to get enough cells for four transformations, we will likely need to double the recipe.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#SinceAmsterdam_-_-_TEXT.html," 4 gives an overview of the constructs employed for the degradation of BPA.
Figure 4: Schematic depiction of all constructs used for BPA degradation: BBa_K525511 , <partinfo>K525515</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525551</partinfo>, BBa_K525580 and <partinfo>K525560</partinfo>. Constructs are divided into those without FNR (left) and with FNR (right).
All constructs were cultivated under the same conditions as described under Cultivations . BPA concentrations were measured using HPLC . Figure 5 shows the percentage of BPA degraded in 24 h of cultivation and the specific BPA degradation rate calculated with the regular model and in the case of <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> with the model for the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB .
Figure 5: Results of the BPA degradation experiments with BBa_K525511 , <partinfo>K525515</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525551</partinfo>, BBa_K525580 and <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> and the corresponding specific BPA degradation rates calculated with the model. The construct consisting only of BisdA shows almost no degradation activity, which was expected since BisdA alone can't facilitate the degradation of BPA. In comparsion the fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB degraded BPA considerbly more efficent than the polycistronic construct, indicating that the fusing of the two proteins improved its activity. Regarding the constructs containing FNR the completely polycistronic construct lags distinctively behind the other two constructs. Again, the fusing of the BisdA and BisdB proteins improved the BPA degradation activity. Using the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB we measured the highest specific BPA degradation rate of all constructs. Although it has to be taken into account that a different model had to be used for this particular construct.
We are especially impressed that the fusion protein of FNR, BisdA and BisdB (<partinfo>K525560</partinfo>) not only was capable to degrade BPA but also was the fastest construct we employed. This also contributes to the feasibility of our approach for a cell free BPA biosensor since in a cell free environment fusion proteins are beneficial when compared to their non-fused counter parts.

The last year’s edition had the participation of 250 cities in 32 European countries with the aim of bringing science and researchers to the general public, proving that science and research can be fun and that it also related to everyday life, and promoting science communication among young people.
The commitment of researchers is key for the success of the activity, which records an increasing number of scientists and scientists participating in the event each year. Specifically, the activity brought together more than 1,200 researchers to show their work to the public in the 2016 edition.
We set up our stand next to the cathedral in the center of Seville, which is a really beautiful place. Much more people than what we actually expected stopped to get to know our project. It was a great surprise and we felt very thankful.
Our stand attracted the attention of really different kinds of people. Apart from students, we were glad to explain our project to tourists, teachers and professors from different fields, parents, children and curious walkers.
Although we belong to the Universidad Pablo de Olavide, this time we could have our own space due to the magnitude and recognition of our project. Our university conducted a workshop on legumes entitled ""Legumes, much more than a food"" located in Plaza Nueva, next to the City Hall in Seville.
We took advantage of the occasion by distributing brochures with information about iGEM, about synthetic biology and about our project in an attempt to bring it closer to people who have no idea about this field.
For us, the influence of people and their interest in new scientific projects is a huge breakthrough. We were able to see how good science is appreciated, and therefore we were proud to be a part of it. Thanks to this event we have been encouraged to continue our idea with more enthusiasm."

Negative Control (DH5a single transformants containing LovTAP construct without BBa_K2330002 reporter construct)
EXPECTED RESULTS
To reduce unwanted interference from tryptophan in the growth medium and lacl promotor 'leak' the assessment medium was swapped for M9, and LovTAP was ligated into a low-medium low copy number plasmid to control LovTAP over expression. The induction and activation of the LovTAP system (exposure to blue light and addition of IPTG) should have a similar effect as addition of tryptophan on the readout of the reporter system. Whereas little to no activity is expected in samples not exposed to blue light or lacking IPTG.
Figure 3. OD600 of DH5a transformants grown in supplemented M9 media measured over a 16 hour period.
Figure 4. Fluorescence assay of DH5a transformants grown in supplemented M9 media measured over a 16 hour period. Fluorescence measured at 610 nm (mCherry).
From these results we can see optimised LovTAP is active and has a definite effect on RFP expression when induced with IPTG and activated with blue light. We can also see a basal level of expression for other test conditions which appears slightly elevated for the sample with LovTAP induced but not activated. Indicating there is a basal level of activity for LovTAP when expressed. The sample where LovTAP was induced and also trptophan was added expected higher levels of expressed RFP were expected. This could indicate the colony had lost the LovTAP plasmid when resuspended in M9 media as no antibiotic selectors were used to prevent antibiotic preventing cell growth.

pSB1AT3
The following diagram shows the concentration of the pSB1AT3 midi-prep sample as well as the DNA to Protein ratios; at 67.9 ng/ul the DNA concentration is at a suitable level for further processing. When analysed through DNA gel electrophoresis (see 'Results' section below) it can be seen that the band produced by the pSB1AT3 plasmid lies between the 2027bp and 2322bp fragments of the HindIII ladder.
The plasmid size is 3,446bp but seen as the plasmid is uncut the gel again doesn't reveal its true length. Like said before, we will need to linearise the fragment with appropriate enzymes to prove it's length.
Second attempt at pMUTIN4 midi-preps
In a lab session on the 24th July 2009, we took the decision to prepare some E.coli cells containing the pMUTIN4 plasmid by taking 2 flasks of inoculated 100ml LB (inoculated with these E. coli cells and grown overnight in the previous lab session), splitting them into four 50ml falcon tubes and then spinning them down. The supernatants were then decanted and the pellets stored in the -20C freezer. Today, the Metal Sensing team will use these cells to attempt a second midi-prep.
Two of the four tubes were taken and each was treated using the Sigma-Aldrich Midi-prep kit and protocol . There were no changes to the protocol but there are two important notes to make:
This midi-prep attempt started at step 2 (titled 'Resuspend Cells) in the protocol
The Spin method was the preferred route (as opposed to the Vacuum method).
Once two midi-prep samples of pMUTIN4 were successfully prepared from the 2 cultures of E. coli, they were taken to the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The following readings were produced:
These two midi-prep samples of pMUTIN4 contain a higher concentration of DNA than the first attempt. These concentrations are sufficient for further processing. These two samples were also run on the gel and can be found in lanes 14 and 16 in the first well of rows (see gel photograph in 'Results' section below). Whilst the two samples are found near the 4,361bp band of the HindIII DNA ladder, it has to be remembered that they are uncut so they don't reflect their true length (which is roughly bp) -"

Fig 1: The germination rates of B. subtilis germination mutants. All germination rates are relative to wild type 168 (W168), our positive control. W168 showed near 100% germination rates. The mutant spo0A::tet is unable to form spores, and should therefore show no germination (our negative control). Our results were consistent with this expectation. Mutants used were:
W168: wild-type 168
spo0A::tet: a sporulation-deficient strain
B29: cwlD::kan, sleB::mls
B30: gerD::cm, sleB::mls
B32: cwlJ::spec, cwlD::kan
B40: cwlD::kan, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec
B41: cwlD::kan, sleB::mls, gerD::cm
B42: cwlD::kan, cwlJ::spec, gerD::cm
B43: gerD::cm, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec
B46: cwlD::kan, cwlJ::spec, gerD::cm, sleB::mls
B47: gerD::cm, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec, cwlD::kan
The remaining germination ability in strain B30 in Fig. 1 seems inconsistent with the retained germination ability in strain B42, because B42 contains mutations to only one of the genes knocked out in B30. For example, we would have expected that B41 or B43, which contain both gerD::cm and sleB::mls should retain some germination ability instead. We could find no evidence of a labeling mix-up that could have caused the inconsistency. But the germination of B42 spores occurred in only one of the many germination assays performed on this strain. Hence we cannot rule out an experimental artifact.
The next figure showing the LB-agar plates from the germination assays (see below) demonstrates the inability of our mutant spores to germinate.
In Fig. 2 below, plates from our germination assay illustrate the process of checking for colonies. This colony growth information was used to calculate the number of germinable spores in each culture.

Figure 3. Structure based sequence similarity of various metal responsive regulators of MerR family. CadR: cadmium, CueR: copper, ZntR: zinc, MerR: mercury, PbrR:lead. Those amino acids showed in bold are metal binding sites according to solved crystal structures [5] or mutagenesis analysis [8]. The metal binding site of CadR or PbrR can be speculated based on the high similarity of MerR family and the geometry of ligand field of metal ions.
METAL BINDING PEPTIDE (MBP) CONSTRUCTION
To achieve the goal of making a high performance MBP, we constructed a single polypeptide consisting of two dimerization helixes and metal binding loops of MerR, to form an antiparallel coiled coil MBP mimicking the dimerized metal binding domains of the wild-type as described in Fig 2. We amplified the N-terminal and C-terminal of MBP directly from full length MerR by PCR, and then cloned them into the backbone together in one step (Fig. 4).
A
B
Figure 3. MBP Construction procedure. A: Standard part. B. Expression detection part.
To be specific, the entire coding region of the MBP for standard part was amplified by PCR from full length MerR with two pairs of primers. Two of these primers encoded a three-residue bridge, SSG, which does not occur in MerR and was added to afford some flexibility in the loop connecting the two dimerization helix (fig. 1). The two PCR products were digested with EcoR I / BamH I, or BamH I / Pst I and cloned into EcoR I / Pst I -digested pSB1K3 in one step (fig. 3A), which was verified by DNA sequencing.
Based on the same strategy, MBP-His6 was constructed by using two different pairs of primers, which is used for MBP expression test by western blot. The two PCR products were digested with Nde I / BamH I, or BamH I / Xho I and cloned into Nde I / Xho I -digested pET 21a, which contains a region encoding six histines, in one step to construct pET 21a – MBP (fig. 3B), which was verified by DNA sequencing.

Fig. 12
The map shows n1-n2 plane, in which each point represents an initial condition. The color stands for the ratio of $n_3$ at $t=24h$. The redder, the higher. The dark ribbon marks the line of 95%~96%. With this map, every time experimenters need to do a conjugation experiment, they can conveniently know how many E. Coli & C.C. they,  should add into the system by looking at the map and doing simply calculation.
Qualitatively speaking, the map illustrates that experimenters should put way more C.C. into the system than E. Coli (>2:1) initially, as the map is diagonally unsymmetrical. Besides, the initial concentrations should be relatively high if one expects to complete this part of the experiment in a short time. Practically, the point at the turning point of the black ribbon represents an ideal initial condition, for it has high potential of n3 yield, but requires relatively low initial concentration.
Conclusion
Founded by reasonable and practical assumptions, upheld by concrete experimental data, this model simulated the concentration change in the process of conjugation, taking birth, death, competition and conjugation all into consideration. In this light, we deepened our understanding of conjugation from a new quantitative perspective and went boldly beyond to make practical predictions.
This modeling work is chiefly done by Fangming Xie, assisted by Hongda Jiang and Zui Tao.
The experimental data is offered by Juntao Yu.

Another way to verify the succesful transfection and protein expression is given by the two tags (A3C5 and Strep-tag II) that are included in the receptor design, which allow detection via Western Blot analysis.
After transfecting mammalian cells with the receptor constructs and selecting them for 2 weeks on hygromycin, we lysed the cells and checked for the presence of Strep- and A3C5-tag via western blot using primary antibodies (or a Fab for A3C5) against the respective tags und secondary alkaline phosphatase coupled antibodies (see methods). As the figure shows, the Strep-tag wasn't detectable via WB - however, the A3C5-tag-WB shows significant singular bands at the size of our proteins in the respective samples. This data corresponds with the flow cytometry results again showing that the BAP receptor is also present in the non-fluorescent cells.

Quantification of mRNA expression levels by RT-q-PCR
The characterization of our transfected mammalian cells showed that the two receptors containing an avidin variant were expressed and translocated to the outer cell membrane. The biotin-presenting receptor containing the biotin-acceptor peptide, though, showed a very low fluorescence signal. Therefore, the success of the stable integration was tested by PCR of the genomic integration, which lead to the conclusion that the construct was transfected and integrated sucessfully, hinting at a problem downstream of the integration. In order to understand where the source of this problem was, we took a closer look at the expression levels of the different receptors by analyzing mRNA levels in comparison to each other and to the housekeeping gene (HKG) GAPDH.
For a better comparibility, we used the same amount of cells for each receptor and not only reviewed cells with stably integrated but also cells with the episomal stable receptor constucts. After extraction of the total mRNA from the cells the quality and integrity was measured by Bioanalyzer. All samples showed a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 9 which means that the total mRNA is pure and does not have any contamination. During the first step"

He informed us inhibiting GzmB completely would have extremely negative effects.  This had a big effect on our project.  We needed to figure out a way to only partially inhibit GzmB so that it would maintain normal levels of GzmB.  We modeled GzmB concentration vs ACT inhibitor levels and developed a calculator to estimate how much of our inhibitor protein to bring elevated GzmB levels down to normal.( link )
Medical
Dr. Stephanie Hsieh, Medical doctor, formerly from Kaoshiung Medical University Hospital
We interviewed Dr. Hsieh about the different type of inflammation that exist and about her experiences with patients who have had chronic inflammation.  Through her we learned that chronic inflammation was a major problem especially for elderly patients.  We asked her about the application of our bandage prototype and our cream prototype.  She said that she thought both prototype ideas were plausible but would require lots of clinical trials.
Policy
After receiving experimental and application advice from experts, we wanted to investigate the policy roadblocks we would encounter trying to get our project to the actual market.  We emailed every member of the The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (Committee on Science, Technology and Law – Forum on Synthetic Biology) with a list of 5 questions specifically related to policy issues:
What more should the government be doing to encourage the development of synthetic biology and biopharmaceuticals?
What are the main obstacles to getting biopharmaceutical treatments to market, and what, if any policy changes should be made to the regulatory environment to get these treatments to market?
What, if anything, should the government do to increase the accessibility of biopharmaceutical treatments to the public?
To what extent is a supply gap impending for biopharmaceutical treatments?  And what, if any steps should governmental, academic and corporate actors take to insure that supply meets demand?
Given recent public concerns regarding issues of consuming GMO's, what if any steps should corporations, universities, and governments take to make syn bio treatments more attractive to the public?
We received several responses from the following members:
Dr. Stephen Hilgartner – Professor of Science and Technology studies at Cornell University
Dr. Alan Pearson – Head of NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Aboriginal Chronic Disease Knowledge Translation and Exchange (CREATE) of the University of Adelaide

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Details_-_-_TEXT.html,". So when the ribokey isn’t transcribed, the ribolock mRNA will form a hairpin structure, so that the ribosomes cannot access double stranded mRNA, and there will be no translation of the CeaB gene.
Hence, to activate the cell death mechanism, E.D. Frosti needs to undergo a cold-shock treatment. E.D. Frosti will ‘sense’ the change in temperature and the ribokey will be transcribed. This ribokey will bind to the ribolock, followed by the opening of the double-stranded mRNA hairpin loop. Under these conditions, ribosomes can bind and translate the CeaB gene. CeaB is a DNase, which can be found in the Colicin E2 operon ( BBa_K131009 ). CeaB cuts all DNA in E.D. Frosti in small pieces, which results in cell death. We chose to only insert the CeaB gene instead of the whole Colicin E2 operon, since this also contains the CelB gene and the CeiB gene. CelB will induce cell lysis and under these conditions, E.D. Frosti would undergo complete degradation and this is something we want to avoid. We want E.D. Frosti to die, but it needs to retain its form, so that the proteins that are expressed on its cell membrane can retain their activity, even when the DNAse is active. The CeiB gene is an immunity gene, that results in DNase inhibition for the organism that is transcribing the CeiB gene.
So in summary, our cell death mechanism functions via an AND-gate system, in which both a stimulus and a cold-shock are needed to relieve the transcriptional and translational block, resulting in the death of E.D. Frosti.  If you want to know more about bacteriocins or colicins such as CeaB , please click on this link .

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," specific covalent binding reaction, which we wanted to incorporate it into our target protein. Therefore, we created a library of aaRS with random mutagenized amino acid binding sites and a selection system to select for the aaRS that speciffally incorporates the ncAA. Next to the selection based approach, we modeled the aaRS which could incorporate our new amino acid CBT-asparagine. We showed that both ways are suitable for the evolution of aaRS.
Although incorporation of ncAAs through the amber codon works, there are a lot of problems with this approach. The repurposing of codons leads to the decrease of the growth of E. coli and it is only possible to incorporate two ncAAs. We decided to use a new way to incorporate ncAAs, the incorporation of an unnatural base pair into the DNA that encodes for 64 new codons. Our first challenge was the uptake of the unnatural base from the media, because E.coli has no nucleoside triphosphate transporter and is not able to synthetize the bases itself. We cloned a nucleoside triphosphate transporter that enables the uptake of both bases from the media.  Furthermore, by transcriptome sequencing of the plant Croton tiglium that produces isoG (also called crotonoside) as a defense mechanism, we found a suitable enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoG in E. coli. To detect the unnatural base we developed two orthogonal systems. A restriction experiment based on the software tool M.A.X. and an adaption of the Oxford Nanopore sequencing, which make up one software suite .
To demonstrate the possibilities offered by the incorporation of ncAAs, we developed a toolbox containing five different tools. We chose seven different ncAAs for these five tools and demonstrated interesting applications for them. These ncAAs can be used for various approaches in basic research, medicine and manufacturing. Furthermore, with our submitted parts , every iGEM team can incorporate these ncAAs into their target proteins."

場所：VBL3階会議室
前半は古林さんに来ていただき、これからの方針について話し合いました。
8月に入り次第本格的な実験にうつるためには、7月中旬のテスト休みの前に今年のiGEM-Chibaのテーマを決定しておく必要があります。
そこでこれからの予定としては、先日決めたチームごとに企画を完成させていき、7月10日までに紙面化して提出＆発表します。
また勉強会では、2年生が全員揃う曜日が少ないこと、時間がないことを考慮し、Web勉強会をすることになりました。
Web勉強会は自律して行わないとできないものです。各自本気で取り組んでください。
ブレインストーミングでは福冨さんの案を中心に行いました。
ほかのチームも福冨さんに負けず、自分たちの案を発表していきましょう。

Dow Corning (finally!) responded to Nelly about the preparation of adhesives.
Basically, the actual adhesives are dissolved in heptane. This is the reason why handling it without precaution might cause irritation. The adhesive in its pure form is safe to use.
Easy enough, we just have to let the heptane evaporate so we can use the adhesives. The evaporation rate will depend on the temperature of the environment. In some patent documents she found online, companies dried the same type of adhesive in 100o C oven for 2-3 minutes.
Note, we must do any adhesive assays under the fume hood.

Meeting with Dr. Jenne (August 17, 2016)
Mouse orders done on Wed the 24th potentially
Might take some time to do training, he’s concerned about the timeline since he technically can’t order mice until he got ethics done
He thinks that the biggest thing for us is mass spectrometry
Problems we might encounter:
Peptide not being found in the blood
If it's found in the blood, what if it’s absorbed by other cells or organs
The most important thing is what we get out of it, what the results tell us, and our future solutions for it. It’s okay if it fails.
We have to change the dimensions of our patch to make it narrower and longer.

Modelling meeting with Dan
In our modelling story, this experiment would be in the beginning of the story. This would be use which peptide we are going to use. Once our peptide has gone into the bloodstream, this model would help us determine how fast our peptides would diffuse through the cells to do its functions.
Different forms of our peptide
How it would go through our membrane
Looking at the energy levels
Applying force to membrane through a bilayer
Very hydrophobic = low energy in the middle

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," aspect of our project the most, Jussi Jäntti and his research group from VTT likely contributed the most to the detection part. They gave us valuable input on our thoughts of harnessing the yeast stress response, and for example commented on our transporter constructs and gave ideas on tags to facilitate the verification of its expression. They also gave us input on our results and gave ideas on possibilities to take things further, e.g. giving the idea about using flow cytometry to verify stress promoter functionality. Without them we probably wouldn’t have thought to use flow cytometry, which ended up providing important support and verification for our other results!
Even though our team had students from fields ranging from biotechnology to mathematics, there wasn’t anyone who really understood both fields well enough to have a clear idea of what modelling is like in the field synthetic biology. That’s why meeting Merja Oja, who works with modeling biological systems, was very important in the beginning of our project. After that we were able to also think about the modelling part of our project and how it could support the experimental parts of our work. We ended up creating two different models: molecular and mathematical model about our detection. Integrating modeling as part of our project provided also interesting new challenges for our mathematicians.
Meeting with SYKE
The most valuable information from our meeting with Finnish Environment Institute was that we learned what kind of solutions already exist for the blue green algae problem. It came up that all the present methods dealt with the problem causing algal blooms, eutrophication. There was thus a real need for solution like our that could be effective in a smaller scale. This convinced us that we were on right track with the degradation.
We also discussed current detection methods and according to them, all the available detection methods are rather expensive and hardly any of them is available for the public. They guided us to plan our detection device so that it would correspond to the current need - being available for the public and not be too expensive. If the use of GMOs was legal, our yeast based detection system would provide an easy and affordable solution.
It was also nice to hear that there was no available method for the present day to get rid of the cyanobacteria or the toxins. All the present methods dealt with the problem by nipping it in the bud, i.e. fighting eutrophication but, none tried to get rid of the toxins once they have been produced. They gave us a an advise that one measurement should cost less than 25 euros in order for it to be an improvement to existing methods. We used these aspects when choosing the best"

Augmented reality app
We have created an augmented reality app to allow people to interact with our poster - to be presented at Latin America Jamboree (Chile). In that way they can, using our application, access our videos, charts, graphs, and our wiki page. We think the poster presentations events can be more interesting with this kind of resource and we never saw the use of such technology in academic poster before.
The application was created as a skin of the Aurasma system, in a partnership, and can be downloaded for Android in this website: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurasma.skinned.ctit&hl=en
The video below is a demonstration of this app, note that some images of the poster trigger the content (video, image and a 3D model) in the tablet:
Metalab
The Meta-Lab aims to be an open space for collaboration, creation, experimentation and development of objects and devices to support teaching and research, through low-tech tools, free knowledge and rapid prototyping machines. Our first goal was to create a site to group DIY projects related to science that could be used by universities and schools in Brazil.

we can be be able to know the exact amount of this substance in the sample. The bacteria that is being developed as a diagnostic tool by the UFMG team (CardBio project), will be able to report, according to the fluorescence intensity, the amount of certain substances (biomarkers) in serum of the patient, allowing a more accurate assessment of their health conditions.
