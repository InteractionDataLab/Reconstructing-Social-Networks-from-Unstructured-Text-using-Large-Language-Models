How to stop a war
before it starts?
Come closer and discover
The Colon Yeast
The hemiCherry in the (FAECAL) Cake
So, how to stop a war before it started?
Colorectal cancer includes tumors affecting a segment of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. It is treatable and, in most cases, curable when detected early, before it hasn't spread to other organs.
However, the diagnosis requires a biopsy, made ​​by handset introduced via rectum. Noticeably, this procedure is highly invasive and often inhibits patients to submit to this practice, hampering the discovery of cancer at an early stage and thereby reducing the chances of effective treatment and cure. On our institution, a modified probiotic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated from local beverage.
Our objective is to introduce this strain as a new probiotic chassis on iGEM, and also to develop a gene circuit that allows it to detect one or more stool biomarkers for colorectal cancer on the intestine and report with a color change on the feces. We chose L-DNA (long DNA molecules) as biomarker, and designed a chimeric protein using TALE DNA-Binding Domains and a split version of mCherry.
This protein can detect certain repetitive sequences on DNA and emit red fluorescence, which when measured serve as proxy for the DNA size. Since RFP emission falls on the visible spectrum, it can also be used for staining the feces, allowing for a patient consuming the probiotic to become aware of the possibility of the developing problem just by checking on the color of their stool.
We are from Brazil!

KU_Leuven,2017,Team:KU Leuven#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,", we were contacted by a PhD student, completing his degree in philosophy. He found about iGEM through our Facebook account and has contacted via Facebook. He was extremely interested in our iGEM journey and asked to follow us for a couple of days, documenting our work; something that we felt extremely honored about!
At the end of the day, we could safely say that it was indeed an excellent choice to use social media as a tool for reaching out and public engagement. The accounts racked up over 1500 followers, people who were interested to know what were up to, and it was in return a pleasure to share our hard work with all those interested in reading about it.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Techniques_-_-_TEXT.html," are steps that take a lot of time and therefore have a big influence on the time behavior of your system. Another class of important processes are processes in which new compounds are formed. However, not every reaction step in such a process should be described as a separate reaction, since this will result in too many equations to conveniently handle.  For example if you have A turns to B, and B turns to C, and C turns to D (\(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D\)), this can be summarized as \(A \rightarrow D\) immediately.  The reaction rate of this summarized reaction can be estimated to be the lowest rate in the process (the rate-limiting step).
Once you have decided which processes are important enough to include in your model, you should write down reaction equations for the processes. An generic example of a  reaction equation looks like this:   $$ A + B \ \xrightarrow{k} \ C \tag{1} $$  This reaction equation tells us that compound A and B react at a reaction rate k to form compound C. Writing down such equations from the information you found during research is the most important step of modeling. This is where you write down what you think is an accurate description of how the system works in real life.
After establishing a system of reaction equations, the next step is to convert this system to a system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). ODEs are a broad class of differential equations, which have in common that they contain a function of one dependent unknown variable and its derivatives. In the case of the deterministic modeling of biological systems, this means that for every compound (the dependent variable), you write down how its concentration changes in time (the time derivative of the dependent variable). To make this more clear, we will write down the system of ODEs describing reaction (1) step-by-step.
We will first consider the concentration of the compound A ([A]) as the dependent variable. A reacts with B to form C; this means A will be removed from the system due to this reaction. To have this reaction occurring, at least one A and one B is needed. The rate at which this reaction occurs is proportional to both the concentration of A and B, and of course the reaction rate k. The reaction rate is a parameter which defines how fast or slow a reaction happens. Written down as an ODE, you have this:  $$  \frac{d}{dt} [A] = \ -k[A][B] $$  For compound B, exactly the same happens, so the differential equation is similar"

3.1 Strain Construction
Design: We constructed a fusion protein by linking dxCas9 cDNA to Tn5 cDNA with a linker coding for glycine helical peptide.
Results and interpretation: The sequences encoding the dxCas9 (3.7) and Tn5 were obtained via Addgene with plasmid numbers #60240 from Picelli et al. (2014) and #108383 from Liu et al (2018) respectively. First, we introduced a linker coding for glycine helical peptide to Tn5 cDNA and cloned it to pACYCDuet. We screened colonies with the correct insert by colony PCR, followed by visualization of amplified insert on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel (figure 9). Plasmid was isolated from colony 8 and sequence verified.
Figure 9. Colony PCR of Linker-Tn5 in pACYCDuet-1 (1508 bp). The ladder represents the size of DNA in bps.
Next, we introduce dxCas9 into pACYCDuet-1_Lin-Tn5. We screened colonies with the correct insert by colony PCR, followed by visualization of amplified insert on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel (figure 10, 11, 12). After plasmid isolation from positive colony 2, we sequence verified plasmid pACYCDuet-1_dxCas9-Lin-Tn5 (figure 10).
Figure 10. Colony PCR of dxCas9-Tn5 in pACYCDuet-1_dxCas9-Lin-Tn5, expected size 5924 bp. The ladder represents the size of DNA in bps.

Severely compromised colonies: In this case, the approach is the same as the one for AFB and it lies in destroying both the colony and the hive and in disinfecting and sterilizing the beekeeper’s instruments.
Not compromised colonies but with clinical signs: In this case, the “swarming technique” is carried out to overcome the disease. It consists of:
Removing the infected combs from the hive.
Replacing the queen bee.
Adding adult bees from external healthy colonies.
Feeding bees with an appropriate nutrition.
Further practices suggested by the veterinarian in charge.
The apiary will be seized for at least 9 days and until the positive outcome of the treatment, in order to assess the efficacy of the “swarming technique”. Anyway, also, in this case, the beekeeper can ask the destruction of all the affected colonies to the veterinarian authority.
In both the cases AFB and EFB, the use of antibiotics is not allowed in Italy because of its ineffectiveness and to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
FAI emphasized a very important point that seems not only to apply in Italy but throughout the whole world: there are no different solutions to AFB and EFB diseases these days and the legislative tools are often perceived as repressive, so many beekeepers don’t notify the infection in their apiary, destroying the infected colonies and concealing the fact. This is one of the most relevant problems for the health and statistical assessment studies.
After Mr. Della Morte learned about our project and the scopes of synthetic biology regarding beekeeping, he considered our proposal as a possibility of prevention method against the diseases. Our product would help beekeepers do not have to lose all their beehives and save money.
After the video call, Mr. Raffaele Cirone and his staff reflected on our project information and kindly sent us their final insights:
The Italian Federation of Beekeepers believes that AMPABEE Project is a new and innovative approach to such incurable diseases as AFB and EFB. Preventing the spread of these bacteria and increasing the immune system of bee larvae is an important goal to achieve in the health bee risk prevent. In particular, nowadays the only preventing tools are the Beekeeping Best Practices (BBP) which depends on the personal application beekeepers carry out. In this respect, FAI considers essential to test this research on the pure Italian Apis mellifera ligustica, as it is the most widespread in the world. In this regard, FAI will collaborate and provide the necessary support, remaining at iGEM team Tec-Ch"

Contexte
Le cancer du poumon non à petite cellules, ou NSCLC, est un cancer ayant une zone de développement à la lumière de l’organe. Cette localisation tumorale est essentiellement du aux facteurs déclenchant la tumorogénèse (exemple : Tabac). Une voie d’accès logique pour l’administration du traitement, serait la voie aérosol, par nébulisation de la bactérie. Mais, cette voie n’est pas celle que nous avons choisie pour notre traitement. Le traitement DVS appliqué au cancer du poumon est administré en intraveineuse.
Objectif
Nous avons décidé de vérifier et de quantifier la présence de Mycobactérium avium, le vecteur tissulaire, au sein du poumon, lors d’une administration en intraveineuse. Pour cela, nous avons réalisé une étude in vivo dans plusieurs modèles murins.

As a webpage it’s much more accessible - anyone (even on a phone) could use it without having to install any custom programs which would take both time to install and might require a license.
As far as we’re aware, we’re the first iGEM team to ever put up something like this. The closest was Pretoria UP 2016, but our graphs also contained our entire mass action kinetics model, instead of just a visualization.
It was built in JavaScript and therefore not limited by proprietary license agreements, and doesn’t require Java applets to be enabled (which modern browsers no longer support due to stability and security issues). [2]
JavaScript follows ECMA’s open standard so it can run on purely open-source tools. This helps acheive “iGEM’s goal of making everything in the competition open source”. [3] There are also a lot more open source libraries available for JavaScript which means other teams can build upon our work easier. These include Chart.js, the library we are using to draw the graphs.
Finally, our JavaScript code ran faster than our MATLAB code, which we attribute to both our greater experience in JavaScript and the aggressive optimisation that’s been done by vendors trying to compete for the fastest browsers. [4]
Initial mass action kinetics model
We created our first model following a meeting with Thomas Ouldridge at Imperial, who recently coauthored a paper about mathematically modeling toehold-mediated strand displacement. In the meeting we agreed that we’d need to model the different states of the toehold switch. We also discussed modeling the miRNA binding and unbinding to and from the toehold base-by-base. We later decided against this, as whilst it may have been useful for learning about the kinetics of toehold switches it would not have given us useful information to put into our design process and would have overcomplicated our model.
We first modelled a simple system of 4 substances with reversible reactions as follows:
Where CTS, PBTS and OTS represent the toehold switch in closed, partially bound and open states respectively. At this point we didn’t know the value of the rate constants so we used placeholders.
This was useful as it gave us experience programming in MATLAB, which we hadn’t done before, as well as forced us to learn the foundations for the maths we’d need later; mainly ODEs. Khan Academy was very helpful with this.
With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to"

In part A of figure seven the liquid chromatography chromatogram and the associated molecular mass for pure erythromycin as a standard is shown highlighted in red at a retention time of 3.65 min and a mass of ~734.3 g mol-1.
Part B of figure seven shows the corresponding LCMS spectra of purified erythromycin esterase B incubated for 0 min and 5 min with erythromycin. After 0 min of incubation the red highlighted peak with a retention time of 3.68 min and a mass of ~734.3 g mol-1 shows the initial presence of the substrate. However even merely mixing the substrate and enzyme was sufficient to degrade a small amount of substrate which is shown by the emerging peaks at 4.19 and 4.30 min retention time. The chromatogram of the sample taken after five minutes of incubation no longer shows the characteristic substrate peak at 3.68 min indicating that the whole amount of substrate was successfully degraded by the purified enzyme.
Part C of figure seven shows the corresponding LCMS spectra of the in vivo degradation experiment with transgenic moss expressing erythromycin esterase B in the cytoplasm. After 24 h of incubation at normal growth conditions the chromatogram of the sample containing the wild type moss as a negative control exclusively shows the characteristic peak for the substrate highlighted in red. The chromatogram of the sample in which the transgenic moss was utilized in contrast shows the clear degradation of the substrate because only the peaks at retention times of 4.19 and 4.30 min appear representing the degradation product as explained for part B of this figure.
To summarize this experiment demonstrates that our transgenic moss successfully degraded the environmental pollutant erythromycin!

Background
Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. [1] People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 kg/m2, with the range 25–30 kg/m2 defined as overweight. [1]
We need to perceive this: obesity, or excess fat, is not simply an obstacle to many people pursuing beauty. It also stands in the way of health acquiring, sharing connection with various diseases, like cardiovascular diseases, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, depression, certain types of cancer and so on. [2][3] What’s worse, obesity is now one of the major evitable causes for death globally. [4][5] In general, obesity cut down life expectancy by six to seven years. As for the number of obese people, in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, aged 18 and above, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese. 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese. [1]
Map of Obesity in Adult Males (% of adult population with en:BMI 30+) per country. Using data updated until December 2008.
In fact, given the severe circumstance, in 2013, the American medical association has classified obesity as a disease. [6]
While the prevalence of obesity continued to grow, people weren’t just sitting these years away and did nothing against obesity. To lose weight, some change their lifestyle. People trying to lose weight have to refuse high calorie food and switch to healthier food like fiber-rich vegetables, and try to exercise more. Besides, some people might get help from medications. The legal medications in the market usually work by inhibiting appetite (like Sibutramine), reducing the degradation and absorption of fat (like Orlistat), or regulating the metabolism of fat. [7]
We have seen the traditional methods to lose weight. Many of them are prevalent, and we"

It appears that we observed a response from the cells after the third spike.  However, this could also be due to fluctuations in the sensor.
Control: Untransformed E. coli -- Round 2
We repeated the experiment to try to reproduce the response that we saw in round 1. The experiment was performed on August 22th . We were not able to see a response in either replicate that we did this round.  At the end of the second replicate, the sensor gave a jump in reading, but due to the quick drop off, it is most likely that this is due to fluctuation in the sensor and is not a reliable reading.
Untransformed P. aeruginosa
We also did not see a response for the P. aeruginosa, which we would expect.
The experiment was performed on August 7th .
Nir Transformed E. coli
Finally, we measured both N2O and NO, but did not see an increase in N2O.  The NO sensor did not stabilize over the course of the experiment, and these results are not realistic.  Additionally, the N2O sensor was calibrated correctly, but when the experimental readings were converted to mg nitrogen, the values were negative.  Since this is not realistic, it is likely that the readings are not accurate and that possibly the sensor should be replaced.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to repeat the experiment with a new sensor.
The experiment was done on the 19th of September and the procedure is described in our notebook for September 19th .
Conclusions
Despite multiple replicates over multiple experiments, we were not able to reliably detect nitrous oxide being produced in any strain as a result of the addition of nitrite.

Meeting with the Freiburg Team
Thanks to our local proximity and our connection to our partner University of Freiburg we could establish a fruitful collaboration with the iGEM Freiburg team . In this respect we want to thank them very much for the advices for the overall iGEM procedure as well as the furniture with various plasmids, which we required for our work. We think that both teams enjoyed very much our meeting in Strabourg in October. Not only the discussion of our projects but also conversation on the iGEM competition on its own right brought common ideas up. We agreed, that the link between the teams should be strengthened in some way for that an iGEM community feeling can already develop before the Jamboree and thus the overall power of iGEM can be used  better. Ideas have been to unify various teams to work on one project together, whereby each team is working on a subproject. Whether this would necessarily mean that various project has to be proposed from the organizers was not discussed to the end, since concerns of the loss of the creativity were mentioned. Also the question whether it would be advantage to make such collaborations between teams from one region to allow meetings or whether it would be better to make random groups to increase the intercultural contact was discussed. We are looking forward to see you in Boston.
Leuven
Since we just, closely before the shutdown of the wiki, received an email from the Leuven team giving us some advice of the use of the script we want to use this space here to thank you guys and already congratulate you for your really beautiful wiki.

Untitled Document
     In our first year at iGEM, The Citadel team has worked hard  to establish a synthetic biology research group at our school, to complete an  interesting and challenging project, and to learn everything about biological  engineering!  We are providing the  following report to help visitors gauge what goals we met.
We founded a new iGEM team, composed of three  undergrad students and two professors.
We built a new genetic part, a protein coding  sequence that encodes Peptide Tyrosine Tyrosine (3-36).  We synthesized this part, we've entered the  part into the Registry website, and we are providing the part DNA to iGEM HQ.
We designed a new genetic circuit for the  expression of PYY3-36 and the regulation of expression via AHL-mediated  population control. 
We completed a community outreach event in which  our students and professors engaged local residents and visitors to Charleston,  South Carolina.  We informed the people  about synthetic biology, iGEM, and our team.   We demonstrated a DNA extraction using household products, and we  encouraged science in everyday life.  We  gave away handouts showing the method for perform the experiment at home ( we  also gave away cookies and Jell-O).
We aided the following teams with their own  Human Practice projects:
Edinburgh
Mexico-UNAM-CINVESTAV
We will present a poster and give a talk on our  project at the iGEM Jamboree in November 2010.
We will provide our school's administration with  a detailed summary of the summer's work, with recommendations for future  competitions.
     
     The Citadel team has attempted to meet as many of the  established Judging Criteria as possible during the summer research. The following checklist is designed to aid  Judges in reviewing how well we met the competition's preset goals:
Register the team, have a great summer, and have  fun attending the Jamboree.   -   SUCCESS!
Complete and submit the Project Summary form.   -   SUCCESS!
Create and share a description of the team's project  on an iGEM wiki.   -   SUCCESS!
Present a poster and talk at the iGEM Jamboee.   -   SUCCESS!

""We won a Bronze Medal at the iGEM Giant Jamboree 2014"""
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Product Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Andersson 10 Jul 2018). A statement aligned with the monitoring data on the removal rates of SMX.
Altogether, for these reasons, we believe that SMX occurrence in an aquatic environment is one of the key drivers of pharmaceutical pollution in the Baltic Sea. It poses an implicit and imminent threat to the regional ecosystem as WWTPs are, in their current state, unable to sufficiently remove SMX from the wastewater.
Existing Solutions
To remove pharmaceuticals from the wastewater, advanced (tertiary) treatment procedures need to be implemented in WWTPs. Several ready-to-implement technologies have been developed in the past for treating pharmaceutical residues, but each one of them bears some restrictions that prevent its broad adoption and implementation in WWTPs.
To the extent of our knowledge, there is only one WWTP in the Baltic Sea region employing advanced treatment methods to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater, and it is located in Linköping, Sweden.
The most preeminent methods for treating pharmaceuticals in wastewater are displayed and briefly described in Table 1 and Table 2 .
Note that the emerging solution pCure in Table 2, which was developed by Pharem Biotech, is a solution designed to be implemented in the topmost upstream level, which is the level of the toilet and not in the WWTP [19].
Table 1. Existing and solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals [19].
Table 2. Emerging solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals [20].
Note that one common system including ultrafiltration (or micro-filtration) in conjunction with a biological wastewater treatment (activated sludge) process is called Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), and it does not being displayed separately as it is represented in Table 1 by the ultrafiltration method.
Combinations of the existing solutions can be implemented in WWTPs, either integrated into the primary treatment stages or as an extra stage of treatment. With this tactic WWTPs try to leverage the main advantages from different solutions, achieving sufficient removal rates of pharmaceuticals. As Sofia Andersson, from Henriksdal WWTP, disclosed: “With Ozonation there is a risk of receiving compounds you don’t want, but Linköping WWTP has moving Biofilm Membrane Bioreactor (MB-MBR) carriers implemented after the Ozonation” (Study visit S Andersson 10 Jul 2018). However, as it is logical to assume, this tactic leads to inflation of the treatment cost as well.
Overall, the two most easily accessible and realistic solutions for the removal of pharmaceuticals are Ozonation and Activated"

2) Create an oxytocin quality sensor using a G-protein coupled receptor in yeast:
The second goal of our project was to design and test a diagnostic system for medication quality         that leveraged G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in yeast. We relied on the DIY receptor design instructions created by TU-Delft's 2012 iGEM team to create our own         oxytocin GPCR. TU-Delft's design leveraged work done by Radhika et. al. who engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to contain components of the mammalian (rat) olfactory signaling         pathway to detect dinitrotoluene, an explosive residue. TU-Delft used this design to create Snifferomyces, a yeast strain capable of detecting Niacin, a compound exhaled by individuals         with tuberculosis. Our goal was to use the same GPCR approach to design yeast that could detect         active oxytocin in order to determine if the medication sample was expired or not.
We began by designing our receptor using SnapGene (one of our generous sponsors) and having it         synthesized by IDT (for free as part of their sponsorship of iGEM 2016, thank you!) We then cloned         our OXTR part into the TU-Delft part from the BioBrick distribution kit to create a composite part.         We used 3A assembly to remove the composite part which included a yeast promoter, a RBS, our OXTR part,         a terminator, and the FUS-1 and EGFP parts from TU-Delft.
Our next step was to order several shuttle vectors from AddGene so we could produce more of our part         using E.coli, mini-prep it out, and transform it into yeast where it would express the proteins required for         our oxytocin receptor to form on the cell's surface, and when oxytocin is detected, trigger the FUS-1 mating         pathway and produce measureable green fluorescent protein.
In our work on this aspect of the project we experimented with different reporters, yeast promoters and terminators,         yeast strains, and selection techniques. More details can be found on our Project Design and Proof of Concept pages.
3) Produce a more temperature stable form of oxytocin using E.coli and/or yeast:
The third, and original goal, of our project was to directly address the       short half-life and need for refrigeration of the life-saving drug oxytocin. We have begun work on this       aspect of the project"

In this case, it is advisable to consider taking steps to reduce the background of colonies carrying nonrecombinant plasmids either by treating the linearized plasmid DNA with phosphatase or by adopting another cloning strategy so that the recombinant plasmid can be constructed by directional cloning.

An iGEM Forum and Inspiration
DNAZone, the outreach center of CNAST at Carnegie Mellon, has a running platform in which labs are created and posted online for viewing. A classroom kit lending library is available to Pittsburgh educators to borrow from and work the experiments into their classrooms easier. The CMU iGEM team wants to follow this working model by encouraging other iGEM teams to participate on an international forum. The website for the Beyond the Bench[mark]is currently being worked on, but look out for it in January 2015. The launch of our candidacy form will be on November 16, 2014 on this wiki, so if you want to participate in this initiative, get ready! We encourage all teams to submit a brief gamified version of their projects in order to raise awareness (physical or virtual). From past teams, The ToxiMop Game from iGEM Dundee 2013 and the Registry Simulation from iGEM Grenoble 2013 are prime examples of gamified projects that we were impressed with and would like to see apply for candidacy!
Basic Candidacy Outline
The ideal candidate (tool) for the Beyond the Bench[mark] Initiative would cover at least one core science curriculum topic and then spin-off cleanly into an extra element that engages, educates, and/or excites the student about something they have never heard of or only know a little bit about. Any iGEM project with the proper foundational core curriculum would be an excellent candidate since we are all working on new technological advances! The tool would also have specific age level, though variations for different age groups are encouraged, and pass evaluation on two of the following three characteristics: engagement (interactions physical or virtual), education (core and new element), and excitement (creative challenges, user-friendly optional experimental changes). Teams who want to translate are also welcome to do so! Let's make this initiative international!
Candidacy Examples from CMU iGEM
For its first year, two tools  are up for candidacy from the Carnegie Mellon iGEM team for starting up this initiative.
How can we engage, educate, and excite middle students on the concepts of synthetic biology?

JUDGING FORM ⇗
This year the Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team worked with the Danish Technical University (DTU) overgrad team from the beginning. Both teams were inspired by the idea of mycotecture as funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Program to our faculty advisor, Dr. Rothschild. With our expertise in applying synthetic biology to problems of space exploration and settlement, and DTUs particular expertise in filamentous fungal biotechnology, we worked together towards the goal of using synthetic biology enabled fungal mycelia as an material for space settlement. We shared protocols for growing the material and helped troubleshoot each other’s projects. Both teams agreed to frame the project around a mission to the Martian surface and with with advice from resident NASA experts, both teams worked to add suitable benefits to the material.
Modeling
Both teams possessed some expertise in modeling and decided to put it to use to create models which described different stages of the mycelium production process. Working together, the goal was to have models which could inform future scientists that wish to use mycelium from the stage of a single spore all the way to building the final structure.
The DTU team created two models, one taking us from a single spore and modeling its hyphal growth and the second modeling what properties of mycelium would be necessary in a building Brick to make the final structure. Our team worked on a model which  spanned the intermediate between the two, taking a large colony of fungus and modeling its growth into a mold from which building Bricks could be made. Further details on the two teams’ models can be found below.
Our teams met several times over video chat to compare and contrast our approaches to models. Key takeaways follow:
The DTU model begins from a single spore; SBR’s begins from a “plug” of existing mycelia of given dimensions.
DTU’s model maps 2D, unconstrained growth; SBR’s model maps 3D, constrained growth (within a mold). Note that early iterations of the SBR model mapped 2D, unconstrained growth"

The biosensor is the heart of our project and it took us a lot of time to create. Like it is already explained in the Biobrick Design section, this biobrick is composed of the Pr promoter ( BBa_K2023004 ) which is a constitutive promoter driving the transcription of the XylR gene ( BBa_K2023005 ) coding for the XylR protein. The XylR protein is able to bind aromatic hydrocarbons that carry a methyl group like toluene and xylene. When XylR has bound to toluene for instance, it is able to regulate the Pu promoter has a transcriptional regulator. Then, Pu is activated and it allows the transcription of the bioluminescent reporter gene GLuc (Pu+GLuc: BBa_K2023003 ), coding for the Gaussia luciferase. When this enzyme reacts with its substrate luciferine, a substance called Coelenterazine, it emits luminescence.

USER vs Gibson Assembly USER cloning and Gibson Assembly share many principle: both methods enable simultaneous assembly of multiple DNA parts, uses gel-purified PCR products and customized primers, leave no scares, and importantly, no dependence of restriction enzymes.  Gibson Assembly was envolved by Daniel G. Gibson at the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2009  (Gibson, D.D et. al., 2009. Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases. Nature Methods, vol. 6, no. 5, pp. 343-47 ) Cambridge iGEM 2010 introduced an elaborated description completed with software tools to facilitate the use of Gibson Assembly (https://2010.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/Gibson/Introduction).
Gibson Assembly relies on the creation of a 40 bp overlap between two sequences, ei. A and B,  that are to joined.  The magic lies in the primer design. One primer is designed to extend sequence A downstream, the other to extend sequence B upstream. In this way, the downstream end of new PCR product A has the same 20 base pairs as the beginning of sequence B. Additionally, the upstream end of new PCR product B has the same 20 base pairs as the end of sequence A.
Here after an (isothermal T5) exonuclease chews back at the 5’-end of both dsDNA pieces leaving 3’-overhangs. A (Phusion DNA) polymerase fills in the gaps and (Taq) ligase seals the nicks, and the joined DNA is ready for transformation. Thus, the major differences between USER and Gibson lie in the size and creation of the overhangs and the enzymes involved.

Minnesota,2015,Team:Minnesota#Project#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," pastoris has been shown to excrete proteins at a rate of approximately five times that of S. cerevisiae with higher qualitative value as well. Recombinant human insulin has been produced in P. pastoris, but the harvesting and processing procedures are long, complex, and would be greatly simplified through the application of the BioBrick system. P. pastoris is already utilized by the Chinese for various industrial tasks, lending more promise to it as our choice, as industrial application would require very little change to our system.
• What are some risks associated with this design?
      Our system poses a hopeful future for diabetes sufferers, but, as with any medical breakthrough there are some risks to be aware of.  Although the risk of allergy or rejection will be reduced, there may still be adverse side effects that we cannot foresee despite careful testing in the laboratory, until the synthetically secreted protein is actually trial tested in humans.  Although great caution can be taken to solidify the safety of our synthetic system, unpredictable mutations may still occur that, again, cannot be foreseen until human trials are conducted.  The proposal of human trials alone poses a dilemma for ethical reasons.
PCSK1
• What is PCSK1?
      PCSK1 encodes for preprotein convertase type I, which is regarded as the most important enzyme in the first step of insulin processing in humans. Since our model organism P. pastoris lacks this enzyme it is hypothesized that its addition will increase efficiency of Insulin over the lineage.
Methods
   Insulin and PCSK1 Open Reading Frame Design Sequences for insulin and its chaperone PCSK1 were obtained through NCBI. Both insulin and PCSK1 were codon optimized for expression in P. pastoris using the online Codon Optimization tool from IDT. The BioBrick consensus sequence was added to both insulin and PCSK1 in preparation for cloning into the shipping vector. Restriction sites that were incompatible with the BioBrick standard, as well as our Pichia pastoris expression system pMNBB were eliminated by altering single nucleotides while maintaining the proper amino acid sequence. Both genes were synthesized by IDT. Insulin was obtained as one 333 bp fragment, while the longer PCSK1 was split into three, roughly 750 bp fragments.
   Fragments for insulin and PCSK1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Insulin was cloned into the shipping vector. The three PCSK1 fragments were joined into the the full 2300 bp product using overlap extension PCR. The full PCSK1 product"

We can target a protein into the LS through selectively mutating five of the interior amino acids of the LS to glutamate.  By attaching a positively charged arginine tag to the C-terminus of the protein for targeting you can selectively target the tagged protein into the compartment ( Lethbridge 2009 Modeling ) (Seebeck et al., 2006).  We will then purify the complex and use for application in tailings ponds water.  Once we have demonstrated that we are successfully able to isolate the xylE we will then add more enzymes for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds.

Figure 16 & 17: 1:150 with spectinomycin
Figure 18 & 19: 1:10.000.000 without spectinomycin
Figure 20 & 21: 1:10.000.000 with spectinomycin
Discussion
As control groups we used samples that contained either only the    decoy wild-type strain or the spectinomycin-resistant sfGFP mutant.     While the wild type grew well without addition of spectinomycin    (Figures 1 and 2), no growth could be observed if the antibiotic was    added (Figures 5 and 6). On the other hand, the spectinomycin resistant    sfGFP strain grew well both in its presence or absence (Figures 3, 4, 7    and 8).  In both cases, growth of cells not expressing sfGFP was    observed. This could be due to not fully developed cells that do not    yet express sfGFP in their current cell cycle.
A mixed culture in the ratio 1:1 without the addition of    spectinomycin showed presence of both wild-type and sfGFP cells (Figures 9,    10, 11 and 12) as expected. However, the unexpected higher ratio of    sfGFP strain under conditions that do not give advantage over the    wild-type strain leads us to assume that the mutant generally grows    faster than the wild-type strain. Similarly, adding the antibiotic increases    20 times the fraction of sfGFP cells, in this case by killing the    non-resistant wild-type.
The samples with a 1:150 ratio showed consistent results (Figures    13, 14, 15 and 16) compared to the 1:1 ratios. Without the addition of    spectinomycin the mutant outgrew the wild-type strain (10:1) even    though the initial ratio was not in its favor (1:150).
We went to an extreme of using a ratio of 1 mutant in 10 million wild-type cells.    In this conditions, no growth of mutants was observed. The ratio is too    high to allow the mutant strain to grow even in the presence of    antibiotic that would give it an advantage over the wild-type strain.
Conclusion
Our experiment shows that a specific strain, in this case containing    a sfGFP and a spectinomycin resistance cassette can be selected from a    larger number of decoys. We could not determine the optimal ratio that    would strengthen this"

Restriction Digest of PQ-B-R-OU-B in AC to verify its presence
Purpose: to use RD to verify the presence of the PQ-B-R-OU-B construct in the psB1AC3 plasmid. A restriction digest was set up by cutting plasmids from colony 6 and 7 with XbaI and PstI for 2 hours at 37ºC. The digested products were then run on a 0.7% agarose gel (results not shown). No bands were seen on the gel, except for the DNA ladder, indicating that DNA was lost somewhere along the procedure. We believe that after the past few days, it is necessary to restart the construction of PQ and B-R-OU-B into each other.

We measured our reporter gene’s expression by measuring it’s absorbance. RFP’s excitation wave length is 560nm and it’s emission wavelength is 612nm. The curve was made for 5 hours and measurements were made every half an hour.
Weeks 11 and 12 (August 10th - August 21st)
Our DNA fragments and oligos finally arrived along with the NEB’s Gibson Assembly Mix so we could finally assemble both of our parts, the Trg-EnvZ chimera and Insulin Lispro, both of them are built under a constitutive promoter to test wether or not they are expressed in our strains.
Weeks 13 and 14 (August 24th - September 4th)
We confirmed the assembly of our parts and we transformed them in our strains to obtain a large quantity of plasmid; we also assembled the parts in PSB1C3 backbone to deliver it to iGEM Headquarters while we test their expression by Western Blot (in the case of insulin) and by stimuli response (in the case of the chimera). We assembled our constructs and after transformation and selection of three clones on the plates, minipreps were performed and subsequent digestión with Xbal was done.

Parts
Parts were designed by Alejandro Rodríguez and Lizbeth Bolaños mainly using the Serial Cloner software.
For both parts, the sequence was obtained by back-translating the aminoacid sequences of interest into nucleotides; then restriction sites like EcoRI, NotI, XbaI (among others) were removed maintaining the open reading frame and finally the nucleotide sequences were codon-optimized for E. coli.
Trg-EnvZ chimera
The Chimera Trg-EnvZ is part of a two component system and it constitutes a chimeric protein composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of chemoreceptor Trg and the cytosolic kinase domain of osmosensor EnvZ . Trg is activated by periplasmic binding proteins, and transduces the message to EnvZ to phosphorylate OmpR, a transcription factor which binds to the OmpC promoter driving transcription of whichever gene that is downstream.

With all three reactions being reversible, MATLABs dsolve function was not able to solve our differential equations. We tried them by hand but were not able to solve them analytically. We had to solve numerically and chose the Euler method. This involves iterating with short time intervals (here we used dt ≈ 1s) between each calculation using a loop to keep a record of how the substances changed over time. We then graphed these values as follows:
k1
k-1

We’ve recreated this model so it’s actually running in the browser - try dragging the sliders above the graph to modify the rate constants.
Mass action kinetics model with transcription and translation
The first simple model neglected transcription and translation completely, which meant it was an excessive simplification and consequently was not that useful. To address these shortcomings, we created a second model, derived from parts of Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD, with many more species. [5]
This model was very slow to run (so slow we’re not going to try run it in the browser), as there were many species and thus more calculations needed to be done per loop. However, it primarily was slow as we needed a small dt value to keep the model accurate so there were more loops in total.
We had to use a very small dt value or errors could easily add up with so many species. It ended up taking about a minute to run each simulation which wasn’t acceptable for us, as we wanted to be able to quickly change parameters and ideally test a range of parameters. Speeding up the model would make it more useful to the wetlab team. They then could vary each of our parameters and see how they affected GFP output, for example seeing the effects of different switch designs and experimental setups.
Having lots of species also made it harder to find accurate rate constants for all the steps in the reaction. Tobias Stögbauer’s PhD was very useful for this, although many of his values weren’t that applicable to us as we used a different cell-free system leading to inaccuracies -  which were amplified when dt was increased.
It was also difficult to get useful data from the model as there were so many parameters that changing just one was unlikely to have a significant effect on the final result. This made it harder to draw conclusions from the model. For similar reasons it would also have made it hard to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.

For the interlab study we used several devices to measure optical density (OD) and fluorescence.
Open Source DIY Hardware
Being in the measurement track and having a team of highly motivated engineering and computer science students, we tackled the challenge to build, document and evaluate our open source hardware approach.
For our daily tasks in the lab, two key devices were detected: fluorometer and OD-meter. As we use GFP most of the time, the fluorometer is designed to work best with GFP. For modularity reasons, and re-usability, it is designed such that a change to another fluorescence protein is easy.
Besides the mandatory $\mu$-controller architecture, we worked together with the Fablab Aachen to construct the device. There we have the chance to use laser cutters and 3D printers.
The core component for detecting the light intensity is the cuvette holder. Please find the 3D model we printed below:
This cuvette holder can be used for both devices: the hole in the bottom is used for fluorescence measurement, the two opposite hole are used for the light sensor and the LED for optical density measurement respectively.
Hardware Requirements
The key ingredients for our combined optical density/fluorescence (OD/F) device then are:
Arduino UNO R3 (or equivalent)
breadboard and jumperwires (or: circuit board)
bluetooth modem optional
cuvette holder stl file download
TSL235R-LF light to frequency sensor
LED for optical density (for 600nm we recommend: DIALIGHT - 550-2505F )
LED for fluorescence (any 450nm blue works for iLOV, 480nm for wtGFP )

Shame plays a large part, it seems, in deterring these women from using birth control. As a result, women partake in unprotected sex which results in unwanted pregnancies and STDs. We hope that our discrete birth control method will allow women to practice safe family planning methods without shame.
Kinywankoko United Women Association (KUWA)
Our iGEM team made contact with Kabugho Beatrace through Hank Pellissier of the Brighter Brains Institute. KUWA is a women’s group based in the Kasese Municipality of Uganda. They assist marginalized women in the surrounding villages by providing them condoms, sanitary products, feminine hygiene education, and economic empowerment. They reside in the Bukonzo county which is “rated among the poorest counties where women live below poverty line and one [Ugandan citizen] survives on less than one US dollar a day” (Kabugho Beatrace, chairperson of KUWA). Read More >> According to Beatrace, the population of Kasese increases every day due to high birth rates. At the same time, there is also a high infant mortality rate, as many mothers are too unhealthy to bear a child. The only contraception available in Bukonzo county are condoms sold in remote pharmacies. According to Beatrace, the condoms are placed near registers and customers are often too afraid to be seen purchasing condoms due to stigma. When we spoke with Beatrace, she was very supportive of our new contraceptive. She works closely with other women’s groups in Uganda and contacted them excitedly to discuss our new method and provide us their input on our project’s safety, maintainability, and cost. Our team is extremely grateful for Kabugho Beatrace and the connections she provided us.
Kyogha Women
Our conversation with the Kyogha women was enlightening. Their chairperson, Esther, informed us that her group has been on the search for advanced, safe birth control methods for a while now. Her group recently visited Makerere University in Uganda to see if they can “make an advanced birth control method that is also accessible with less side effects”. Esther was ecstatic to hear of our approach. She’s spent many years implementing family planning programs and trying to address the stigma on birth control. As with other groups, she mentioned that people fear purchasing birth control because they fear ""being laughed at"". We hope that our new birth control method will contribute to the new market of affordable and safe contraceptives."

From the survey data, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship of the established enabling variables in biotech business creation. The following sections will begin with 1) regressions based upon the established paradigms of business creation and biotechnology/iGEM, 2) a full model regression containing variables that had a 10% significance in direct relation to our dependent variable (dependent variable = Founder), 3) t-tests to analyze differences between the Founder population and non-Founder population, 4) a summary of the open answer responses and finally 5) a discussion and summary of the data.

In this case, the team entrepreneurial spirit and team functionality were both highly significant with p = 0.00 and 0.076, respectively. Interestingly, while it makes sense that having an entrepreneurial spirit is positively correlated with founding a business, team functionality has a negative effect with a coefficient of -0.445!

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html," amino acid in its sequence. Although this is a small difference, it could nevertheless potentially prevent the transporter from functioning entirely as intended. If experiments could be continued, the other transporter constructs should be tested. In addition, more experiment replicates would be needed to prove or disprove transporter functionality; as our visual catalase assay is rather imprecise, replicates for it would be needed to confirm results.
Transporter functionality is essential for our sensor concept as without it, the toxin can not be imported into the cell and thus it cannot cause any response in promoters. For this reason, solving the transporter problems would be of prime importance. One possible idea to be considered is the transformation of the stress promoters into VL3 strain as it already has the transporter for microcystin. However, it is difficult to assess and predict the feasibility and potential problems arising with this, as VL3 is not typically used in lab work.
Two of our stress promoter constructs (TSA1 and CCP1) seemed to be functional when their behaviour was tested with hydrogen peroxide. The base level of TSA1 fluorescence was rather high, and relative changes were rather small. Still, it clearly seemed to be upregulated by oxidative stress. For the CCP1 promoter, construct base level was near to zero, absolute values of induced fluorescence were much smaller, but relative values were significantly greater.
Even though there is a good proof of concept that both promoters are induced by oxidative stress using hydrogen peroxide, we don’t have data on their behavior when the oxidative stress is induced by microcystin. Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species, and microcystin raises cellular reactive oxygen species levels, so we estimated that they affect the oxidative stress related genes in the same way. Nevertheless, this assumption would ultimately need to be proven by experimental results. We hoped to be able to test this during our project, but unfortunately we couldn’t get the QDR2 transporter from VL3 integrated into lab strain’s genome so that it would have remained functional. Without the transporter, microcystin induction of our promoters isn’t possible.
If the promoter constructs could be proven to work similarly with microcystin induction as with hydrogen peroxide induction, they would require additional optimization to facilitate the interpretation of the fluorescence. The main focus would be on producing a more easily quantifiable visual signal. The CCP1 promoter would seem to be the best option for optimization, as although its expression level is low, the fluorescent signal could be amplified using e.g. a genetic amplification circuit. However, this would require much optimization to achieve stable and comparable signals. Genomic integration"

ArsR acts as a negative auto-regulator, repressing the expression of downstream mtrB. Because ArsR activity is repressed in the presence of arsenic, MtrB will be upregulated when arsenic is present, increasing the rate of electrode-reduction.
We inserted our arsenic-sensing BioBrick into the pBBRBB cloning vector (Vick et al., 2011) due to its past success in complementation studies [7]. Upon ligation, we transformed competent DH5a E. coli and attempted to transform JG700, our mtrB knockout strain. Because we had no successes electroporating JG700 with our construct, we decided to append a mobility gene and use conjugation to transfer our construct. We first transformed WM3064 with our mobility-enabled arsenic sensing construct. Finally, we conjugated WM3064 with JG700 to create our arsenic-sensing Shewanella strain.

APPLIED DESIGN
WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Applied Design demonstrates the integration of our system to tackle real-world problems. The first possible integration for our system is in wastewater treatment plants. There are two types of wastewater treatment plants: biological and physical. Biological plants use organisms to clean household wastewater, while physical plants use both chemical and physical treatments for industrial wastewater [1]. As part of our Human Practices, we toured our local biological wastewater treatment plant and recognized the processes that occur, in addition to a potential place where we could integrate it. Integrating our system in the biological treatment plant would be useful by aiding the metal removal process; however, due to the low heavy metal concentrations in average wastewater, our system is most suitable for physical/industrial wastewater treatment plants.
Current Methods
To remove the metals from industrial wastewater, there are many current methods, such as chemical precipitation. Chemical precipitation involves the use of chemicals such as lime to convert the metal ions into solid particles. From there, chemical coagulation occurs to destabilize the solid particles to allow for their precipitation by adding a negatively charged flocculant to react with the positively charged particles; this allows for the creation of larger particle groups  [2]. Chemical precipitation is efficient and generally safe. However, there are many flaws. For example, chemical precipitation produces toxic sludge, which requires additional processing to remove, increasing the cost of production. Additionally, the sludge has a low settling rate in addition to being gelatinous, which is difficult to dewater. An alternative option to chemical precipitation is electrocoagulation; however, it is unable to remove significant amounts of heavy metal[3]. Chemical precipitation also requires a very specific pH range; beyond the range, the reagent is likely to re-solubilize into the solution [4].
Comparison of Our System
Our system in comparison is more ideal because it does not produce a toxic sludge, it does not require a specific pH, and its efficiency is much higher. The sludge produced by the precipitation of the metals using our phage and bacteria does not contain chemicals. Theoretically, our phage and bacteria do not require a specific pH, although we will need to perform further tests to prove it. Furthermore, due to our system’s self"

NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," when implementing our system. We then integrated the above results to illustrate the connection between receptivity and perceived safety, if any was present. Figure 1 shows the relationship we obtained from the survey between the responses of receptivity, segmented by the respondent’s degree of perceived safety of a bacterial diagnostic system. The key inferences from the plot would be that, firstly, there is a high level of acceptance amongst people who find it very safe, as denoted by the pink area. This indicates a proportion of the public who may have an understanding of how our diagnostic system functions, thus opening up the market for our products. Secondly, even those apprehensive about the safety aspects of the RIOT System still believe that it may be a viable solution to expensive detection methods, as the probability of finding a participant who indicated a receptivity level of 3 to 5 is relatively high , regardless of what safety level was indicated. This indicates an overall positive opinion on the RIOT System, and thus means that our project may potentially have a market within the Singapore community:
Figure 1:Conditional probabilities plotted from Singapore survey results: Probability of selected level of receptivity given a certain level of safety selected by participants (P(Receptive|Safety)). (‘1’ being not at all receptive/safe and ‘5’ being completely receptive/safe)
International Outreach
With the results from the Singapore survey looking promising, we extended our study with the help of collaborators, the Hong_Kong_HKU and Melbourne iGEM teams, by administering the survey in their respective countries. Hong Kong and Australia are home to many different ethnicities, and yet are culturally contrasting. By extending the range of our survey responses to two distinctly different populations, we aimed to find trends in public perception of the RIOT System and, if they are present, to reach an international market for the system.  The results are as follows:
The trends in the two countries seem to vary from the results of the Singapore survey. The results from Australia indicate that 32.8% of participants are very receptive to the RIOT System despite many of them believing that it is not completely safe - only 6% rated safety with a ‘5’. In the Hong Kong survey, the trend seems to differ - with only 12.5% of surveyees who were very receptive to the system, and 16.7%  believing that is it completely safe.
To explain these results, we can examine the culture and attitudes of the people in each country towards such technologies. In a study conducted by researchers in the region, they discovered that the people of Hong Kong were less"

(Aster, 2012) All of which are major              deal breakers; not many will be convinced to pay outrageous prices for solar panels that will be obsolete in a year only to produce              little DC energy on sunny days. (Aster, 2012) So it is not a viable renewable energy source.
To bring further insult to the wound, developing novel technologies that are fundamentally different from what has been used before              is wicked by principle; by the virtue of them lacking a track record makes them uncertain which intimidates investors and authorities              that would use it making it hard to convince them to fund them. Also, they have an experience curve; when those new technologies aren't              optimal yet, requires a lot of research and time. (Herzog et al., 2001)
Our solution and how it's distinctive
Since our project is based on bioethanol production from biomass, in which fermentation in large volumes is involved, our endeavour is best communicated with a prototype of a bioreactor, where our project kicks in.
We have considered all sorts of renewable energy sources; both biomass and otherwise and we decided on biomass energy since it can be implemented to real life in the best way possible.
A biorefinery is a facility where biomass is processed to be used in various industries. In this case, we are dealing with lignocellulosic material; which primarily comes from plants with rigid structures such as tree barks, brewer’s spent grain, corn stalk, rice husks and so on.
Our prototype was designed and its detailed blueprint was drawn long before it will be implemented. Our zero-waste approach sets an example to the industry.
Inspired from Çumra Integrated Sugar Facility, we held a meeting with engineers from  BTech Innovations in METU Silicon, where we worked together on the blueprint of our facility, to be 3D printed.
Zero Waste Biorefinery Approach
Product Developing
During our visit to one of the biggest biorefineries in Europe, Çumra Integrated Sugar Facility, we have established two way dialogues with the engineers and most importantly with the director. These dialogues were established to align what we have designed on paper to a more doable design. With the engineers, we have diligently discussed our drawings; noting down the points we remained weak and making the calculations to achieve our approach of having no waste output from the refinery. After our visit, we have done further research to construct a prototype, compatible with real-life situations.
The important thing for us was"

According to the Table.1, we could easily found that there is an obvious difference between experimental group and control. Under the anaerobic condition, L-lactate dehydrogenase, coding by LdhA, acts much better ability than under aerobic condition. However, the final pH value of culture fluid is bigger than pKa of lactic acid. We suppose that the bacteria take advantage of lactic acid, due to the lack of carbon source.
○ Conclusion
There are too many kinds of acid, so we didn’t have enough time to verify them. However, we chose LdhA, coding lactate dehydrogenase which converts pyruvate to lactate, as our model gene to test in our whole system. According to the result, we could confirm that our acid production part is working. However, it’s not difficult to find that most of acid production genes are related to oxidative respiratory chain, and others verified them through gene silence. So we prefer to introduce CRISPR/Cas to make this part work better.The summary of acid synthesis library is shown below(Table.2).

Error-Prone PCR
○ Background
Similar with Polymerase chain reaction(PCR), error-prone PCR is also a powerful method to produce linear DNA fragments, but results in random mutagenesis. This mutagenic PCR, which introduces random mutations by reducing the fidelity of the DNA polymerase[25]. This process is similar to standard PCR cloning of a target sequence except that, for constructing a diverse mutagenesis library, a much larger pool of transformants are needed to increase the diversity of the library, making the process tedious and inefficient[26]. As a result, various processes have been developed to streamline the methods.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane p-Aramid_-_-_TEXT.html," product, pABA.
Since pABA is an intermediate in the folic acid pathway, pABA will be consumed in the pathway’s downstream chemical reactions. Dihydropteroate (DHP) synthase catalyzes the reaction that converts pABA to 7,8-dihydropteroate, a precursor to 7,8-dihydrofolate [3]. By knocking out the gene that expresses dihydropteroate synthase, folate production is halted, thus preventing the conversion of pABA to subsequent folate precursors. To carry this out, we planned to use CRISPR-Cas9 for excision of the gene and to transform into E. coli. To verify that the cells were successfully transfected, cells were grown in medium with selection markers, such as chloramphenicol and folate. Afterwards, the growing cells would be replated on medium containing only the selection marker. Colonies that did not survive on the replated medium are successful, because they are folate-dependent since their folate pathway was disrupted by the DHP synthase knockout.
We also wanted to take into account previous work that has been done on pABA production. Previously, the ETH Zurich 2012 team [4] had produced a biobrick containing pabA and pabB from E. coli (BBa_K909014), but did not see large increase in the amount of pABA being produced. However, we also wanted a biobrick with pabC from E. coli in order to investigate whether or not the pabC enzyme was limiting the rate of pABA production. We also introduced used the DAHP synthase and Cas9 gene knockout to affect other parts of the Shikimate pathway besides just the steps involving chorismate to pABA. Further theoretical work was done on optimizing pABA yield, which can be seen on our modelling page.
Previously, the primary motivation for pABA production was for UV protection. However, our focus on pABA was due to its value as a monomer for a biomaterial. Thus, we also considered more issues for post-production processing of pABA in order to allow it to better fulfill its purpose. We drafted a procedure to chemically process pABA, given that a sufficient quantity of pABA had been accumulated. After accumulating pABA, we then planned to polymerize it using trimethyl borate, after which we would use the standard Kevlar spinning procedure with sulfuric acid to produce a fiber.

To fit the general theme of the event— “Distance”, our talk was titled “Synthetic Biology—What's the Distance between Humans and the God?”. We discussed the principles, applications and risks about synthetic biology, and we also introduced our iGEM project. Nearly 200 people attended the event. Although most of them had never heard of synthetic biology before, they showed great interest in our talk, especially our own research. It was a great honor for us to facilitate the effective communication of science to laypersons.

China High School iGEM Conference
On October 4th, 2017, Chinese Biology Engineering Publication Committee Chinese Bioengineering group and International Teenager Competition and Communication Center(ITCCC) hold he first CGEM Chinese conference for high school participators.
The conference aimed at providing a broad communicating platform for high school iGEMer, giving them an opportunity to make prepared presentation before the international competition. Meanwhile, the conference also wants to more excellent high school students can participate in the iGEM competition.
We use Chinese to present our project to make the presentation more understandable. One of the judgers, Mr.Lichun, the professor of Beijing Technology University, gave us some important advice after the presentation: he said we can illustrate the transfer of electron to make the operation of enzymes more clear. Also about the effect of our microbes will have on the ecosystem( he thinks E.coli is not suitable for the environment of pickle making) . So we make the decision of substituting Bacillus Subtilis for E.coli.

He confirmed our assumptions on the cfDNA levels in the blood and outlined several possibilities of detecting it, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of next generation sequencing with us.
In addition, we spoke with Mr. Cao Jun, CEO of Sports Genomics Inc., on the future of genetic enhancement in amateur sports. His department’s main focus lies with helping people choose a sport that fits them based on their genetic information. For them, the border lies with reading the genetic information and recommending a course of action based on this, not enhancing.
During our time in China we furthermore handed out surveys in the streets, buses and subways. This gave some very interesting results as is further described on our Education and Public Outreach Page .
2.2 General Public
Train Debates and the Public Opinion
On the June 26th, we extended the Belgian Biotechnology Day to The Netherlands. We wanted to open up the discussion on synthetic biology with a broad public. In order to find a diverse audience we organized train debates all over The Netherlands. The topic we chose was gene editing, which at the same time provided us with valuable information for our project. We spoke with people with radically different ideas and background. We even happened to talk to a professional soccer player who was, anonymously, quite open in admitting he would use gene doping if it was safe and undetectable.
“If gene doping is safe and undetectable, then everyone would use it. So why not me?”

2.3 Athlete and Sport Institution Interaction
Athletes
Apart from interaction with the general public and the diversity of experts present at the discussion in Stirling , we find it highly important to talk to athletes to see their perspective and take their experience and values into account.
Cameron Brodie
Cameron Brodie is a former professional swimmer, Scottish Record Holder (6x), British Champion (2015) and Commonwealth Games Medalist (2x), who performed at this top level next to his studies at the University of Stirling. He has only had experience with urine tests, the preferable testing method. However, he did say that blood tests would not be a huge problem, since as an athlete being in the competition is worth that.

ChainList is used to describe chains of DNA, RNA or Protein molecules. Small molecules are
also of such structure with only one element on one chain.  Tree structure is used to describe binding state of elements of different chains. Children
nodes bind with each other and form their parent node. Thus, other than chains, a species has
its binding state forest, which composed of many trees mentioned above.

PROTEIN PURIFICATION
One of the major aspects of our system utilizes metal binding proteins, so it was imperative that we purify the protein in order to move forward and complete our Copper Binding Assay. Our team successfully purified the Cut A protein through Nickel Affinity Chromatography (click here ) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (click here ).
Figure 1 - 15% SDS-PAGE of Nickel Affinity batch purification of CutA.In the first lane we used the molecular weight marker RMR002 from GMbiolab. Lanes 2-5 show the elutions that contain our CutA protein. CutA protein runs at around 12kDA; however, in our SDS-PAGE gel it is seen at around 14kDa, this is likely because of the histidine tag. The remaining lanes are as follows: 6- Nickel Regeneration; 7- Cell Lysate Before Binding; 8- Cell Lysate After Binding; 9- Wash Sample; 10- Cell Pellet.
The CutA protein was expressed in BL21 E.coli cells, and those cells were lysed then centrifuged to separate the supernatant and cell pellet. The lysate was then introduced to a Nickel Sepharose affinity column to isolate the CutA protein as it was bound to the Nickel Sepharose by its histidine tag. Then after washing to remove the unwanted proteins and cell debris, the CutA protein was eluted from the Nickel Sepharose.
Figure 2 - 15% SDS-PAGE of Size Exclusion Chromatography elution samples.The first column contains the molecular weight marker RMR002 from GMbiolab, and lanes 2-16 contain our elutions.
To further purify CutA, we ran the partially purified protein solution through a column, that contained beads. The beads have small crevices and this causes proteins of different sizes to pass through during different times.

Outreach
NEGEM
Our first step towards spreading the word on sustainable practices was at the iGEM Team Meetup, NEGEM, that we hosted with BostonU Hardware. At NEGEM, we presented our tips on how to be more sustainable in the lab and held a discussion on measures to  be more environmentally conscious with our lab work.
GreenGEM
We then compiled ways to be more green in the lab, sorting them into four groups: 1) Equipment, 2) Facilities, 3) Contamination, Safety, and Chemical Use, and 4) Collaboration. GreenGEM builds off of TU Dresden 2017’s iGEM Goes Green project, in which the team constructed a guide for green lab practices. GreenGEM aims to create a more user-friendly and easily digestible guide to help scientists get started on sustainable practices. Not only does GreenGEM present ways to be green in the lab, it also refers scientists to other resources to read through if they want more information on environmentally friendly practices. Check out GreenGEM here !
2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge
While tracking our own sustainable actions helped us generally gauge how sustainable our lab habits were, we didn't have an easy way to quantify our impact or compare to others. Fortunately, through our connections with Sustainability@BU, we were aware of the Sustainability@BU app, which allows users to track their sustainable actions and automatically calculates their impact in three critical environmental areas: CO2 emissions, waste production, and water conservation. In collaboration with Sustainability@BU, we developed a list of lab-related actions that were added to the app to help scientists track the impact of environmentally-friendly lab practices. Our sustainable actions include using multi-use consumables such as culture blocks, sharing autoclave cycles, and powering down equipment that is not in use. These actions will remain on the app to help Sustainability@BU shape their Green Labs Initiative!
To that end, we collaborated with Sustainability@BU to design the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge , hosted on the Sustainability@BU App. The challenge lasted 2 weeks and four iGEM teams participated: iGEM Bulgaria, BostonU, BostonU_HW, and LASA iGEM. Participating teams successfully practiced sustainable lab habits to achieve impressive impact!

Nonetheless, we introduced in the iGEM registry the antitoxin parts of the Kis-Kid and Epsilon-zeta in three different BioBricks BBa_K1493601 , BBa_K1493602 and BBa_K1493603 .
Figure 4. Electrophoresis gel to separate Kis in pSB1C3 and Kid in pSB1K3. As expected, circular plasmid DNA runs in the gel different than the 2 log DNA ladder seen in the first lane. The expected sizes of 2.545 bp for Kis in pSB1C3 and 3.308 bp for Kid in pSB3K3 do not correspond wiht the ladder.
Conclusions
This project aimed to build a double interdependent system to prevent the horizontal gene transfer between BananaGuard and other native bacteria in the soil. The designed system is an innovative approach to avoid horizontal gene transfer. The two main advantages over other biosafety existing systems are that the GMO dies if the plasmid is lost and that the system itself regulates when passing it after division. Moreover, cell viability depends mainly on the balance between two T-A systems and no genome integration is needed. As working with toxins is a challenging work because cells die immediately after toxin cloning, several repetitions and setups were required to successfully built BioBricks for Kis and Epsilon, the antitoxins of the system. Interestingly, we could only clone the toxins in low copy number plasmid (pSB3K3) in combination with the antitoxins, but no successful separation was achieved.
Future work
Future steps should focus on cloning the toxins in a low copy number plasmid without the promoter and, later, clone them behind the promoter and antitoxins of the  same T-A pair and with the other, in order to test the whole final system (Figure 1). Moreover, it would be useful to use a less leaky promoter than LacI, like the Rhamnose promoter, especially for the toxins which will decrease cell toxicity. Moreover, as a final step, this system should also be transformed in P. putida and integrated with all the other BananaGuard modules.

Throughout the project we started to learn the fundamental principles of synthetic biology to get to work on our plasmid with which we want to see gluten degradation via the enzyme Kumamax. For this we going to insert in an e. coli the parts (Biobricks) needed to make our future bacteria can degrade gluten. The parts are:
Promoter (BBa_J23119 ) : Constitutive promoter (which works permanently) that is give in the relative fluorescence of these plasmids in the TG1 strain grown in LB medium.
RBS (BBa_K1084103) : Synthetic RBS with uplifting sequence
.
Vector: pSB1C3
Coding Region: KumaMax (BBa_K590087) : It degrades gluten, celiac disease leading cause. Enzyme generated by rational mutation for the active site of it. It was created by the team IGEM Washington 2011.
Reporter: RFP (BBa_J04450) : Red fluorescence protein.

In our experimental setup, deigned to asses the functionality of our transistor-like elements, the output C is used to enhance the production of GFP to enable a quantitative measurement of the activation (with respect to the basal expression).
dCas9 is constitutively produced from a low copy plasmid and its degradation is  proportional to its concentration. The population of unbound dCas9 is also affected by the  binding between dCas9 and a gRNA. Thus we have             \[               \frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = \alpha_\text{dCas9} - (\gamma_\text{mRNA}+\gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}]             \]             \[             \frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9}] = \beta_\text{dCas9}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] - \gamma [\text{dCas9}] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - R_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}]             \]
gRNA is produced by an inducible promoter. gRNAs are degraded proportionally to their concentration. Unbound gRNAs may also bind to a free dCas9 protein. As stated previously, the dCas9-gRNA complex is degraded as a whole (at the same rate as unbound dCas9 degradation), but we can still have dCas9/gRNA dissociation which will increase gRNA population. Therefore             \[               \frac{d}{dt}[\text{gRNA}] = \alpha_\text{gRNA} -(\gamma_{mRNA}+\gamma)[\mathit{gRNA}] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - R_{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}]             \]
dCas9-gRNA complexes are our gene regulatory units: depending on the targeted site of a promoter, these complex can enhance or inhibit gene transcription. To test activation, gRNA sequences were generated to exclusively target activating sites. In this case,  the binding of dCas9-gRNA to the promotor enhances transcription, which is otherwise in a basal expression. The binding of a dCas9-gRNA to a promoter creates an activated transistor which is otherwise in a basal state"

Synthetic Biology is an important scientific discipline, but it is still quite controversial. Most people don’t know what amazing possibilities arise from research in this field. They think synthetic biology is dangerous and only engenders risks. Unfortunately, the many positive applications of Synthetic Biology are often overlooked.
In order to dispose this negative image it is important to share our experiences, discussions and results with others. Not only with other scientists but also with people who have no knowledge of this type of research.
On this page you will find the many different activities we have organized and participated in during the summer in order to achieve some public understanding and improve our collaboration with other teams.

We were able to fully understand and appreciate each other’s projects which also allowed us to predict possible queries and questions that could be raised to our teams at the Giant Jamboree.Since, our team has previous experience competing at the Giant Jamboree, we were also able to give IIT Kanpur an insight about the judging criteria, the poster and the final presentation, which we hope would have been helpful for Team IIT Kanpur.Our interaction with Team Kanpur gave us confidence in our project and prepared us better for the Giant Jamboree.We hope to have a great time with IIT Kanpur at the Giant Jamboree :)
Knowledge and happiness multiply when shared - VIT Vellore
For the year 2018,VIT Vellore has pulled up it’s sleeves and is working on solving a pressing issue that threatens the very existence of humanity,Ocean Acidification.Their project TogglepH, will definitely have a huge impact in the years to come.
Our interaction with VIT Vellore, started with a WhatsApp text followed by a series of emails,chat over the phone, exchange of MATLAB Scripts.VIT Vellore, communicated to us the difficulties they were facing with the mathematical modelling of their genetic circuits.Since, our team members had a lot of experience with modelling genetic circuits we jumped to the occasion and lended our help to our brothers and sisters in Vellore.We helped them in figuring what simulations could be done and sticked with them until they were successful in finishing  the modelling of their genetic circuits.We hope to meet up and have great fun with VIT Vellore at the Giant Jamboree :)
A beacon of light in the dark-IIT Madras
For this year’s iGEM Project, Team IIT Madras is working to help synthetic biologists in generating codon usage with their free online tool CUTE (codon usage table enumerator),they have also built a synthetic promoter library for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1.When the coders in out team got stuck on a particular model we were working on, we realized that we needed the insight of someone with technical background,our first response was “IIT”. They were happy to help to offer their insight in evolving our algorithm and soon we were back on track!We look forward to meeting up with IIT Madras and thanking them in person at the Giant Jamboree!

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html," controversial subjects like biotechnology and nature conservancy. Biotechnology with animals, genetic modification of plants and the cloning of humans are, according to critics, unnatural practices. And thus repulsive. End of discussion. That’s how it goes repeatedly. Ecological farmers attempt to use natural cultivation methods. Artificial fertilizer and pesticides are regarded unnatural. There was a time when homosexuality, contraception and IVF were regarded unnatural, but luckily times have changed. With all kinds of unnatural situations it seems like the world is a better place to live. One who hears the term “naturalness”, should ask questions. […] The power of the naturalness argument is seemingly obvious. Naturalness is so good and unnaturalness so bad, that it seems like no further explanation is required. And often, no further explanation is given. It sounds like a scientific observation, referring to a higher, unchangeable order. Such a discussion strategy is called a naturalistic fallacy. One describes a situation as natural, to conclude without further explanation, that that situation is good. A well-known example is the justification of the existence of social inequality because of the natural process of competition between different groups in society. In short, there is a foul smell around the naturalness argument. In fact, it can only serve as an emotional signal that the people involved think is important. Afterwards, these people really have to explain and give arguments as to why.”
Van ‘t Hoog argues that what is “natural” is a matter of perception. The concept can be used in any context, either for the pro and contra parties in the GM debate. Another theory is suggested by ethicist John O’Neill , who states that naturalness matters to e.g. environmentalists because of its historical context. It can be compared to an object of art, e.g. a painting of a famous artist. Currently one may be able to make exactly the same painting, with the same kind of paint, colors and autograph, but still it wouldn’t be as valuable. That may be exactly why GM can be perceived as “unnatural”.
However, in synthetic biology this discussion can become obsolete, as the “naturalness” level of synthetic systems appears to be decreasing. At first, one may think that this is useful for ethicists in a pragmatic point of view, because there is one less thing to consider. But this appears not to be true: the discussion has only shifted to a more sensitive discourse, a discussion on the value, essence or autonomy of life.
Nevertheless, the level of artificialness or naturalness is difficult to define. Currently, synthetic biology has a metabolic engineering character"
