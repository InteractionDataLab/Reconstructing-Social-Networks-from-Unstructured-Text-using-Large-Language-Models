BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," More importantly, all of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered the function of microorganisms themselves.
So, can we regulate environmental pH in a simpler way and meanwhile maintain the effectiveness?
Is there any possibility to regulate environmental pH by microorganisms themselves?
Based on these questions, we come up with our idea. Here is the bacteria, now it faces this serious problem: how to survive in acidic and alkaline environment, and regulate environment to a suitable pH, to protect the fermentation world?
At that moment, pH Controller appears. When the bacteria get this weapon, it can balance the pH to a suitable level. To achieve these goals, we firstly constructed PC in E.coli, and designed two subsystems in gene circuits. First system is resistance system to ensure survival of bacterium and regulate intracellular pH, while the second system--regulation system, focuses on regulating environmental pH to a suitable range.
Precise artificial pH control raises worldwide concern because fluctuation of pH level can tremendously influence the performance of cell. This year BIT-CHINA designed a micro-machine, pH Controller, which can make bacteria survive in both acidic and alkaline environment, and adjust the extracellular pH to an optimal level.
Our project consists of two components, basic circuits and fine-regulation circuits. Basic circuits contain the resistance system and the regulation system. The resistance system makes bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. The regulation system adjusts the environmental pH by synthesis of acid and alkali. Fine-regulation circuits are proposed for different regulation requirements.
We established three libraries in fine-regulation circuits, one for the pH-responsive promoters generated by error-prone PCR, another for various inversion effectiveness recombinases and the one left is for functional genes producing acid or alkali. All these factors decide the regulation range of pH. Therefore, we can meet different regulation needs.
Our pH Controller allows for lower artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation. The hosts with our pH Controller can not only maintain high fermentation efficiency but also fine regulate the microenvironmental pH.

- To share this year’s HKUST iGEM project to public in Hong Kong.
Description
Throughout this summer, we have encountered many challenges, and also gained experience from lab and human practices. It is our time to share what we know and have done so far to public. We value that our knowledge is not only acquired from laboratory experience and interview with particular focus groups, but also from all public sources. Inno-carnival is a good opportunity to raise awareness  of biological safety issues.

It can also be achieved by transforming the sensors attached to the PTS1 sequence into a $\Delta\,$Pex5 yeast strain. The sensor is expected to show no specific localisation due to the missing import sequence. We calibrated the sensors in living yeast cells and physiological ranges so that we can not only perform relative but also quantitative measurements. We aim to confirm our hypothesis of a more oxidized redox state of roGFP2 in peroxisomes with violacein pathway activity and want to measure differences in pH within yeast strains with peroxisomal membrane anchored pex3-bacteriorhodopsin protein (membrane proteins) .
Once expression and localization of the sensor is proven by microscopy, measurements with a plate reader or a fluorometer are acceptable. This allows a high number of replicates to be measured accurately in reasonable time. Microscopy is performed with a filter based Nikon Eclipse TI fluorescence microscope at 100-fold magnification and plate reader measurements are performed with a Tecan infinite plate reader (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) . For pHLuorin2 emission intensity is measured at 535 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 485 nm. Same settings were used for roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . Evaluation of the reported signals is done by the excitation ratio of the the corresponding excitation wavelength.
Nootkatone
In order to have a proof of concept for our compartmentation strategy we intend to establish the nootkatone pathway inside the peroxisome. Therefore we aim to target the three enzymes for the nootkatone production to compartment. Before starting the actual lab work for the ambitious plan to establish a completely new pathway in the peroxisome, there are several aspects that have to be considered first.
The initial step is to find a reliable source to prove the abundance of our precursor Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) in yeast peroxisomes. So far there is no proof of existence of FPP inside yeast peroxisomes yet. However it is predicted to be present, as it was detected in mammalian and plant peroxisomes Olivier et al. (2000) .

Making T7 Promoter Variants
To produce these T7 promoter variants, we use a two-step PCR process. The first PCR, which we call ""gene-specific"" PCR, is a typical PCR that adds a ribosome-binding site (rbs) in front of either RFP or the lysis operon and adds a terminator downstream.
With this PCR product now serving as the DNA template, we start a second PCR which we call the ""extension"" PCR. It extends the product by adding the T7 promoter, with or without a lac operator downstream. In these illustrations, we have substituted the lysis operon for the RFP gene but the same process is done for RFP.
In the last stage, we run another PCR with a set of primers that will add Gibson overhangs for the Gibson assembly that will add this promoter construct into the desired plasmid.

It is difficult to draw definite conclusions without more thorough experimentation. It should also be noted that whilst each replicate of isolates was added to the plate using a robot for maximum accuracy, there was still a degree of variability. These variances will have increased over time, and the InterLab method of taking samples at specific time points may be more laborious, but will yield a more accurate result of overall culture behaviour.

Outreach
Meet the Expert
We attended the “Meet the Expert” event held by the Glasgow Science Centre on the 5th and 6th of July which gave members of the public the chance to meet members of the scientific community and discuss their research. Somehow they thought we were experts!
The event was well attended and gave us the chance to interact with many members of the public. It was a great opportunity to discuss with them what they thought about our idea. We were also really interested to get their opinions on water treatment and water usage around the world. The team answered any queries they had about GM organisms and the safety of different processes.
We also has a few fun activities that were intended for children, but were enjoyed by adults and iGEMmers alike! The feedback was generally positive, and members of the public were on the whole excited by our idea.  Our poster for the weekend (in .pdf format) is available here.
Explorathon
We went back to the Glasgow Science Centre on the 26th of September but this time however, we were armed with results. The event was called the Explorathon which was to celebrate European Researchers’ Night in Glasgow. Entry to the Science Centre was free and members of the public, from the very young to the ‘young once’ were out in force.
We had an amazing time again talking with members of the public about their thoughts on water usage and GMO. We loved telling the public about our project. This evening was spent less surveying public opinion of water usage, as it’s not the topic people like to discuss at 9 in the evening when there’s beer being passed around, but it gave us a great opportunity to chat with the children about what we were doing, introducing them to the hero of the hour, ‘Wilkins’. A great evening was had by all.

DLUT_China_B,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"The β2-MG nano-antibody modified by the long chain of C18 is larger than that of β2-MG                             nano-antibody. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the effects of ordinary                             β2-MG nano-antibodies and C18 long-chain modified β2-MG                             nano-antibodies on the optical imaging of liquid crystal cells.
2. Result
Under the condition of 500ng/mL of β2-MG, 250ng/mL C18 modified of β2-MG                             nano-antibodies, 250ng/mL and 400ng/mL of β2-MG nano-antibodies were fixed on the                             glass slides, and color and brightness changes of liquid crystal film were compared, as                             shown in Fig. 6.

(a)                                         250ng/mL modified                                         C18 β2-MG nano-antibodies.

From the experimental results, fixed with the same concentration of β2-MG nano                             antibody (both with a concentration of 250ng/mL), the brightness of the liquid crystal cell                             with C18 modified β2-MG nano-antibody is higher than the threshold of normal                             nano-antibody.
3 Comparison of sensitivity between normal β2-MG nano antibody and C18 modified                             β2-MG antibody
From the experimental results, we can find that the C18 modified β2-MG                             nano-antibody has greater disturbance to the liquid crystal molecules, so we can judge that                             the sensitivity of the C18 modified β2-MG nano-antibody is higher.
Conclusion
Through experiments, we finally decided to immobilize 500ng/mL β2-MG on the                             substrate , binding with 400ng/mL β2-MG nano-antibody. In addition, we determined                             that the detection sensitivity of the antibody at β2-MG modified by C18 was                             higher. Therefore, we can detect the concentration of β2-MG in the range of                             100ng/ ml-400ng /mL (a theoretical estimate) by this method, which meets our requirements                             for the early diagnosis of nephropathy patients"

We are passionate about sharing the exciting advances in research in the field of synthetic biology with young minds! On August 12, 2012, we taught a course on Synthetic Biology to local Boston middle-school students through the MIT Educational Studies Program. Our fun course included introducing the central dogma and basic molecular biology background information, teaching about cool circuit parts and simple molecular biology design tools, and interesting new applications of the research. Through our engaging course, we hope to have inspired these young minds to learn more about the field and to join us as members of the synthetic biology community some day!
Splash! Class
On November 17, 2012, we plan on teaching a course about Synthetic Biology to Cambridge and Boston high-school students. We hope to make a difference in the lives of a few future biologists by introducing them to tools, techniques, and exciting applications from the cutting edge of synthetic biology. Since this is for high-school students, we will be able to cover more difficult material. We're looking forward to it!
International Outreach Projects
Internationalization Project of Synthetic Biology
Our team has laid the foundations of the Internationalization Project of Synthetic Biology (IPSB), a collaborative project between MIT and Tel-Aviv University (TAU) that aims to introduce synthetic biology to Palestinian and Israeli high school students. The project seeks to educate these students in basic synthetic biology, bioengineering, and bio-entrepreneurship principles in a combined, collaborative setting. Over the course of three years, the students would work together to develop a technical project to present in the iGEM High School Contest, as well as a business plan to commercialize their proposed project to present in the iGEM Entrepreneurial Contest. The program would allow veteran MIT iGEM students to"

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of testing. Currently the cows are recorded using ear tags, these are either plastic or metal, and attached to the cows ears. There are normally two of them and the numbers on them must be written down once the cow is tested. However this is a very analogue way of recording the information.
The method we propose is to change the ear tags so that they contain a passive RFID tag, as well as a number. This would allow a lot more information to be contained on the tag. In addition, it also changes the system to a digital version whilst still keeping it familiar to the farmers that use it day to day.
By placing an active RFID reader in the testing facility, this could be used to power the passive RFID tags located on the ear tags. The reader can work up to 100m, whereas the tags work up to 10s of centimetres. If this was placed at the crush containing the cows then as they went through they would be registered as being tested. This removes the chance of human error and also speeds up the testing procedure. The number on the tag would still have to be written on the test tube to associate this with the animal tested.
We were reluctant to have much human involvement, but after much deliberation is was decided that writing on the tubes would be the easiest way to link the cow and the tube together. The RFID tag would greatly speed up the cataloguing of testing.
After waiting for our test to be finished, the positive reactors could then be located and the number found. By inputting these numbers into the computer it would be possible to then walk the cows back through the crush and have an automatic signal for when the infected animal passes through. So therefore it would be simple to find it and remove it from the herd.
For an existing farm  passive RFID tags would have to be purchased for the herd and one active RFID reader located at the crush. A free piece of software would then be downloaded onto a laptop to log the cows and locate the infected animals.
The cost for these devices are as follows:
Passive RFID $0.15 each, which are stickers so can be used on existing tags [7]
Active RFID beacon can be purchased for a maximum of $100 [7]
Test Costs
bTB costs the UK economy £1 billion every year[10], and this cost is steadily increasing[8]. Two significant parts of this sum are the costs of testing cattle, and those of compensating farmers.
[8]
A huge part of the costs of bTB is the compensation paid to farmers. When a cow tests positive for bTB, further testing is carried out"

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.

Supervisors
Sebastian Maerkl is the principle instructor of the 2018 EPFL iGEM Team. His main role was to manage the entire project and also give advice in the direction taken by the team. His help was vital to get funding for the project from our two main sponsors: Nikon and SISF. In addition, he is been able to secure EPFL funding over the years for the IGEM team and we hope this will continue in future years. His guidance in wiki design, presentation and overall technical design decisions of the project have been invaluable for the team. Furthermore, Sebastian Maerkl also provided helpful resources and access to his laboratory, Laboratory of Biological Network characterization (LBNC).
Grégoire Michielin, Michael Crone and Ivan Istomin were our advisors and instructors and probably the people from outside the team that know the project and its intricacy the best. Their feedback in our design experiments and direction of the project subparts has been incredibly helpful. We specially thank Grégoire Michielin for helping us in the design of the cell free expression system and protein purification, Michael Crone for helping us with cloning, plasmid design and the CRISPR/cas12a assay and Ivan Istomin for helping us with the biobrick design and organising our human practices.

Milk  is considered as the next-generation materials with fire retardant properties. Proteins in the milk have been studied and proved with fire retardant effect. Casein is the major components and estimated 80% in the cow milk. Federico Carosio, et al. studied the effectiveness of thermal stability and flame retardancy on the polyester and cotton fabrics treated with casein and published the data on the journal of Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research  in 2014. The data showed as below that the casein on the fabrics strongly reduced the burning rate and blocked the fire propagation. Casein is a phosphoprotein, which has up to 7 phosphorylation sites on the serine residues. The high content of phosphorus (0.8%) is believed to give casein fire retardant efficacy.

Wool

Why the high contents of phosphorus in milk and the nitrogen in wool play an important role in fire retardancy? Flame combustion requires three essential elements, heat, oxygen and fuel (fire triangle) and fire needs free radicals to spread. Removing one of them can stop the fire. Phosphorus and nitrogen can both react with free radicals and eliminate them. Fuels burned with materials containing phosphates can rapidly release water and form carbon layer. This charring process can isolate the fuel and protect it from burning. Ammonia burned in the air may react with oxygen to produce water and nitrogen gas, which could be a kind of inert gas to replace or isolate oxygen during combustion process.

Our goal of iGEM project this year is to find a novel fire retardant bio-material in addition to casein and wool. Furthermore, we’d like to make a fire retardant bacterium and produce fire retardant proteins. Finally, the prototype we create could be qualified through flame test and applied to the industry.
In order to find fire retardant protein candidates, we collected protein sequence data from Uniprot database and ranked with highest contents of serine (phosphoserine) and/or arginine (the"

HO+pcyA, P3 vector w/o GFP
Primers were designed to PCR out the heme oxygenase and pcyA coding regions from the UT Austin plasmids. Due to the RE sites in these nonBB plasmids, their ends are given ApaLI and KpnI sites. The same is done for the P3 vector (the primers are such that we can PCR out the backbone, along with the RBS and terminator. The ""P3-GFP"" primers should also work for P1. However, I'm a little concerned, b/c the annotation of the P1 and P3 vectors disagrees with the sequence given for the RBS and terminator subparts.

Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," new genes or even complete genetic circuits into living organisms – and that is a difference that is not without controversy. Many express concerns such as the potential unknown effects of new genes being released into the environment by “hybridisation with wild relatives”11.  As a team, we have deliberated issues of biocontainment both in our lab practice and in our ideas around mösbi. Engineering auxotrophy into our chassis repeatedly came to the fore as one of the key ways in which we could achieve biosecurity with our concept, and we have also considered genetic counters that limit successive generations. For a full analysis of our thoughts, please refer to our wiki page on Biosafety.
The controversy implicit in this is an important idea to consider. Without clear ideas of what makes a new technology controversial, and how originally controversial ideas can become commonplace and common practice, the synthetic biology community is in a weaker place to put forward its products and goals to the general public who will one day potentially be using them.
History has been full of controversial new technologies, and very topical at the moment is the standoff surrounding cultivating and eating genetically modified crops. Although GM soya now makes up more than 94% of soya grown in the US (12), and has been consumed by humans for years with no documented ill effect, there is still a sense of unease in many people about the technology.
This stems from two main feelings. The primary is a general neophobia that prevents us from eating foods that we are not familiar with. This shows itself universally: Westerners will generally go hungry rather than eat chicken heart, fried tarantulas or fish eyes, even though these dishes are clearly safe and apparently delicious to the palates of people who enjoy them. Perhaps this reflects how we see putting something inside our bodies as the ultimate sign of trust in it. The second most important reason is that people are less likely to trust a system that they do not fully understand, until it has been shown to benefit them enough to make them overlook their lack of understanding.
Mösbi will help on both counts. If people were to want to use it in their homes, especially for unimportant, unintrusive tasks such as monitoring phosphate levels in their windowboxes, the idea that genetically modified organisms are novel, and hence one should be wary of them, will gradually become untrue as GM technology becomes first normal, and gradually mundane. This mirrors technologies like electricity. People, due to a general neophobia as well as more reasoned fear of electrocution, were slow to take up what became one of the most useful technologies ever to be invented. Originally electricity was a"

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
History
Anthony van Leeuwenhoek was born in 1632. He was the first son of Philips Antonyszoon ( a Delft basket maker) and Margaretha Bel van den Berch (from a brewery firm).  On 4 November 1632 he was baptized as ‘Thonis Philipszoon’, however, he called himself ‘van Leeuwenhoek’ because his parental house in Delft was on the corner (is “hoek” in Dutch) next to the Leeuwenpoort.
The father of van Leeuwenhoek died in 1638, whereupon his mother remarried. Ten year later also his stepfather died. Van Leeuwenhoek went to school in Warmond, during this time he lived by an uncle in Benthuizen. After his school, van Leeuwenhoek learned for the first time to work with a magnifying glass when he was apprenticed to a Scottisch cloth merchant, William Davidson, in Amsterdam. In this time, the quality of clothing was judged by thread-counting, for which of course magnification is essential.
Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Meij and moved to Delft in 1953 or 1954, where he opened his own drapery business. Together they had five children, unfortunately his wife died in 1666. In 1660 he became the Chamberlain of the Council Chamber of the Sheriffs of Delft, which ensured him of income. Van Leeuwenhoek got therefore the so called “sinecure”, this means that he was an office with salary but he has no fundamental obligations. In 1671 van Leeuwenhoek remarried with Cornelia Swalmius, progeny of"

US_AFRL_CarrollHS,2017,Team:US AFRL CarrollHS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Two digests were preformed using different sets of cut enzymes. Digest 1 was using the SpnI-HF and BmrI, while Digest 2 used the cut enzymes PacI and BmrI. The Digest was then confirmed using a gel, which showed the accurate number of base pairs.
Packaging: The week started with the RXers streaking and growing cultures of certain colonies of the transformants from Friday. The samples of pBAD-CsgA were sent off for sequencing and a plan was drawn up to further troubleshoot and proceed with the project.
Tuesday (08/01/17)
Sense/Respond: The students set up another run of their GFP Project. The students used a Kinetics reading of the Plate Reader. The kinetics were taken over 24 hours, every 20 minutes. The students then worked on the wiki, trying to create a template.
Packaging: The day began with developing a plan for troubleshooting the project throughout the week. Later, the RXers made up a stock of LB agar and LB agar with Kanamycin and miniprepped three milliliters of the liquid cultures from Monday. Restriction digests were performed on each miniprep and a gel was run, and one sample's results seemed hopeful. New restriction digests were performed on the sample, but the outcomes of the sequencing arrived and suggested that success with the new restriction digests would be unlikely. The sequencing results showed a fragment of the TOPO plasmid had cloned in before csgA in each pBAD-CsgA sample. Solutions of magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, and glycerol were made in order to perform a competent cell protocol on the mutant strains of E. coli, which were left in an incubator overnight to grow.
Wednesday (08/02/17)
Today was an exciting day for the students as they got to perform their survey at their high school. The iGEM students volunteered to help the high school on schedule pick up day. As the other students were coming to grab their schedule we would offer for them to fill out a pick survey on computers we had set up. Over 200 students varying in with some teachers filled the survey. This was a  huge success for the students.
Packaging: The RXers chose samples of the pBAD-CsgA containing TOPO plasmid to digest with NcoI in the hopes that the TOPO fragment would separate from the rest. A gel showed the digests to be successful, and a gel extraction was performed. The concentrations of the results from the gel extraction were checked using a Nanodrop."

Manchester,2016,Team:Manchester#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," 7. Schematic representation of the assembly of Plasmid 2.
Figure 8. Schematic representation of the assembly of Plasmid 2 adapted from SnapGene.
This plasmid is crucial in proving that our mechanism works (Figure 8). It consists of the alcA promoters ( BBa_K2092002 and BBa_K2092003 ), which has the AlcR binding site, and chromoproteins to produce a visible colour change. Similar to Plasmid 1 (CP3+alcR, BBa_K2092008 ),  the alcA promoters and the chromoproteins were initially present in two different plasmids. They were first digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, ligated and then transformed into E. coli DH5α. The final plasmid construct has chloramphenicol resistance.
Co-Transformation
Just two weeks before Wiki Freeze and the deadline for vector submission, we attempted to prove that our model works. To do so,  we co-transformed Plasmid 1 ( CP3+alcR ) and Plasmid 2 ( PalcA(var)+amilCP ).  Despite the short time available, we managed to test our model on our FLUOstar Image plate reader, using the parameters provided in the iGEM registry ( BBa_K592009 ) (λmax=588nm) and research paper (λmax=588nm, λmin=450nm) [3].  We compared the dynamics of co-transformed (CT) colonies with one of our new BioBricks, CP3+amilCP , as a positive control (Ctrl) under the influence of different ethanol concentrations (0-5% (v/v) with 1% increment).  The parameters used for ethanol induction were based on a similar study which tested the same alc regulon system in E. coli DH5α and One Shot TOP10 strains[4].
Quantification
Figure 9. 22-hour growth curves of E. coli DH5α containing: (i) co-transformed (CT) (ii) control (Ctrl) plasmids grown in LB broth (negative control).  CT= Co-transformed Plasmid 1 ( CP3+alcR ) + plasmid 2 ( PalcA(var)+amilCP ); Ctrl= CP3+amilCP .  Both CT and Ctrl sample groups were induced with different ethanol concentrations (0-5%) at mid-log phase, OD580 = ± 0.4. The samples were measured every 30 minutes at OD588"
DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#background_-_-_TEXT.html,"gillus nidulans
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans is a model organism and therefore in contrast to most other aspergilla, has a well characterized sexual cycle and a well-developed genetic tools for manipulation (9,12). Furthermore, in A. nidulans the parasexual cycle has been extensively utilized. Parasexual genetics involves examination of recombination in the absence of sexual reproduction.
The genetic analysis has produced a deep understanding of both the physiology of Aspergilli and the organisation of the genome (13). This research has advanced the study of eukaryotic cellular physiology and contributed to our understanding metabolic regulation, development, DNA repair, morphogenesis, and human genetic diseases (12). Furthermore, the recent sequencing of the complete genome of A. nidulans has created a tremendous potential to obtain insight into important aspects of fungal biology such as transcriptional regulation, secondary metabolite production and pathogenicity (14).
Gene targeting
Gene targeting facilitates precise genome manipulations, called site directed alterations. They are performed by deletions, replacements and insertions at a target locus. Gene targeting is achieved by transforming fungi with a suitable linear DNA fragment that contains sequences that are identical to the target site in the genome, see figure below. Fungi can integrate linear DNA fragments in its genome by repair of double stranded breaks (15).
Two mechanisms for repair of double stranded breaks ensure that a linear piece of DNA is integrated into the fungal genome; homologous recombination (HR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ), also called illegitimate recombination (15). HR involves interactions between homologous sequences, whereas NHEJ involves ligation of the ends independently of DNA homology (16). Precise genome manipulation can often be tedious and time-consuming, because fungi appear to favour NHEJ over HR resulting in low gene targeting efficiencies (15).

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," blue-light exposure (465nm). Pblind will only allow RNAP to transcribe genes downstream upon blue-light (465) exposure, as this will induce a conformational change in EL222, a natural photosensitive DNA-binding protein, required for RNAP recruitment and transcriptional activation. To enable blue-light dependent transcriptional control, EL222 should be constitutively expressed by the cells. Since light can be controlled easily in space, time and degree, this new basic part will enable tight spatiotemporal control of gene expression, which in turn enables the tight regulation of cell adhesion required for intricate structure formation.
Placing Intimin'-SpyTag/SpyCatcher under the control of Pblind along with the constitutive expression of EL222, will allow the transcriptional control of the cell surface display of SpyTag/SpyCatcher through blue-light (465nm). As shown in figure 4, Pblind consists of a fusion of the EL222 DNA binding region and the LuxI promoter (see figure 2). The lux box, a 20bp inverted repeat (LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL complex binding region) from the luxI promoter, was replaced with the 18bp DNA binding region of EL222. In the dark, EL222 is inactive as its N-terminal LOV domain represses its DNA-binding C-terminal HTH domain. Upon blue light exposure (465nm), LOV-HTH interaction is released, allowing it to dimerize and bind its binding region, overlapping the -35 region of the luxI promoter. This ultimately results in the recruitment of RNAP and transcriptional activation [3].

Experimental design
Two cell lines expressing either intimin’-SpyTag or intimin’-SpyCatcher under the control of PBlind would have been grown overnight in darkness or under blue light (465nm) and either been mixed together, mixed with WT cells (control) (15min) or not mixed in the presence or absence of the EL222 construct. Cell mixtures would have then be passed through a particle sizer with a range of aperture sizes (0.4µm - 40µm) to compare aggregate sizes.
As secondary experiments and for visual purposes we would have also incubated cells expressing Intimin-SpyTag with purified GFP-SpyCatcher, Intimin’-SpyCatcher with purified"

Our samples were analyzed by flow cytometry with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and CELLQuestTM acquisition and analysis software with gates set to forward and side scatters characteristic of the bacteria (Gate G2=R2). Measurements were done at following hours: 0h;0,5h;1,5h;3h;4,5h;6h;8h.  The construct used for our test was a ligation of the blue light promotor in front of GFP using three different vectors (pSB3K3, pBR322 and pSB1A2).  (An example of a sample name is: 37/16/NB/LigA, grown at 37°, put in 16°, not lit and in vector pSB1A2. ) It's important to know that the regulation of this promotor is very sensitive and that all factors need to be calculated into the experimental setup. For instance, since temperature has an equally high effect on the promotor as blue light has, cultures grown at 37°C will have a different GFP signal compared to cells grown at 25°C.

Stability Analysis
Comparison of the parallel and antiparallel coiled coil interaction was performed with consideration to both the Lennard Jones and Coulomb potential energies as calculated using GROMACS software. The Lennard-Jones potential is a mathematical model that approximates the intermolecular forces between two molecules 6 and Coulomb potential describes the interaction between point charges. Statistical analysis was carried out on the energy output for each file and can be found summarized in Table 2 below.
Table 2. Energy comparison of parallel and antiparallel coiled coils. Values are understood to be comparable energy units and a more negative energy is indicative of a more stable interaction.

These values suggest that when compared with the Lennard-Jones potential, the antiparallel orientation is more stable while the Coulomb potential suggests the parallel is slightly more stable. This discrepancy creates uncertainty in the theoretical knowledge of preferred orientation for these engineered coils. For the basis of this project, it is presumed that the NMR structure as determined by Lindhout et al. is the preferred orientation and thus the coils should interact in a parallel orientation.
PYROSETTA DOCKING & LINKER TESTING
AFP & Scaffold Docking
In order to test the self-assembly of the AFPs and scaffold proteins with E/K coils, docking simulations were run. These were used to assess the energetic stability of the coiled coil interaction and determine the orientation of the ice-binding surface of the AFP. This was done using PyRosetta by following the standard procedure for initial low resolution docking prior to high resolution docking on favourable protein structures. Sorting of low energy dockings was used with consideration given to the proximity of the E/K coils to choose a final selection of proteins for refinement and scoring. The general procedure used is outlined in Figure 8 and the final docked structure reached shown in Figure 9.

We have multiple diseases for which we can screen; both viral diseases, like Zika and chikungunya (CHIKV), as well as African Sleeping Sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT). How do we integrate these different aspects? How can we visualize our ideas best? How should our device look like? Is this even the best approach? We talked to several experts and integrated their expertise into our project.
Integration of our prototypes
From the very beginning of our project, we have been working on the prototypes of our diagnostic device . We received feedback from several experts and have adapted our device accordingly.
This includes general comments on our device having to be robust and applicable to be used in the field with minimal facilities, but also specific comments. For example, we added an LED-screen to get a quantitative output after our talk with dr. Philippe Büscher . After collaboration with the students from the Quantified Self course and our talk with dr. ir. Arnold van Vliet , we added a GPS signal and data storage unit. Finally, one of our latest prototypes was shown to dr. Erwan Piriou , who confirmed that it was easy and straight-forward to use.
Wondering why we made these adaptations? Read more about this in the timeline on this page!
We wanted to know more about the situation in Africa. Do they need a new diagnostic? Which requirements should this meet?
Prof. Joseph Ndung'u
Programme Head at FINDdx, expert on HAT
We talked to prof. Ndung'u early on in the project. We found out that there are several bottlenecks that exist in making and implementing new diagnostic tests in Africa. Some cannot be changed by the power we have, like political situations. For us, it is most important to develop our diagnostic test to be used with minimal facilities.

We wanted to get the complete overview of the HAT situation in the field in Africa, make sure that the ideas we had were realistic and that there is a real need for it. Currently, field teams drive hours into the countryside to test possible patients with dipstick tests, which have many downsides . A test should be rapid, cheap and easy to use. Tested people are often skeptical about the results as they do not feel ill, thinking they don't need treatment. The availability of the tests and field teams is highly dependent on the current political situation in the country.

CRISPR all in one
Most CRISPR-technology vectors with both gRNA and Cas9 expression have expression of both genes under control of different promoters. Due to CAS9s immense size there are often problems working with this technology and having two regulatory sequences does not help. This effect is especially detrimental while using complex eukaryotic regulatory sequences like the 1077 bP long promotor pCLN1, used in iGEM 2014 Team Gothenburg.
To minimize the need for regulatory sequences (promoters and terminators) we introduced a new system which has a similar effect as a bacterial operon. The system is capable of regulating one protein-encoding gene and one RNA-sequence in eukaryotes using only one promotor. We call it CGC1 (Cas9 gRNA complex one) and used it in the signal amplification mechanism in our detection system.
To obtain both of the complex components a set of requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the coding sequence for CAS9 should be flanked by the ‘5 cap and the poly A- tail to be transported outside the nuclear envelope and be translated into the protein. Second, the gRNA must be free from polyA tail and 5’ cap to avoid relocation into the cytoplasm and degradation
The solution to the problem uses two simple parts, hammerhead ribozymes and synthetic poly-A tails. The hammerhead ribozymes are functional secondary RNA structures which induce self-cleavage. The use of ribozymes to create gRNA are quite common in the research community but also in iGEM, an example of a team using ribozymes to produce gRNA in vivo are iGEM 2014 Team Gothenburg. The other CGC1 part, the synthetic poly A tail, is used as the new poly-A tail after ribozyme cleavage ensuring the cas9 mRNA translocation and translation.

Mr Holmes
Mr. Holmes Secret Logbook
Please, please do not take this sub-page serious. It's probably everything - but not serious.
In fact, most team members know that this website exists. But it silently documents all the funny aspects of our project.
First, even we as team Aachen 2014 - we're actually the first team of our university - performed experiments that didn't end well.
It's never a good sign if already the blank rather tries to escape than to stay.
Especially with our own-minded experiments we had some rainy days in the lab
but also some bright moments, where we could spread peace, love and happiness :)
How many biologists does a computer scientist need to nail a camera?
Exact. 3.
But not only the biological experiments created a high level of frustration, but also the hardware ...
... or software.
At times we really wanted to kill each other ...
... but we had those cool moment where stuff really worked out ...
... and just some other bright moments.
Now at the day of wiki-freeze we're really tired ...
... but really, overall we had a fun time with our igem and loved to stand together for our project

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," on Leishmaniasis in the country. He is also part of the biosecurity council of Honduras.
Figure 3: National Autonomous University of Honduras
Here, Dr. Carrasco lectured us on both the immunology and the parasitology of Leishmaniasis. He explained the immunocellular response to the pathogen. It was noteworthy that immunity to the infection is mainly cell mediated, but humoral immunity can also play a role. This falls perfectly in line with our decision to use the LJM11 protein in our vaccine, as LJM11 is believed to induce both cell mediated and humoral immunity.
We also learned that the lack of diagnosis and treatment ensure that the life cycle of the parasite is maintained. As the parasite continues to move from sandfly to person and vice versa the untreated population act as a reservoir to ensure the infection will continue to spread rapidly. This is why there is such a high demand for immunisation against the disease. Also, as many are infected at a young age (early childhood), it is important that the vaccine can provide immunity against successive infection by different forms of the parasite leading to more severe infections, eg. mucocutaneous or visceral Leishmaniasis. Thankfully, multiple of these species are carried by the sandfly vector which we are immunising against..
A brief clip from our recording of the meeting with Dr. Carrasco can be found here :
Regulation in Honduras
Now that we understood the condition on a scientific, clinical and epidemiological level in the country, we felt the need to gain an understanding of key regulators of Leishmaniasis control in the country. Firstly, talked with Dr. Carlos Ponce, the former director of Leishmaniasis strategy control in Honduras. He approved of our Limitless lactis vaccine idea and was very impressed by it as there is a real need for such a vaccine. We also spoke with Dr. Concepcion Zuniga, the current director of Leishmaniasis strategy control who offered us further insight into the regulatory aspects of treating this disease. From these conversations we learned a great deal about the positive and negatives of introducing a vaccine such as ours into the country.
Firstly we learned that regulation in Honduras is practically non-existent in comparison to regulation in the developed world. There is no regulatory body for health products in Honduras. They do follow Pan-American regulatory guidelines, but they are far less stringent than the tight, drawn-out regulation that we are used to at home in Ireland. This may be highly beneficial for bringing the Limitless lactis vaccine to market in the country as vaccines could potentially"

    SdiA is a homolog of LuxR that is able to partially activate AHL promoters in E. coli. LuxR and some types of AHL promoters are used in our project. LacI is used in our project, too. Therefore, to eliminate these the influence of these two intrinsic genes on experiments, we need to knock out sdiA and lacI in MG1655, which is used to do test in experiments. However, we do not know how to knock them out. Therefore, we turned to Team NPU-China for help and they succeed to knock them out. MG1655 they provide performed very well during our experiments.
III Tsinghua
    Back in Tsinghua, we formed a tight relationship with our brother team, Team Tsinghua, based on members’ friendship and productive team-team interaction, which results in the two teams’ frequently doing things together.
    First, we think together. At the brainstorming stage, we shared our inspiration and sparks and mutually received thought-provoking advice from the other. We discussed a wide range of problems including the project’s applicability, molecular tools in gene editing, plans of human practice and so on.
    Second, we act together. Several teams outside Tsinghua (BNU-China, SZU-China, XMU-China) have expressed their willingness to pay a visit to our university and teams. We thus held several seminars together with Team Tsinghua under the efficient coordination of Han Jianing from Tsinghua and Wang Chenghao from Tsinghua-A. During the open talk other teams’ creative thought struck us from time to time. Some of them even kindly pointed out our team’s flaw which we later payed heavy attention to (the problem of applicability and its limit in human practice). Here we want to deliver our sincere appreciation to Team Tsinghua and all those team involved. It is your wisdom, openness and passion that makes the seminar successfully achieved what was far beyond our expectation.
    Thirdly, we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire"
SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour14_-_-_TEXT.html," to have worked pretty well, we won the Best Wiki award in Boston!
So, just a quick sum up, you are looking at the price winning world Best Wiki, in the undergrad section of the iGEM competion 2013.
What went down during the European iGEM Jamboree 2013 in Lyon, France
We had an amazing time in Lyon!
We were delighted to meet iGEM's founder Randy Rettberg We were all very exited about what this great event would bring. We embarked on our journey from Odense to Lyon early Thursday morning, only hours after we finally printed our poster.
It seems to be a universal fact that iGEM teams from SDU-Denmark are be too exited about the wiki, outreach, and lab work to even think about the poster and presentation before wiki freeze has passed. Luckily, our experience from outreach projects at elementary and high schools enabled us to prepare a good presentation in short time. Our presentation was scheduled immidiately after lunch, meaning our audience would be stuffed and tired due to excessive amounts of exquisite French cuisine. So naturally, we started our presentation with an exercise that our supervisors used on us when we grew tired and weary. See the exercise and the rest of our presentation here.
We also presented a poster. The basic idea of our Lyon Poster was to remind our reader of our wiki; we framing the poster like our wiki and presented the project through the various components of our logo. At the poster session, we received a great amount of feedback that will help us improve the logic and reader-friendliness that we aim for. More importantly, we got to talk to the many amazing iGEM'ers and even met iGEM founder Randy Rettberg! It was unavoidable that we became enamored by the many exceptionel projects and by the efforts put forth by the other iGEM teams. See ours as well as the multitude of other teams' great posters here.
Going to Boston!
So what did SDU-Denmark achieve at this year's European Jamboree in Lyon?   We were extremely proud to receive a Gold medal for our project and to advance to the World Championship in Boston! Furthermore, the team went into euphoria when the judges presented Most Improved Registry Part and our lacI BioBrick appeared on the big screen.
To sum up: Gold, special award for Most Improved Registry Part, new acquaintances, lots of fun, and advancement to Boston!
Boston, here we come!!

Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.
Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’"

S-Gal negative Control:
DH5alpha cells transformed with T7prom yielded white colonies on the S-Gal plates. However, BL21 cells transformed with K322127 yielded all black colonies. Most likely, our strain of BL21 is unsuited for expression tests using S-Gal (might constitutively express lacZ).
Expression test of K322127
After over night incubation, both plates incubated in red light showed white colonies only. Of the two plates incubated under the lamp, one did not show any colonies. The other one showed black colonies.  --> First evidence that part K322127 works as expected!!! To further quantify and characterise this: Miller assay? Other methods?

Zyklisierung beschränkt sich auf das Core-Motiv: konserviertes Motiv KYPSD
Ligasen erkennen dieses Motiv
Herstellung von Einfach- bzw. Mehrfachmutanten
bei Mehrfachmutanten wurde kein Microviridin gebildet, was vermutlich daran liegt, dass keine Zyklisierung stattfand und das lineare Peptid in E. coli abgebaut wurde
durch die Arbeitsgruppe konnte bereits ein Minimalsystem in E. coli hergestellt werden
als wichtige Gene wurden mdmB-E genannt

Supervisors
In addition to providing a dedicated iGEM laboratory at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering in Basel, the professors helped us with general decisions by asking critical questions and pointing out difficulties. During our weekly meetings, they kept the overview of our project and supported us in choosing a direction for the project. With their knowledge, they drew our attention to future issues that might appear, so that we could prevent them or adapt early to difficult situations.

Emulsification—increase surface area for oil degredation. Lots of current focus in this area.
Also trying to develop fertilizers for bioremediation of oil—contain nitrogen and phosphate, emulsifiers to help the bacteria degrade oil.
Usually quorum dependent secretion of emulsifiers
Keywords: oil bioremediation, oil bioaugmentation,Aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbon chains.
Most bacteria can only degrade a select few, not a variety of compounds. Aromatic rings are carcinogenic.
Metals:
One of the problems with metals is that it’s difficult to clone out the necessary components—lots of things needed to make it work.  Sulfur iron clusters in many of the proteins, many enzymes going into making the actual cluster which is the catalytic core of the enzyme.  Metals usually as terminal electron acceptor—involved in electron transport chain, use lots of cytochromes which are different in all organisms. You’d need to get all the cytochromes too to make the pathway work.
One pathway, reduces selenium, uses a few enzymes, only three to construct the reductase. Pathway completely mapped out.
A lot of secretion, biominerilization occurs outside the cell. Some organisms can do this inside the cell—requires less enzymes, but hard to amass them into large quantities. But could sonicate cells to release the metals.
Quantum Dots: related to semi-conductors. Nanocrystals of different metals, conductive properties based on the molecular arrangement of the crystals.  Used for nano-technology. Grouping electrons to use for “quantum computing”.
E.coli can reduce gold.
Other stuff:
Send in some grants, submitting project proposal sometime this week. We’re going to stay with the decoder but find some application if possible.
Meeting Wednesday night, 20 min, officially have a project. 9:30, RSO.
4/23/10
Summer meetings, bootcamp overview (already covered in previous team meeting)
Metals: May not be as easy of just transplanting the pathway—secrete cytochromes to grab the metal, shuttling system. Check pathways, could be difficult.
Maybe looking at oil—oil had different compositions, increase efficiency to degrade only what’s in the specific spill.  Oil classified by sulfur and viscosity—find something that’s Sulfur sensitive.

We were also invited to give a presentation about our project at the international ESF EuroSYNBIO conference on the 4th of October (17:30), where we expect to do the same.
To be a viable alternative to current healthcare applications, our product should be profitable. For industry, this means it should be patentable. Because we can imagine this giving rise to conflicts with iGEMs Open Access policies, we asked some stakeholders from industry how they regard iGEM and the viability of our project. [Stakeholders]
Synthetic Biology as a whole is an exciting new field of science, yet in our experience, little of it is known to the general public. Therefore, we don’t want to limit our Human Practices approach to our own specific project.
As a highly specific part of our public awareness program, two of our members visited a secondary school to teach about synthetic biology. [Secondary Schools]
In order to reach a greater audience as well, we collaborated with the Dutch iGEM teams from Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Groningen. As a national effort, we are cooperatively organising a synthetic biology ‘lab tour’ and education program at the Dutch ‘Discovery Festival’. Held simultaneously in three different cities, a total of 5500 visitors are expected to visit this festival and our stands on September 28th. [Discovery Festival]

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," permeability and one could think of an opposite effect in case of overexpression, but this has not been shown yet.
INP1
The INP1 knockout was designed after the skype call of Prof Dueber, who recommended us, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton in order to improve the secretion efficiency. INP1 is responsible for the tethering of peroxisome, which would inhibit the secretion of peroxisomes.
POT1
The only protein, which is imported by the Pex7 import machinery in saccharomyces is the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (POT1). A knockout of POT1 would enable utilizing the Pex7 import for proteins of interest, which cannot be tagged at the C-terminus with pts1, without having unintended import of other enzymes.
Genomic integration of our novel Pex5 import receptor
After testing our new Pex5 import systems, which is completely orthogonal to the natural import, the next step would be to replace the endogenous system with our artificial import system. Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance (Figure 4). Afterwards the plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain which was created by our collaboration partner Aachen (double knockout strain Pex5 & Pex7).
Figure 4: Design of integration plasmid for integrating our orthogonal Pex5 import receptor.
Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance
The resulting yeast strain allows full control over the peroxisomal matrix proteome, by replacing the whole protein import machinery, which is the first step for creating our artificial compartment.
Outlook
Besides the genome engineering approaches, which were performed in our project one could think of more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering. A final goal could be a “minimal peroxisome”, which contains only the proteins that are required for the biogenesis of the peroxisome and import of proteins and metabolites. On the one hand peroxisomal pathways could be redirected to cytosol or other organelles and one the other hand endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment by changing the protein localization signal in the yeast genome with help of the Cas9 system. All these strategies would allow tremendous improvements for metabolic engineering applications by creating an artificial compartment, which can be rational designed and customized for specific metabolic pathways.

NTU-Singapore,2018,Team:NTU-Singapore#RNA_-_-_TEXT.html,", namely spacer length and regions of coverage on the target were characterized in mediating A-to-I RNA editing.
•   Spacer length is the region of guide with homology to the target.
•   Regions of target coverage is measured by guide mismatch distance, that is the distance from the 3’-end of the spacer to the base targeting the adenosine to be edited.
In an experiment, the plasmid coding for mRNA target, plasmid coding for the dCas-ADAR and plasmid coding for guide RNA are transfected into HEK293FT cells. After 48 hours of transfection, media with the expressed luciferase is harvested and its luminescence was analysed and compared to that of the sample with non-targeting guide, marked as negative. Difference between the two would tell the A-to-I editing efficiency. 
Figure 1. Experimental design of luciferase assay
 Endogenous mRNA Targeting
With the parameters obtained from the luciferase reporter assay, we further characterized the A-to-I editing activities of the dCas-ADAR2DD constructs on endogenous mRNA. In such an experiment, plasmids coding for dPspCas13b-ADAR2DD and dCas13d-ADAR2DD fusion proteins were transfected into HEK293FT cells, together with different guide RNAs targeting endogenous PPIB and KRAS mRNA transcripts. After 48 hours of transfection, transcriptome of the cells was extracted and the target regions were amplified for Sanger sequencing. Fractions of the adenosine being called as guanosine and therefore being edited can then report for the on-target efficiency of A-to-I editing. Different guides were used to investigate the activities with different spacer lengths and guide mismatch locations.

Results and Discussions
 Luciferase Reporter Assay
In the luciferase experiment, we first evaluated the A-to-I editing activities of different RNA editors at different target positions on the Rluc mRNA. The aforementioned nonsense mutation of G to A was performed and tested at five tryptophan residues, at position 60, 104, 121, 153 and 219 respectively. Figure 3 below shows the luminescence levels after the restoration of Rluc sequence with different editors at different positions.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," violacein this pathway was chosen. Violacein is naturally produced in numerous bacterial strains, most popular in the gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum. It is related to biofilm production and shows typical activities of a secondary metabolite (Seong Yeol Choi et al., 2015).
Figure 8.1 The synthesis of Violacein requires five enzymes encoded by the VioABCDE operon. VioA, a flavin-dependent L-tryptophan oxidase and VioB, a heme protein, work in combination to oxidize and dimerize L-tryptophan to an IPA imine dimer. Hydrogen peroxide is released as a by-product of the VioA reaction. Next step by VioE is the rearrangement of the IPA imine dimer to protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, which can non-enzymatically oxidize to prodeoxyviolacein or, by VioC via deoxyviolaceinic acid, oxidize to pink deoxyviolacein. The flavin-dependent oxygenases VioC and VioD require interaction with the oxidized form of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (uniprot, uniprot) . The two enzymes act sequentially: first, VioD hydroxylates protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, leading to protoviolaceinic acid. Second, VioC creates the oxindole at the 2-position of one indole ring, leading to violet violacein (Balibar CJ et al., 2006) (Janis J. Füller et al., 2016).
Relocating the pathway into the peroxisome enables proximity of the enzymes and substrates. Furthermore the yeast cell is protected from the toxic substance hydrogen peroxide. Yeast peroxisomes have no problem with this as their main function is the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the detoxification of the thereby produced H2O2 (Erdmann R. et al., 2007) . Because VioC and VioD are FAD-dependent, it is additionally an evidence for FAD availability inside of the peroxisome, if the synthesis of Violacein works. Otherwise the two enzymes would not be able to catalyze the reaction.
The genes for VioA, VioB and VioE were amplificated via PCR with Golden Gate compatible overhangs from the biobrick VioABCE (Part: BBa_K274004).

Hannah Worden
Major: Bioengineering
Year: Middler
Hometown: Easton, MA
Why I joined iGEM: I joined iGEM because the industry of synthetic biology is poised where the tech industry was in the early 1990s, and I believe it will have an even greater impact on humanity.
Parts I worked on: I mainly worked on the Human Practices portion of our project- an informational video exploring the ethics, morality, and inevitability of genetic engineering.
Asa Budnick
Major: Biology
Year: Middler
Hometown: West Grove, PA
Why I joined iGEM: I am very drawn to the idea of problem solving through synthetic biology. I believe that as time and technology progress our society will increasingly need to develop technologies that require less resources and less infrastructure and I believe that synthetic biology offers a great deal of hope for solving complex human and natural issues without consuming as many resources as traditional technology. iGEM gives participants a chance to see how one can approach problem solving from a synthetic biology perspective, giving important experience and insight into a field that is rapidly going to become a core part of human technology.
Parts I worked on: I directed and did much of the lab work for the conjugated CRISPR/Cas side of the project. I also worked on lab safety planning and the corresponding documents. Towards the end of the season I helped with team organization as our team captain transitioned to full time employment.
Career/Post-college Plans: I would like to work on a synthetic biology approach to more ecologically sound production of crops, ideally working on a system of genetically modified crops that is superior to harmful mono-cultural agriculture.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," the input relations     based on promoters and the output products based on the functional genes     and RNAs which are included within the parts. Working condition simply     describes any influencing factor or circumstance which is directly related     with the functional properties of parts.
Third part of our standardization template includes parameters of     contingent input and output elements. These parameters are classified     into two groups for simplicity as presented on Table 3. This final part     of the standardization template includes the upmost important information     about the Biobricks that are required for the BioGuide Software to run     its searching algorithm.
Briefly, BioGuide application is designed to catch the input and     output relations of individual parts to examine possible Biobricks pathways     for specific input and output queries. In other words, at pre-experimental     stage, it helps wet lab biologists to design their unique constructs     by revealing possible alternative options for pre-determined purposes,     along with the primary paths. Our ultimate goal is to improve the algorithm     designed for iGEM 2010 and present a new version of the BioGuide in     iGEM 2011, which will provide optimum design of constructs for predetermined     parameters.
Most of the parts are composed of functional and nonfunctional constructs     which are formed by atomic parts. And every part should carry the information     for all of its atomic parts within itself. The “input” heading actually     stands for promoters. Parts with one or more promoters can be found     at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Along with the information on which and how     many promoters a part might have, the activity level of promoters are     also important to distinguish between a constitutively active promoter     or a promoter activated by specific physiological processes or states     etc. This information was crucial for us to dissect in order to run     our algorithm as it directly affects which inputs can activate the devices     or the systems.
Throughout our investigations on the Parts Registry, we found out     that much of the terminology was being used ambiguously. Although this     might not be vital for synthetic biologists, it is still endeavoring     to understand the function of certain regulatory elements which also     becomes a time consuming task for the researcher. Thus, we recommend     that the explanations of certain regulatory elements should be redefined     and fixed especially for synthetic biology for easy communication, sharing     and searching of information.
Common misuses of the terminology can guide us to figure out how     to construct a standard nomenclature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all,"

Operon 2 consists of 3 genes psbE, psbL, and psbJ. psbE encodes for a cytochrome b559 subunit alpha [12]. psbL encodes the protein PsbL involved in the reaction centre and psbJ encodes for a core complex subunit [13]. Operon 3 consists of 2 genes psbT and psbB. psbT encodes for a small chloroplast hydrophobic polypeptide associated with the core complex [14], while psbB encodes for one of the subunits comprised in protein P680 of Photosystem II [15].
Operon 4 consists of 5 genes psbM, psbZ, psbH, psbW, and psbK. psbM and psbH encode for core complex subunit proteins [16] and psbZ, which is a stabilising protein for the Photosystem II/Light Harvesting Complex II [16]. psbW encodes for a transmembrane protein involved in Photosystem II dimer-stabilisation and photo-protection [17]. The final gene psbK encodes for a low molecular weight subunit of Photosystem II involved in stabilising the whole complex [18].
Operon 5 consists of 4 genes psbO, psbP, psbQ, and psbR. psbO encodes for a protein that acts to stabilise the cluster of four Mn2+ that forms the catalytic centre of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) [19]. psbP, encodes a protein that optimizes the availability of Ca2+ and Cl- cofactors in the OEC in Photosystem II to maintain the active Manganese cluster [20]. psbQ, is involved with oxygen-evolving and the enhancer protein 3 [21]. psbR encodes for a protein essential for the stable assembly of psbP, that is a component of the OEC of photosystem II [22].

Middle school students, with creativity and knowledge, are who we want to enlighten with knowledge of synthetic biology. We want to inspire them to create with synthetic biology to benefit society.
From October 2017 to October 2018, we held joint synthetic biology science training camp with Jinling Middle School by monthly lecture. We brought them synthetic biology and its latest application. As the activity progressed, the students' understanding of synthetic biology deepened and the enthusiasm for learning increased. In the last few lessons, they gave us a description of synthetic biology and the highest ideals of synthetic biology in their minds. We are deeply impressed by their creativity.
After the event, we exchanged ideas with the school officers. The school officers expressed their willingness to build an iGEM team affiliated to Jinling Middle School. They hoped to get our help and support. We also expressed our willingness to work with them to build a team which is full of passion for synthetic biology and creativity.
College: Professional
Compared with our education activity in middle school, our education activity in college is more professional and more targeted. We held lectures about synthetic biology and organized a competition called “agar art”, which allows competitors using microorganisms to create artworks on agar medium. We also allowed students to get into our lab and see what we do every day. We successfully spread synthetic biological knowledge and philosophy, and involve a group of students to get into it.
iGEMcloud: Create A Platform
We developed iGEMCloud to solve some current problems of iGEM, with its immediacy, openness and interactivity.
Fast and accurate event information of iGEM are provided in iGEMCloud. It allows everyone to post messages in the corresponding section for others to view or reply, and the writer will receive notices. Based on this, a rich social possibility of iGEM is built. We provide searching, collection, attention, and other features that could make it easier for users to interact. iGEMers from different teams in different countries can openly discuss issues together. We provide team space for each team, where team members can publish the news of the team for others viewing and interacting. In this way, barriers of cooperation between teams could be removed..
This application will serve as a community for iGEMers. It can also expand the influence of iGEM events. Here, researchers can gather and exchange ideas.The application could be one of the most iGEM style communities.

Plasmid Map of BBa_K2450501 in pBAD33 without the quenching peptide
We successfully cloned the SpyCatcher-GFP-Quencher part into pBAD-33, however were unable to clone the OmpA-SpyTag part into pQE-60. This limited the experiments we were able to do with OMVs. However we were able to characterise the quencher, ensuring that if future teams can express the two parts together they will be able to use the finished system as an assay for protease presence. This can either be for the presence of protease which has been localised to OMVs or for the lysis of OMVs, by adding protease to the media they are in.
SpyCatcher-sfGFP-Quencher Characterisation
Inital Microscopy to Show Fluorescence
The first experiments we ran aimed to show that sfGFP was produced, and that the quencher worked to reduce fluorescence. Initial microscopy showed that when the quencher was removed from the part the cells did exhibit fluorescence. We were unfortunately unable to see whether the TorA leader sequence had worked as planned with the part. We were expecting to see the fluorescence transfer to the periplasm, which would have manifested as a ‘halo’ around the cell.
Figure 1: Microscopy to qualitatively detect the expression of sfGFP, the protocol for this can be found on our protocols page.
Figure 2: Graph to show efficacy of quencher. Cells were grown overnight in minimal media (M9) in a plate reader and sfGFP was measured. Fluorescence was corrected against a blank of M9 and then the starting fluorescence was subtracted from end fluorescence to give absolute response.
Plate Reader Assay of Quencher
Next, we ran a plate reader assay comparing the fluorescence of the quenched and unquenched part. Induction with arabinose to produce the part lead to an almost 10-fold increase in fluorescence in the noQuencher version of the part, showing a quenching efficiency of 90% under these conditions.
In vitro Cleavage Assay
To characterise relief of the quenching by cleavage with TEV protease we aimed to combine purified sfGFP+Quencher and TEV protease in wells and let it run in the plate reader, to see relief of quenching. Originally we attempted to do this in vitro, by purifying the part and then adding purified"

Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
We have devoted plenty of thought into the ethics and environmental issues within our project; from how we undertake the project ourselves, to how our BioCamera/bacteria could be safely used by other iGEM teams or potential users. As can be seen on our Safety Attributions page, we have implemented a variety of rules and habits in the lab to prevent unethical or unsafe use of our bacteria. As with most strains of bacteria used in R&D laboratories, the strains of E, coli that we utilised (DH5α and XL1 competent cells) are not designed to exist outside of the lab environment; they are grown in nutrient rich media and would be unlikely to proliferate if removed from the lab. However, if people develop their own images using our bacteria, we need to offer a technique where they can “fix” the image to preserve their picture but prevent release of the bacteria. We experimented with trapping the colonies under layers of varnish or epoxy resin with mixed results . We have also thought about how the “camera” could be built; allowing images to develop in a completely sealed environment, much like a traditional pinhole camera.

Q6. What’s your opinion on government’s restrictions on fishing tools, methods and time? I understand the necessity. But it’s hard to comply with them in actual activity.
The result showed that 85% of respondents held supportive attitude to the policy, but the implementation of the policy came across many problems. Most fishermen said that they hoped to improve the fishing condition but were not willing to sacrifice their personal interests.
Q7 analysis
Q7. If you think the policies are not carried out very well, what do you think might be the reason? (You can select more than one answer.)
A. Lack of finical support.
B. Lack of technology support.
C. Government didn’t attach great importance to the problem.
D. The fishermen didn’t attach great importance to the problem.
E. The regulatory system is not complete.
F. Lack of legal publicity.
G. The fishermen’s interests are impacted.
H. Other_____________________________
Figure 1: X axis: question number, Y axis: number of chosen answer.
According to Figure 5, most respondents, especially fishermen, thought that ""Government didn't attach great importance to the problem"". However, we learnt that since 2009, the government had been making more and more effort on ecological restoration at Zhoushan Fishery. Especially in 2013, large scale of artificial reefs was sunk into the costal sea. On the other hand, during interview of local public, we found that local government would broadcast videos about artificial reefs on televisions and internet at regular intervals. However, due to lack of education, the fishermen couldn't see the long-term benefits of these technologies. Instead, they tended to blame the government for not acting efficiently to the problems.
In all, the environment at Zhoushan Fishery are under terrible condition. Fishermen’s ignorance to technologies and unwillingness to sacrifice a little interest for long-term benefits cause more difficulties to ecological restoration.
We drew the conclusion that in spite of the bright future of artificial reefs, lack of understanding and support from fishermen severely impaired its ecological restoration effect. This also coincided with professor Wang's worry.
After the discussion, we figure out that in order to enhance the construction of artificial reefs, the publicity of the technology among fishermen and the public is essential. Ensuring the transparency of government policy and regaining the public's trust are the foundation to carry out policies that benefit the public, and only then will the task of restoring ecology be eventually fulfilled.

Discovery
    Maybe you have not thought about it before--game is not only for pure fun, but is also a good tool for thinking and educating. In fact, our game E.coli War has many deep meanings for us to explore. For example, we have found it really interesting when we compare our game theories with typical historical events.
    When a player manages to conclude some theories about how to win the game, he will find that the war between our little bacteria is very similar to the war between empires in history. Different ways of initializing bacteria symbolize different eras. The growth and kinds of bacteria symbolize the changing of dynasty. They wisdom and strategies a player conclude is like the wisdom that is needed by the rulers of a kingdom.
    What's more, the game can also help us in considering spatial factors' effects on population interactions (For example, discoveries metioned below) and even promoting synthetic biology.
    Now let us take a look about different discoveries that we conclude. (In movies, the yellow ones are from side A(left) while the blue ones are from side B(right))
I Era of Peace without War
    In this case, there are no warriors on either side. Therefore, the initial position of where to set the bacteria accounts the most. The following movie shows the situation where both sides own the same amount of bacteria: side A has 4 farmers while side B has 2 farmers and 2 beggars. If side A initializes its bacteria in the middle of media, then they can easily win.

Improving Biosensors Our Solutions Design Components Kits of Parts
Introduction
The E. Chromi project strived to facilitate biosensor design and construction.  We designed and characterised two types of parts - Sensitivity Tuners and Colour Generators.  The availability of these parts on the registry could revolutionize biosensor design in the future - when new promoters that sense novel inputs are characterized and submitted to the registry, Sensitivity Tuners and Colour Generators can be implemented to tune the sensitivity of the promoter to detect a concentration appropriate to the biosensor's desired application, and to report the presence of an inducer in a cheap, user-friendly fashion.
Improving Biosensors
The Parts Registry's repertoire of input-sensitive devices is incredibly varied.  Teams have engineered E. coli to be sensitive to a wide range of environmentally significant compounds, including arsenic, mercury, lead, cyanide, etc., to genetically engineer biosensors as an alternative to other technologies. The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team identified two stumbling blocks to biosensor design.
Output:  Previous iGEM biosensor projects have used pH, electrical conductance, and fluorescence as output.  However, these reporter mechanisms require further steps to read the output.  While this is acceptable for First World applications, for biosensors to have true Third World applications, a simpler output is necessary.
Response to Input: By utilizing an input-sensitive promoter, the biosensor is limited by the sensitivity of the promoter.  For example, the promoter might be sensitive to input concentrations which have no real world meaning.  The promoter's sensitivity could be too high, so it reports concentrations below levels of real-world interest.  Alternately, the promoter's sensitivity could be too low, so it reports concentrations above those which mark the boundary between ""safe"" and ""dangerous."" A second limitation is the the behavior of the PoPS output from the"

Cadets2Vets,2017,Team:Cadets2Vets#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," shore in Puget Sound brought jobs and wealth to the area. Unfortunately, over the course of its 100 years of operation, the plant had been pumping toxic materials like arsenic and lead directly into the air, where it then settled into the surrounding soil and water of the greater Tacoma area.
The smokestack was demolished in 1985, but there are still toxic levels of heavy metals in the soil over 30 years later. The city of Tacoma takes measures to warn new Tacoma homeowners about how to mitigate any increased levels of exposure to toxic materials in their soil, but must also take more drastic steps to protect users of publicly-owned land.
The Department of Defense has a strong interest in developing rapid assays to test for environmental risks to protect the health of service members. Troops often deploy to hostile environments and assessing the risks of the environment itself can be challenging. The development of the arsenic circuit represents a new way to use synthetic biology in the military setting. Demonstrating that a biological circuit can be used in this application will lead to an expansion of the technology to test for more substances in the future.
arsenic levels of interest
The maximum contaminant level for arsenic that federal and state agencies use as guideline to test the arsenic levels in drinking water was established by the EPA. Initially it was set to 50 micrograms/liter or 50 ppb. However, drinking water that contains 50 ppb arsenic for prolonged periods of time may cause bladder or lung cancer and other chronic conditions.
In 2001, the EPA reduced the maximum contaminant level of arsenic to 10 micrograms/ liter or 10 ppb1. Nevertheless, according to data gathered between the years of 1993 and 2007, arsenic contamination of the waters in Washington state persisted2.
Probes in the waters of western part of Washington state, near the southern part of the state by the Columbia River, and also north near Everett have detected higher concentrations of arsenic, close to 50 ppb.
Developing an inexpensive paper-based circuit to detect the concentration of arsenic in the water in the region will greatly influence our knowledge and awareness of the quality of the water are consuming.We hope to develop our assay to detect arsenic within the EPA limit.

Purpose
Brainstorm
In order to make sure that we have enough time to a better preparation, we started recruiting                         players in mid-March. We hold a group meeting every week to conduct ""Brain Storm"". In the first                         few weeks, everyone can come up with his or her own interesting ideas. After a few weeks'                         ""Storm"", we identified the final project purpose. After that, we started with different entry                         points according our purpose, reviewed a large number of literature and reviews, and reported                         them regularly. At the same time, we realized that we needed to make sure our project is                         meaningful for the society. Therefore, we did some surveys.
Survey
During Brainstorm, we basically determined that this year we want to build a cell-detector of                         antioxidants. In order to evaluate whether this has the significance of implementation and                         whether it is the core of people's attention, we conducted some surveys.
We designed a questionnaire about antioxidant products and the way to test them. And we also                         tried to clarify whether the public is familiar with synthetic biology.
After the investigation, we gained a lot. We were very glad that more and more people around us                         knew and started to pay attention to synthetic biology and had a strong interest in                         biotechnology. This really excited us. As for the part about antioxidants, we also had some                         positive results. According to what we learned, about 60.77% of people had used products                         contains antioxidants, such as vitamin C, astaxanthin capsules. However, most people questioned                         whether these products really have antioxidant effects. And they hoped to establish a set of                         antioxidants detection method in living cells so that it can be more accurate and efficient. At                         the same time, about 89.3% of the people made clear that the establishment of this kind of                         system will be helpful when"

A crude estimation can be obtained by assuming: a) all genes are controlled by the same promoter, b) same folding energy for all proteins, and c) same activation energy  for all reactions. The activation energy for each reaction (mean activation energy is from [1]) is:"

As a senior igem team, Peking University has provided many reliable and effective suggestions for                         our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the                         project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of                         the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.
Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the                         enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot                         of different ideas for our project.
Collaboration with Northeastern University
Time: 27 Aug, 2018
Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building
Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology

The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern                         University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study                         methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that                         may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned                         their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.
After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought                         their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute                         gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side                         effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by                         engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly                         decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid.
Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β2-microglobulin. By                         immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a                         change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β2-micro in the urine. As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in synthetic biology can be   transferred to a different strain of E. coli and in principle any wild type organisms outside the lab. Therefore kill switches that use lysis as a mechanism for cell death should not be considered bio-containment.
Future
Failsafe
One area that we were unable to explore was the incorporation of multiple kill switches into the same system.  Initially we aimed to construct an operon that contained KillerRed and  KillerOrange. This was unfeasible with the cloning  strategy that we were using as the overhangs that join the ribosome binding site (RBS) to the CDS would not differentiate between KillerRed and   KillerOrange. Constructing KillerRed and KillerOrange on plasmid backbones with different antibiotic resistance markers  would allow both to be transformed together. This is a simpler way to test the hypothesis and would be interesting for   the future.
Genome integration
While plasmids are widely used to carry genetic parts, integration into the host genome  could prove a more robust approach to introducing genes into an organism. Genome  integration removes the need for a selectable antibiotic resistance marker as parts  will be faithfully replicated and the variability of copy number is removed. We aimed to   investigate whether integration into the E. coli genome will affect the efficiency of our  kill switches and whether they would remain functional for longer in a continuous culture. We aimed to use the lambda red  recombination method to integrate our parts into the arsB locus using the pKD4 plasmid as a vector. Integrating at arsB has been shown not to affect E. coli growth (Sabri et al, 2013). However the pKD4 plasmid contained  illegal EcoRI and XBal restriction sites.  To resolve this we decided to carry out site directed mutagenesis to change one nucleotide in each sequence  of the restriction sites. Primers were designed for use with the Q5 site directed mutagenesis kit. The first attempt  using this kit involved a 2 step PCR reaction, this was shown by gel electrophoresis of the product to have been  unsuccessful. The protocol was changed to a 3 step PCR reaction and a successful product was produced. The PCR  product underwent a KLD reaction and was transformed into E. coli DH5α.   The transformation was unsuccessful and so mutagenesis was carried out again and re-transformed. Each time the  transformation was unsuccessful. We attempted to use an Agilent Quick change multi site-directed mutagenesis kit to   remove the illegal sites. Unfortunately, this kit was also unsuccessful"

Week of June 25th
Our part still hasn’t come in, so our lab work has slowed to a crawl. In the meantime, we worked on some outreach. Another student research team on campus came to tour our lab and we talked to them about synthetic biology and our project. We also started a journal club! We look at one or two different articles every week (typically in the field of synthetic biology). One student gives a presentation on the article and afterwards we discussed the implications that this could have on our project and what we learned from it. It went really well this first week and helped promote critical thinking. Hopefully, we can do things like this every week.
Week of July 2nd
Again, we haven’t received all the parts that we need to produce our completed plasmid. In the meantime, we are working on producing bacterial cellulose for hardware for our plastic degradation. We also started brainstorming good designs for our hardware project. We started designing T-shirts and other graphics for our project to make it simpler to explain. This week, the lab members who weren’t in lab as frequently were concerned that they were losing understanding of our progress so we had a long lab meeting on the weekend to catch everyone up and update each other on all aspects of the project. The modeling team did a good job explaining what they discovered in terms of rate of plastic degradation. This encouraged us to allow at least a month for incubated PETase enzymes to degrade plastic and run experiments on it.
Week of July 9th
The door to our lab broke early this week so we were having problems getting in and out. Luckily, it was fixed quite fast. Our PETase Gblock finally came in so we can really get started on the primary plasmid for our project. Everyone was very excited for this. Also, our Mid-Atlantic Meetup was this Friday so we spent a lot of time preparing to explain our project and the modeling that we have done up to this point. It went really well and we could see a lot of different teams talking to each other and fostering connections and sharing knowledge. Holly from iGEM also came by and was an absolute delight to talk to. We learned a lot about other teams and their outreach in local communities.
Week of July 16th
This week we assembled our PETase Gblock and transformed it. We ran a gel on the PETase and sent it for sequencing. Unfortunately, it seems"
