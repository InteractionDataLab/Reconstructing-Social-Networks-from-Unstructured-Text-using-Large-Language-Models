Best Hardware Special Prize
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
To compete for the Best Hardware prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," written is an abbreviation for gene 3 to gene 8 shown in “system” section. The circle in which the letter 5 is written is a counterpart of a 5-state system.
This method enables us to create even 105-stage genetic cycles by combining three-stage, five-stage and seven-stage cycles. Also the number of transcriptional regulation components we have to prepare is only 15. Even if you consider other components necessary to construct AND circuit, the total number of transcriptional regulation components could be far less than 100.
1. Developing solutions to contamination and pollution by using kill switch-inserted genetically modified microbes
It is true that these days environmental destructions are getting more serious issues, such as oil spill and soil contamination. It is quite difficult to clean up and collect causing non-biotic substances once released to the natural environment[1]. To deal with this problem, a number of solutions are proposed, and one way is the utilization of DNA modified microbes that can break down or detoxify contaminants in the environmental media[2]. To use genetically modified microbes might be able to realize the more efficient processing system than natural microbes. And from a viewpoint of preserving biodiversity, using genetically modified microbes, which will kill themselves, is better than using microbes of alien species when we decontaminate.
However, release of living modified organisms to the natural environment results in ecosystem destruction, particularly in genetic pollution, as it is prohibited by Cartagena Protocol.
Then, we propose the results of our project as a beneficial solution to this issue. Our designed system that expressed genes will change in each generation would make it possible to create microbes able to commit a suicide without external influence after a certain period of time. This can be realized with transferring genes that can remove contaminants to a former generation, and at the same time, inserting genes that can kill the cell itself(kill switch) in later generation[3]. Using this type of microbes, we can achieve the goal of contaminant removal and also reduce negative influence on the environment, due to the fact that the microbes would die over spontaneously after achieving the goal.
Figure. GM microorganisms which decontaminate polluted sea and die after a certain number of cell division [2]
We researched and discussed the vulnerability to release genetically modified microbes into natural environment and it is explained on Human Practices .
2. Improving the efficiency of cell division counting
In our project, we created the genetic cycle with three stages that the color of E. coli would change along with cell divisions. This system would be applied for a new cell division counting method that researchers can guess how many times the cells have divided just"

Since the production of MDMA is a chemical process either PMA or MDMA is produced at the end 1. That means that while MDMA does inhibit Monoamine oxidase A7 it should not be that much of an issue.

2018 January
Brainstorm for the team project
2018 February
Determined the subject as cockroach terminator
Experimental skills training for the new team
2018 March
Searched for documents and references about cockroach and Metarhizium anisopliae 128
Communicated with 2018 SUST-iGEM team about some experimental skills
2018 April
Constructed an applicable working plasmid called pBC
2018 May
The first try we transferred our working vector into the wild-type Metarhizium anisopliae 128. However, we failed.
We held a meeting which called iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting, our purpose is to build a plat for iGEMers to communicate.
We empolder an applet which named biocompany after that meeting, it can help iGEMers better communicate with each other, also a good platform for Human Practice.
We Isolated the strain.
We interviewed Canteen manager to ask the impact of cockroaches.
2018 June
We got Metarhizium anisopliae 128
We built a transformation system, but we failed.
We successfully constructed plasmid.
2018 July
We interviewed the CDC to consult about the diseases caused by cockroaches and the killing of cockroaches in the community.
We re-built a transformation system, but we failed again.
We attended the iGEM EurAsian Meetup.

Although the accumulation of toxic tailings is a prevalent challenge in our oil-dependent provincial economy, the environmental concerns they present is a global issue. Their pollution of surrounding water bodies, prolonged damage to aquatic biodiversity, and ever-increasing size are especially detrimental to the global sustainable development effort. Successful implementation of our project will, therefore, benefit both our local industries and the global community.

If the amount is apparently lower in the medium containing C, the warrior must have killed itself.We find that the amount of warrior 1 is apparently lower in C group, which means that warrior 1 kills itself.

The first thing came into our mind was Cas9 system. But how can we apply Cas9 system into detecting ctDNA? In searching for solution, the project of Peking University IGEM in 2015 brought a lot of inspiration to our design.
Paired dCas9 design of Peking University and NUDT Peking University IGEM team in 2015 dedicated to build a new reporter that is able to convert the sequence-specific information into easily readable signal including bioluminescence.[1] Compare to the previous nucleic acid detection methods such as q-PCR, probe method and direct sequencing, their method carries out a faster, less-risky and more specific detection.
Figure 3. Schematic of the paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter system of Peking University. A complex is formed by dCas9, split luciferase(Nluc or Cluc) and sgRNA. In the presence of target DNA, each of the complexes will bind to the specific sites indicated by sgRNA. When they approach to each other, the split luciferase will reassemble and generate bioluminescence signal.
In order to increase the specificity and visualization of the results, Peking University invented a programmable paired-dcas9 report system (PC report system) with luciferase. dCas9 is a variant of Cas9 protein that is catalytically dead. In other word, it can bind with sgRNA and lead itself to target site like Cas9 but it is unable to cleave DNA strand. The system designed by Peking University consists of a pair of dcas9 which fused with split luciferase (Nluc and Cluc) respectively. Thus, two kinds of split luciferase-dCas9-sgRNA complexes can be formed.(Nluc-dCas9 and Cluc-dCas9) With the presence of target DNA, each of the complexes would bind with target DNA. In this way, when a pair of sgRNA are designed properly close in target sequence, the two complexes would approach to each other so that two split luciferase"

The analysis commences with a Boolean model and proved the existence of oscillation performed by the tristable system. A more elaborated model based on ODE was formulated to further characterise the oscillatory behaviour of the system. This further confines the conditions at which oscillation occurs, as well as identifying the parameters controlling the magnitude of the oscillation.
Their findings on these additional behaviours of the switch further our understanding on the system; and hence, allowing us to fine tune if no further functions are added to the circuit design.

IIT Madras iGEM team creates a game, Codonut, to teach the players about the codon optimization phenomena which boosts the protein expression during protein synthesis by means of the ribosomal machinery in the cells so that the translational efficiency of the gene of interest can be elevated. Our team tried the game and found that it is really educational and informative. To help them optimize the game, we gave some comments and solutions towards several problems, like technical issues and tactics for attracting more players.
This game is highly recommended for diving into the molecular world in biology. If you are interested, please go to:

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," pucL were                     not able to reduce the urate concentration in the LB medium.
We doubted that it was because the bacteria cell couldn’t intake urate that our system couldn’t work. To verify it, we measured                     the urate concentration in the cell cytoplasm when two different genes [eGFP(J23100 + RiboJ + B0034 +                     eGFP, not submitted), pucL(BBa_K2334001)] were expressed in pSB1C3 vector.
To our surprise, the result shows that urate did enter the cytoplasm, but at one point, it’s excluded from the cell and won’t                     be taken in again anymore (Figure 7). If uricase exists in the cytoplasm, it can still work to reduce                     the urate concentration in the cytoplasm, but even so, urate still can’t be taken in continuously. There’s                     a possible unknown mechanism to prevent the urate from entering the cell when the mechanism is activated.                     In previous research, YgfU was expressed driven by T7 promoter, which was a furious expression process                     that the mechanism couldn’t influence in a short time. When YgfU is constitutively over-expressed, the                     mechanism can actually act successfully.
Figure 7 pucL and eGFP were cultivated in urate LB medium overnight (Urate concentration is about 1mM). The initial OD600                     of the LB medium was controlled at 0.02. Urate concentration in the LB medium was detected by HPLC. Cytoplasm                     urate concentration was detected by HPLC as well. Diluted cell lysate was used for detection.
We tried to figure out the parameters that influence the unknown mechanism. In our experiment, we tried two parameters: 1)                     Oxygen. 2) Nitrogen Source.
The reason why we suspected these two parameters is that it’s reported that E. coli can utilize allantoin as nitrogen resource                     under anaerobic conditions. Based on that, we designed our experiment to verify if those two parameters                     are important for urate utilization. We cultivated eGFP, pucL, YgfU+pucL, LM4 Full, LM4 Optimum (transformed                     in E. coli Nissle 1917) in M9/LB medium and aerobic & anaerobic environments (see protocol). Considering                     that the number of bacteria can influence the ability of urate consuming, we measured the OD600 of the                     bacteria when the sample was ready for HPLC"

iGEM Japan
iGEM Kyoto suggested ""Human Practice iGEM Japan"" project to other iGEM teams in Japan. Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project. iGEM Kyoto leads the project, and successfully we have gotten over 1500 answers! According to the results, we revealed the difference of opinion between students and the others.We also found that Japanese have a positive impression about biotechnology, but in parallel they worry about the safety very much.
Introduction
This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practice” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
Motivation
According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose ""negative"" or ""neutral"" than the other nationalities [1] . In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food [2] . We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
Advantages
By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practice activities.
This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,", we requested their part from the iGEM registry and we transformed it successfully in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Colony PCR was used to pick colonies carrying the correct insert length. The results can be seen in figure 1. After subsequent culturing and miniprep to isolate the plasmid DNA, we sent the sample for sanger sequencing and could confirm the sequence. We also performed colony PCR and subsequent culturing, miniprep and sequencing on our new part BBa_K2812004. The results of the colony PCR can be seen in figure 1.
Transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria were cultured overnight at 37 °C, followed by protein induction at an OD600 of 0.5-0.8 by adding 0.5 mM IPTG, also at 37 °C. Before induction, a cell pellet sample was taken as control (uninduced SDS sample, t0). Cell pellet samples were collected after 3 hours of induction (induced SDS sample, 3h) and after overnight induction (induced SDS sample, o/n). All samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE. The SDS gel can be seen in figure 2a. No clear overexpression of a band around 27 kDa, the expected length of truncated lysostaphin, can be seen after induction of the construct. There is no difference, except for overall intensity due to bacterial growth, between the to and 3h sample. Similarly, the o/n sample shows no difference with the samples at t0 or 3h, except for overall intensity due to bacterial growth.
Figure 2. (a) SDS-PAGE of the truncated lysostaphin construct under control of T7 promotor. First row: BioRad All Blue Protein ladder, t0 is uninduced sample, 3h and o/n is time after induction. (b) SDS-PAGE gel of the Lysostaphin-HlyA biobrick protein expression experiment with the same ladder and conditions.
In contrast, when the same protocol was followed for our assembled BioBrick BBa_K2812004, we did observe clear bands at approximately 27 kDa and 23 kDa (figure 2b). We also observed a band at 50 kDa, representing the full construct consisting of lysostaphin and HlyA. The observation of the bands at 23 and 27 kDa can be explained by cleavage of the thrombin linker due to accumulation of lysostaphin in the cytosol.

crRNA
(tracrRNA) (Jinek et al. 2012, Gasiunas et al. 2012). During infection, the
CRISPR-
locus will be transcribed into the pre-
crRNA
containing the spacer region flanked by conservated repeats. The
tracrRNA
binds to the pre-
crRNA
due to 25 nucleotides which are complementary to the repeat regions of the pre-
crRNA
(Deltcheva et al. 2011). After procession, the mature
crRNA:tracrRNA
duplex binds the
Cas9
with the
tracrRNA
builded stem-loop constituting a
CRISPR
ribonucleoprotein (crRNP). The
crRNA
contained a 20 nucleotides large spacer region at the end of the N-terminus which is complementary to the invading DNA     (protospacer) therefore leading the
crRNP
to the target. In addition, the presence of the Protospacer adjacent Motif (PAM, NGG in S. pyogenes) preceding the protospacer three nucleotides is necessary for the cleavage activity (Jinek et al. 2014, Nishimasu et al. 2014). The
crRNA
and
tracrRNA
can directly be linked by a linker loop into a single guided RNA (sgRNA) like we used in our project for a more simplified and modularized genetic engineering application (Brazelton et al. 2016, Jinek et al. 2012).
Part Collection
The Marburg Collection is a powerful tool we created, tailored to V. natriegens to enable precise cloning at an unprecedented speed.
Genetic toolboxes, a review
Golden Gate Assembly is a revolutionary cloning method published 10 years ago ( Engler et al., 2008 ). since its publication it became very popular giving rise to many assembly strategies based on this system. All systems published over the years offered improvements over previous publications. Nevertheless, although there are many systems available – often specialized for certain organisms or classes – the development by far is not at an end. We worked on a novel toolbox and developed an improved, highly flexible system focused on prokaryotes including a high number of parts characterized for the novel upcoming chassis Vibrio natriegens.
The innovation given by Golden Gate assembly was the introduction of type IIS restriction enzymes used for DNA digestion. A current workflow at that"

Cellock Holmes - A Case of Identity
Welcome to the iGEM Aachen 2014 Wiki!
Until now, an ideal method to detect pathogenic bacteria is still elusive. The existing techniques require expensive equipment, trained personnel or labourious routines.
We, the iGEM team Aachen, have developed a '''novel biosensor system''' called ''Cellock Holmes'' that '''detects bacteria on solid surfaces''' using a low-cost, rapid and portable technique.
In this project, we demonstrate a unique way of combining '''Open Source biology, software and hardware'''.

Ready, set, glow! With our projects being put on pause as we awaited the arrival of gblock, we decided to spend the days working on our contribution to the InterLab Study
Once our TLP gblock came in for our Banana Project, we attached it to an A3 backbone. We also received samples of a nonpathogenic strain of Fusarium oxysporum and streaked it onto our homemade potato dextrose agar plates.
Since our PCR insertion of an RBS failed, we decided to use a different approach, the 3A assembly method, to attach the RBS in front of our TetR/TT/pTet construct. Now we have this:
June 26- July 7
We tried to attach an Anderson promoter to the beginning of the TetR construct we had been working on and and RBS to the end with 3A assembly, but both kept failing. The issues were likely caused by the relative small sizes of the parts we were adding. We added a constitutive strong Anderson promoter to the TLP piece we ordered to be later used for observation of the efficacy of expressed TLP.
July 10 - July 14
We received our Cas9 project gblocks - two halves of Cas9 and an sgRNA, and performed Gibson assemblies to insert them into our backbones (the two Cas9 pieces were designed to be combined together with the backbone in a 3-part Gibson and the sgRNA was designed to combine with a backbone). The Gibson of the sgRNA was successful but the Cas9 Gibson was not. We also attempted to add on to our TetR construct by using PCR to add on an Anderson promoter in the front. We decided we would use GFP as our gene of interest that would be selected for with mutations, so we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a PAM sequence recognizable by the Cas9 into the chromophore region of the GFP. For our Banana project, we needed to"

New Part Shewanella ldhA gene BBa_K2565001
This composite part is used to constitutively express high levels of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 fermentative lactate dehydrogenase NADH dependent ldhA (BBa_K2565000) in E. coli, locus tag SO_0968.
The left figure shows that the media with E. coli constitutively expressing ldhA contains more lactate than LB only. The right figure shows the amount of lactate in the media of cultures so that when Shewanella and E. coli are grown together there is more lactate in the media. The MG1655 strain of E. coli does not express the Shewanella ldhA gene.
This graph shows the voltage produced by microbial fuel cells (MFC) in 15 hours. The MFC with Shewanella and E. coli produced more voltage than Shewanella alone. The MFC with Shewanella and E. coli expressing Shewanella ldhA produced more consistent voltage than E. coli without Shewanella ldhA.
Improved Part Consensus ProU promoter BBa_K2467002
The biosensor from the CMUQ 2017 team was selected for improved characterization (Part: BBa_K2467002 ). Five different concentrations of NaCl were added to tryptone and yeast extract (same as LB) and E.coli containing the biosensor plasmid and were grown overnight in triplicate. After 18 hours the red fluorescence of 100ul of culture was measured in a TECAN m1000 plate reader set for excitation/emission wavelengths of 584/607nm at a gain of 100.
Figure showing fluorescence readings of RFP reporter for ProU consensus promoter. Error bars show standard error of the mean.
These results show that the biosensor is sensitive from at low osmolarity (0-100mM NaCl). At more normal osmolarity (100-400mM NaCl) there is no difference (normal LB is 170mM NaCl).

Safe Lab Work
Besides of ensuring a safe project design, we are solicitous about our biosafety and general safety in our lab work. All secondary schools use biology laboratories with biosafety level 1 [4] . We also believe that safe lab practices are important, so we emphasize safety through maintaining a high level of personal hygiene and apply good microbiology techniques [5] . We wear lab coats and gloves while doing any experiment and wash our hands with soap before leaving the laboratory. To prevent any bacteria being left on the bench after experiments, we always use alcohol to wipe the bench thoroughly before we leave. (While doing any experiment with e.coli, we ensure the bacteria do not expose to the environment by setting up a sterile space using a Bunsen burner and working in the heated area. Also to keep the bacteria away from the open environment, we seal every used petri dishes with parafilm before long term storage.) We received safety training when joining the team, topics include risk assessment, general precautions, fire precautions, handling chemical spills, disposal of chemical wastes and experiments on biotechnology. Details of the training can be found in here . which we follow to the letter.
Other Safety Concerns
Some steps of our experiments require the use of UV light, whereupon exposure to UV radiation may result in sunburn, pigmentation of skin and slight discomfort [7] . To ensure our safety, we make sure that any parts of our body won’t be directly exposed to UV radiation; we will place a UV filter board [8] between us and the source of UV radiation so that it will be blocked from us.

This background helps guide student’s research and offers a shared foundational knowledge for all attendees. The background guide also provides information on CRISPR-Cas technology and encourages students to look into bioengineering/biohacking before attending the conference. This guide  was distributed to the 150 students in the WHO committee as the first point of contact. Ashley requested we create a powerpoint presentation to build on information in the background guide, the presentation will kick off the debate. The goal of the outreach project was to expose high school students with an interest in international policy to the potentials of synthetic biology and give them the opportunity to practice discussing the science.
Search the Database & Adapt
Our presentation was about Biohacking, as outlined in the background guide. Although our team was familiar with the science, we had never presented to international policy makers. Before presenting we wanted to ensure that we put our research into the appropriate context for the students so we turned to the Database for additional suggestions. By using the ""specialized audiences"" option we were able to find team ETH_Zurich's 2016 Youth rep workshop which centered around the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which are goals the United Nations hopes to achieve by 2030. We took some of the topics ETH_Zurich had presented as the most important for their United Nations related program and used them as inspiration for our own research. Our iGEM team went on to create a synthetic biology presentation which both built on the foundation set in the background guide and introduced advancements and concerns in synthetic biology relevant to legislators such as new medical advancements, the regulation of reagents and information, and the containment of synthetic organisms.
Implementation
On October 4th we met with Julie and Ashley and presented our rough draft of the presentation. It was well received and we were given additional time to expand our presentation to include even more synbio applications. We will be presenting our 20-minute presentation , to 150 High School Model United Nations students on Sunday, November 10th. The group will then spend the rest of the day discussing and debating global policy as it relates to biohacking, DIY biology and bioengineering advancements. This project was designed to put synthetic biology into a global policy context, encouraging students to see the impact of bioengineering. By presenting synthetic biology in this new format we are able to make synthetic biology relevant for a larger portion of the high school population. We have already learned so much about the complexities of international organizations from our conversations with Ashley, and we can't wait to learn from the high school students"

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Achievement_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM team originated from our school's synthetic biology club, and we used the club as a base for our works of public engagement. We focused on the community development, and we held a biosafety panel session in a high school iGEM meet up, in which we had former iGEMers, current iGEMer who was running the lab and lab manager from a university lab, to discuss how to propagate biosafety considerations into the existing Chinese Synbio community. Also, we gathered Biology Olympians from all over China, to discuss the future of high school academic communities. We had always believed in that the solution to all kinds of complicated circumstances, such as biosafety threat to the society, has to be the cultivation of academic and safety cultures to the public, and such farming has to start from ourselves, the iGEMers, striving to be the conscientious members of the current community;
We are striving to do the best modelling works for We proposed a deterministic ordinary differential equation set, which is sufficient to describe the quorum sensing regulation of a bacteria population. By using numerical methods to simultaneously solve these three concise and easily comprehensible modelling equations, we have successfully derived at a concentration interval for the amount of extracellular acyl homoserine lactone required in the fermenter in order to maintain a high enough concentration of PhlF protein to suppress the expression of nuclease and maintain the survival of engineered bacteria both at the start of and during the fermentation process. The result from Matlab simulation,1E-10M [AHL] corresponds well with that from wet lab experiments,1E-9M [AHL]. Using the experimental data, we adjusted the model, concluded that the difference might be the effect of plasmid copy number. We will improve the model according to the data, and come out with an acceptable concentration range. This information would be handy for workers at the fermentation industry to ensure their biosafety-directed bacteria to always survive inside the fermenter;
We are striving to do the best measurement for by using a capacity monitor described by a nature article, which is a constantly expressed GFP in the genome, we can characterize the resource consumption by heterologous gene constructs, through the changes in GFP production in the genome comparing to the ones without heterologous protein expressed. We characterized several devices reported to be high resource consuming, which provides other users to consider their resource occupation quantitatively, and improve the future devices' orthogonality and robustness;"

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium"

Yang is a junior student majoring in Biology. He would show great earnest and passion when he is doing experiments. And he could do management very well.
When Chenmao joined our team, he was just a freshman, but he had got unique insights about GMO. Although his major is EE, he is no worse than us in doing biological research. Science fiction is always his dish.
Heng is an enthusiastic boy who comes from a beautiful coastal city. His favorite sport is badminton, and our instructor Yang often plays it with him. He believes life is movement.
Junjie Zong is a humorous and lively boy, crazy about sports and Japanese comics. He says he has an inexplicable crush on biological lab…(Do you?)
Yuwei has a very active and open characteristic, sometimes like a boy. However, when she does experiments, she could show great patience and  carefulness. She loves others' praise, so everybody follow me and speak aloud- You are the apple of my eye.
Xuan is the only person praised by Shoujie as handsome. He is very keen on basketball and almost his every WeChat' moment is about it. In our team, he is Ketong's good partner in molecular cloning.
Yuchen describes himself as a talker, however, in our mind he is a singer, though I never get a chance to appreciate his singing. He is in charge of molecular cloning, at the same time he studies English hard every day.  2
Bowen is a graceful girl who is admired by us for her fluent and native English. In her spare time, she loves watching movies and reading books. Christopher Nolan and Scientific American are her favorites.
Junjie Yu is a junior student majoring in Chemical Engineering. He said why he joined us was that Ketong let him consider biological experiments interesting. Now he is in charge of the project of plastic degradation and could do molecular cloning very well.
Haofeng would love to talk with people, creating fun of  dreary experiments. He loves racing with others on agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. In daily life, his hobby is basketball.
Jinxin once said his life was forever about  losing something, looking for it and waiting for others to send it back. He is in charge of molecular cloning now, and he just lost some base pairs as sequencing showed…

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Project Background
What are integrons?
Integrons are systems which can capture and utilise mobile genetic elements known as gene cassettes, and which are found in a vast array of bacteria. Cassettes are often associated with antibiotic resistance and are a significant factor in the spread of antibiotic resistance between bacteria. Gene cassettes with an attC recognition site are site selectively recombined into an attI recognition site by the integron integrase. Insertion of cassettes can continue to occur at the AttI site, and with much lower frequency at the AttC sites, resulting in a long array of cassettes which can be expressed from a constitutive promoter (Pc) just upstream from the AttI.  Cassettes may also be from the array ,
There are a few classes of integrons, but the first to be discovered and most well-known are the Class 1 integrons.  Class 1 integrons are the most medically important class because of their involvement with antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria.  As shown in the diagram on the right, Class 1 integrons are defined by the presence of a conserved sulfonamide resistance gene on the outside of the array. The cassettes found within class 1 integrons are usually antibiotic resistance genes.
Since the integration of new cassettes is simultaneous with expression by the constitutive promoter, the system can conceivably be used for pathway optimisation by gene shuffling .  This means that new insertions are immediately tested and selected for if beneficial.
An extensive review about integrons can be found here .
What are we doing?
We are seeking to design biobrick compatible, completely controllable class 1 integron components that can be used as a novel, convenient and selective cloning system in lab strains of E. coli, which normally do not contain integron systems. Additionally, we are investigating regulation of natural transformation mechanisms in E. coli in an attempt to allow uptake and recombination of attC containing genetic elements with added convenience.
Why is this cool?
By re-building nature’s modular genetic shuffling machine, we aim to provide a novel tool for Synthetic Biologists AND ALSO create an experimental system in which we can more precisely understand integrons.
Integrons in iGEM
Integrons have been encountered before in iGEM for different purposes:

2. According to iGEM NCTU’s project, they continued their former work in last year, trying to extend an extra function, aiming at a different target. In our case, this plan is something that we could try out because our we have a similar condition! Our devices have been completed around 70% though we only have one featured probe, EDCs probe. There is a high potential to develop some other featured probes or to integrate other iGEM team’s detectors like what we are doing now with iGEM WLC.

To gain or learn some improved techniques from another unit, GF Competition provided us an extraordinary chance to practice it. This competition is hosted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs every year, whose purpose is to offer a platform for any research groups to integrate their latest technology or methods with government developed technique. This is one of the famous competitions among technical universities in Taiwan, which attracted more than a hundred team to attend. This time, we integrated our EDCs detector and thin-film enzyme reactive filter with MediaTek LinkIt ONE demo-board, MediaTek Cloud Sandbox and Node-RED provided by the government. The government arranged three experts with corresponding professions to help our integration plan and this whole session has lasted for four months.  In the end, we won the excellent work prize and  Bronze Medal, which indirectly supported our project achievement.

""""The opportunity of being a trainee at Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team of 2017 opened my eyes to the world of Synthetic Biology. It was a truly outstanding experience mainly due to the vast knowledge and extreme proficiency in their study fields from the whole iGEM team, which I was able to observe and learn from. During discussions about the lab and the fundamentals of the idea I was astonished nearly 100% of the time because of the intense flow of new concepts and ideas. Furthermore, aiding the team in other fields such as HP was very new to me, I was never part of such a big group project and was certainly never appointed to help design scientific activities and even take part in sharing the responsibility of the project. I now see the iGEM competition as something great not just because it helps to form and characterize synthetic biology, but of what it helps others to achieve through hard work, determination and, most importantly, teamwork. I aspire to become competent enough in my field over the course of couple of years and then attempt to give another shot at the iGEM competition, but this time as a proper team member to experience everything first hand."""""",2,,,Two highly motivated high school students came into lab to work with the team. ,,,

It's important to understand the difference between the software darwin and the utility dwndiff. Over the summer, the team produced dwndiff, which is a command-line utility for producing what are called ""diff"" files suitable for use with genomic data. darwin, on the other hand, is the overall vision of the software team: to produce a solution for tracking changes to all sorts of genomic data. Given input files in FASTA, GenBank, or ApE format, the dwndiff utility can speedily produce output files which can be used with an external version control system much more easily. Examples of such version control systems include git , svn , and hg .
Using dwndiff is somewhat complex at first, but let's start with the most obvious solution: the ""help"" command:
$ dwndiff --help       Usage: dwndiff [OPTION...] FILE...       dwndiff is a command-line tool to format DNA sequences for use in version       control systems. It is intended to be used as a backend for version control       tools which act upon biological data. It defaults to 'format' mode, where it       formats a given DNA sequence (through stdin, or the given files) to a special       format, appending the '.vcsfmt' suffix. If given the '-c' option, however, it       will take two files, convert them to .vcsfmt format if necessary, and produce a       .vcscmp file which can be used in version control software.        -p, --preformat_loc=DIR    Location of pre-existing .vcsfmt files for given       input DNA       -w, --write                Write output to file(s) instead of stdout       -c, --compare              If two files given, produce unix diff-compatible       comparison .vcscmp file       -v, --verbose              Produce verbose output       -?, --help                 Give this help list       --usage                Give a short usage message       -V, --version              Print program version        Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional       for any corresponding short options.
Let's break this down into multiple cases:
Given a genomic file, convert it to a version-controllable format, which we call vcsfmt.
Given two vcsfmt files, find the difference between them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcscmp"

Safety And Security Questions
Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
No, we did our work under the control, and all team members follow the lab rules. Therefore, in fact, we did not get hurt during working.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
No, our work also is harmless to the public and the environment. After we had finished our progress for a day or a step, we always dealt with the contaminated trash carefully, and the trash is disposed of after sterilization. It is the most important in our work.
Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
No,  We only worked with non-hazardous, non-infectious, commonly used and accepted bacteria strains. Even releasing by accident will not cause risk to environment.  All work was conducted in a biosafety level S1 laboratory. Rules of best microbiological practices were applied.
Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
No, almost Biobricks we used are from MIT, and only something new we made and modified from previous Biobricks in 2010 iGEM works or clone by ourselves. Actually, these new and old Biobricks are very safe. Our progress is to build up a new control mechanism. These new mechanism is about temperature, and is safe. There is no method for others to use maliciously.
Please explain your responses (whether yes or no) to these questions.
Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):
- pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity?
- threats to environmental quality?
- security concerns?
If your response to any of the questions above is yes:
Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as"

Gifu,2016,Team:Gifu#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," organisms escape from laboratory, we picked up an accident which happened in Nagoya University last year, and exchanged opinions that could help each other with either research or outreach efforts.
Collaborate with Nagahama
Gifu and Nagahama held a meeting on September 21th. We wanted to exchange opinions for each project. Nagahama aimed at improving the parts which they made last year, for FLAVORATOR . They had difficulty in protein assay. So we suggested that to use His-tag for assaying protein.
We planned to do a lot of expression about some enzymes. But, we troubled about what E.coli doesn’t release enzymes. So we thought we have to break E.coli to get enzyme. Nagahama suggested that to refer to iGEM Kyoto 2012 project . Because the study was E.coli’s secretion systems. This advice helped us for our project.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#substrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"ol as an example. The concentrations were measured between 0.1 µg mL -1 and 3 µg mL -1.
At first dilution series of all different substrates were measured. It was possible to measure calibration curves for estradiol and ethinyl estradiol but not for estrone. This was probably caused by its bad solubility.  The retention time for estradiol is 4.4 minutes and for ethinyl estradiol 4.9 minutes. For all estrogens the same extinction and emission values could be used: Ex230, Em310.
Degradation of estrogens
Figure 2: Degradation of estradiol (dark green) and ethinyl estradiol (light green) with the different laccases after 5 hours without ABTS. In the graph it is shown that the bought laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade more than 90 percent of the used substrates. None of the bacterial laccases are able to degrade ethinyl estradiol without ABTS but estradiol is degraded in a range from 16 %(ECOL) to 55 % (TTHL). The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The measurements were made to test if the produced laccases were able to degrade different hormones. Therefore the produced laccases were inserted in the same concentrations (3 µg mL-1) to the different measurement approaches. To work with the correct pH value (which were measured by the Team Activity Test) Britton Robinson buffer at pH 5 was used for all measurements. The initial substrate concentration was 5 µg mL-1. The results of the reactions without ABTS are shown in Figure 2. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (blue) and ethinyl estradiol (red) are indicated. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 30 °C. The negative control was the substrate in Britton Robinson buffer and showed no degradation of the substrates.

N anti-terminator gene from Lambda phage
BBa_K374006
In lambda bacteriophage, gene expression is regulated by the suppression of transcription termination (antitermination) which is mediated by the lambda N protein that interacts with the nut site which is a cis-acting element. This part contains the lambda N gene which will suppress transcription termination downstream of  the nutR site.
This regulatory biobrick can be used in a biological circuit. Together with BBa_K374005 , they will promote anti-termination.

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.

Overview | Design | Results
TECAN Data
The initial circuit for this project has recently been completed. The relative fluorescence of both RFP and sfGFP reporters was tested in a TECANM1000.
The graph above shows the relative fluorescence of two reporters corresponding to two start codons in the circuit. The reporters indicate the ribosome's preference for one start codon over the other in protein translation. Super-folder GFP (sfGFP) is preferred in this construct, as shown by the high amount of relative fluorescence. Though the amount of green fluorescence significantly outweighs the red fluorescence, there is still a measurable amount of RFP expression in the cell. The presence of both reporters indicates that multiple start codons may be possible in DH10B E.coli, since the ribosome recognizes both start codons and initiates the translation of both proteins.
Further Application
This construct tests only a 7-nucleotide separation between start codons. Since these preliminary results show that the recognition of multiple start codons is possible within the cell, further research will continue to investigate the effect of ribosome binding site translation initiation rate, as well as length between codons, on codon slippage. To view the full list of intended sequences which will be tested in this genetic circuit, please visit our parts page.

During the lunch break, we had the occasion to discuss about our experience and how each team works. We also shared some advices and some anecdote about our respective team. After this break, we have been able to enjoy the sun and the beautiful city that is Marseille. The day ended by an occasion to learn more about each other and sympathize. It was a great pleasure to meet all these people.  The second day begins with the presentation of iGEM Valencia team about their project, Chatterplant. It was really interesting to discuss about the possibility of using the roofs for plantation. After a break, we begin the poster session and it was again an occasion to share some advice about the design and organization of the poster.This meet-up was an excellent occasion to meet people and have different opinions on our project. It is a great idea that allows us to create relationships that could useful for work opportunities or could become friendship.
2. Around the world
IGEM is an international competition involving teams from all around the world. In this spirit, we got in contact with a team which is far away from us. We collaborated with TNCR_Korea team to get some feedbacks on our respective wiki and to fill some surveys. Their project is about making gluten digestable for everyone. You can visit their wiki HERE.

Moreover, the resulting engineered E. coli exhibited an excellent capability for the degradation of TCP and γ-HCH.
Project Story
γ-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH)
HCH, formerly known as benzene hexachloride (BHC), is one of the now notorious organochlorine group of insecticides. About 600,000 tons were used throughout the world between the 1940s and the 1990s to control a wide range of agricultural, horticultural, and public health pests.[2,3] Mounting concerns about its nontarget toxicity and persistence have since caused it to be deregistered in most countries[2], but it is very stable in the environment[2,7] and it is still being manufactured in India for local and export uses, so residue problems will continue for many decades.[2] The majority of HCH waste has been discarded in the open or stored at various levels of containment near the production sites, HCH residues at many of the sites have percolated into the soil and then contaminated ground water.[2] Residues of HCH have now been reported for many countries in samples of air[8,9] water[10] soil[10,11,12]food commodities[13,14,15] and even from human blood samples.[16,17]
1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP)
1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) is a toxic synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbon that is not known to occur naturally[20]. It is used as a chemical intermediate in organic synthesis, as a solvent, and as an extractive agent. In addition to these intentional uses, TCP is produced in considerable amounts as a by-product from the manufacture of epichlorohydrin. TCP does not noly contaminate soil, it also leaks down into groundwater and settles down at the bottom of the ground water reservoir because TCP is more dense than water. This makes TCP in its pure form a DNAPL (Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid) and it is therefore harder to remove from groundwater[19]. Groundwater and soils in various parts of the United States and in Europe are polluted with TCP as a result of improper disposal of TCP-contaminated effluents and due to the past use of the"

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a co-culture medium to us, which is derived from the cyanobacterium medium BG11. He also provided us with the protocols which were then frequently used in our project .
In summary, Dr. Ducat helped us significantly in several ways that changed our project. At first, by providing us with the Synechococcus cscB strain which enabled us to conduct experiments with sucrose production and export in salt stress media.  Second, by introducing a co-culture medium to us which we ended up using for all of our co-culturing experiments.
We are glad to be given the opportunity to speak with a co-culture specialist and value his advice that changed our project significantly.
Integrated Human Practices with Dr. Spencer Scott
Our work with the quorum sensing system is based on research done by Dr. Spencer Scott and colleagues, who published the paper “A stabilized microbial ecosystem of self-limiting bacteria using synthetic quorum-regulated lysis” in the well known “Nature microbiology” journal in 2017. Since we knew we would encounter some difficulties and had questions regarding this harsh project, the best choice for us was to reach out to Dr. Scott in order to improve our project.
At first we presented him our current progress and he showed himself very delighted that his PhD project was further studied by us. He also assured us his support.
Our idea was to use the same microfluidics system that the researchers used in the paper mentioned above. Since the paper does not precisely state which kind of system they used, we asked if their system was easily reproducible in our lab. Unfortunately, Dr. Scott informed us, that their lab was endowed with very sophisticated and costly microfluidics system and advised us against this setup. Instead he suggested us to use a simple chemostat.
Moreover, he suggested to try to apply the quorum sensing systems in different organisms, since the used parts should, according to him, be transferable to other organisms.
In addition to that, we encountered some issues when comparing the growth situation of the wild type co-culture with the mutant co-culture which included the quorum sensing harbouring microorganisms. He recommended to just check the overgrowth of the specific organisms in the two different situations.
Regarding this, another important advice he gave us was that a good overall experimental time is 24 hours.
Finally, to solve the problem of quantifying AHL - the quorum sensing molecule of interest - he proposed to us to use a qualitative approach instead of a quantitative one, hence to try titration of different AHL concentrations and to check the impact it has on our cultures"
Fudan_Lux,2012,Team:Fudan Lux#biowave_-_-_TEXT.html," the HTH motif containing a
helix-turn-helix protein sequence which is the α2 and α3 helixes in the structure image.  Using tetR as a repression has several advantages. The tetR has no leaky expression, and the repression can be adjusted by the tetracycline.
LOV domain
LOV (light, oxygen or voltage) domains are protein photo sensors that are conserved in bacteria, archaea, plants and fungi, and detect blue light via a flavin cofactor (FMN or FAD).
Figure 2this cartoon presents just a few examples of the hundreds of LOV domain- containing proteins. The attached domain include: GAF cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterases; HTH helix-turn-helix; HK histidine kinase; MASE1 membrane-associated sensor1; PAS PER-ARNT-SIM; REC CheY-like phosphoacceptor (receiver); SpollE sporulation stage II protein E; STAS sulphate transporter anti-σ antagonist; ZnF zinc-finger.
In bacteria, LOV proteins generally follow the domain organization that is described in other bacterial signaling proteins. The activation domain could be multifunctional; the chart shows the diversity in LOV-signaling output. Such complex domain arrangements can allow the integration
of multiple environmental signals and can provide mechanisms for amplification or attenuation of the light signal. Clearly, LOV domains are versatile photoswitches. But how do LOV domains regulate such a structurally disparate group of proteins? The mechanisms could be simply described by the following chart. The LOV domain transfer the signal by the Jα helix or the dimerization of the Ncap. The properties of LOV domain show us the possibility of designing light switch. We have laid eyes on such two LOV opsins: EL222 and AsLov2.
LOV-HTH
The LOV-HTH protein design is inspire by the natural protein EL222, a 222amino acid protein isolated from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594. In addition to an N-terminal LOV
domain, EL222 also contains a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain representative of LuxR-type DNA-binding proteins. The EL222 has the naturally light switch and DNA binding activity, but the regulation sequence should be modified into a repressive operon. The tetR operating sequence shows the same HTH motif. So the HTH swap could be processed. The swapped sequence is shown in the image. After the HTH swap, Lov-HT"

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," by the NFkB transcription factor. NFkB activation in microglia causes motor neuron death in vitro, as well as in vivo. Heterozygous inhibition of NFkB in microglia substantially delayed disease progression in ALS mice model 2. In the experiment we used a commercial shIKKb viral vector. This vector expresses a short hairpin RNA targeting the IKKβ mRNA. An RNA interference with the expression of IKK-β should inhibit the activation of the NFκB pathway which would produce a weaker expression of its target genes3, among them: Interleukin 1 subunit α (Il1α)4 and Tumor Necrosis Factor subunit α (TNFα)5.
Procedure:
Infect BV2 microglia cells with shIKKb plasmid.
Perform selection of transfected cells with Puromycin.
Grow BV2 cells (wild type and infected) in 6-well plates to 80% confluence.
Activate the cells with LPS for 2 hours to induce microglia activation and cytokine secretion.
Extract RNA and create cDNA.
Preform ELISA with the supernatant.
Preform qPCR with cells.

He decided to participate in iGEM because he finds the idea of manipulating the properties of life, polished by billions of years of evolution, to affect a desirable outcome intriguing and appealing. He also hopes to gain invaluable experiences and skills that will promote his future career in synthetic biology. Previous to iGEM, he has worked in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics at Rockefeller University, attempting to elucidate a high-resolution structure of Thermus aquaticus σ70, a protein vital to transcription initiation, and of an analogous transcription initiation factor in T4 bacteriophage called gene protein 55. Outside the lab, Wilson enjoys working with friends on building a Parallel Computing Cluster from scratch, and also enjoys programming and playing the violin and piano.
Jonathan Elzur
is a sophomore in MIT. He is currently planning to major in physics, but is interested in many fields including math, bio-engineering, chemistry, and computer science. Jon was fascinated by iGEM because it offered cutting edge research, where undergraduate students get to perform experiments that literally have never been done before! He also loved being able to program organisms to be able to do anything: glow in the dark, make bio-fuels, or fight cancer. He hopes to learn from iGEM what working in a lab is like, and gain some expertise in biology. Jonathan is a brother of AEPi, MIT's Jewish fraternity.

Then we went to the beautiful Minhang Campus (and very huge!) and held a meeting together. Since it is their 1st year in the iGEM family, we shared with them our experience of participating iGEM competition and working on synthetic biology projects. And they told us what they have learned from the workshop at Imperial College. After the meeting, our Shanghai friends guided us to some famous places, such as the Nanjing Road, the Bund and Yu Park, which are typical symbols of Shanghai. We really appreciate their hospitality and cannot wait to see them again at the Jamboree.
Preparing for the meeting
at Yu Park
Help NTU-Singapore and Valencia teams with their surveys
Survey is a valuable approach to obtain public opinions and tendency about specific issues on human practice of synthetic biology. This year, a lot of iGEM teams focus on human practice and some of them invited us to help. We filled out surveys for NTU-Singapore Team and Valencia Team(they honored us a silver medal, as is shown left). Besides, we built up a google group with NTU-Singapore team in order to help each other with experimental problems.
Interaction with Paris team
In June, Prof. Ariel Lindner (supervisor of Paris team) and some French students visited the Center for Theoretical Biology at Peking University. He, Camill and Yann (PhD candidates) attended our team meeting and gave us many beneficial suggestions. The two PhD boys are very friendly and humorous, and as fascinated with football as we do. We played football together and planned for another game at the Jamboree!

The larger antigen-antibody complexes generated will disturb the                         distribution of the liquid crystal molecules so that they are no longer vertically aligned, and                         the transmitted polarized light passes through the disorder. The aligned liquid crystal                         molecules turn into color, reflecting the presence of excess β2-MG in the urine,                         which provides early warning of the development of chronic kidney disease.
Description of Product
Our products are presented in kit form, without the need for expert knowledge, and can be tested                         by following the instructions. This kit can be used both at home and in the hospital, and is                         portable and easy to operate. The test results of this kit provide early warning only for the                         occurrence of chronic kidney disease, warning patients of the risk of chronic kidney disease,                         and cannot be used as a basis for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.
The First Generation of Dr. Familict
Structure:
The kit is designed based on a liquid crystal cell. A polarizing plate is disposed above the                         reagent box, and the ordinary light that is incident on the reagent box through the polarizing                         plate can be polarized light; the inside of the reagent box is mainly composed of a glass                         carrier and a liquid crystal cell, and the two parts can be assembled into A test chip.

On the glass slide, we have optimized the corresponding concentration of DMOAP inducer and                         antibody. The substrate in the liquid crystal cell is also modified with DMOAP, and the liquid                         crystal cell is filled with vertically aligned liquid crystal. When used, the urine drop to be                         tested is first added to the glass slide and then the glass slide is assembled with the liquid                         crystal cell, and the complex formed by antigen-antibody combination can affect the liquid                         crystal alignment and produce corresponding image color change.

ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the research results could only meet two of the requirements at most, which greatly limited the industrialization and further development of the research results. However, in our project, the application of bio-enzymes ensured the relative high efficiency to produce hydrogen; with the application of biofilm, the system became recyclable to maintain a reasonable cost; and finally for the same reason, the system could be used for a long time showing its sustainability. Speaking of the future application into real industrial production, Pro. Mi thought our project demonstrated a very promising application potential, but he still suggested us to further modify the system to ensure a steady product quality and to find the best reaction conditions to undergo a better efficiency. And our team will going to further work from these aspects in the near future.
Interview with Researcher Fei Yu
Researcher Fei Yu is now working at the CAS Key Laboratory of Low-Carbon Conversion Science and Engineering, Advanced Research Institute. Focusing on the energy issue, Dr. Yu has been seeking for potential approaches, especially the ‘Fischer–Tropsch to olefins’ (FTO) process, dealing with the energy problems. His lasted research article, ""Cobalt carbide nanoprisms for direct production of lower olefins from syngas"" was just published on the ""Nature"" magazine in early October.
Our team members were honored to be in touch with Dr. Yu, holding an interview with him, where we not only discussed the potential industrial approaches to the energy challenge, but also we briefly exchanged thoughts and ideas on our biofilm-based project as well as Dr Yu's recent breakthroughs. Lots of inspirations and insights aroused from the talk.
Administrative Authority
Our team delegation paid a visit to the Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange CO., LTD. On the interview day, we had a meeting with Ms. Yu Huang and Dr. Shengbo Chen from the department of Research & Development Center there. As one of the most important parts of implement by Chinese Authority, lots of policy are set and then implemented here, in response to the United Nations Climate Conference. Due to its special characteristics it possesses, the Energy Exchange Center is an ideal place for us to know more about the energy issue from a governmental aspect.
First of all, Dr. Wu carried out a brief introduction about the Energy Exchange Center. Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange CO., LTD is a platform directly built by the Shanghai Central Government, where carbon emission permit is allowed to be traded. Since people are still trying to figure out a sustainable solution to the energy issue, temporarily one of the feasible ideas is to use the power of"

Our identity preservation construct consists of two transcriptional units carrying the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) transcriptional factors (SlANT1, SlJAF13) which are regulated by the 35S constitutive promoter. Both transcriptional factors are involved in flavonoids biosynthetic pathway regulation; it is that they enhance anthocyanin accumulation.
SlANT1 and SlJAF13 are S. lycopersicum orthologous of the Antirrhinum majus Rosea1 and Delila genes. In previous researchs, ectopic over-expression of these transcription factors under the control of the E8 fruit-specific promoter increases the transcript levels of most of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in tomato fruit leading to high levels of anthocyanins [1,2]. In N. benthamiana, transient expression of SIANT1 and SIJAF3 activates the expression of several flavonoid biosynthetic genes leading to a change of the colour on the leaf due to accumulation of anthocyanins.
We transiently transformed this new identity preservation module (containing SIANT1 and SIJAF13 transcriptional units) by agroinfiltration into N. benthamiana. As result, the anthocyanin accumulation drives our plant to a violet colour change that can be observed by the naked eye (Figure 3).

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," the hazards of classic industrial society is of considerable importance because, at the same time, they are also confronted with a public environmental discourse that relates to their use of synthetic biology. However, the nature of the ecological risk pertaining synthetic biology is considerably different from conventional industrial risk. The latter, for instance, is predominantly characterized by threats that mainly manifest themselves on a local level, which makes them clear in the limited scope in which they can have a potentially harmful effect. In the case of the Cristais River, the affected population of the relevant ecological system only concerned those organisms consuming the water of the river. In addition, local industrial pollution is often described in terms of the degree of health or environmental risk that is involved, which in this case means the extent to which there are carcinogenic implications of leaching effluent. Furthermore, in such a case of local industrial pollution, there is a higher probability that drawing a connection between the impact of the risk and the source can be done in a linear and hence easily measurable fashion (Beck 1996).
In contrast to the relatively more straightforward approach required in the Cristais River case, such ‘high-risk’ technologies as synthetic biology, or genetic engineering in general, tend to supersede such clear and localized risks when considering the scope of their impact. Their difference can be so great that authors like Ulrich Beck would portray the implications of something like synthetic biology in an almost apocalyptic manner. One of the reasons for this is that it would, for example, be impossible to trace the origins of synthetically engineered micro-organisms in the open environment, making it difficult to invoke accountability as to who can be held responsible for misusing or even exploiting the technology (Blowers 1997). Another reason is that, with synthetic biology, risks have been rendered “incalculable and unpredictable in the risk society”, thus giving leeway to the accumulation of increasing uncertainty (Beck 1996: 160; Cohen 1997). In much the same way, the International Risk Governance Council would assert that the emerging risks related to synthetic biology are still largely underdetermined notwithstanding the possibility of the considerable impact that it might have (IRGC 2010; Zhang et al. 2011).
With regard to the potential large-scale risk factor, Beck (1992a) argues that “science hovers blindly above the boundaries of threats” because “testing comes after application and production precedes research” (Beck 1992a: 108). The logic of scientific research that Beck illustrates shows how safety implications are expected to become known even before the issue can be fully understood. Therefore,"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Jiangnan,2018,Team:Jiangnan China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," ------- Yakult   Location: Wuxi, Jiangsu
    At Yakult, we understand the great benefits of probiotics for human health. Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.
（2）On June 29th ------- Meiji   Location: Suzhou, Jiangsu
    First, we watched the propaganda film of Meiji and learned about the company's products, market and corporate culture. Then, we visited the company's workshop under the guidance of the staff. The streamlined production made us feel the advanced technology of the company. After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.
（3）On July 9th ------- Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd   Location: Zibo, Shandong
    Firstly we went to Xinhua pharmaceutical company. At this company, we learned that most of their current drugs are still relatively common drugs, and they are also used in the traditional way of taking drugs. However, some drugs need to be prepared in the form of coating, and need to control the time and dosage, which is not very convenient. Also, the granules are relatively large. We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.
（4）On July 10th  ------- Shandong Vland Biotechnology Co. Ltd
    Later, we went to Vland biotech company to discuss the problem of frozen stress in the process of microbial fermentation and preservation and transportation. Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lactobacillus lactis in anti-acid and anti-freezing are self-evident. And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.

(3) Injection oil. Series 700 Halocarbon oil;
(4) Worm pick;
(5) M9 buffer;
(6) Worms; (Well-fed, young to middle-aged (≥1day old) gravid hermaphrodites with a full but single row of eggs.)
(7) Needle-loading pipettes.
4.10.3 Method
(1) Fill a needle-loading pipette by capillary action with ≥ 1 ul of DNA injection mix;
(2) Insert the pipette tip in through the back of the injection needle, and expel injection mix onto the needle's internal filament;
(3) Place a loaded needle into the needle holder and mount on the manipulator;
(4) Position the needle so that the tip is in the center of the microscope's field of view using the 5X objective;
(5) Place a drop of oil on an injection pad and place under a dissecting microscope on top of a small Petri plate cover;
(6) Scoop one to several worms from a bacteria-free region of an NGM plate with a naked pick and transfer to the oil drop. Avoid contact with the worm's head. Alternatively, first touch the worm pick to the oil, and use the oil droplet to pick up the animals from a bacteria-free region. The idea is to minimize transfer of bacteria to the pad;
(7) Flame then cool the worm pick and use it to position the worms in the oil drop, and to gently push them down onto the pad. Orient the worms in rows with their ventral sides facing the same direction (opposite the needle direction) If the worms fail to adhere to the pad, move to a new location or rub the bodies with the pick to remove water or bacteria droplets. If adherence is still a problem re-bake the pads or use thicker or higher concentration agarose pads (see above)
(8) Transfer the slide face-up onto the microscope stage. Center the first worm to be injected and focus using the 5X objective. Move the needle down and in close proximity to the dorsal surface of the first animal. Switch to the 40X objective and focus on the worm;
(9) First make sure the needle is flowing;

A: GS linker + cECFP, B: GS linker + nECFP, C: 2GS linker + cECFP, D: 2GS linker + nECFP. Relative fluorescence intensity is evaluated by grey level measurement of ImageJ and flow cytometry. The group of AB seems to have a better expression level as well as response rate. Experiments were conducted in biological triplicate, and each experiment is representative of at least three independent biological experiments. (*: P<0.05, ***: P<0.001)
It is obvious that a complementary ECFP would not form if the two chains failed to locate to cell membrane or if they couldn’t bind under the effect of VEGF. Thus we can infer from the results that our VEGF-scFv together with the signal sequence and the transmembrane domain is ready for further tests.
Transcription Factor Test
Another important part of our system is the transcription factor on the intracellular domain. After viewing information of different transcription factors in previous parts, we finally decided to use the advanced tTA as our transcription factor, together with a pTight promotor.
We first co-transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding tTA with an EGFP protein and another plasmid with pTight promotor and a mCherry reporter, and observed both strong green and red fluorescence after 48 hours of expression (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Transcription Factor Test. (a) Fluorescent images of transfected cell with pTight-mCherry (-) and tTA-EGFP and pTight-mCherry (+). Photos were taken 48 h after transfection. (b) Relative fluorescence intensity in conditions above.
Then, for further tests of the whole system, we constructed stable cell lines of both HEK293T and HeLa, with downstream plasmid of pTight and mCherry.
Now that we had successfully tested both sections of STEP system and built stable cell lines, we were able to carry out further experiments concerning the whole system.
Overall Tests
TC/PC Ratio
To see if the whole STEP system works we need to co-transfect the two plasmids encoding TC and PC chains. We want to find a best TC/PC ratio and total quantity of transfection.
At the beginning we transfected HEK293T cells with different TC/PC ratio. We used VEGF-STEP as an example"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," are a major source of disability and high cost for healthcare systems worldwide, not to mention pain, misery and the continual threat of infection for the affected individual. Referred to as a “snowballing threat to public health”, chronic wound sufferers have been aptly described as “carriers of a silent epidemic”, who are often already diagnosed with “highly branded” diseases including diabetes and obesity [1] . In the current context of these conditions twinned with an aging population, the trend in chronic wounds is set only to rise. We decided to approach this clinical problem using Staphylococcus aureus biofilm as a model. Since this organism is part of our skin flora, it benefits from easy access to broken skin and easily becomes established in non-healing wounds; it is suggested that S. aureus is present in more than 90% of all chronic wounds [2] .
A Look Beyond
In addition, questions on a pressing global public health threat are raised by our project: antimicrobial resistance.  It is well established that bacterial biofilms, fostered by the chronic wound environment, protect bacteria from both antibiotics and an individual’s immune system, generating the perfect backdrop for increasing drug resistance [1] . We could not fail to acknowledge the intrinsic link between this world issue and our project plan and as such made it the focus of our final Human Practices and Safety theme.
Biofilm
With both chronic wounds and the variety of bacterial resistance mechanisms in our minds, we were concerned about using traditional bactericidal approaches to aid chronic wound healing, which often stumble into one of two pitfalls:
a largely unspecific effect which risks to further aggravate the wound [3]
a limited efficacy on chronic wounds from the very start and / or decreasing efficacy during the course of the treatment [4]
So instead, iGEM Stockholm decided to focus on a prominent feature of many chronic wounds – the biofilm. Biofilms are complex extracellular structures generated by a variety of bacteria as a self-protection mechanism and are often increased in response to stress such as antibiotic treatment [5] .  They are essential in supporting bacteria when they adopt a ‘sessile’ lifestyle in the form of chronic colonization; they interfere with inflammation meant to rid the wound of bacteria, help the bacteria attach and detach from the wound surface as the infection progresses, and have been found to contribute to quicker development of antibiotic resistance [6] [7] . In particular the biofilms' contribution to antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly problematic and inspired a large proportion of our work in Human Practices .
The components of biofilms differ among bacterial species, but many of"

All of the lanes for the extraction that includes the His-tag show bands at that are a similar size compared to the normal beta-lactamse extraction which is expected as the gene is 927-bp in size. Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR set. No contamination is observed in the NTCs (no template controls). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.

Week 11: July 8 - July 12
Our team reviewed primers design for our Golden Gate Assembly with emphasis on ensuring proper ligation of our products. This involved matching melting temperatures, ensuring there were no palindromic sequences, and considering the other requirements involved. Primer design is integral to our overall project since we must successfully use Golden Gate Assembly to synthesize our parts. Much of our time has been spent towards this goal.
Also, Ferritin gene sequences have arrived. We have transformed, MiniPrepped and ready as a template for the Golden Gate primers.
Also received this week were the redesigned primers for extracting beta-lactamase from the pSB1A3 plasmid. These primers were used in three combinations to produce the beta-lactamase gene by itself, the beta-lactamase gene with a His-tag at the end and a beta-lactamase gene with a flexible glycine linker ( BBa_K157013 ) fused to the N-terminus of the protein. The gels of these PCRs indicated that the experiment was successful (Figures 6, 7).  These products were PCR purified in order to be used for constructions.

“Don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened!” – Dr. Seuss
Writing this on the night of the wiki-freeze sure brings a lot of thoughts – what are we supposed  to do with our spare time now? What else could you get E. coli to produce? WHAT ARE WE GOING  TO DO IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLD NOW?
Well, we do not know the answers but one thing is certain: Our iGEM project, working in the lab,  getting to know each other and work together – preparing for Boston – the whole process has  been a great experience in every thinkable way. We are grateful and will like to thank everyone  who has helped and everyone who have put up with our immense mood swings and non-existing  circadian rhythm.
We now look forward to present our project at the Giant Jamboree and hearing about all the other iGEM projects.
Thank you for reading our team wiki – we hope you enjoyed the tour!
