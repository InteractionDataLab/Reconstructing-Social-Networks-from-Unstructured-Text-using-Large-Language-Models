OUR HP WITH TEAM NKU iGEM
Tianjin & NKU
On the day we visited professor Cunjiang Song, we conduct a human practice with team Nankai iGEM. We visited team Nankai’s laboratory in Nankai university. They introduced to us about the general situation of them. We discussed with their members about project affairs about life in the laboratory. We took a photo together finally. We are delighted to communicate with members of NKU iGEM. We hope that our rapport and friendship would last forever!

OUR HP With TEAM NJU iGEM
Rhodococcus jostii RHA1
We found that Rhodococcus can degrade intermediate product TPA efficiently. Thus we got in touch with Prof. Aijun Liao with the help of iGEM NJU. He presented us the Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 which helps us a lot. We are grateful to what he has done. Here are the screenshot pictures of the online chatting records. (We use the common social network QQ to communicate, Xu represented our team and Du reprensented Team HFUT)
Du： Hi！
Xu： Hi!
Du: I’m Shuangshuang Du of team Nanjing_China from Nanjing University.
Xu： I’m a member of iGEM_Tianjin. Our team would like to communicate with you.
Du: Sure.
Du: By what means?
Xu: We intend to biodegrade PET using yeasts. How about your project?
Du: Photobiological hydrogen production.
We both are environmental projects!
Xu: Yes. Then we should have plenty of common topics. What strains do you use?
Du: We use Escherichia coli.
Xu: We use yeasts, but the other day when we consulted theses, we found that Rhodococcus might meet some of our needs.

1. Production of hirudin
For this simulation, we wanted to know how fast a cell-free system can produce hirudin. This is very important for us to determine if our system will be able to prevent blood coagulation. Blood clots in 5-10 minutes when taken out of the body, so our system will need to produce enough hirudin in less than that time.
To determine the production rate, we measured the time it takes to produce a threshold level of hirudin. We decided to use 1.3 μM of hirudin as the amount needed to prevent blood coagulation. (Mark"
Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"oweapons. Even a fully replication potent AAV will depend on the coninfection of a helpervirus and is therefore not suitable for a fast propagation in an population. Additional to this point we concentrated our project on the retargeting of the virus - means to make the broad tropismn more narrow and to decrease the transduction efficiency in the most cases. This modification is usually mainly required for medical purposes. Also we did neither investigate possibilities to shield the vector from the immune system of potential host nor ways to bypass an existing immunity.
Concluding all factors mentioned above, we need to consider the possibility that a person, organization or state could misuse the fast-advancing life sciences for biological warfare. The possibilities and the simplicity of dual-use research misuse will become more and easier the faster the scientific progress advances.
Therefore it is important to minimize these potential risks before they become reality. This is not only the task of a designated group but a moral obligation for scientists, politicians and everybody related to dual-use research. Especially scientists have to contribute to and lead the continuing discussion on this topic because they are able to estimate how aspects of their research fields might be misused.

Have you heard the legend of 'The Wolfman'? They're ordinary man at daytime, but suddenly transform into a ferocious wolf in the full-moon night. Our project aim to imitate the character of Wolfman, more specifically, designing two types of E.coli that helps each other to survive at daytime, whereas competing at full moon night. In order to create the “Wolf coli”, we introduced "" red-light-dependent gene expression network""[1] and ""band-detect network""[2] into one cell, and combined these networks with the Artificial Cooperation System (Fig. 4-3). We characterized new series of OmpC promoter, and LacIM1 which are crucial"

Improvements and testing of existing biobricks
BBa_K283030 and BBa_I712074
We have placed an T7 promoter BBa_I712074 upstream of the RBS-cheZ BBa_K283030 system making it a functional biobrick for inducible expression in an E. coli host harboring the lambda DE3 lysogen.  We have tested this biobrick for functionality and confirmed that it works as expected.
BBa_K398108
Based on the data displayed here , we have determined the conditions in which bacteria display the most tumbling. Tumbling is a  chemotactic  response to environmental conditions that signifies a positive bacterial response. At a salt concentration of 0.5 M, an average of ~10% of bacteria were consistently tumbling. There is a clear bell-curve trend of induced tumbling in E. coli that contain the BBa_K398108 salt resistance with optimal conditions at 0.5M NaCl.
This is a congruent with the data found by the TU Delft iGEM 2010 team. A peak growth rate can be observed at 0.5 M NaCl, signifying positive cellular conditions. Our data also suggests optimal NaCl/environmental conditions at this concentration.

We brought up the plummeting costs of equipment, from which they stated that lowering costs would undoubtedly expand accessibility to these projects; however, they emphasized that education was nonetheless an essential piece of the puzzle. The UCLA team transitioned to talking about what drove them to join in on the iGEM experience, and described how excited they felt to have the autonomy and opportunity to engage in these projects. They described iGEM as an entry point for young scientists and engineers who are able to greatly benefit from taking these projects into their own hands, and guiding the projects with their own vision. When asked if they would ever consider pioneering a DIY lab of their own, they admitted that only a short time ago they would have never dreamed of tackling such a challenge. Following their experience with iGEM, however, they feel they have been endowed with the confidence and skillset to take on ambitious goals such as those. Following this interview with the UCLA iGEM team, our team was gratified to witness the how the iGEM competition is positively shaping the ambitions and confidence of its participants, and how expanded accessibility to synthetic biology projects is allowing those ambitions to come to fruition."

Moreover, this will lead to improvement of the popularity of iGEM as well as the social recognition of biological investigations, but, most importantly, to the promotion of Science and Communication. In addition, it becomes a contribution beyond the scientific community, reaching to the general public.

we finally received the strains sent to us by Prof. Bagdasarian. Beginning of next week we should also receive those from Prof. Derbyshire.
this means we have to do mini(or maxi)-preps to get the plasmids from which we can amplify the oriT and the helper plasmids (RP1/4, pUB307 if we need this).
We received the strains from Prof. Derbyshire. He sent us pUB307, RSF1010, pED350, pED361, pED369 and pED374.
we received two plates with bacteria containing pUB307. We picked 4 colonies and inoculated them in   with canamycin.
we received the glycerol stocks of the cI from the registry and inoculated these for a maxiprep in LB with ampicilin.

Cellulose Synthase (Cesa) Project
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and is incredibly valuable for multiple uses including paper, cellophane, and biofuel. Although cellulose in everywhere, we are still limited by the amount of production by the plants and constantly use more. The goal of our experiment is to introduce a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase complex into the primary cell wall to ultimately increase the production of cellulose in plants. Our hope is that if we use a primary cell wall promoter followed by secondary CesA’s (Cellulose Synthases) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we can produce more cellulose and create stronger plants.

Introduction
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and is incredibly valuable for multiple uses including paper, cellophane, and biofuel. Although cellulose in everywhere, we are still limited by the amount of production by the plants and constantly use more. The goal of our experiment is to introduce a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase complex into the primary cell wall to ultimately increase the production of cellulose in plants. Our hope is that if we use a primary cell wall promoter followed by secondary CesA’s (Cellulose Synthases) in Arabidopsis thaliana, we can produce more cellulose and create stronger plants.
Background
Cellulose is produced in both the primary and secondary plant cell walls. Research has shown that secondary cellulose synthase (CesA) complexes produce greater quantities of cellulose than those located in the primary cell wall. (1) Additionally, research indicates the possibility of a hybrid plant cell wall through the ability to exchange promoters for cellulose synthase genes. An intricate protein complex in nature, research of cellulose synthase is continually ongoing. Due to the limited amount of definitive information known about the complex, the synthesis of a hybrid plant cell wall would provide verification of standing hypotheses and valuable novel information.
(1) http://mplant.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/2/199.full
Method
To assemble our construct, we isolated the CesA 1 Promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana by extracting the genomic DNA and using PCR amplification. The CesA 4, 7, and 8 genes were obtained from cDNA via the Arabidopsis Biological"

CryptoGErM must take into account, those three different guidelines and regulations to ensure that the Bacillus subtilis spores containing the encrypted information can be sent freely nationally and internationally.
Consulting national and international regulations, we ensure that CryptoGErM obeys the legal standards for the shipping of GMOs
According to the guidelines from the World Health Organization, the Bacillus subtilis spores used in CrytpoGErM are classified in Class 9 and assigned to UN 3245 since they “do not meet the requirements of infectious substances but are capable of altering animals, plants or microbiological substances in a way which is not normally the result of natural reproduction”
“Bacillus subtilis spores used in CryptoGErM are assigned to UN 3245 for their shipping”
GMOs assigned to UN 3245 must be shipped by following the Packing Instruction P904 [6] . This instruction states the requirements for the container used in the shipping of GMOs:
An inner package: Primary receptacle and secondary packaging, must be leakproof for liquids or siftproof for solids. In case that the sample is liquid, absorbent material must be placed between the first and secondary packaging
An outer packaging shall: Strong enough for its capacity, mass and intended use
These requirements are explained graphically in Figure 1 from the “Guide to Shipping Biological Materials” [7] document from the North Carolina University (NCSU). Please refer to this document for graphical consultant of the shipping
However, CryptoGErM found out that the labelling in the transatlantic shipping is not common since the legislations for the transboundary shipping are rather different between countries in America and those in the European Union.
This is particularly true for the Parties and Nonparties of the Cartagena Protocol, whose regulations and legislations are rather different. In order to solve problems that might occur between those parties, it is stated in the Cartagena Protocol that “Parties may enter into bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements to avoid potential conflicts”
We sent the spores of Bacillus subtilis with the encrypted message to the Wageningen UR Team and iGEM TU Eindhoven through the facilities of the University of Groningen to ensure a secure and safe shipping.

You can find more economical information about WatsOn and the project on our Economical View page.
For building our WatsOn we used some tools that are not included in the list of necessary components because we assume that they are already available. We used a soldering iron to solder the resistors to the LEDs and fix the headers on the mount of the LEDs. For building electrical circuits our multimeter was very helpful. Furthermore, we applied special glue for plastic to hold the acrylic glass in place. All other components were fixed with tape or hot glue which is versatile and can be removed quickly during alignment of components.

Phase 1, Growing up your cells:
In our system, colanic acid is only produced during the utilization of a secondary carbon source. For this reason we must use minimal media for this assay such that we are able to define the carbon source used.
DAY 1:
AM:
M9 Minimal Media Preparation:
Measure out the following reagents and dissolve them in 1000ml of sterile H20:
M9 Minimal Salts = 11.28g
Secondary carbon source (as determined by the Top Ten cell growth assay) = 4.0g
Casamino acids = 2g
Leave out for autoclaving (before 12:30)
PM:
Collect media from autoclave (at 5pm)
M9 Minimal Media Innoculation:
Add 4.0g of the filter sterilised secondary carbon source as well as 0.5g of filter sterilised magnesium sulphate. Filtering should be done using a Minisart® 0.20µm syringe filter.
Spit the media between two 500ml autoclaved flasks.
Innoculate one of the flasks of M9 Minimal Media with 7ml of Top Ten starter culture carrying the encapsulation construct. Innoculate the second flask of M9 Minimal Media with 7ml of Top Ten starter culture not transformed with the encapsulation construct to serve as a control. Incubate both flasks at 28°C in a shaking incubator.
Phase 2, Quantifying Colanic Acid Production:
In brief, colanic acid production can be quantified from two pieces of information: the packed cell volume and the OD of a culture.
DAY 2:
AM:
After 24 hours of incubation, pippette 1ml of culture from each of the two flasks into PCV tubes.
Spin the PCV tube at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and record the volume of the pellet.
Take another 1ml sample from each culture and measure the OD at 600nm.
Divide the PCVs by the OD and subtract the value obtained for the controls from the value obtained from the transformed cells. This gives the average volume of colanic acid produced per cell.
Phase 3, Quantifying the protective effect of colanic acid:
This stage of the assay works on the principle that acid will lyse cells resulting the the denaturation of"

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Human_-_-_TEXT.html," some new technology with uncertain hazard.
Another source of worry is remedial possibility. Genetic pollution may endanger the whole system. Since we know little about its detailed risks, and at the same time we know the possibility of great pollution can't be ignored, remedial possibility turns to be another main source of worry.
So far, transgenic technology has little application in industry and commercial fields. For this reason, the weight of values of industrial use wide range and public emphasis are relatively small.
In the table, the grade of genetic pollution on four perspectives is within the range of 0 to 10.
Figure 8. Risk evaluation result of genetic pollution (From TJU iGEM team 2012)
Conclusion
An overall risk evaluation system of the genetic pollution is established and used to evaluate the relative seriousness of this problem. We can also use this system to evaluate the seriousness of genetic pollution at different times and to predict the development tendency of this problem.
Influence on public attitude towards genetic pollution
Background and Problem
For a social problem, it will call for support from different social power. At least, there should be little barriers from various social groups. What is more, the society should pay enough attention to the newly occurred genetic pollution, and what factor has more influence on the public attention towards the genetic pollution is unquestionably urgent and important. Consequently, we designed a model to quantitatively analyze the problem. The source data of the model are derived from the questionnaire.
Another problem that still exists is that all the probable factors that might impact the public attitude are complex and complicated that make our analysis more difficult to analysis with order. So the other task for us is to classify the factors to make sure the factors with certain primary character is classified into one group.
Classification method and Evaluation system
In searching for factors in various perspectives and fields that might impact the public attitude towards the genetic pollution problem, we have searched many articles and record all the potential factors, after integration we have achieved 26 factors that will potentially impact the public attitude and attention towards genetic pollution.
First of all, we distributed questionnaires towards the society which contains primarily four kinds of groups:
Governmental leaders,
Business decision makers,
General social public,
Researcher.
In the questionnaire we let them to grade the importance of the 26 potential factors on public attitudes.
Secondly, we collect these data and use the cluster analysis to analyze these factors’ grade from all the survey respondents. The principle component analysis can sep-arate these 26 factors into some groups. We can also find some inherent connections amount these factors within the same group and consequently find the significance of each"

Making agar plates
Pouring normal LB + agar plates (with optional antibiotic)
Preparing the LB+agar powder
Mix the contents below to prepare the agar powder required to make 10L of agar solution
100gr tryptoptan
50gr yeast extract
50gr NaCl
150 gr agar
Mix the content very well before using the mixed powder
Preparing the LB+agar solution
To prepare 1L of LB+agar solution:
Put 500 ml of distilled water into a measuring cylinder then transfer to a clean 1000ml flask
Put 400ml of distilled water to a measuring cylinder and then transfer this to another 1000ml flask. To this flask add 35 gr of LB+agar powder. After mixing sufficiently transfer the LB+agar solution into the measuring cylinder and add distilled water until a total volume of 500ml has been reached.
You should now have two 1000ml flasks - one conatining 500ml of distilled water and the other containing 500ml of LB+agar solution
Add 10ul of antifoam to LB+agar flask
Seal the flask with some tin foil and place autoclaving tape on it. Make sure the flasks are correctly labelled with date, substance within flask and lab.
Put the flasks in the autoclaver for half an hour
Once the flasks have had time to cool for a few mins, carefully place the flask with LB+agar into 55C-60C water bath.
Also, put the flask containing distilled water into the sink to cool it down - only once it is cool enough to transfer. 'This means that the water flask should cool down more rapidly than the LB"

Isolation of PtNTT2 from the Inner Membrane
For further analysis of PtNTT2 the isolation of the transporter from the cell was attempted. This task proved to be challenging, given that PtNTT2 comprises ten transmembrane domains and is therefore highly hydrophobic. For that reason, several different methods and procedures were tested to achieve the best results.    The first two attempts were based on the isolation of the periplasmic protein fraction through cold osmotic shock and fast cell lysis followed by analysis via SDS PAGE. Unsurprisingly, both methods did not lead to the desired results, since not bands for PtNTT2 could be observed. Figure (13) shows the SDS PAGE of the samples prepared using the fast cell lysis for SDS PAGE.
Figure (13): SDS-PAGE of the GFP-fusion constructs of PtNTT2
The cells were prepared using the fast cell lysis for SDS PAGE protocol. E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Unsurprisingly, no thick band can be observed around 90.3 kDa, which would be the size of PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP. No bands can be observed for the other PtNTT2 variants.
A second gel was used for a western blot using an anti-GFP antibody. The result is shown in figure (14).
Figure (14): Western Blot of the samples prepared using the fast cell lysis for SDS PAGE protocol.
An anti-GFP antibody was used for the detection of PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP variants. E . coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 were used as negative controls. Much unspecific binding of the anti-GFP antibody could be observed, which is not surprising given that the entire proteome of the cells was analyzed. Thick band can be observed for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP, PtNTT2(66-575)-cMyc-GFP, PtNTT2(31-575)-cMyc-GFP and PtNTT2(pelB)-cMyc-GFP around 35 kDa. This indicates that only the cMyc-GFP linker was detected and that the linker might be cleaved of from PtNTT2 due to the high difference in hydrophobicity.

We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters. Based on these studies, we can make the better plan, central or prediction in the experiments.
We consider the tubulin length is the function of time, assembling rate, disaggregation and hydrolysis rate. According to the literature, there are some relationships between these promoters.
Details of Original Differential Equation Model
a. - Model Assumption
We only consider tree main phenomenon in the solution: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.
There are three types of dimers, Taxol-dimer, GTP-dimer and GDP-dimer. Only Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer, no matter they are dissociative or already fixed on the filament, can aggregate new Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer.
Especially, the difference between Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer is that new fixed aggregation Taxol-dimer will not disaggregate and become dissociative again.
According to literature [2] , every Taxol-dimer and GTP-dimer may hydrolyze into GDP-dimer, which can no longer combine new dimers and growth.
b. - Parameter specification
c. - The explanation of the process
As we discussed in the modeling theory, we only consider three main phenomena: disaggregation, aggregation and hydrolysis.
Now we consider how these filaments growth specifically. At first, initial \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are added in the solution. Then they aggregate into filaments forms, including \(G_{11}\), \(G_{21}\), \(G_{12}\), \(G_{22}\)(the meaning of these parameters are specified in table above).  \(G_{11}\) and \(G_{21}\) can become \(G_{12}\) and \(G_{22}\) if new dimers are aggregated at the endpoint. Also \(G_{11}\)and \(G_{21}\) can disaggregate into the solution and become dissociative dimers (\(T_1\) and \(T_2\) again. If all the GTP-dimers at the endpoint become the GDP-dimers or there is not enough \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the solution, the growing process is stop.
The flow chart of this process can be illustrated as follow:
According to the flow chart, we can get the ODE equations as follow.
$\dot{T_1}=k_1 G_{11}-r_1(G_{11}+G_{21})$

Interview with UBC President
Clear science communication is essential and becomes even more important when it comes to new areas of research. With unfamiliar content, this can pose a significant challenge when educating people from a wide range of educational backgrounds, perspectives, and different levels of prior knowledge.
This year, one audience we wanted to connect with specifically were individuals who are highly educated but not knowledgeable in synthetic biology. As synthetic biology has the  potential to draw from and influence many areas of research, it is imperative to start an open, multi-disciplinary conversation about future collaborations and to address different concerns.
We were fortunate enough to conduct an in-person interview with the 15th President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of British Columbia, Professor Santa J. Ono.
Professor Ono obtained his PhD in Experimental Medicine and worked a professor of medicine and biology before stepping into his role as the University’s president. With aid from his biological background, Ono spoke elegantly about synthetic biology and our team’s aGrow project.
An abridged version of the interview is shown below and a full version of the interview can be found here.

04/02 Wednesday - Cultivating E. coli Nissle 1917
LB plates were produced without antibiotic. Therefore 10 ml MQ-H2O were sterile filtered in 15 ml falcon tube. 1 capsule Mutaflor 331800 was solved in the sterile water.                  The E. coli Nissle solution was incubated at 37°C and 200 rpm for 1 h and crossed out at 4 plates to get different dilution of cells.

For extraction of the genomic DNA of E. coli Nissle, 2 E. coli colonies were picked from LB plate (dilution 1:103) and used for inoculation of 6 ml LB precultures. These were grown over night at 37°C and 200 rpm.
04/04 Friday - Genomic DNA extraction of ECN - second step
For preparation of the genomic DNA 1 ml of each preculture was taken and a genomic extraction performed using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification Kit. See instructions of the purification Kit by Promega. Genomic DNA was stored at 12°C in fridge.              As E. coli Nissle is a natural organism without resistence genes both precultures were streaked out on LB, LB+KAN and LB+AMP. All plates were incubated over the weekend at 37°C.              DNA concentration was measured by 260 nm using Goldi. DNA was diluted 1:40 in a UV cuvette and DNA absorption measured at 260/28 nm in goldi.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

(1) As the  increase of tetracycline, the selection pressure increased and the growth rate  of strains decreased.
(2) With  increased selection pressure, it could be observed that within time window of  15h, in some selection pressure condition (tetracycline concentration) strains  with higher tryptophan productivity showed much higher growth rate, while the growth  of tryptophan non producer trp000 nearly inhibited by high concentration of  tetracycline.

Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," bands. The 90 kDa band likely corresponds to the full-sized CR2 Gag-Prot-RT. We believe that Band 2 (75 kDa) and Band 3 (50 kDa) are degradation products of the full-sized construct corresponding to CR2 Gag-Prot and CR2 Gag, respectively. Data from the mass spec will provide us with the cleavage sites necessary to accurately produce future constructs of the mature Gag and mature protease.
Results and Discussion: To determine protease cleavage sites, the ~100 kDa, ~75 kDa, and ~50 kDa bands representing the full polyprotein (CR2 Gag-Protease-RT ~90 kDa), the partial polyprotein (CR2 Gag-Protease ~62-77 kDa), and the full gag (~52-54 kDa) respectively were extracted from three separate gels of cells induced at 35℃ selected by Vishal Negi and Ryan Shontell. Selection was based off of resolution of the gel and band intensity (Fig. 1). Samples were sent to the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility on June 1, 2018, and received by the facility on June 5, 2018. Results were obtained on June 29, 2018. We were notified that the samples were contaminated and contained fragments from all three bands. However, filtering allowed for the determination of the most relevant fragments for each sample.
Tryptic fragments for each band were mapped on to the CR2 Gag-Protease-RT GenScript construct using fragment data copied from the Taplin results page into an Excel sheet and sorted by position. The 100 kDa fragments covered 90.04 kDa, the 75 kDa fragments covered 56.76 kDa, and the 50 kDa fragments covered 47.88 kDa of the full construct. These fragments confirmed a protease cleavage site downstream of the nucleocapsid in the form of an 18 bp gap between the end of the last 50 kDa fragment (6 bp upstream of the 3’ end of the CCHC Zinc Finger domain) and the beginning of the next 75 kDa and 100 kDa fragments (12bp after the 3’ end of the CCHC Zinc Finger). The second cleavage site between the protease and reverse transcriptase domains could not be identified as the 75 kDa fragments did not exceed 56.76 kDa, with the most upstream protease cut site observed being located well within the protease domain"

We collaborated with two iGEM teams this season: (1) Team WPI and (2) Team BostonU_HW .
1) We set up an experimental methods collaboration with Team WPI. At the first New England iGEM Meetup in June, WPI discussed their project using CRISPR to perform point mutations in RNA. They planned to qualitatively measure fluorescence using a microscope because it was what they had access to. We realized that they could benefit from using a flow cytometer as a quantitative method and offered them access to our institution’s own flow cytometers. They accepted our invitation and visited our lab. We helped them run their cells through our Fortessa flow cytometer and collect and analyze the data. Together we set out to quantify their mutant ACG GFP and their wild type GFP function’s in comparison to an eGFP. They also used our flow cytometer to compare the results of their microscope image analyzer. To thank us, they offered to help us analyze the fluorescence of our constructs using their microscope for additional validation. The results of this can be seen on our Proof of Concept Page. The microscopy results corroborated out flow cytometry data.
2) We set up a Human Practices collaboration with our sister team, BostonU_HW (hardware special track team). Both of our teams were interested in understanding and engaging fellow researchers in intellectual property paradigms in synthetic biology . Our teams created a new blog called “Who Owns What” and co-wrote several blog posts to share with the wider synthetic biology community.
For more information look at our Collaborations page.
3. Human Practices: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights.  Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.  Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
We completed several distinct Human Practices projects.
One major topic that we investigated was about intellectual property in synthetic biology. Our team attended the Mammalian Synthetic Biology Workshop in June, which concluded with a panel about intellectual property (IP). We were surprised that this module had perhaps twenty percent attendance as other modules in the workshop"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," IDT codon optimisation to get the DNA sequence. This software gives the DNA sequence when you enter the amino acids. This programme also optimises the DNA sequence for expression in E. coli (or whichever bacteria species you are wanting to express your proteins of interest in). This is an important step, for which I will now describe the biochemistry.
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 amino acids and each is coded for by three DNA bases, which are called codons. As there are 4 different nucleotides (A, T, C, G), there are 64 different possible codons. With only 20 amino acids, this means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon. For example, AGA, AGG, AGT and ACG all code for the amino acid serine. The relative frequency of codon use vaires widely depending on the organism and organelle. For example, AGA is the most commonly used codon for serine in E. coli. When taking the amino acid sequence of the protein you want to express in E. coli, the codon optimisation software gives the DNA sequence using the codons that are most commonly used by E. coli. This is important to avoid very slow or incorrect protein synthesis.
When you have the codon optimised DNA sequences, restriction enzymes are then used to cut and stick the sequences and plasmids. These enzymes cut at specific sequences of DNA called restriction sites and allow us to stick our pieces of DNA together. iGEM specifies certain restriction sites at the start and end of DNA sequences so that any sequences can be cut and stuck together using only a few restriction enzymes. If the restriction enzyme sites were present within any of the DNA sequences (and not only within the prefixes and suffixes) then the restriction enzymes would cut within and mix up all the sequences, rendering them useless. Before using restriction enzymes, it is therefore crucial to check all of the DNA sequences for any disallowed restriction enzyme sites.
For example, the DNA sequence where the EcoRI restriction enzyme cuts is GAATTC. This sequence is present in the DNA sequence for the protein Dispersin B, meaning that EcoRI would cut within the coding sequence, leading to a shortened amino acid sequence and a non-functional protein. With this in mind, it is necessary to change the codon to alter the restriction site whilst at the same time ensuring that the same amino acid is coded for (a different amino acid means an incorrect protein). GAA codes for glutamic acid but so does GAG; thus"

Today’s result was clear: after trying to transform for three times now, we found out that E. coli RR1 suffered a mutation that made it resistant to chloramphenicol, selectable marker from the pSB1C3. We lost time and lots of microliters of the diluted DNA from 2013 Parts kit! We lost a precious amount of time but the result was gratifying.
After having this sorted out, we discussed the best method to make DH5α chemical competent.  We decided to use the methods given by Professor Spartaco.
We made a pre-inoculum in liquid LB media!

ROUND 2
We ran a 1.5% agarose gel @60V for the following:
FCY2p
FCY2utr
Gal 1/10p
Results:
As expected, only FCY2p worked. We're still trying to optimize conditions for FCY2utr and Gal 1/10p.
8/01/2011
Purpose: Run an analytic gel for the promoters and UTRs made on 7/29. Extract successful P/U. Try to amplify more.
Procedure:
ROUND 1
We ran a 1.5% agarose gel @70V for the following (PCR'd at annealing temperature 48C):
ARD1utr
RPL24Autr
RPS8utr
TDH3utr
RPS2utr
Results:
Unfortunately, no bands appeared. Suggested annealing temperature might be too low.
ROUND 2
We made more FCY2p, KRE9utr, PRY1p, HH01utr to use for extraction (protocol on wiki). However, we chose not to extract FCY2p yet because since it's bigger (length), more would be needed for a higher DNA concentration. ~40µl extracted: 550mg KRE9utr, 310mg PRY1p, 570mg HH01utr. 1 gel volume of isopropanol was added to KRE9utr and HH01utr since protocol suggests for x<500bp to increase DNA concentration. Digested three samples using same procedure as other digestions. Stored at -20C.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," over other compartments, including it being able to import fully folded proteins and not being essential in yeast under optimal growth conditions. Our project’s aim is to create a toolbox for manipulating and creating customizable peroxisomes as a first step towards synthetic organelles.
By modifying the import machinery of yeast peroxisomes only selected proteins will be imported into the peroxisomes leaving the researcher in full control over the content of the peroxisomal lumen. Furthermore our toolbox will include a secretion mechanism for the synthesized products, various intra-compartmental sensors, modules for the integration of proteins into the peroxisome membrane, as well as optogenetic control for some of these parts for a more precise spatiotemporal control.
As a proof of concept for the functionality of the toolbox and the customizable compartment two metabolic pathways will be integrated into the altered peroxisome: (i) Violacein biosynthesis and (ii) nootkatone biosynthesis. Violacein, a bisindole formed by condensation of two tryptophan molecules, is a violet pigment and thus easy to quantify in the cell. Nootkatone on the other side is a natural compound found inside the peel of the grapefruit, which gives it its characteristic taste and smell. In addition, nootkatone is a natural mosquito and tick repellent that is already being commercially used and industrially manufactured. Unfortunately, the production costs are extremely high. Furthermore, the production of nootkatone inside yeast is challenging as it is toxic for it and thus, the production efficiency is rather low. A successful implementation of the synthetic compartment will show increased yields in the production of these compounds and showcase the potential of this approach for similar future applications.
Cloning strategies and the Yeast Toolbox for Multipart-Assembly
While describing our cloning strategies we mentioned several levels, which stand for different stages of our plasmids. They are further described in the work of J.M. Dueber and colleagues, who designed the well established yeast toolkit we used in this project (Dueber) .  The toolkit offers the possibility to design plasmids with desired antibiotic resistances, promoters as well as terminators from standardized parts. It also provides fluorescence proteins, protein-tags and many more useful components as part plasmids. These part plasmids are distinguished in different part types due to their specific overhangs to ensure their combination in the correct order (e.g. promoter - gene of interest - terminator) all in a versatile one-pot Golden Gate reaction without time-consuming conventional cloning steps.

The GG products were transformed into chemically competent Top 10 cells and plated on amp-plates.
On the next day each plate revealed many single colonies. Two colonies of each plate were picked and cultivated in 4 ml 2xYT with carbenicillin overnight. A glycerol stock (25 %) was prepared and the remaining 3 ml of the overnight culture was purified with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit.
Protein_Interaction
Week 36: After some weeks of doing research to find a fitting protein to evolve in protein-interaction(PI)-context, one decided to evolve split variants of T7RNAP and dCas9 to reassemble more efficiently. Both of them are commonly used proteins in biotechnological context and thereby characterized well. Protein structures of the proteins are accessible and basic literature is available. Nevertheless, split variants have not been evolved to reassemble better, yet. Four matching split sizes for T7 RNAP and one for dCas9 were chosen and in consequence first primers have been designed to produce the respective APs and SPs. Primers were tested for primer-dimerization and secondary structures. Primer products will be fused using GoldenGate cloning based on BsaI and BsmBI restriction sites in primer extensions.

OVERVIEW
Diphtheria is becoming a prominent issue in Indonesia as its incidence is increasing recently. It also causes various complications, leading to morbidity and mortality. We realized the urgency of fast, reliable, and cheap early detection method for diphtheria infection as one of means necessary for its eradication. Therefore, we created a chimeric between native Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor and human HB-EGF receptor so the bacterium may recognize diphtheria toxin. Moreover, we combined CheA and CheY in E. coli chemotaxis system with LuxAB and eYFP, respectively. When in contact, LuxAB and eYFP create resonance energy transfer system in which LuxAB gives its emission to eYFP. Without diphtheria toxin, CheA will be in phosphorylated state, allowing interaction with CheY and energy transfer, resulting in yellow color. Toxin binding into chimeric receptor will inhibit CheA phosphorylation, hindering interaction with CheY and energy transfer, resulting in blue color (i.e. LuxAB native color).
Pathogenesis of Diphtheria: How Does Corynebacterium diphtheriae Cause the Disease?
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive rod bacterium that causes diphtheria. It produces exotoxin with two fragments (AB toxin). Fragment B facilitates toxin internalization within host cell via endocytosis upon binding HB-EGF receptor,while fragment A catalyzes modification of ribosomal elongation factor-2; therefore, it suppresses protein synthesis
Tar-mediated Chemotaxis System in Escherichia coli
In E. coli, chemotaxis mediated by methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) has been widely studied. MCPs are transmembrane chemoreceptors with periplasmic ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic signaling domain. To date, four different E. coli MCPs have been identified: Tar, Tsr, Trg and Tap chemoreceptors.
Tar chemoreceptor mediates E. coli movement towards aspartate and maltose (attractant molecules). It undergoes conformational change"

The primers we use to amplify glnA gene         contain restriction sites of HindIII and PstI. We digested the gene with the two restriction enzymes and then ligased into the pSB1C3 vector which is the same as before. After constructing the plasmid, we transformed it into E. coli DH5α for construction. Afterward, transformed the plasmid into E. coli MG1655 for protein expression.

This protein is conserved in many bacterial strains as the capacity of swimming given by the flagellum confers a great selective advantage.
Metal Biosorption Capacity
It has been demonstrated that Flagellin has the ability to adsorb precious metal on its surface such as platinum, palladium gold [2] [3] and this was important for our project Highway to platinum
Immune response capacity
The propensity of the immune response to flagellin may be explained by two facts:
Flagellin is an extremely abundant protein in flagellated bacteria.
There exists a specific innate immune receptor that recognizes flagellin, Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). [4]
BBa_K1941010  : CsgA Escherichia coli producer
CsgA is the major structural subunit of the curli fimbriae.  Curli fibers are involved in adhesion to surfaces, cell aggregation, and biofilm formation [5] . Curli also mediate host cell adhesion and invasion, and they are potent inducers of the host inflammatory response. The biobrick contains a strong promotor.

At the basis of nascent blebs, where the outer membrane is non-flat, the simple diffusion (ie Brownian motion) of doubly-anchored Tol/Pal molecules leads to their accumulation. ( Details and figure 2)
Rings of accumulated Tol/Pal at the basis of nascent blebs tend to constrict: vesiculation happens. This again simply results from plain Brownian motion on non-flat surfaces. ( Details )
Figure1: Initial formation of small blebs resulting from intra- and extra-cellular osmotic pressures differences combined with non-perfectly uniform distribution of Tol/Pal complexes acting like press studs between the internal membrane and the outer membrane.
Figure2: the simple diffusion of proteins on a non-flat surface leads to their accumulation at region of negative curvature (as it is the case at the basis of blebs).
Improving the quality of the signal sent
In order to obtain a good synchronization between the maximal production rate of vesicles and the maximal concentration of proteins to encapsulate, we have to introduce a delay between the initiation of the synthesis of the proteins to encapsulate and the initiation of the synthesis of the truncated Tol protein that causes vesicle formation. We showed that this delay can be conveniently implemented by using a transcriptional cascade. More details here
Figure 4: Plot showing that vesiculation happens only when the protein to encapsulate has reached its maximal concentration.
Optimizing the quality of message reception
Using stochastic simulations we identified two possible problems causing a non-robust response when the messenger concentration is low:
the activation does not always occur
even when it occurs, the activation time can vary significantly.
After trying various solutions, we found that an overexpression of the FecR protein solves both problems: simulations showed a good and robust activation in this case. More details here
Figure 5: Plot showing that a more robust response is obtained when FecR is overexpressed in receptor cells.

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#IntColi_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria with multiple tandem integrants. Expected amplicon for multiple integrants: 572 bp.
PCR results with primers P1/P2 and P3/P4 showed that each clone had the correct integrant in the correct genomic position (see Materials and Methods for a list of the expected amplicon lengths). Negative controls showed no amplicons with primers P1/P2 as expected, but showed an unexpected band with P3/P4. The reason of the presence of this band was not further investigated and the results with this primer pair cannot be a useful tool for future analysis. Anyway, the P1/P2 primer pair can be sufficient to successfully validate the presence of the DNA of interest in the Phi80 genomic locus.
PCR results with primers P2/P3 showed that two clones (MC-GFP-B and MC-GFP-C) were single integrants, while all the other clones were multiple tandem integrants (i.e. the Phi80 locus contained more than one copy of the DNA of interest). Negative controls showed no amplicons, as expected.
Validation of the integrants phenotype: all the 11 clones were assayed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Unfortunately, the green fluorescent clones (MC-GFP-A,B,C and MG-GFP-B,C) did not show appreciable differences when compared to negative controls, most probably because the autofluorescence of the cells was too high and hid the GFP signal. For this reason, GFP clones were not considered for further analysis. Other instruments should be used to detect the GFP signal.
On the other hand, RFP clones (MC-RFP-A,B,C and MG-RFP-A,B,C) all showed a higher fluorescence than the negative controls (see Fig.5). As Fig.5 shows, the fluorescence of the three MG-RFP had a higher variability between clones when compared to the three MC-RFP. However, the clones were not necessarily expected to behave in the same way because all of them were multiple tandem integrants and the copy number of the PconRFP construct could be arbitrary.
Figure 5: relative RFP synthesis rate for all the RFP expressing clones. Note: as a reference, typical values of the relative RFP synthesis rate measured for PconRFP in a low copy vector (~5 plasmids per cell) are about 6-7 fold higher (data not shown).

Orthogonal system
Orthogonal system
Parallel and independent orthogonal system is one of the foundations of synthetic biology. This system has no or little cross with the natural biological system. The orthogonal system is composed of unnatural base pair,shift code,unnatural amino acid,orthogonal aaRS(aminoacyl tRNA synthetase), orthogonal RNA synthetase,promoter and the orthogonal ribosome.These components work corporately or separately in the organism, programming cells with new functions, and also providing new techniques for researchers.
Biological UAA Orthogonal genectical system：
What is UAA?
UAA is short for Unnatural Amino Acids.In most organisms,there are 20 kinds of amino acids in DNA encoding,which form the vast majority of proteins in the present life.Part of the ancient bacteria (Archaea) and (eubacteria) can encoding selenium (selenocysteine) or the pyrrolysine.The amino acids which do not exist in the natural protein sequence are called UAA.The unnatural amino acids used in the system must be stable, and can be stable in the cell.
Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.
Heading
If the unnatural amino acids were inserted into the  proteins expressed by the genetic system of encoding,the new physical and chemical properties of the proteins will expand the space of protein operation.
The UAA using in our system:Acetyllysine(ACK)
Acetyllysine(ACK) is one of unnatural amino acid and only corresponds to a special aminoacyl-tRNA(tRNA). It can be added to the protein by Semantic coding of termination codon(UAG).
Use UAA as a switch to start the translation of proteins:
To transmit the genetic information of mRNAs to proteins,after aa-tRNAs were synthesized by natural amino acids and tRNA via aaRS,they entered, and then entered the protein or peptide.To expand the genetic code and to lead new amino acids into the biosynthetic system,we need to identify the unnatural orthogonal codon,the tRNA with blank codon,the aaRS which can load"

Many molecular biology techniques involve chemicals which pose a danger when inhaled or when coming in contact with the skin, requiring additional safety measures. For example, Ethidium Bromide is a known carcinogen, used for DNA staining in agarose gel.  Therefore gel preparation was done in designated marked areas, addition of EtBr was done in a hood, and special emphasis was placed on wearing gloves, lab coats and covering the face when cutting bands from gel using UV.

Parts
Our main part is the 3α-HSD enzyme from rat liver origin (AKR1C9), which also exists in the human body as four different isoforms (AKR1C1-4). In the prostate, 3α-HSD converts the potent androgen 5α-DHT into a less active form - the reaction in the heart of our project. In order to minimize the risk of hormonal imbalance, this reaction will take place topically, on the human scalp and will be catalyzed by an isoform specific as possible 2 .
The second half of our project focuses on NADPH overproduction.  NADPH is an essential cofactor for our desired reaction. It is an abundant reducing agent, which isn't considered dangerous even in highly purified solutions, according to the Sigma-Aldrich MSDS .
Product safety
Our final product will include two separate containers, one containing B. subtilis secreting our enzyme, and the other containing the E. coli overproducing NADPH.  A contraption consisting of a syringe and a comb (see the design section of the wiki for more details) will be used to apply the B. Subtilis bacteria onto the scalp. The other compartment, containing the E. coli strain, will be equipped with a filter which will keep the bacteria and large molecules in the solution inside the container, while allowing the NADPH to pass through onto the scalp. Direct contact between consumers and genetically modified bacteria raises several safety challenges which must be addressed.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", we obtained the following results for our survey.
As we can see, the European society feels concerned by the problem of pollution. 77% of respondents think they are affected, and almost half feel very affected by the pollution, since they live in a polluted city. For indoor pollution, even though 43% of people think they are exposed to pollution in their home, more than half do not know if they are affected or think that pollution does not affect them at home.
This observation has strongly influenced our scenario and more particularly our desire to develop an application to raise awareness about the dangers of indoor pollution and create a database of pollutants so that people are aware of the dangers of this scourge.
Even though people are aware of the dangers of pollution, especially indoor pollution, most of them do not take measures to fight it. Most do not inquire, or inform themselves passively (TV, Radio). And only 13% of respondents really use protections against air pollution. We can interpret it as follows: pollution is a problem, but a second-area problem, which is not the priority of our fellow citizens at the individual level, which we can compare with the next question of the survey (How do you feel such an issue should be addressed?). Finally, we noted once again that a significant number of participants think that they will avoid air pollution by staying at home: a pedagogical work is therefore strongly necessary.
We asked the previous questions to see if the key concepts of our project were well known to the general public. As we have seen, most respondents think they know what are the fine particles (which we hear a lot about in the media). A large proportion (62%) also thinks they know what an endocrine disruptor is. This result is very high for such a technical term and contrasts with results from other continents, where on average 35% think they know what an endocrine disruptor is. This difference can be explained by the high-profile debates in the European Union on the banning of certain compounds suspected of being endocrine disruptors. After asking these questions, we gave a definition for these terms from a pedagogical perspective.
We gave the following definition for particulate matter: Atmospheric particulates are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. It’s the deadliest form of air pollution due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood stream unfiltered, causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death. [Ref.]
We gave the following definition for endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere at a certain level with your endocrine (or hormone)"

1. Prewash the spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer BL and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
2. Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 µl Buffer P1 (kept at 4 °C) and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.
Note: Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet.
3. Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 6-8 times to mix.
Mix gently by inverting the tube. Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
4. Add 350 μl Buffer P3 and invert the tube immediately but gently 6-8 times.
To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution gently but thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer P3. The solution should become cloudy.
5. Centrifuge for 10-12 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
A compact white pellet will form.
6. Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
7. Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
Spinning for 60 seconds produces good results.
8. Wash spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s.
Spinning for 60 seconds produces good results.
9. Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
10. Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EBor water to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
Note:  Pre-warming the Eluent at 55°C will generally improve elution efficiency.

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", we pipetted 50 µL of the supernatant and diluted it in 950 µL of isotonic water. This allowed us to obtain the 10-2 dilution. We prepared then the 10-3 to 10-9 dilutions as described for the liquid environments.
We spotted 5 µL of each dilution on the corresponding MCK plate + antibiotic (no antibiotic for the control).
We incubated plates overnight at 37°C.
The next day, we counted the CFU to estimate our strain survival.
protocol experiment : survival of E. coli
Results
It took us time to develop a proper protocol to follow the survival of our strains in the various environments. It was a trial and error process and we had to adjust the protocol after each trial.
Preliminary - experiment
First of all, we made a small-scale preliminary experiment during three days to determine whether our strains were able to survive in our three major environments: soil, freshwater and saltwater, and to determine what would be the optimal concentration of bacteria in our contaminating culture for our experiment. We used 5g of soil, and 5mL of freshwater or salt water. We contaminated them with 1mL of overnight bacterial culture not diluted or diluted 10 or 100 times. For these preliminary experiments, the samples to be plated were prepared as described above, but rather than spotting 5 µl on plates, we plated 100 µl of the dilutions on the adequate MCK plates and incubated the plates at 37°C overnight. Unfortunately, because of some problems with the medium, the results for the experiments with freshwater and saltwater could not be interpreted. The results for the soil experiment are presented in the table 1
On the whole, we observed that after three days of contaminations only, there were no or very few surviving E. coli bacteria in the soil when we diluted our contaminated E. coli culture 10 or 100 times. Moreover, the same decrease trend is observed for each of the three E. coli strains tested, suggesting that the integration of each of the three resistance genes in the genome of the E. coli MG1655 strain is not introducing a bias in our experiment. From this experiment, we concluded that it was more interesting for us to use an undiluted bacterial culture to contaminate our environment in our following experiments.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," been made with a codon optimization of the natural crdS sequence for E.coli.
CrdS under the control of a stationary phase promoter (pOsmY) : BBa_K1686033
BBa_K1686033 is a composite part consisting of an Escherichia coli osmY stationary phase promoter (BBa_J45992) and Curdlan synthase gene (BBa_K1686046). Thus, BBa_K1686033 produces curdlan synthase in stationary phase cultures.
See BBa_J45992 for details on the osmY stationary phase promoter.
See BBa_K1686046 for details on the Curdlan synthase gene.
Full-length stationary phase osmY promoter (MIT 2006 iGEM team) : BBa_J45992
BBa_J45992 was no longer in stock so we submitted it once again. We used it to express our Curdlan synthase gene (crdS) BBa_K1686046 in stationary phase. BBa_J45992 worked as expected, activating our gene only in stationary phase.
crdA gene with codon optimisation for E. coli : BBa_K1686045
CrdA might assist translocation of the nascent polymer of Curdlan across the cytoplasmic membrane.
Note : This protein has not really well described in literature. However this gene is essential for curdlan production and may increase curdlan production in our chassis.
crdC gene with codon optimisation for E. coli : BBa_K1686047
CrdC assists translocation of the nascent polymer across across the periplasm.
Note : This protein has not really well described in literature. However this gene is essential for curdlan production and may increase curdlan production in our chassis.
His-Gal promoter BBa_K1686098
BBa_K1686098 is a biobrick containing a histidine auxotrophy gene of yeast and the promoter galactose one.
Note : The sequence submitted in the part sequence is the initial sequence of the promoter. We have to do a mutagenesis to delete the different sites of restrictions that are not allowed in the final sequence. Our team had not the time to do it, that's why we only gave us the initial sequence in pSB1C3.

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#FurtherWork_-_-_TEXT.html," could step out of the shadow of G28, which surged to a peak of 3.7 million units of pure awesomeness after a few hours.
But soon after that, G28's btightness came crashing down. K28 still hadn't quite got to grips with the situation - while growing happily, it didn't seem into the whole glowing business. But what is that? Even though only half as bright as G28 at the start, R28 takes a stand against the fall and maintains its luminescence at a respectable level of 1.7 million Somethings.
G28 hadlong fallen into darkness, but R28 is still going strong to this hour. K28 went to get a coffee...
Right, like any season finale this gave more questions than answers. My take on all of that would be that H-NS does indeed repress, but is still affected by physiological changes connected with cell density, despite the absence of the Vibrio quorum sensing system. Therefore, expression is reduced after a while and falls off rapidly. In R28, the lux operon is not repressed and keeps glowing away as the cells are growing and slowly changing into stationary phase. The initially lower brightness might be due to greater availability of secondary substrates, like ATP, as Top10 is generally more viable. Another explanation could be that G28 burns out all its resources at the start, while R28 lives at a much slower pace (although the OD values do not show this), but uses a greater proportion of its resources to make light. K28 just sucks.
We left the plate reader running. It will be interesting to see how long R28 is able to maintain its light output. Either way, there definitely is a significant influence of H-NS on LuxCDABEG without the original promoter regions, and we can definitely present that as evidence for our codon-usage-change approach.
Peter bumped into Jim Ajioka today and he asked me to let him know when we are going to do the LRE/spinning down experiment. Are we still going to do that? It would help us a fair bit in showing the efficacy of LRE and how much of the effect depends on liberation of luciferase and how much is actual recycling.
Thursday 14st October
Basically, the sequencing didn't work. There was something wrong with the sample concentrations or something, so even though they say they've repeated the readings they can't get any meaningful results. So we don't yet know if we have successful colour changes yet I'm afraid. BUT, all we need to do is send some more"

Eut Bacterial Microcompartment Expression
Previous iGem teams have found that microcompartments have proved difficult to work with ( Dundee 2011 , Hong Kong 2013 , CU-Boulder 2016 ). Because of this, we thought it would be beneficial to work on optimising the formation of micro-compartments. These three constructs (EutS, EutMN and EutLK) were each combined with an independent inducible promoter (see figure 1) to enable variable synthesis of micro-compartment proteins and allow us to optimise micro-compartment formation with varying induction levels. We designed a collection of experiments, varying in complexity in order to prove that microcompartment formation was induced by our promoters. We also wanted to understand if microcompartment protein synthesis induced stress within our chassis and affected growth.
Figure 1. Architecture of EutS , EutMN , and EutLK constructs based on the ethanoalamine utilisation (Eut) bacterial microcompartment of Escherichia coli. Constructs were cloned into the plasmid pSB1C3 and transformed into DH5α E. coli chemically competent cells.
We managed to transform colonies combining EutS and EutMN to give us the construct EutSMN within the plasmid pSB1C3. We then obtained colonies which we believed"

Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology
About me: I have started working in a lab during my bachelor and then I thought that this is what I want to do in my life. I have started working in iGEM project by chance, last year, then our group won silver medal. This year we decided to continue and develop our project to get gold medal. What I love in synthetic biology is that, it is easy to see changes that we’re introducing into the system.
Attributions: I was involved in the multipromoter expression system project. I was in charge of assembling constructs and measuring the promoters’ strength (fluorescence measurements). I also contributed to Wiki content: methods, ethical issues and patenting. I described some biobricks, created a part of presentation and conducted classes during workshops. What is more I also prepared survey for human practices.

About me: When I first started working on iGEM project, it was mostly about gaining practical experience in the lab and learning to work by myself. Now it is so much more- this is my second iGEM edition and I developed as a person who aspires to be a scientist. I‘ve not only learnt lab etiquette, new techniques and widen my scientific horizons, but also figured a lot about myself.
Attributions: assembly of constructs with E1 enhancer & altered UTRs, promoters’ activity measurements, data analysis, preparation of poster, notebook, galleries and  illustrations for wiki, project and results description, project presentation, team’s logo and banner design, sfGFP and mRFP production and purification, biobricks description.

If the system works and we obtain what we expected it's unbelievable fantastic feeling. However, sometimes the results are surprisingly different and we have to face up to new challenges, what is equally exciting."
KUAS_Korea,2018,Team:KUAS Korea#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ics policy (KoNIBP) and conducted an in-depth interview. Soo hun Park whom we contacted, teaches in the College of Law in Sookmyung Women’s University and is also the education committee member of The Korean Association of Institutional review boards. He is one of the most informed specialists on the field of regulations and ethical concerns of developing biotechnologies in Korea.
The interview questions were mainly dealing with current bio legislations of Korea and ethical laws that cope with upcoming technologies in the field of biotechnology. As Bioethics and Safety Act(생명 윤리 및 안전에 관한 법률) stand at present, we discussed the highly limited circumstances which we could apply gene therapy and the newly introduced crisper technologies in genetic engineering of humans. Due to the article 36 of the act, these therapies are forbidden in fetus or germline cells in Korea while in the UK these experiments were authorized by the law. Drawing comparisons of bioethics laws in different countries led us to conclude that genetic engineering in Korea is especially under strict regulations and also negatively portrayed by the media. The ministry of health and welfare claimed that they would lift the regulations in 2015 but there were no significant acts of amendment yet. From the interview, he mentioned the guideline of a new direction; the ethics of synthetic biology and emerging technology, which is a risk-based approach on new technologies such as synthetic biology. He noted the fact that unlike the US there are no guideline in Korea but only restrictions. In addition, he explained the process of how the KoNIBP committee makes a decision on updated agendas related to the conflict between ethics and technology. Furthermore, we inquired about the genetically modified microorganisms(GMM) and what regulations were they restricted by after being consumed by humans. Only the GMMs that are intake by human or human derivative materials are controlled by this bioethics and safety act.
The interview helped us get a grip of the current technology and ethical challenges they pose. This helped our team analyze the reasonableness and rationality of the current legislation of bioengineering and synthetic biology in Korea. Although this interview covered genetic engineering techniques related to the human on a limited basis, this field is the actual hot spot of conflicts and ethical debates. Our team indicated that further discussion should be held in public to bring up the resolving solution that may lead to rational atonement.

So, Can we regulate environmental pH in a more simple way and meanwhile maintain the effectiveness?
Is there any possibility to regulate environmental pH by microorganisms themselves?
Basing on these questions, we come up with our idea.Here is the bacteria, now it faces this serious problem: how to survive in acidic and alkaline environment, and regulate environment to neutral pH, to protect the fermentation world?
At that moment, pH controller appears. When the bacteria get this weapon, it can balance the pH to neutral level. To achieve these goals, we firstly constructed PC in E.coli, and designed two subsystems in gene circuits. First system is resistance system to ensure survival of bacterium and regulate intracellular pH, while the second system--regulation system, focuses on regulating environmental pH to suitable range."

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," Lambert iGEM discovered that most lab kits or chemistry sets for children were marketed towards boys rather than girls. As a result, the team created a doll kit specifically designed for elementary-aged girls to increase exposure and interest in biotechnology. These kits include basic laboratory materials such as pipettes and beakers as well as Lambert iGEM’s very own 3DFuge. This kit allows girls to explore biotechnology as fun and accessible rather than something strictly for boys, significantly increasing interest in the science field. Placing the possibility of a successful career as a scientist in the minds of young girls has immeasurable value to the confidence of the girls themselves as well as the scientific community as a whole.

This minimizes the work done during summer. - PUF: further applications will be looked into. We will google + hangout on Monday night to discuss the proposal presentation. Take the initiative to contact UNC researchers if necessary. Next advisor’s meeting! Dress up to take a formal picture (that means suits and jackets!) Tentative agenda: Brief discussion of ideas for entrepreneurship and human practices. Then PUF and Phat present, followed by a great deal of discussion. We will also ask if it is feasible to do a main project, a side project, and the entrepreneurship competition.
iGEM Advisor’s Meeting 4/17/12 Project Proposals Round 2 Resveratrol Metabolite Blocks Apidogenesis - Why aren’t we just producing lots of resveratrol and putting it in the body? The body will naturally change it into piceatannol for us. Response: Does it happen in the necessary quantity and concentration? We want to make these molecules more stable and more soluble in the body. - Resveratrol is widely regarded as a wonderful compound to extend life and help health. It’s widely researched and popular, but there is much controversy about it still. - How are we going to make this more soluble? Add groups to the non-active sites of the molecule. Groups increase solubility, like halogenation. - Do these modifications change the molecule itself? Well we can run computational tests on that. We can also biologically make resveratrol derivatives and test them like a pharmaceutical company. o Beyond looking a solubility, computational testing might not be of much help. You really need to synthesize libraries of the molecule and test them. - Need to look into P450 enzymes. But we want to stay away from protein engineering. We can buy and test a range of enzymes though. - Computational side? The molecule docking technology to do simple hydrogen bond analysis is free, but for the more complex and detailed information we need an expert. Courtney will consult with one person in her lab who has experience in this area. o The computation sounds like it is beyond the scope of the summer. o Our best bet in terms of time is to just make a few analogs and test them. Microbial Expression and - PUF works with only 8 base pairs of recognition. - Where should the PUF binding site go? Let’s test a bunch of models with it in various places to see which is the most effective (via visibility of YFP). - Need to clearly understand"

Stony Brook University Admitted Students' Day
Team members introduced iGEM to prospective students as a great first stepping stone for undergraduates to get involved in research. Previous Stony Brook iGEM projects were presented as an example of what research past teams have done.
Presentation for CSTEP Summer Students
We presented for CSTEP Students, which are incoming freshmen at Stony Brook University. We presented about the basics of synthetic biology, since many of the students already had a foundation in AP Biology. We also spoke about our projects and what they plan to accomplish, as well as why they're important. We answered any questions that the students had about research, college, and our projects.
Presentation at the Seawolves Community Movie Night
iGEM team members had a table at the Seawolves Community Move Night and spoke to people about what iGEM was and what our projects were. We also spoke to some college students there that were interested in getting into research but didn't know how. We also advertised for our Building With Biology event to be held in mid August
Presentations for the Lang Program students
iGEM team members presented about synthetic biology in today's world as well as iGEM and the premise of BioBricks for high school researchers involved in the Lang Program through the Museum of Natural History.

Introduction
Olfactory receptors
Animals sense their chemical environment through olfactory receptors (ORs). The olfactory receptors are a large group of proteins belonging to a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind odorant ligands. If the receptor is activated by a ligand, the confirmation of the receptor is changed and there is an interaction with the a-subunit of the G-protein. This causes dissociation of the a-subunit from the Gßα dimer and the signal is propagated [1]. Because of the sensitivity and selectivity of the of the olfactory system it can be of value in detection of environmental toxins [2] or pharmaceutical screening. In this iGEM project we aim to investigate if the ORs can be used as a diagnostics tool for tuberculosis.
Yeast G protein-coupled receptors
In this project we choose to work with the budding  yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host  organism because it utilizes already a GPCR pathway.  Furthermore S. cerevisiae has been successfully used for functional expression of GPCR’s [3,4], a lot of genomic tools are available, and it has a fully characterized genome.  In S. cerevisiae two GPCR cascades have been identified: a glucose sensing pathway and a mating pathway [5]. There are two sexes of yeast cells, MATa and MATa. Whenever pheromones (small peptides) of the opposite sex are bound to the specific G-protein coupled receptors (Ste2 p or Ste3p), the MAP kinase cascade is turned on,  leading to induction of mating genes such as FUS1 and growth arrest  mediated by the FAR1 promoter. This mating response can be"

If people are happy to use a plant to assess water contamination, soil nutrients, toxins or any useful property or particle someone can invent an input module for, it will be easier to bring about what happened with cars: Although few people truly understand what is going on under the bonnet, or how it is made, and most people know that cars are incredible dangerous, the huge majority of people are happy to use them because they make life so much easier.
As the risks of synthetic biology are so much lower than those of driving (on a death rate basis the comparison is of course ludicrous), and the benefits potentially as great, it is an exciting time to be working in synthetic biology.
Over the past 11 years, the iGEM competition has trail-blazed the path in expanding synthetic biology away from the preserve of academia and research and into a field for enthusiasts and hobbyists all over the world. We believe that mösbi will play a key role in continuing this legacy. As a small multicellular chassis, with simple transformation protocols built on common plant knowledge and modularity, mösbi is primed to boost synthetic biology further into public consciousness. The door to acceptance of this new technology has been slightly ajar for a number of years, and we hope that mösbi will form a small part of the doorstop that will help it to open fully.

There were no identified phosphorylations that were more (or less) abundant in cells that expressed pantothenate kinase II. Since none of the upregulated proteins where protein kinases this result is not surprising. Although the phophoprotein analysis did not provide any data relevant for our project, a phosphorylation on serine 5 of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase that is not registered on uniprot, was identified in all of our samples.

International Conference the COINS
The COINS is an international conference of life sciences, which is organised annually by the Vilnius University Student Union. This year, it was held from 29th of February till 2nd of March. The conference is attended by scientists from different countries all around the world, who work in life sciences field and have the will to discuss, learn and share their scientific experiences. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for young scientists and students to practise their public speaking skills and present their scientific posters. At The COINS, there is also a possibility to meet experts of any fields, discuss their ideas and discover their area of expertise. Also, a special event –  A Company Fair – provides an opportunity for both experienced companies and entrepreneurs to find new partners and mutual interests.
Our team had a chance to represent themselves at this conference and share the ideas with the scientific community. Together with a member of Vilnius-Lithuania 2015 team , our team had an opportunity to introduce the iGEM competition and present the project of a previous team – ColiClock. The talk also included the insights on this year's project ideas, a probiotic therapy for phenylketonuria patients. The presentation was followed by the vast interest of the public, which motivated the team to pursue their ideas. What is more, the feedback on the project helped us to plan the project more thoroughly, taking into account all possible issues.
Our team has also participated in the above mentioned Company Fair, where we had an opportunity to get acquainted with the representatives of the variety of biotechnology companies and seek for their support. Information booklets were designed especially for this event. We were pleased to get a lot of interest from both local and international companies, who were eager to collaborate and establish close ties with Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team.

When induced the expression of the red fluorescent protein, dTomato, starts and the degradation part of the construct gets expressed. The laccase and dioxygenase gets translated and transported to extracellular space thanks to the HlyA-tag (See secretion system). The laccase oxidizes the PAH and dioxygenase catalyzes the ring cleavage.
Modification of CueO D439A/M510L
The modified CueO was synthesized with iGEM prefix and suffix, RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and a M-scar was added after the RBS in order to guarantee the function of the RBS. Two Nsil restriction sites were put before and after a 6xHis-tag so that the enzyme could be purified with an IMAC and so that the tag could be removed. The gene is followed by a KpnI restriction site with glycines and serines on each side, which are small amino acids which increase the flexibility of the protein. This is needed for the export tag HlyA , to make it easier for the resulting signal protein to be folded properly. A second KpnI restriction site is put after the HlyA so that the export tag can be removed easily. It has then two stop codons, and a terminator at the end.
Attaching the secretion tag
An issue when combining two biobricks with standard 3A Assembly is that a “scar” containing a stop codon is created between them. When attaching a signal sequence to a gene encoding an enzyme there can not be stop codons in between because the two genes need to be expressed together as one polypeptide chain. To assemble the HlyA-tag with the enzymes without getting a scar, two different methods were tried. These were overlap extension PCR and restriction free cloning ( RFC ). The aim was to attach the HlyA-tag to the biobricks encoding the two laccases CotA and CueO as well as to the catechol-1,2-dioxygenase.
Secretion system and characterization
It was uncertain whether the cells had the secretion system enzymes that would enable enzymes with a HlyA tag to be transported through the cell membranes. Therefore a cassette containing the genes encoding the secretion system enzymes was ligated to each biobrick. This construct was intended to be compared with a construct without the secretion system to see if any of them had exported proteins. The final step in our project was to get the cells to express the enzymes of interest to be able to characterize them. The enzymes were purified and measured for activity using enzyme kinetics"
