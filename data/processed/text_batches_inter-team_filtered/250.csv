Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," project by extending it to new fields (iGEM Manchester), or help other scientists (iGEM Istanbul Tech).
About the legal framework: If the bulk of the teams chose patent over open license for their project, most of them preferred a patent with humanitarian licensing than a traditional patent. It shows how teams wants to respond to societal needs. We believe iGEM could be a great laboratory for definition and test of legal frameworks. The legal framework is different for each project. This legal framework could be defined at the beginning of the project, in order to see what would be the best choice for the project to be economically interesting and meet societal goals. The anticipation of the framework could help the team to shape their projects and the goals they want them to reach.
Inclusiveness
Inclusiveness is one of the principles the most shared among iGEM teams. iGEM teams met as many stakeholders as there are projects. If we give a quick glance at it we can find among stakeholders: governmental agencies, farmers narcotic police officers and academicians, city hall, doctors, vets, European agency… Among this very different stakeholders, there is a lot of industry actors, showing that teams think how their project should be developed.. Sometimes there is a difficulty to meet industry actors in very specific fields (like space).
Because of the work of the iGEM competition on this field, popular science and outreach are well admitted and used among teams. Most of the teams lead actions of popular science among public or students. iGEM meet-ups are also important for inclusiveness. According to the answers they are often useful for the teams, they permit to increase the feasibility of the project. For example, a team discovered potential impacts while talking with iGEM teams at a meet-up.
In order to foster Inclusiveness the iGEM competition created in 2015 a special prize for Public Engagement. We believe it could be a good idea in the iGEM competition to have prize for Reflexivity and Anticipation (Responsiveness is already a price through the Integrated Human Practices).
Responsiveness
Teams had really interesting answers on how the different steps highlighted by the test helped them to reshape their projects, even if some teams have not seen their project reshaped. They found it useful to decide where they should direct the development of their project, and how to build feasible and long lasting project, positive for society. We could take the iGEM Valencia UPV as an example: after talking with farmers they understood their tool could not be used by farmers, and so aimed plant breeders. An other team realized they have to put"

Design
Introduction
 An important feature of microfluidic chips is that they are capable of artificially designing liquid lines and reaction chambers. Our project involves three reaction processes: the separation of the aptamer and the complementary strand on the magnetic beads, the separation of the complementary strand from the small molecule, and the biochemical reaction of the small molecule and the engineered bacteria. According to the needs of the project, we designed the two reaction chambers as shown in Figure 1.1, and used the peristaltic pump, the magnet plate and the heating plate as supporting auxiliary equipment. As can be seen from Figure, our chip consists of two chambers:
 
 Chamber 1 is oval.In our design, the function of the chamber is to hold our magnetic beads (fixed with magnets) with the aptamer and provide a place for the sample to bind to the aptamer so that the the complementary strands with lysine can get detached . Our intention to design the chamber as an oval is that the elongated structure can reduce the bubble generated by the difference in flow rate between the cavity wall and the middle stream.
 Chamber 2 is round.The contents of the chamber are engineering bacteria frozen into dry powdery and trypsin. After the reaction in the chamber is carried out for a certain period of time, the mixed reaction of the culture medium and the reaction liquid flows from the upstream into the chamber under the negative pressure generated by the peristaltic pump,the following reaction occurs:
  ①: Freeze-dried engineering bacteria’s recovery with the help of culture medium and constant temperature provided by the heating plate
  ②: Trypsin catalyzes cracking of DNA chain,lysine on the complementary strand falls into free small molecule
  ③: Lysine goes into the engineering bacteria, biochemical reaction within the engineering bacteria began.
 We can use the design of hardware to detect the reaction generated fluorescence generated in reaction③, and we can draw a conclusion through analyzing and processing.Besides,the material of the chip is an important factor affecting the detection of fluorescence.For the material of chip,we choose NOA 81.

Ethics
Synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field, with a bright future perspective. Synthetic biology-based systems are sustainable, innovative and have many possibilities. While developing systems it is important to look for the most suitable, safe and widely accepted application. To determine what problem would be most relevant and best suitable for our system, it was essential to acquire information of both experts and stakeholders. This shaped the focus of our social relevance, which started as a detection method for botulism and shifted towards a system aiding detection of oestrogens and oestrogen-like compounds. Furthermore, the extensive feedback aided the design of a device that is convenient to use, low-cost, safe and meets all other stakeholder requirements. To give an impression of the evolution of our project, the project timeline is illustrated below. A summary of the most influential insights is provided in the last section, underneath the infographic.

14/05/18 About RIVM
The RIVM is the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. They conduct research and provide advice to government authorities to improve policy relating to environmental and public health and safety. One of their core focusses is on policy surrounding safe use of GMO.
Insights
The development of a general lab tool is less interesting and powerful than an applied solution.
Contacting relevant organizations and businesses to figure out their needs is a good way to determine if problems in their field could benefit from our project.
Fields of interest could be food safety, environmental pollution, water quality, and chemical compounds.
It is likely unfeasible to engineer our GMO biosensor in such a way that introduction in the environment could legally be allowed.
Applied
Changed the aim of our project from a general lab tool to a specified sensor-solution.
Established contact with relevant organizations to catalogue interesting applications of our biosensor platform.

Jos van der Vosse is a senior scientist, currently working for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), where he develops detection systems to improve food quality and to ensure microbiological quality and safety.
Insights
Measuring specific contaminant concentration is crucial for application in food industry.
When using our biosensor for detecting contaminants, such as hormones and medicines in surface water, a less specific concentration might be sufficient.
A method using quantitative measurement is preferred"

CAT-Seq system design incorporates a droplet merging step as a way to enrich the droplets containing the Product Nucleotides by combining them with droplets that contain DNA amplification mix and Reference Nucleotides in high-throughput.
Yet, as we began to grasp the droplet merging techniques, effective merging appeared to be an extremely difficult task. The merging was not efficient – only 1 to 5 droplets merged for every 20 of droplets that contained the Product Nucleotides. Each droplet that has not merged is a huge loss of information. As our goal is to create a biomolecule activity recording system that is not only fast, but also accurate, increasing the effectiveness of the droplet merging step was of the highest priority.
Videos displaying faulty and inefficient droplet merging due to poorly chosen parameters
The merging difficulty stemmed from the fact droplet merging techniques consist of large number of different parameters that depend on each other – droplet volumes, water and oil phase flow speeds, electrical field strength that helps the droplets to merge, microfluidic chip dimensions and other.
For this reason we have decided to develop an in-depth mathematical model to determine the appropriate merging system parameters that would provide effective droplet merging in CAT-Seq.
Here we present the full mathematical description of the active fusion of droplets in a microfluidic chip. The droplets from two populations are fused together one-by-one using specially designed droplet coalescence chip and an electric field. The full scheme of the chip is shown in Figure 1:
The electric field is created by plugging the voltage to the metal electrodes (Fig.1 A). One of the droplet population is being produced on a chip (Fig.1 B) and at the same"

Talking to affected people
To our surprise, some (former) cancer patients visited us during the weekend of NRW-Day Celebration after having heard from our project through local newspapers. It was very interesting to hear about the experiences of a cancer patient from a personal point of view.
Two women who came to our presentation told us about their experiences with the diagnosis “breast cancer” and how they dealt with it. While speaking with them we noticed how much they were interested in the disease and that they were very excited about new ways to fight cancer and our project in general.
It was very sad to hear that one of the women felt neglected of her physicians and that they did not want to explain the working mechanisms of her medication. But this showed us very well how important it is to educate people about and clarify how the development of new therapies and medication actually works.
People do want to know more about this dreadful disease. In this case, it was on us to explain and how cancer is working and how we will be able to fight it in future. The next day, we continued our research even more eagerly.
Survey about the public’s knowledge and opinion about cancer, cancer treatment and gene therapy
Both cancer and gene therapy are publically highly discussed topics. Cancer is one of the most common causes of death in the Western world, only cardiovascular diseases are more common. Therefore, cancer is an omnipresent topic in everyday life. Almost everyone knows at least one person in their close circle who has or had cancer and witnessed the often life-altering side-effects of today’s rather crude treatments , like chemo- or radiation therapy. Hence it is not surprising that there is a huge demand for newer, less severe treatment methods. One of those treatments is the so called gene therapy, a method our project is derived from as well. Yet, gene therapy often causes a public uproar and is met with broad rejection.
But what is the public’s actual opinion about the topic. And how well are people informed about cancer and its therapies? How well is our project received by the people? And where would people search for information about such topics? Those were questions we wondered about, so we decided to create and conduct a survey to answer those questions. The survey was conducted online"

Parameters
Our project is aimed at designing a system to detect and handling pollutants and toxins in the environment     especially microcystin. Our system is consisted of several parts, such as the positive feedback circuit,     the time sensor, the toxin detector, the suicide circuit and so on. We can find the toxin and measure its     concentration by the detector. The time sensor is designed to tell the time to make sure all the measurement     is at the same time. With the positive feedback circuit, we can make much more enzyme or binding protein to     degrade or catch the toxin. The suicide circuit is used to satisfy the requirement of life safety.     We use riboswitches to detect the toxin, which means we need to design several riboswitches and evaluate     its efficiency. For the evaluating riboswitch, we use RNAstructure to predict the secondary structure     of the sequences and its free energy. With the free energy and some other parameters, we can obtain the     kinetics model of the RNA.
The solution of detector model needs the help of MATLAB for solving partial differential equations.     We also use Simbiology of MATLAB to simulate all the other circuits.
We compare the modeling results with experiment results. Some prediction can also be found by modeling
The POSITIVE FEEDBACK SYSTEM is used to enlarge the production of enzymes and promote the degradation of toxins.
There are four designs. The first is a blank control. The second one uses luxI to             cause positive feedback. The third uses luxR while the fourth uses both luxI and luxR.

For specific information of modeling, please look at the supplement.
Simulating by MATLAB Simbiology, We get several conclusions which can be compared with the results of the experiment.
From the picture above, we can obtain the conclusion that our positive feedback system works in theory.             The binary positive feedback system[ luxI+ and luxR+]  maintains much more RFP than the control system             in only 300 seconds. The luxI+ system is as good as the binary system. The luxR+ system is only             a little better than the control.

The association passes through the membrane, bringing the cytoplasmic domains of ToxR together to form an active homodimer. The active ToxR dimers drive transcription from the ctx promoter by binding to TTTGAT repeats and recruiting transcription machinery.
ToxR elegantly allows Vibrio cholerae rapid sensing and the activation of pathogenic functions. Virulence factors such as those controlled by this system are often clustered in the genome within pathogenicity islands, remnants from a past horizontal gene transfer. The simplicity and orthogonality of the systems contained in these small virulence cassettes make them an ideal source for modular biosynthetic tools. Indeed, one of the reasons ToxR is so interesting is that it single handedly achieves the task of the standard two-component signal transduction pathway: it is activated in the periplasm and directly promotes transcription in the cytoplasm. The simplicity of this regulation system and the scope of this single protein make it an ideal starting point for synthetic design.
Dimerization of ToxR has been found to activate the ctx promoter in Vibrio cholerae by binding directly to the DNA. DiRita et. al. (1991). ToxS detects changes in the environment, interacts with, and dimerizes ToxR's periplasmic domain. Dimerization of the periplasmic domain of ToxR results in dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain, which activates transcription of the ctx promoter. The ToxR domains are all on one peptide, so signals can be quickly relayed from the periplasm to the cytoplasm. This unique aspect of ToxR makes it a good part for building a biosensor. We aim to make a biosensor by further engineering this dimerization-dependent transcriptional activation feature of the ToxR system to be ligand dependent.
We hypothesized that we could create a biosensor if we attach ligand dependent dimerizing proteins to the periplasmic domain of ToxR. The periplasmic domain will dimerize only in the presence of a particular ligand. The ligand dependent dimerization of the periplasmic domain of the ToxR fusion will cause the cytoplasmic domain of ToxR to dimerize, activating the ctx promoter. By putting GFP after the ctx promoter, we can then detect if the ctx promoter is activated.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

The total cost of his self-made fluorescence stereomicroscope is 1000 RMB yuan. It can be used for observation, incubation and heating. The communication with Dr. Zong Yeqing not only gave us the hope of building low-cost fluorescence instrument for production and medication, but also reminded us of the significance of building low-cost instrument for scientific research itself. (图3) (图4)             Protocol We use MATLAB as our fluorescence image process platform. Cell segmentation based on the brightfield channel is done automatically by CellX（Mayer et al., 2013, Dimopoulos et al.,2014）, a MATLAB open source package. Then we can load the fluorescence channels and analyze them in single cell level. The expression level of proteins is reported by fluorescence intensity. The phase separation signal is defined by abnormal maximum fluorescence intensity compared with pixels in the same cell. Then the size of droplets is measured by setting a threshold.

UNC-Asheville,2017,Team:UNC-Asheville#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," our project on mass spectrometry. However due to being unable to assemble the full pathway, equipment being offline for ¾ of summer and lack of correct columns, our team decided to scrap this in favor of a simple colorimetric assay. In the 11th hour, our team developed and tested an assay which measures free chloride form the competitive reaction of Fe2+ and Hg2+ for 2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)- s-triazine(TPTZ). In this assay, mercury ions preferentially bind to TPTZ, producing a colorless solution. Upon the addition of chloride, mercury and chloride form HgCl2 precipitating out of solution, and Fe2+ binds to TPTZ forming a purple solution which can be measured by UV absorbance. Our team had to develop a homebrew version of this assay because at the cost of $250, the assays sold by sigma were too expensive. A patent for the assay was found online and emulated, though this recipe was eventually tweaked as it was discovered not to work as intended. Eventually a solution system was discovered which would could colorimetrically measured free chloride linearly over the range of 0.2mM - 2mM of free chloride. Our experimental results did not fall in this linear range, however qualitative data was collecting showing that our parts containing dhlB under inducible Lac expression did indeed produce more free chloride than either A) dummy plasmids containing GFP + IPTG and B) dhlB without IPTG. Although these results are extremely preliminary they are extraordinarily exciting for our team.
Chloride concentration is determined by a competition reaction between Hg2+ and Fe2+ for 2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)- s-triazine(TPTZ). The preferred Hg-TPTZ complex exhibits no color. In the presence of chloride, Hg2+ forms HgCl2, which precipitates, allowing TPTZ to complex with Fe2+. The Fe-TPTZ complex results in a colorimetric (620 nm) product proportional to the chloride present.11

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Freiburg,2011,Team:Freiburg#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," ligase sequence (see above), we were still unsure whether this would work out. To increase our chances of success we designed six different versions with distinct Histidine patterns on the LRR core.
Six different Histidine patterns inserted into our ideal LRR sequence, capped by Hagfish domain fragments were sent for I-TASSER structure prediction. C-Score shown under the sequence.
After evaluating the C-Scores of I-TASSER we saw that our favorite versions 1,2 and 4 gave acceptable scores. We then reverse translated them with a codon usage optimized for E. coli, using http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_trans.html The sequence was handed over to our sponsor ATG:biosynthetics, who ran their own analysis on it, to optimize the sequence for RNA trafficking and secondary structures. In pictures below the alignment of our reverse translated sequence and the returned sequence is shown: ours above, ATG:biosynthetics sequence below. Underlined in red are the mutations the company introduced to optimize the expression. They also were so kind as to synthesize the three genes for us as a gift.

Incubate all three tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius for 80 minutes.
Remove all the tubes and add 1mL of chloroform to each. Gently shake each tube and centrifuge it at 4000rpm for 10 minutes at 7 Celsius. Remove the supernatant from each tube with a pipette and place it in a new tube with the same label. Be careful not to get the chloroform or bacteria when you remove the supernatant.
CsCl gradient was ran right after completion of mutagenesis.
3) Spot test to determine phage concentration (8.26)
Dilution series -1 through -6 were performed all three samples (0, 500, and 850). These dilutions samples were then used in spot tests to estimate phage titer.
Specifically, three plates were prepared for spot tests using E. coli B by adding 0.5mL overnight into a tube, mixing it with 5mL of x1 top agar, and then plating the content. 5ul of each dilution sample was spotted onto corresponding plate.
4) CsCl gradient (8.26)
Phage Purification Team was able to finalize their procedures for performing CsCl gradient on T7 phage. For specifics please refer to ADD LINK
CsCl separation was performed for both 0 and 500 sample. The finished gradient was aliquoted into 20 eppendorf tubes each, each containing 1-1.5 mL solution. We will need to determine phage characteristics in each aliquot before proceeding with dialysis and TEM.
5) Characterizing post-CsCl phage (8.27-9.2)
Spot test was performed to estimate phage concentration within each aliquot. Specifically, 1:100 dilution series were performed for each aliquot to generate a -2 and -4 dilution sample for each. All dilution samples were spotted (5uL) onto plates overlaid with 0.5mL of E coli B overnight and 5mL of x1 agar.
Nearly all aliquot formed plaques during the previous spot test at -4. Thus further dilutions (to -5 and -6) and spot test was performed to more accurately estimate phage concentration. Spot test procedures are similar"
SDU-CHINA,2018,Team:SDU-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," be tested before industrial fermentation. Normally, chassis used for fermentation including E. coli, Bacillus, yeast and fungi must be compatible with the culture medium, especially the carbon source. Glucose, which is a monosaccharide, is now widely used as carbon source in fermentation, glucose is easily absorbed by chassis but can be poisonous to chassis when the concentration is high, so chassis that can tolerant high concentration of glucose will be more suitable for fermentation.
    Besides, safety of chassis and operation is of great importance in selecting engineered bacteria. Pathogens and conditional pathogens are not allowed for fermentation unless the pathogen genes are knocked out. And the chassis for fermentation is forbidden to leave the fermenters, to prevent contamination to the environment.
    What’s more, engineered bacteria should be easy to operate to face the change in environment. During fermentation, engineered bacteria will produce a large quantity of byproducts, which may influence or even repress bacteria growth and synthesis. Therefore, we should analyse the relativity among bacteria growth, bioreactor operation and environment to regulate metabolic flux inside the cells and optimize fermentation.
    Last but not least, stability in heredity is also of great importance to engineered bacteria. Exogenous genes responsible for production is better inserted onto bacteria chromosomes than onto a plasmid. As to genes must be located on a plasmid, stability should come to the first place before constructing the engineered bacteria, resistance to only one antibiotic is better than that to multiple antibiotics.
3. Hardware
    According to the trouble caused by non-transparent culture medium, we must make some developments in the light devices. First of all, we need to solve the problem that light cannot reach our bacteria, so that we can think of further improvement even if application. However, putting light into practical use may need a great innovation in fermenter as well as other equipment, the light devices should be equipped onto the fermentation and be connected to the regulating equipment. As we all know an innovation in the structure of fermentation as well as other equipment could cost a lot of time and money, and this innovation suffers a risk of low profit but high cost (we will discuss it later).
4. cost
    The cost of the whole process for a type of new engineered bacteria as well as a new inducer transferring from labs to factories should be analysed and we should make a prediction to imitate the comparison between costs and profits. Raw materials for culture medium, maintenance of fermenters and regulating equipment, introduction of new light devices and purification of products, all these parts require money and should be in our consideration.

Cooperation
To verify our work, we find Tianjin team, which have cooperation relationship with us. We verified a part of their work in return. The initial device they designed is BBa_K1020004. During the cooperation,We noticed that the bacteria with this device had a slow growth rate. We thought this was because the leakage of this promoter (J23100) was too strong, for alkR was constitutively expressed and RFP had a high expression level even in the absence of alkanes, the inducible compounds. We assumed that the over-expression of alkR caused negative influence on the growth of cells. To reduce the expression level of the constitutively expressed alkR, eliminating the influence, we designed a modified device BBa_K1020005, and replace J23100 with J23103. It turned out that RFP showed almost no expression without alkanes. If we add C8 as inducible compounds, the red color can be observed and the rate of cell growth is largely increased.

We need to dilute down the silk concentrate before spinning. I do not know the concentration of the Tamura, so I will be assuming that the Tamura is dilute enough to treat as water in the calculations. That is to say, instead of diluting the silk dope with water, I will be diluting it with the Tamura fraction.
Let's spin 250 uL of the Tamura.
To obtain 250 uL of ""15% w/v silk,"" we need 187.5uL of the 20% w/v silk dope, and 62.5 uL of the Tamura fraction.
However, before adding the Tamura fraction, we need to ensure that there are no particulates
Currently, the fraction has a lot of particulates -- probably some coagulated silk, as well as some of the resin.
Aliquot 500 uL of the fraction into a tube. Centrifuge at 5000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4 C.
Transfer supernatant to a syringe with a filter tip, then inject into a new tube.
Some problems
Upon centrifugation, both the resin and the silk particles settle at the tube bottom (checked under UV box)
I aliquoted another 250 uL of the fraction to syringe filter, all of the silk particles were trapped in the filter (checked"

Overview
In this country profile, information of synthetic biology in South Korea is compiled from different on-line sources such as government website, official government annual reports, news articles, and reviews. Searches were conducted in both English and Korean media. This country profile contains information about different aspects of synthetic biology in Korea, including regulation, research, people, perception, and organization. However as specific classification of work under the moniker of ‘synthetic biology’ is still uncommon in South Korea, wherever a specific aspect of information cannot be found described under synthetic biology, we have obtained the same information under the wider field of ‘biotechnology’. Information about biotechnology may be inferred to see the general growth trend of synthetic biology and its future development. In fact, biotechnology research institutes and companies are the ones that are most likely to adopt the synthetic biology approach (Hranueli, 2013).
In general, synthetic biology is a small but rapidly growing field in Korea. This trend is guided by a comprehensive plan called the Bio-Vision 2016. In 2006, the Korean government announced the Bio-Vision 2016 as a 10 year plan aimed at developing Korea’s biotechnology capabilities into making the nation a leader in the field. Needless to say, this has also allowed synthetic biology to gain a foothold in Korea (Cho, 2006)
Synbio Map
The SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology all round the world. This map was created at the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

John:
Ran 1.5 % agarose gel to verify whether primers worked on the Nub-Fusion construct.  Previously, we PCRed NUB-Fusion plasmid using verification primers.  After, we used this product as a template for PCR with the NUB specific primers that we designed. Sec-tag was also PCRed and run on the gel.  Additionally, old PCR cleanup NUB and Sectag were run on the gel to see if they can be used or disposed.
Harris:
Transformations from the day before of ADH1-Aga2Linker and ECFP-Terminator in the Biobrick Chloramphenicol plasmid failed, although the retransformation of Aga2 (in the Amp plasmid) alongside them worked. Ligations left overnight so today I am retransforming them alongside BBa_K098994, which is 5B from Plate 3 of the initial distribution, and is in a Chloramphenicol resistance plasmid. This should grow up fine, and if it does, then we know that the problem is with the ligations, but if it doesn’t, then there is a problem with the Chloramphenicol plates.

Russell:
PCR results from 7/20 were disappointing but not unforeseen. Previous sec tag PCRs show band of appropriate size, but biobricking attempts have been unsuccessful with cause unknown. Will perform one more biobricking procedure on the sec tag under careful scrutiny before troubleshooting for larger problems.
Transformed the N-terminal and C-terminal GFP biobricks from the initial distribution. These will be used to show that the test scFv and test antigen are, in fact, complexing in the cytoplasm (and maybe on the surface).

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we decided on                     the use of a riboswitch Therefore, in our contact with Prof Howard M. Salis, he ensured us                     that a theophylline riboswitch with a high dynamic range would be an                         excellent choice,                     as theophylline readily enters bacterial cells, it is not metabolized by E.                     coli, and it binds strongly to its RNA aptamer inside the riboswitch.
Regarding the choice of fluorescent marker he told us that both                     sfGFP and RFP would work fine, but since the AEB--Theo-27 riboswitch                     currently uses luciferase as the reporter gene of interest we couldn't                     simply replace the current coding sequence (CDS) with another one. He                     advised us to use luciferase as a reporter or create a fusion protein that                     consists of the first 99 nucleotides of the currently used CDS                     (luciferase), followed by our desired gene of interest without inserting a                     stop or start codon in the middle of the CDS fusion. So, as we could not                     measure luminescence levels we designed a fusion luciferase-sfGFP protein.
We visited the Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH (Centre of Research & Technology Hellas) in Thessaloniki, Greece, where we discussed about our project with                     scientists from the biotechnology field. Dr Antonios Makris, who is working                     on metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces, informed us about copy number                     variations in yeast and how they might affect the functionality of an                     engineered system. Our conversation with him gave us the necessary                     information to further investigate the usage of our stabilized systems in                     yeast.
We also visited Dr Tefas, Associate Professor, School of                     Informatics, AUTh, to ask about network optimization. After discussing                     about our work and defining the optimization problem, he described to us                     methods to find the optimal parameters for our systems. We ended up using                     robustness analysis over a gradient descent algorithm as he suggested,                     because computational cost was not a problem, as we didn't have many                     unknown parameters or big ranges for their values.
Project Applications - Interaction with Stakeholders
As we wanted to expand the purpose of our project and investigate its                     possible applications outside of the lab we had meetings and discussions                     with several stakeholders from our country.

Please   mention. All the best and jeetkeana.... I wouldn't pay a cent to buy something that will let me know if something is spoiled or not. In   my experience (I cook), I have till date been able to detect if a food is gone bad or not pretty   effectively. A strip or any other innovation on this arena, I think will not do any good as it is in   fact, redundant. Nature has already done this for us. All you're doing is appealing to the eyes,   which I believe would not really serve the purpose.

background
Our IGEM research project involves study of the autophagy phenomenon by using the GFP to reveal it more clearly. The Autophagy is a biological process which acts like a recycle factory. Like you put a pop can into the trash bin and then reproduce by the factory, the procedure of autophagy just catch the aging, denaturing, damaged organelles and send them into the lysosome which degrades the organelles.
Health
Autophagy is developed as a way to address the disease and maintain the health of human body. With the degradation of the denaturing cellular, our cells can have the ability to defend themselves without other medical treatment.
Anti-aging
Autophagy is also capable to keep us young and strong. It is better than the cosmetic we used which may cause other problem.
Fight with cancer.
Autophagy gets the potential impact to fight with cancer. However it still get some negative effect. The reaction taken place in the lysosome can consciously can unconsciously help the cancer cell to grow. It may be an efficient assist of deteriorating the denaturation of tumor cell. After all, it still play a paramount significance in the future genetic study.
Human Practice
How We do it
Environmental Impact
Since our subject is a fundamental work in this field, all the processes were finished in the laboratory. It did not bring any negative effects to our environment.
Safety
The experiment itself is totally safe. Although we met some trouble during the operation of experiment, fortunately, all the troubles did not cause any hurt to teammates or others.
Education
In order to make the public have deeper comprehending of genetic modification, we did a lecture and a questionnaire of people about GM food. The reason why we used the GM food as the topic but not the subject of our experiment was that our subject is too professional for normal people to understand.
Evaluation
We summarized and processed our statistics. It is not surprised that the students accept GM food in a much larger extent than that in general public.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," lysostaphin. Overall, the material costs for our living material are manageable, and upscaling will further reduce the costs. Although the exact manufacturing costs are unsure, a wound treatment with our patch should not be more expensive than the current costs of €7200 per leg ulcer (7).
Use
Stakeholder contributions resulted in some practical design requirements. Our plaster will be easy to use, as it can be simply applied directly on the skin and attached with some tape or a loose dressing. The patch can be easily sterilized with radiation, after which it can be delivered in a sterile wrapper. It can also be freeze-dried, which eases storage and transport. These properties ensure that even patients in remote places without well-equipped clinics can benefit from our product.
We will need to experimentally determine the optimal treatment duration. Previous research on bone fractures suggests that a week would be plenty for lysostaphin to eradicate E. coli (18). However, experts warned that bacteria may return if the wound is not yet closed. Dr. Edgar Peters predicted that the total treatment time will be several weeks or even months, during which the plaster must be replaced several times to prevent inflammation around the plaster.
Evaluation of our solution
We have demonstrated that our bandage is able to safely contain viable E. coli. Furthermore, we showed the production and secretion of functional lysostaphin which kills S. aureus. We expect to obtain a living material able to inhibit S. aureus if we combine both systems. This will allow us to develop a wound healing plaster. Here, we evaluate to which extent our bandage will provide a solution to chronic wounds and its implications for wound healing.
An essential design requirement was specificity. Patient Karel mentioned that the worst thing of having chronic wounds was the sustained treatment with systemic antibiotics, which gave him many side effects. Lysostaphin specifically and effectively targets Staphylococcus aureus. It is thus much more specific than most antibiotics. As the patch is applied locally, only bacteria on the wound should be targeted. Hopefully, our patch will thus improve patients’ quality of life. Patient suffering will be further reduced as our patch can stay on the wound for several days or perhaps weeks thanks to the sustained release provided by living bacteria. This will be an improvement particularly for burn wound patients, for whom the (current) daily wound dressing changes are painful.
Koen Lim from Plasmacure mentioned that the high costs of wound care are a burden for insurance companies. It is thus important to keep our solution affordable. Although not accurate, our cost calculation above indicates that the plaster will"

    2) Centrifuge for 1 minute at 12,000 rpm (~ 13,400 x g) in a conventional benchtop microcentrifuge at room temperature (15-25°C), 1-5 ml of bacterial cells were harvested in a microcentrifuge tube, and then all traces The supernatant opens the centrifuge tube by reversing until all the media has drained (for large volumes of bacterial cells, collect a tube through several centrifugation steps.)
    3) Use 250μl of Buffer P1 (to ensure that the RNase A has been added) to resuspend the bacteria. The bacteria should be completely resuspended by up or down rotation or blowing until there is no cell mass. Note: After the suspension is suspended again, the cell mass is not visible, otherwise incomplete dissolution will reduce yield and purity.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," PERIPLASM TEST.
The purpose of this construct will be to check the sensor-reporter system. The alternative construct contains AIP Generator for self-induction and no permeability device to facilitate accumulation of AIP in the periplasm. The system would essentially product its own AIP, thus showing activity of sensor-reporter system before final tests in presence of S. aureus.

3.5 THE QUANTIFICATION INITIATIVE
Characterization of certain parts, functioning as signal ampliﬁers, was done by the iGEM Team Cambridge, which designed them, in terms of arabinose as an input signal. The arabinose sensing system consists of promoter pBAD and it respective repressor AraC. The BioBrick part BBa_I0500 contains both of those components in one part, while BBa_I13453 and BBa_I13458 are similar to BBa_I0500 split into two components: pBAD and AraC respectively. In order to retrieve the data about Team Cambridge’s parts, the modeling division of iGEM team Waterloo 2010 requested characterization of pBAD in relative promoter units (RPUs). The article by Kelly et al. (2009, Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using in vivo reference standard) describes the issue of great deviations involved with measuring biological systems due to too many factors to account for. The proposed solution is to measure in reference to a standard: the promoter BBa_J23101. The proposed vector for both the measured part and the standard is pSB3K3 (low copy number kanamycin resistant BioBrick plasmid) with green �"

Week 7 --- 15.09.14 - 19.09.14
On the weekend of the 13th and 14th five of our team members attended the iGEM meetup (hier n link)  in Aachen, where we presented our project and interchanged ideas with the other attending teams. An overnight expression test of our BL21DE3 with the pETue1.1[Link zum plasmid] constructs at 20°C did not yield any Protein. The functionality of our expression vector remained unconfirmed, as SDS-page did not show any overexpression bands. We also tried to purify protein with Ni-NTA columns, in case the expression was not very efficient in our cells. However nothing could be purified from the cell lysate. After this failed expression test we started an extensive error screening. Sequencing of pETue1.1 revealed that it in fact contained a deletion in the start codon, thereby inhibiting any expression. Constructs in pSB1C3 were also re-checked by sequencing of the insert from both sides using specifc RFC25-binding primers, aswell as a primers per enzyme, that  was specifically designed to bind inside of the constructs. They turned out correct, except for SNAP-aGAL and SNAP-EABase. Work on the synthetic peptides continued with construction of the C-Intein. This was performed using an Intavis AG ResPep System. The product was purified by HPLC and analysed with ESI. The fractions containing the product were lyophilised.
Week 8 --- 22.09.14 - 26.09.14
We began the 8th week by repicking colonies from the transformation of NEB5α with pETue1.1, since we suspected that we got unlucky before by picking a conoly with the start codon mutation. We managed to get a NEB5α colony with a perfect pETue1.1, which was confirmed by digestion with NsiI and full sequencing of our inserted annealed oligos. We decided to label this vector pETue1.2 in order to avoid cofusion, since we had already worked with the wrong vector (labeled 1.1) for some time. We ligated all available pSB1C3 constructs into the new pETue1.2 and then transformed NEB5α cells with the lig"

Plant persistence tests
A key test of the effectiveness of an endophyte to impact its host if the endophyte can persist in and on the plant. FCP2-01 was isolated from the roots, and therefore we examined ability for the endophyte to inhabit the roots of Brachypodium distachyon. Seeds were inoculated by submerging in bacterial culture, then grown axenically in glass culture tubes in a growth chamber. Confocal micrographs were acquired at intervals of 1 week for 1-5 weeks post-inoculation. Bacteria were observed on roots at weeks 3 and 4 most clearly, but overwatering may have been responsible for no visible colonies in week 5.

Various connections in Clotho provide extension points. These extension points have interfaces associated with them. Plug-ins then become extensions which implement those interfaces.
In the ClothoCore there is a plug-in manager which keeps tracks of all the extensions and extension points. It learns about these each time Clotho is run. It does this by examining specific directories for plugin.xml files which identify classes as either extensions or extension points. Then at runtime, the core informs all extension points (i.e. connections) about the available extensions (i.e. plug-ins). Therefore if you create a plug-in, all that is required is the compilation of your code into a .class file and the creation of a plugin.xml file. You then place it in the required directory (currently /build/classes). Then the Core will find your plug in at runtime and you will be able to choose it from a list of the connection whose extension point it extends. Whew:)
As we develop this system more we will make available the APIs for creating plug-ins as well as library files needed to develop plug-ins for Clotho.
For more detailed information about the plug-in environment for Clotho and to download plug-ins you can check out this page . This page is currently underdevelopment but will provide plug-ins for users to download, information about how to create plug-ins, and the latest updates about Clotho's plug-in environment.
8. Clotho User Interfaces
In Figure 6 (#8) illustrates that the actual user interfaces from Clotho are kept separate from the connections which implement their functionality. This allows for changes to be made quickly to the look and feel of the tool without having to change code relating to the operation of the system. The following individual sections provide screenshots of the individual user interfaces as well as a feature list for each.

The main toolbar is the primary point of interaction for Clotho. The main toolbar allows the user to interact with other Clotho ""Connections"". The toolbar supports the following features:
Set the skin for Clotho. Using the ""Substance"" look and feel library the user can set the skin of the tool.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," carried out according to UK and European regulations. We reviewed these in more detail as part of our Human Practices section, to help communication within synthetic biology we also compiled a set of Synthetic Biology Communication Guidelines . Communication is a very important factor within safety as if proper practices are not carried out, due to misunderstanding, small hazards can be amplified.
Safe Project Design
Chassis (E.coli )
The chassis, which we chose, are all non-pathogenic and were selected within the design stage to minimise the risk, these were all strains of E. coli.
The strains of E. coli we used are DH5-α and BL21-DE3, these strains are within safety group 1, like most E. coli strains these present the lowest level of risk to humans. Research commissioned by HSE (Chart et al. 2000) showed that these lack the pathogenic mechanisms usually present within hazardous E. coli strains.
Cell-Free
From the perspective of safety, aspects of our project were advantageous due to their cell free factor. Within cell-free systems random mutations and dissemination are not as likely. This utilizes cell extract for transcription and translation. Sonification and centrifugation steps remove the cell membrane. This makes them suitable for use outside of the lab, however in line with Newcastle and iGEM’s ‘Do Not Release’ policies, this was not carried out.
Arsenic
For the characterization of the arsenic biosensor which we produced, specific COSHH forms were required detailing the use and possible hazards involved. Arsenic is a groundwater contaminant of major significance to public health. It can get into the body via ingestion and absorption, for this reason it is not used as a fine dust as it can be breathed in which can cause serious health hazards. The health hazards related to arsenic range from irritation to internal bleeding for short term exposure. We have assessed the health risks and precautions which provide the appropriate protection with reduced exposure. The use of arsenic on the small scale that we needed was allowed within our labs as they have appropriate ventilation and fume cupboards. As arsenic is only used for characterisation longer term effects do not need to be considered. The risk team members working with this in the lab is set to as low as 'reasonably practicable' as it is with every hazardous compound.
Formaldehyde

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the design special prize .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
By talking about your design work on this page, there is one medal criterion that you can attempt to meet, and one award that you can apply for. If your team is going for a gold medal by building a functional prototype, you should tell us what you did on this page.
This is a prize for the team that has developed a synthetic biology product to solve a real world problem in the most elegant way. The students will have considered how well the product addresses the problem versus other potential solutions, how the product integrates or disrupts other products and processes, and how its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in positive and negative ways.
If you are working on art and design as your main project, please join the art and design track. If you are integrating art and design into the core of your main project, please apply for the award by completing this page.
Teams who want to focus on art and design should be in the art and design special track. If you want to have a sub-project in this area, you should compete for this award."

We received the data from the MALDI-TOF and the subsequent results where positive: The overexpressed protein, had formed a band on a SDS-PAGE at about 15 kDa. We hoped it would turn out to be RibE, with a molecular weight of 16,7 kDa.
Figure 3: Screenshot of the BioTools user interface showing the pure results of the MALDI-TOF.
The results show that it is indeed “riboflavin synthase beta subunit ribE” from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The mascot score was a slick 906. We want to thank Vera Ortseifen for the execution of our measurements.
Figure 4: Exported MALDI-TOF results.
For further quantitative analysis of riboflavin in culture supernatants we measured fluorescence with the Tecan Infinite® M200 platereader (The week before we had already measured absorbance). Riboflavine absorbes light at 440 nm with a corresponding emission at 535 nm. We again checked riboflavin of known quantities to compute a calibration line. The samples consisted of KRX wild type bacteria (grown for 72 hours) and KRX that carried the rib-cluster with strong Anderson promoter / strong RBS (<bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart>) (grown for 72 hours and for 12 hours respectively). Of course both cultures were nurtured in the good M9-D5.
Table 1: Pipetting scheme and measurement results of riboflavin standards and cell samples for fluorescence measurement, emission at 535 nm. Measured in the Tecan Infinite® M200 platereader . WT = wild type, And77 = E. coli equipped with <bbpart>BBa_K1172306</bbpart>, sn = supernatant, cd = cell disruption.
Y = 8*10^8 * X - 3193.6
This allowed us to evaluate the amount of riboflavin in the supernatant and the cell disruption samples.
Supernatant after 12 hours: 308.1 µg / L
Supernatant after 72 hours: 3821.5 µg /L
We asked the lab of Dr. Heino Büntemeyer if we could use their HPLC detector to verify riboflavin concentrations"

1.3 The Vision of Future Collaboration
BioBrick-A-Bot: Sharing and Collaboration in Automated BioBrick Assembly
(New Approach to Human Practice in Synthetic Biology)
Ways to Facilitate Collaboration
BioBrick-A-Bot  is a prototype of a automated BioBrick DNA assembling robot (hereafter called ‘bot’). We have demonstrated with a proof-of-principle that it works. This is only the first step. Once this is done, other iGEM teams can build and customize their own, inexpensive bots. Collaboration is made extremely easy because of the 3 design philosophies below:  replicability, interchangeability and extensibility.
Replicability
The cost of building your own bots is about US $700. The Lego Parts are easily accessible. We will provide hardware construction instructions in a document form, so that iGEM teams can follow and build ALPHA and PHI modules. We will provide RobotC source codes to iGEM teams too.  So, It is easy to replicate BioBrick-A-Bot Model C that we show in the Proof-of-Principle Demo.
Interchangeability
Interchangeability is the next logical step to collaboration and sharing. We have shown a proof-of-principle that it is possible to build two different physical implementations of ALPHA module, with different geometric configuration and physical dimensions, and still run the same software. Hence various other iGEM teams are encourage to customize their own variants of the ALPHA modules. These ALPHA modules should work seamlessly with the software provided. iGEM teams are also encourage to check in new ALPHA implementation in the registry, so as to facilitate sharing and collaborations.
Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility. This would mean adding new functionalities to BioBrick-A-Bot"

Our second collaboration was with the UC Davis team on the IGEM match website. The UC Davis team has come up with a great idea to help teams with similar projects to connect and collaborate. Teams are able to join their specific track and also see different teams on the same track and select the teams they would most like to collaborate with. However we thought that the website could be further enhanced by creating a search bar to find certain keywords when looking for a collaboration. We sent this and other feedback to The UC Davis team and they gave us the code for the website, which we edited to implement our suggestions
As part of the iGEM community we felt it was crucial to help teams any way we could so we replied to all requests we can, such as filling out surveys made by other teams. We filled out surveys for UCL, XMU-China, Munich United iGEM team, UC Davis team on the iGEM match website,  Svce on Lab techniques,  the University of Manchester on Alcohol consumption and the Virginia team on biocontainment.
Finally, we also attended the UK iGEM meetup, hosted and organised by Westminster iGEM. Here we presented our project and got to meet various teams from the UK. Not only did we meet our collaborators from UEA at the meet up, we also received and gave constructive feedback to the UK teams’ projects."

Human Practice
Brief Introduction
The human practice part of Fudan University iGEM team includes setting up an association to insure a sustainable development, funding an innovation laboratory for students in biology school, holding a Bacteria Painting Competition (BPC) to rise a wide concern of synthetic biology, communicating with other iGEM teams, attending a Chinese iGEM teams’ conference.
 
Setting up Bertalanffy Association
March, 2014
We set up an association named Bertalanffy aiming to have an organized team to put our planning of human practice into reality while publicizing iGEM and synthetic biology.
The Bertalanffy Association has two recruitment this year, one in March, another in September. We recruit not only students majoring in biology but also those who have an interest in synthetic biology or iGEM. Up to Now, Bertalanffy Association has up to 50 members including more than 10 different majors.
(New members are coming into the Bertalanffy Association)
 
Funding Innovation Laboratory
April, 2014
Since undertaking our project needs quite a lot hardware and software facilities, we funded the Innovation Laboratory with the help of School of Life Science, Fudan University. The Innovation Lab is available for students participating in competition like iGEM.
As the first settler in the Innovation Lab, our team voluntarily formulate the rules of the lab. It is strongly believed that more and more students who are fascinated by life science will join in our team or join the lab to do their own research.
(Here we are introducing the Innovation Lab to professors and students in Fudan)
 
Bacteria Painting Competition (BPC)
May, 2014
The Bacteria Painting Competition (BPC) held in June, is a competition that participators use GFP/RFP injected bacteria to draw their works on petri dishes. Thepictures will finally come to light under ultraviolet ray after a 12 hours cultivation.
More than 50 students took part in the BPC this year, and most of them chose to pay more concern on iGEM and synthetic biology after their amazing"

Human Practices
Our team knew from the start that human practices were just as important to our project as lab work, and so the dry team worked together to brainstorm and discuss some of the main issues our project might face. We wanted to look into the cures for Cholera and Shigellosis already available for those in need in the developing world; after doing some research we found out the distribution to “Third World consumes only 20% of the global supply of pharmaceuticals.”[1] From this we realised that access to pharmaceuticals is massively lacking from ordering to resupply. This became a problem we wanted to try and find a solution for, which we have incorporated into our design . We also realised that with our project using GM bacteria, the people who would potentially use our product might be concerned about that, and so decided this ethical issue was something that must also be discussed and taken into account.

Diauxic Growth Models
We have implemented serval models for diauxic growth in order to characterize our autoinduction medium. More information about them can be found in the relevant pages in the dry lab hub.
  about autoinduction and diauxic growth models.
Encapsulation: Effect of pH on cells treated with colanic acid
In this experiment, we chemically induced the production of colanic acid. This relates to our Module 2: Encapsulation.
In a multiple well plate, 2 different types of cell cultures were grown, both containing the BBa_I13522 construct, a constitutive promoter expressing GFP.
Growth rate of the cell cultures and levels of GFP expression were monitored over time, at different Ph values in order to decide if induction using colanic acid provides extra protection to the construct.
Conclusions:
Cells treated with colanic acid grow slightly faster than non-treated cells.
Fluorescence output is higher and lasts longer in cells treated with colanic acid.
  About the results.
Characterisation of BBa_K00022: Thermoinducible promoter
In this experiment, we want to investigate the behaviour of the lamda-cI thermoinducible promoter. Furthermore, this analysis serves to characterize the construct BBa_K200022 , submitted by Harvard last year.
The characterization of the thermoinducible promoter is as follows:
At 28°C, we cannot observe any fluorescence (GFP) output because its expression is repressed
At 42°C, we can observe an increase in fluorescence (GFP) output, as its expression is no longer repressed
Hence, we can conclude that in The E.ncapsulator system, an increase in temperature de-represses the expression of downstream genes, which will trigger the genome deletion phase.

HebrewU,2018,Team:HebrewU#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"'s, it appeared that they were unable to utilize 2,3,7,8 TCDD as substrate. By contrast, CYP450 deriving from canines have showed some ability to catalyze  hydroxylation of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. In 2003, an article published by Kyoto university, described a single amino acid mutation [F240A] which allowed a rat CYP enzyme to catalyze TCDD dechlorination in E. coli.3
In vivo studies suggest that the CYP-dependent metabolism includes multiple reactions such as hydroxylation at an unsubstituted position, hydroxylation with migration of a chloride substituent, hydroxylation with elimination of a chloride substituent, and opening of the dioxin ring. All of these reactions appear to be detoxication reactions of PCDDs.
Aromatic hydroxylation reactions of arenes, 7, are catalyzed by P450. The initial product is a reactive arene epoxide, 8, which then undergoes an interesting rearrangement (NIH shift) to yield a reactive keto 2,4-diene intermediate, 11. This reactive intermediate rapidly undergoes a tautomeric shift of a proton to restore aromaticity.
Further Reading:
Plant CYP450:
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) represent the largest enzyme family of the plant metabolism. Plants typically devote about 1% of the protein-coding genes for the P450s to execute primary metabolism and also to perform species-specific specialized functions including metabolism of the triterpenes. The members of the subfamilies CYP51G, CYP85A, CYP90B-D, CYP710A, CYP724B, and CYP734A are generally conserved across the plant kingdom to take part in plant primary metabolism related to the biosynthesis of essential sterols and steroid hormones. However, the members of the subfamilies CYP51H, CYP71A,D, CYP72A, CYP81Q, CYP87D, CYP88D,L, CYP93E, CYP705A, CYP708A, and CYP716A,C,E,S,U,Y are required for the metabolism and might perform species-specific functions including chemical defence toward specialized pathogens.4
Fungal CYP450:
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases of fungi are involved in many essential cellular processes and play diverse roles. The enzymes catalyze the conversion of hydrophobic intermediates of primary and secondary metabolic pathways,"

Description
In order to engage the community, we presented our iGEM 2018 Living Battery project along with a DNA Code Game to a middle school innovative underwater robotics program– also known as The SeaPerch Program. The SeaPerch Program provides students with the opportunity to learn about robotics, engineering, science, and mathematics (STEM) while building an underwater ROV as part of a science and engineering technology curriculum.  Our purpose is to educate the youth about the risks of a damaged global environment due to the greenhouse gases in our community, in addition to enlightening them on a different discipline in STEM- in this case, synthetic biology.  In order to engage the students, we taught them our DNA Code Game found in the iOS App Store.  The students had a lot of fun playing the game and learning about DNA.

Discussion
There seem to be a lot of things that can be approved in this experiment. Figure 3 and 4 clearly show an irregular concentration of eGFP being present in the hydrogel part that has been seeded. It was seeded by submerge it in a eGFP solution overnight. The irregularity can likely be resolved by submerging the hydrogel block longer in eGFP so in can be guaranteed that the centre of the hydrogel block has the same concentration eGFP as the outer regions. Another way to improve the experiment is by having a clearer cut. The surfaces of the hydrogel parts with whom there were aligned were quite rough and did not have contact along the entire surface. It is likely that this has influenced the results. The final way to improve the experiment is by making sure the hydrogel does not dry out overtime. This would extend the measuring time past the current limit of 20 hours. A way to do this could be by protecting the gel by encapsulating it better during storage and exposing it to the environment for a shorter amount of time. Also a more humid environment is expected to help. Adding new fluid to the gel will not be a good idea, since this will convection into the hydrogel.
From the combination of experiments and modelling we could estimate that the tortuosity of our hydrogel should lie somewhere between 1 and √1.5. In order to safely conclude on an effective diffusion constant of eGFP in our Dextran hydrogel the experiment still needs to be improved upon.
Conclusion
By using eGFP, which has a similar weight to that of lysostaphin gained insight in transport of lysostaphin. We saw that diffusion times of lysostaphin within our patch will lie in the range of 24 hours. It can be concluded that the experiment that was done is a promising way to measure the effective diffusion constant of a particle in a hydrogel. In order to improve the accuracy of the experiment one should let the source part of the hydrogel incubate longer than one day with eGFP. Also cleaner cuts in the gel should be made.

Question/Answer
Q1: 98% of the patients have the mutation C282Y/C282Y. We know that this mutation is Celtic, but how can we explain the 2% who have another mutation?
A1: When we notice a major iron overload and a heterozygosity, we look for another mutation: sometimes it is indeed another mutation, but sometimes it is a heterozygosity with two different mutations of HFE gene (but it is very very rare).
We notice a great variety of symptoms, but the personal particularities are still uninterpretable.
Q2: What do we do with H63D patients?
A2: Nothing.
Q2': Even if their serum ferritin values reach 1200?
A2': The most frequent causes of high serum ferritin value are metabolic (alcohol, excess weight, etc.). The H63D patients are rarely iron overloaded.
Q3: Was the HFE mutation C282Y once an advantage?
A3: It was probably once a selective advantage against postpartum haemorrhage for example. But today it is no longer the case. A high amount of heterozygosity is often due to the fact that it was once a selective advantage.
Q4: Does the immune system age more quickly with frequent bloodletting? Has it been researched?
A4: No. But the life expectancy of an early diagnosed patient is average, even slightly above because hemochromatosis patients have a better medical follow-up. And iron overload is far more toxic than immune system aging.
Marie-Paule Roth: ""Link between HFE, hepcidin and BMP6""
Summary
What are the pathways of Hepcidin regulation? So far, we know that a large number of proteins are involved in hepcidin synthesis, mainly BMP6, Hemojuvenile, ALK3 and SMAD4. The inactivation of one of these molecules leads to iron overload (this has been demonstrated in knockout mice). Studies on mice has revealed an important role of testosterone on the activation of EGF receptors, which are present in the liver and which is a repressor of hepcidin. In the biosynthesis cascade of hepcidin, the exact role of the HFE protein is still unclear but according to the current research hypotheses of Marie-Paul Roth's team, it seems it is involved in 2 pathways: One with BMP6 and one with BMP2.

EPF-Lausanne,2008,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Our goal was to produce a system as simple as possible giving patterns as complex as possible.  We therefore decided to use only two quorum sensing systems - and two fluorescent proteins - while testing various network geometries and rule sets. We tried two different fluidic networks, determining the patterns formed by all possible rule-sets. We mean by ""rule-set"" the law determining the output response of the system to a given input.
The first fluidic network, with simple connections, gave two simple patterns, like the ""barcode"" one.
The second network, with more complex connectivity, gave more interesting patterns like the ""triangles"" one.
We choose to keep the ""triangles"" pattern, and to try to implement its rule set, given in the following table. You can see the desired expression level of each fluorescent protein on the graph below.

The genetic circuit which will be implemented in the cells is the following :
Pattern:
This genetic circuit must give this following pattern :
Plasmids:
Our system introduces a new plasmid in a pre-existing system (""A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern formation"", from Ron Weiss et al., Nature, vol.434, April 2005) which detects different levels of the luxI quorum sensing molecule and gives a specific response according to the detected or observed concentration . As shown on the previous genetic circuit, we will clone the gene coding for the RhlI molecule at the 3' end of the GFP gene, with C4-HSL being our second quorum sensing molecule used.  In addition to the two Ron Weiss system plasmids, we have to build an additional plasmid for the second part of the proposed genetic circuit. We will add an extra copy of the lacIm gene from the Ron Weiss system so that we can test it independently from the latter system.
Here is the scheme of the plasmid with the Registry of Standard Parts references for each Biobrick that is used.
Response:
The response of our network depends on the incoming signal. Four cases can be found :
1) GGG
If there is green but no red, the AHLRhl will bind to the RhlR to allow transcription of lacIm . This LacIm will inhibit transcription of both the GFP and the tetR genes. This"

Introduction:  Today gel extraction and digestion of PCquad 3.0 will be done.  If permitting, ligation will also be done.
Procedures: Gel extraction was performed as indicated by zymo procedures.  The concentration was measured using the nanodrop.  78.78ng/uL.  260/280 = 3.23.
Since the yield was too low, another round of amplification will need to be done before digestion.
Conclusions:  There weren’t any restriction enzymes available to use, so digestion will be done next week.  PCR amplification will be done in a larger volume for PCquad 3.0 as well.

Your title
The first weeks of our project (Week 12 - Week 19) we spent a lot of time in brainstorming sessions. Before ending to our final project theme, we came up with many meetings where all the team and the instructors were present. Each meeting had each special purpose; each of us had to study previous iGEM projects, articles and any other available source of information in order to come up with ideas about potential iGEM topics.
For these choices also helped the crash course we had in collaboration with the Amsterdam  2012 iGEM team Those topics had to be enhanced with structured arguments, always keeping in mind whether they could stand as iGEM project. Additionally, they were criticised by all members trying to focus on some directions and excluding others. Those meetings helped us a lot in understanding what iGEM stands for, what we want to succeed and how we could satisfy our wills as a team with students with different knowledge background. We not only learned how to argue about our choices, but also how to collaborate with each other and become an enduringly more tight team. By the 15th Week we came up with final 9 topics; those were:
9. Frame shifting
8. Smelling bacteria
7. Bioprinting
6. Bee colony
5. Bactocamera
4. Biosphere
3. Bio-solar panel
2. Min E. coli
1. Immune E.coli
And later, the 17th Week there was a presentation debate about the final 2 topics: Smelling Yeast and Antibeast.  The people who gave advice were: Han de Winde, Juan Keymer, Bertus Beaumont, Chirlmin Joo, Daniel Solis Escalante, Niels Kuijpers, Fabai"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," designed it seems to globally advance people. Patients suffering from chronic wounds or burn wounds will benefit from the plaster, and so will other people as our design diminishes the burden of antibiotic resistance. It may be argued that animals also benefit from the latter, as they also suffer from bacterial infections. Moreover, the plaster could replace current antibiotics administered to livestock. Things get more complicated when we consider Gelcatraz as a platform for GMO use outside of the laboratory. By making working with GMOs safer and more convenient, we may accelerate the use of GMOs in regulated environments as well as in less controlled environments. The desirability of the widespread use of GMOs could be the topic of a separate ethical discussion and is beyond the scope of this analysis. Nevertheless, we should only launch our system for use outside of laboratories if the safety of our device can be demonstrated and regulations should ensure that only GMOs classified as ‘low-risk’ are allowed. When people use Gelcatraz within a laboratory environment, they do not need special equipment to work safely with the platform.
Another reason why prudent vigilance would be important comes from the dealing with novel technologies which have not yet been thoroughly tested. Interestingly, SYNBIOSAFE highlighted the need for new risk assessment methods in three cases: a) when larger DNA-based circuits are built based on individual ‘parts’, b) when new minimal organisms are designed and c) when alternative biochemical structures are involved (3) . The first case is generally applicable to iGEM with its emphasis on BioBricking. Although we do build new circuits, their complexity remains limited. This means that the functioning of the circuits should remain predictable, limiting the additional risks involved. We also tested our constructs thoroughly. The latter two cases are not directly related to our project, but the third one may be if we implement an artificial amino acid-based kill switch. Although we would implement the kill switch to enhance the safety of our design, we should be aware of the level of unpredictability added by such a novel biochemistry. The authors do not elaborate on the type of risk assessment methods they envision. However, the need for new risk assessment methods means that we must take a vigilant stance during the design process.
3. Intellectual freedom and responsibility
Here, the risk of malevolent ‘dual-use’ should be recognized. That is, the abuse of SynBio technologies for dubious cases. The commission does not believe that this risk is high enough to justify the limitation of intellectual freedom. Instead, it calls for “regulatory parsimony”: no more surveillance than strictly required to ensure justice, fairness, security, and safety, as this"

USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," a synthetic biology solution for a given situation. The situations they have to deal with go from light production to saving an entire city from hunger! They should use the cards they receive, which represent BioBricks, to design a plasmid that will be put into an E.coli in order to resolve the problem. To win the game player has to convince the opponent that his/her plasmid construction and solution are both terrific and going to work well.
We have seen how the BioMech was easily assimilated by people and  useful in transmitting knowledge. The game was applied at the “Semana Temática da Biologia”, in english “Thematic Week of Biology” (TWB), an annual biology event that happens at Institute of Biosciences of University of São Paulo, where BioMech was played by college students (target audience of TWB).
Undergraduate students playing BioMech at TWB
The players just needed a little explanation of how the game works and then they got involved by the problem they have to solve. We were amazed with the constructions and proposals of solutions that the players found, some a little bit funny and some well elaborated but both well thought out and argued. And that is one of the characteristics of the the game, to arouse argumentation and defense of a viewpoint.
Just as we desired, BioMech showed to be a fun and simple way to learn about synthetic biology, and having this type of game available in our language is by itself a great achievement. Because we need new and stimulant ways of learning which are interesting to people, even more when talking about a subject that is unfamiliar to most people like Synthetic Biology is, and we are really proud of it.
Survey - evaluating the application of the game
Before each new player enjoyed the game and received the instructions of how to play it, we talked to them about BioTROJAN and the issue of mosquito-borne diseases. We think that to play BioMech and to know BioTROJAN concepts has the power of improve the players' knowledge of the topics covered. In order to verify the possible impact of BioMech on its players, we did a survey comparing two groups: BioMech Players (Group 1) and Non-BioMech Player (Group 2).
The survey (a version in english of it can be seen here ) was applied to Group 1 after its played BioMech and to Group 2 without having played BioMech, all of the survey’s participants were life sciences undergraduate students from 18 to 24 years old. We only did the survey with N = 9 for both groups,"

Synthetic biology is a relatively new industry with a lot to offer - with applications ranging from the use of alternative biofuels, contribution to human health, detecting pathogens and the conversion of feedstock to chemicals.
The growth of this industry seems to be at threat as funding opportunities are narrow. In comparison to American and European researchers, the Australian field of Synthetic Biology receives significantly less money. A report released in 2010 reveals that United States received a sum total of roughly 430 million dollars in funding for Synthetic Biology research (Kuiken, 2010). European researchers in Netherlands, UK and Germany have received a sum total of $160 million in the same time period (Kuiken, 2010). In comparison, the Australian Synthetic Biology funding landscape is limited, particularly when when it comes to funding from the public sector. There appears to be no publicly funded Synthetic Biology research projects.
The grim state of funding for Synthetic Biology research also translates into minimal funding for iGEM teams. This is primarily because of the lack of visibility of Synthetic Biology research in Australia, coupled with a lack of confidence in the capability of undergraduate research. In our experience, private funding is also notoriously hard to get, primarily because most relevant organizations (biotechnology companies, lab equipment companies etc.) are usually based in North America or Europe and regional subsidiaries are unlikely to have the budget to fund teams in the Oceania region.
We are very grateful as we have been fortunate to have received external sponsorship for our project this year.
A huge thank you to our Gold sponsors!
Also many thanks to our Bronze sponsors!

Its sole modification, however, is its ability to degrade methane so no dangers come along with it. If E. cowli should unexpectedly leave the rumen a proposed kill switch shall make sure that it does not proliferate any further. Apart from these issues, our methane-degrading bacterium would allow for the maintenance of high production standards while simultaneously rendering them more climate-friendly.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". Lower production of milk could also result in a healthier cow because the cow can put more energy in its own immune system. In order to bring the disease burden down, the environment and food for the cow should be adjusted accordingly. The stress on the animal should be minimized as stress has negative effects on the immune system of the cows. According to Gerbrich the solution to the antibiotic resistance problem is further reducing the use of antibiotics in all sectors of livestock farming. Besides this she thinks reducing the transport of animals can improve the situation as then the spreading of the resistant bacteria becomes less. When transport is necessary hygiene is of utter importance!

Function
Cow farmer and breeder at Domela Holsteins
Insights
There are plenty of different diseases that play a role in the dairy industry.
Fast diagnosis is essential to minimize loss of cattle and productivity, since most illnesses cannot be prevented.
While only sick cows are treated with antibiotics, more antibiotics are potentially used in the chicken and pig industry.
Para-infectious diseases (spread through manure) are especially tricky.
The tool should neither be too complicated, nor take a lot of time.
Changes
Research into the chicken and pig industry.
Research into Bovine Virus Diarrhoea, a para-infectious disease.
Summary
As a farmer, Machiel aims to deliver qualitatively good cow milk as inexpensive as possible. In 2014 his company started to buy embryos to enhance the animal’s properties through breeding. These are strong races with health certificates.
Machiel informed us about different diseases that play a role in the dairy industry, such as Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR; viral) and pneumonia. For some (like IBR), animals can be vaccinated. However, often this is not the case. So, the only thing that can be done to minimize the loss of cattle and productivity, is quick diagnosis of illnesses. Currently, a blood sample takes approximately half a week to be analysed.
According to Machiel, no antibiotics are given to cows (in the Netherlands) unless they are sick. This is potentially different in the chicken and pig industry, which he suggested us to look into. Furthermore, he recommended research in para-infectious diseases, i.e. diseases spread via manure (e.g. Bovine Virus Diarrhoea).
With regards to our tool, Machiel thinks this would be very useful. However, the tool should then neither be too complicated, nor take a lot of time, as farmers generally do not have much spare time.
