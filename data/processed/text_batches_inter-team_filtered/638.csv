Best Hardware Special Prize
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
To compete for the Best Hardware prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Day 4:
Ogaga, Lamya and Sam continued updating the spreadsheet. The team had our bi-weekly meeting with our supervisors. Chris and Max reviewed modelling challenges, while Sam, Max and Charlie planned a trip to Dundee for the debate collaboration with The University of Dundee iGEM team.
Day 5:
We got DNA that we had ordered from iGEM, as well as our sequenced Biobrick DNA from DNA 2.0.  Charlie tested a potential lysing agent (SDS) for the Kill Switch Proof protocol, but found that the bubbles it created were interfering with the experimental absorbance readings.  The modelling team continued to read papers while Ogaga, Lamya and Sam continued gathering information for our human practices component.
Week 5 - 8/08/11
Day 1:
We had our bi-weekly meeting. The modelling team read papers and found a few regarding the σ 70 ribosome, which relates to transcription rates.  They emailed John Mitchell about pBAD promoter advice and transcription details. The human practices team continued gathering information for the iGEM review. We also extracted DNA from the DNA 2.0 shipment.
Day 2:
We transformed our Biobrick sequence into supercompetent E. coli, as well as plated normal supercompetent E. coli for use as control experiments in the near future.  Max and Chris tried to create a hybrid system of equations, taking components from last year's modelling project, as well as components other past iGEM teams such as Berkeley 2008. At the end of the day, they were still left with a lot of unknown constants that they had been trying to source from papers.
Day 3:
Sam, Max and Charlie visited Dundee to make plans concerning the debate collaboration. They met with John Urch, head of the Revealing Research Dundee, and members of the University of Dundee iGEM team, to discuss the format of the debate and the details of the proceedings.  Ogaga made overnights to test our promoter functionality the next day. Lamya and Ogaga continued gathering information for iGEM review.
Day 4:
We had our bi-weekly meeting with our advisors. Max and Chris received modelling help from our advisors, and plowed ahead into more papers to try and find the constants required for their models.  Sam and Charlie did a test run of the Kill Switch Proof"

WashU
We engaged in communication with WashU on the 8th August to discuss a potential collaboration. Their project aims to detect stem rust in wheat, caused by Puccinia graminis, and potentially find a way to create GM wheat resistant to the fungal infection. The team proposed we collaborated with them in two ways.
Firstly, their project uses a poorly characterised bacterial operon that responds to and is activated by the presence of ribulose. Consequently, as not much is known about the sequence, we offered to test the operons control region directly in plants, in case it had some activity. We did this by putting the control region upstream of two reporter genes, Gus and mCherry, with the NosT terminator downstream. We tested their control region both in the presence and absence of ribitol, a hydrogenated version of ribulose. The results can be seen below. In doing this, we had to create a version of their control region that was GoldenGate compatible. This is part BBa_K2810010 .
Figure 1. The results of our wetlab collaboration with the WashU iGEM team. We tested the expression of their ribitol control element in plants, linking it to two reporter genes. These were GUS (top), and mCherry (bottom). We found that there was expression of both reporter genes, independent of induction by ribitol, suggesting leaky expression. However, we suspect that the Ag"

Prospects
How would we make Bacto-Aid?
Even though we spent hundreds of hours in the lab, we did not end up standing with the Bacto-Aid in our hands in Boston. But do not worry - we got a plan for how you can end up with our bandage. On this page we will enlighten you about the next steps in our project, which we would have followed if the days contained more than 24 hours or if we had a bunch of effective minions available. These steps have to be fulfilled before we can create a full functional patch that can be used in hospitals and in the everyday life.
Making a 4 monomer silk construct
There were some difficulties with producing a longer silk construct, and whether it was due to the reproducibility of UCLA's method  or the too old streptavidin beads, we did not have the time to find out. However, the first step would then, of course, be to try the ICA method with new streptavidin beads.
As soon as a 4 monomer silk construct is produced, we would insert it into E. coli and purify it from the bacteria. Here, we would have liked to try a purification method without the use of His-tag, because earlier literature have demonstrated that recombinant silk produced without a His-tag have better mechanical properties compared to the fibres made from silk proteins with a His-tag Tokareva, O., et al. (2013). ""Recombinant DNA production of spider silk proteins."" Microbial Biotechnology 6(6): 651-663. .
For the spinning of silk, we would first have tried to spin our silk by wet spinning, which is a very simple and inexpensive method Teulé, F., et al. (2013). ""A protocol for the production of recombinant spider silk-like proteins for artificial fiber spinning."" Nature Protocols 4(3): 341-355. . In relation to using the recombinant silk for wound healing, it could also be interesting to prepare a three dimensional scaffold of the silk. Here a number of methods, such as salt"
Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM team.The Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team demonstrated that the degradation of catechol to 2-HMS by xylE is successful using E. coli as the chassis7. The same spectroscopy methods used to characterize xylE will be used to detect the production of 2-HMS – an easily detectable compound due to its yellow colour – in the presence or absence of xylT as a measure of catechol degradation. To further optimize the xylE/xylT system, compartmentalization of the proteins into biological MCs will also be performed. Close proximity of xylE and xylT within the MC will facilitate rapid reactivation of xylE by xylT, increasing the efficiency of catechol degradation.
The protein, lumazine synthase (LS), will be used for compartmentalization of xylE and xylT. To target xylE and xylT into the negative interior of the LS MC, a positively charged poly-arginine tag will be used. However, the positive tag may impair the function of the target protein, xylE or xylT, depending on its position at the N-terminus or C-terminus. It has been demonstrated that adding a poly-arginine tag to the C-terminus of a protein does not affect its function, while an N-terminal tag may significantly reduce a protein’s activity22. The Lethbridge 2010 iGEM team confirmed this by individually tagging the N- and C-termini of both cyan and yellow fluorescent protein (CFP and YFP, respectively) and demonstrated that the N-terminally tagged proteins were inactive. Together, CFP and YFP are a well known fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair that will be used as a proof-of-principle demonstrating successful co-localization in the LS MC. FRET is a distance dependent phenomenon that involves the transfer of energy from an excited donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore and results in a decrease in the fluorescence signal from the donor coupled to an increase in the fluorescence signal from the acceptor when the fluorophores are in close proximity.
With successful co-localization demonstrated using the CFP/YFP FRET system, optimized conditions will be used to co-localize xylE and xylT within the MC. BioBricks for xylE, xylT, and both N- and C-terminal poly-arginine tagged xylE and xylT will be assembled into constructs, tested, and submitted to the parts registry."
SJTU-Software,2015,Team:SJTU-Software#project_-_-_TEXT.html," with igem team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. Our goal is to evaluate their biobrick by scoring two parallel experiment results. We got the new devices and its structure from SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and noticed that the parts were built by themselves not long ago. When we downloaded the database data, they had not uploaded their new biobrick. So we could not find the parts' ID from the new devices in our database.
In order to evaluate the new parts, we use BLAST to find the parts with most similar sequences compared to the new parts in our database. Then we use the parts found in our database to evaluate the new devices. We found the coding parts in the device are most important, so our algorithm give the coding part a highest weight.
And the consequence of this collaboration is very ideal. The two devices got two disparate scores, one of which is scored 32.98 and the other is 3.542. In addition, this difference is also reflected by their experiment result that the one with the higher score is chosen as their final biobrick to control the expression of the iron pump.
So this collaboration proves that our algorithm can evaluate new device roughly on the base of existing part.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," stress, our research has shown that the system is in need of a genomic improvement that can be provided with GSH and FucO (Kim & Hahn, 2013). This can be inferred from the fact that an increase in GSH enhances tolerance to furfural but not to 5-HMF, while FucO on the other hand is in need of GSH as it provides a longer lifespan and deals with the interactions of free radicals (Kim & Hahn, 2013).
So, we have come to the conclusion that the simultaneous overexpression of GSH and FucO would increase cellular growth rates, lifespan and ethanol yield in E. coli ethanologenic strain KO11 since GSH is the master antioxidant in living organisms coping with ROS; and FucO is the gene that converts HMF & furfural to non-toxic alcohols without interfering with the NADPH metabolism (Ask et al., 2013; Höck et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011).
Figure 9: Our representation of using Bio-E in the fermentation process. The significance that Bio-E makes is higher ethanol yield, intact and tolerant bacteria and the conversion furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A this year is to design a biological system aiming to alleviate intestinal inflammatory diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose E. coli Nissle 1917 as our chassis, a probiotic that is safe for humans. On the one hand, when it senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it releases an anti-inflammatory compound (interleukin-10) to put out the fire in the intestines. On the other hand, it can release myrosinase to convert the glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. The sulforaphane can both alleviate inflammation in the intestine and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic inflammation.

For details of whole project design, please click to Design
As a therapeutic project, we know that it is very difficult to verify the entire system in less than a year. We split the entire system into three core parts to verify separately: the nitric oxide sensor (nitric oxide is a marker of inflammation), protein transport and production, and the kill switch. In addition, we test them in DH5α and BL21. We believe that the success of these core parts will ultimately make the system work in the real world.

Interviews with prominent academics, like Prof. Richard Dawkins and Prof. Richard     Titball about their thoughts on public engagement and the importance of Biosafety,     respectively.
We hosted a panel discussion on equality and diversity at the university creating a two     way conversation with the public on the topic.
We designed a synthetic biology module for second year Bioscience students.
We hosted three separate work experience students , who gave direct input on how to    improve both lab and human practices aspects of our project.
We attended the Westminster UK iGEM meet-up and communicated with various teams via skype    throughout the process.

The effectiveness of kill switches was discussed with academics and individuals in industry to inform our experiments. We then tested what    was discussed and designed parts to address the major concerns.
Integrated: Equality and Diversity -
We took a different approach to Integrated Human Practices by integrating the Equality and Diversity work into itself - each interview influenced the next forming a     grounded analysis of the issue.
Whilst not strictly Integrated, our board game; BioMech, embeds the principles of our lab work - biosafety and effective plasmid construction - into a fun     and engaging educational tool.
Equally, we have provided a framework for the implementation of a Synthetic Biology Module at our University in order to provide a better understanding of the field to fill the gap in knowledge we found during our human practices. Assessment is in the style of the iGEM jamboree
Improve a previous part or project:
We have further characterised KillerRed by testing it under a wider range of conditions and quantified the length of time for it to remain viable as a kill switch.
We have improved Lysozyme C by adding a signal peptide targeting it to the periplasm where it is most effective.
Proof of concept
We used a ministat array to test the longevity of kill switches and to simulate their real world application in an industrial chemostat setting.
Demonstrate your work:
We are bringing the latest version of our board game (BioMech) to the Jamboree , demonstrating its gameplay and highlighting how we implemented    feedback from schools and science fairs."
Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Alberta 2009 iGEM team , The system was further optimized as an easy-to-use teaching kit, Genomikon, which was the Alberta 2010 team project .  This updated incarnation (RDP) has the potential to radically improve the accessibility of synthetic biology. It seems only fitting that our Genspace 2015 iGEM team would evaluate it and suggest improvements as part of our Human Practices.
Genspace first receiving the Synbiota kit
Preparing a part to be used in the RDP system is similar to the biobricking process. Primers adding the RDP prefix and suffix are used to generate assembly-ready parts using PCR. However, we found the assembly process to be very much faster and easier with less equipment required. The only equipment required is a magnet and a pipettor. DNA parts are added sequentially to an anchor part tethered to iron beads, Parts are added sequentially with ligation and wash steps at room temperature, all in the same tube, and exch step taking less than half an hour. The completed construct is released from an iron bead by treatment with a base solution and is transformation-ready. As an example, the dual-plasmid system testing LsrR/pLsrA2r would have taken weeks to build by 3A assembly, yet we did it in a couple of days.
We strongly recommend this system to other community lab groups, and are planning to add a video tutorial of the process to the Genspace website.
In order to reach an even greater segment of the New York City community, we engaged in the following additional Human Practices activities during iGEM:
Public Engagement around Synthetic Biology at the NY Hall of Science
On the 23rd of August, we participated in the Building with Biology event at the New York Hall of Science in Queens. This event was part of the NSF-funded Multi-Site Public Engagement with Synthetic Biology (MSPES) grant. Its primary goal is to convene conversations around synthetic biology and its societal implications between synthetic biology researchers and the public.  Our event was part of the prototyping cycle aimed at developing specific engagement activities around synthetic biology.. The grant will culminate in the creation of materials for these activities that will allow them to be implemented at 200 informal science education sites in a national ""summer of synbio"" to take place in 2016.
About half of our iGEM team participated in this event. At an orientation meeting at the NY Hall of Science we were allowed to choose between several types of activities for the demo to the public on the Sunday. Although the physical objects were"

As we are dealing with bacteria, work under a flame!
First, prepare the medium in a falcon tube. One tube per colonie you will pick:
5 ml LB medium (be careful not to touch the walls of the bottle!)
5ul ampicillin (or other antibiotic)
Then, for each colonie, drop a tip in it (don't make a hole in the agar) and put the tip in the tube. The tubes should be incubated overnight at 37°C; put the tubes 30°C inclined.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,". We then engaged all of these students in a discussion about synbio and engineering ethics in a forum on whether or not the proposed solution of terraforming Mars was reasonable and ethical. Each student first read a short article explaining more context and highlighting various options as possible paths of action. All of these options encouraged students to consider and discuss biologists’ responsibilities to human civilization, other life forms, and the environment.
We had an opportunity to show these young women our research and the microfluidic devices and control infrastructure we build for the devices. Again, most students had never heard of these devices, but we were able to show that these devices had practical uses in the lab.
Industry and Lab Visits
Our educational and public outreach allowed us to teach younger generations and members of the public about synthetic biology, and about microfluidics. Much to our surprise, microfluidic devices were not well known by most people we spoke too.
To gather more information about how synthetic biologists use microfluidics, we staged several visits to biotech companies that use synthetic biology, and we even spoke to a microfluidic fabrication company.
Ginkgo BioWorks | 28 JUNE 2016
The first company we visited was Ginkgo Bioworks. In this short visit, we toured their Boston based facility and had the opportunity to learn both about their research, and about the tools they use to do synthetic biology. The detail that stood out to us the most was: Whoa, they sure do have a lot of hardware! As a hardware team, we strive to enable synthetic biologists by creating software and hardware that accelerates research and discovery: Ginkgo Bioworks had no shortage of tools to enable rapid discovery and characterization. They had tools to automate as much of the synthetic biology workflow as possible: PCR tools, pipetting machines and software to keep track of all device characterization.
As it would turn out, we learned that some hardware that Ginkgo used did incorporate microfluidic technology. Some devices that are used to measure expression of certain proteins in a sample do so using microliters of a sample, and these devices have built-in microfluidics. Needless to say, this equipment was very specialized and incredibly high cost.
Aside from very specialized machines that incorporated microfluidics, we found that Ginkgo did not use these devices in their regular workflow.
Lab Central & Sembler | 23 JUNE 2016
At this point we were very curious: our investigations led us to conclude that microfluidics were not widely known about by the public, and in industry and research these devices"
UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Dental hygiene_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression of the structural gene mutA to make a prepropeptide, comprising a C-terminal propeptide and an N-terminal leader peptide from which the former undergoes processing and the latter is cleaved off before export into the medium (4). The specific post-translational modifications make mutacin III distinct from other bacteriocins and are introduced by enzymes coded for by other genes in the locus (mutBCDP).
Based on sequence homologies of genes in the locus with those of other lantibiotic biosynthetic loci it can be inferred that these enzymes catalyze the dehydration (MutB) and cyclization (MutC) of the propeptide serine and threonine residues which can condense with a neighboring cysteine residue (6) leading to the formation of lanthionine or methyllanthionine (thioether) bridges, respectively. The enzyme coded by mutD catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue (7) while the product of mutP is a serine protease which cleaves the leader peptide and is likely the last step in the biosynthesis (8).
The mature mutacin III is composed of rings connected by flexible linkers (Fig. 2) which may be important in the mechanism of bacteriocidal activity (9). Following export, the peptide is believed to form transmembrane pores as monomer aggregates leading to membrane disruption and efflux of cellular components (10). The content of anionic phospholipids in the membrane has been suggested to be an important factor influencing initial binding – mutacin III has a net positive charge whereas Gram-positive bacteria have a high relative amount of anionic lipids (11).
Fig. 2. The structure of mature mutacin III thought to be identical to mutacin 1140 (8).
In one investigation of the activity of mutacin-related lantibiotic gallidermin it became clear that lantibiotics are more effective in preventing biofilm formation rather than in exterminating microorganisms already embedded in biofilms (12). To reflect this, our device could be used to transform E. coli cells and employed as an anti-cariogenic strategy in replacement therapy (Fig. 3). Such a novel bacterial strain would demonstrate features of a successful effector strain as it would not cause disease by itself and because it could displace the host pathogenic bacteria.
Importantly, there are very few existing examples of lantibiotic resistance compared with antibiotics and only one mechanism of resistance to mutacin III, known as CprRK in Clostr"

Kevin and Chris ran a PCR to produce a component for the final construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. The first reaction did not yield the expected results. Two more were prepared for comparison.
Tuesday, June 19, 2012
Hannah and Kevin extracted plasmids from the CBAR cultures again to get a higher yield for sequencing. Victoria and Alexander worked on the Codon Optimization construct by culturing insert components. They also extracted plasmids with the desired components for the final construct. These components were digested, run in a gel, extracted, and Cleaned and Concentrated. Kevin and Chris ran a gel to compare the PCR runs set up yesterday. This showed that the PCR runs had not yielded the desired components. Another PCR run was prepared and run a lower temperature for better annealing. Hannah ran a gel of her CBAR plasmid digests to see if they contained the correct parts. Unfortunately both gels showed that the plasmids were self ligations of a single component of the construct.
Wednesday, June 20, 2012
Victoria developed a new method for the assembly of the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah designed primers for the main construct for the Multiple Start Codons project. Kevin and Chris ran gels and extracted components for the final construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. They also ran another set of PCR to make more of the three components for the CBAR assembly they will need to do. Kait and Alexander extracted plasmids containing components for the Codon Optimization Construct.

We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer drug molecules that were not tested before, and proven to be effective alter on.
Deep down we already knew the question we wanted to ask - can we generate novel enzymes using the Generative Adversarial Networks?
Setting the goals
Despite the recent success of GANs in various field, to the best of our knowledge, no one attempted to apply this novel technique to proteins. In a way, it can be explained by the great complexity of such task. In order to proceed, one would need to re-design the architecture of GAN networks that work well with images and audio, to architecture that works well with sequences of amino acids.
This is why we have decided to create the world first Generative Adversarial Networks for Enzymatic Sequence generation.
We believe that the development of such framework will facilitate the discovery of novel and useful enzymes and accelerate the field of synthetic biology and protein engineering immensely.

The longest needle, extending to the bottom of the tube, is attached to a peristaltic pump tube and filter for culture aeration. The shortest needle draws and dispenses unused media from a reagent bottle via a peristaltic pump. The last, a medium length needle used for overflow, attaches through a tube to a second reagent bottle; the height of this needle's tip is adjusted to set culture volume. With both peristaltic pumps running, air inflow pushes excess media through the medium-length needle.

We finally got the strain we requested from Dr. Aguilar in Barcelona (Strain E-15 EG3), and we also received the primers for the glycoaldehyde reductase compatibility with an aerobic environment, so that was exciting. We similarly got a stock of ethylene glycol for which we can test the activity of the enzymes, and began culturing on it. We also continued our work on the SOEing procedure, trying to remove the Pstl restriction sites from the sequences after a brief mix up yesterday. We also got in contact with another professor here at UC Davis that does work in textiles and material sciences, and obtained some samples of PET that we can use in our assays of our enzyme.
Wednesday August 1st
After talking with our advisor we decided to pursue the Entrepreneurial track in the iGEM competition. We ran a PCR on Reaction 7 and Reaction 8. After, we ran the products on a gel and PCR purified them. The screening gel showed Reaction 8 to be successful as well!
Thursday August 2nd
We skyped with the UC Merced team and looked at possible collaborations we could possibly have with them. It was also a chance for us to impart some of our knowledge to them, as this is their first year participating in the iGEM competition. We also spoke with the CEO of Micromidas Inc., a green technology startup based in Sacramento that does work in taking waste water and sludge, and through microbial processes, generating biodegradable plastics for marketing. This gave us some insight into the economic situation of the environmental market and how we could conduct an economic analysis of our project. We got the Cutinase. Transformed that into DH5α and MG1655 and we left that overnight. Ran a gel of many of our cutinase constructs, various backbones and both dehydrogenase and reductase.
Friday August 3rd
We ran a gel and PCR purification of the PCR from yesterday, adding an Eco cut site to the reductase and dehydrogenase parts. After, a gel extraction on the digest of reaction 8 was also done. (pg. 24 of Sahar's notebook)

Welcome!
This year, the University of Calgary iGEM team aims to build a biosensor for naphthenic acids (NAs). NAs are organic acids that are toxic to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. Because they are waste products of the bitumen extraction process that mines petroleum from the Alberta oil sands, the accumulation of NAs in the on-site settling ponds (tailings ponds) is an environmental concern requiring constant monitoring and eventual remediation. In addition to harming the environment, NAs also contribute to refinery equipment corrosion, directly increasing maintenance and replacement costs. Currently, sophisticated and expensive procedures, such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, are needed to identify and assess NA concentrations in the environment. A bacterial sensor, if developed, could greatly improve the cost- and time-efficiency of NA detection, and facilitate a workable approach for remediation.
Our Naphthenic Acid Biosensor
A detailed description of our project can be seen here ! Below is a picture of what our final product will look like. We will have our biosensing bacterium in a container that the sample to be measured can be added to.
Roll over the bacterium below!
An NA-Sensitive Promoter
The most critical component of our biosensor is a naphthenic acid sensory element. This would likely be a promoter element. The major challenge for this was that given the lack of available information on NA degradation, there was no NA sensitive promoter available in the literature for us to use. We needed to develop methods to search for such an element. These included our novel “fishing” method as well as our bioinformatics approach. Click on the promoter to learn more about this!
An Electrochemical Reporter
We need a reliable reporter for our system. Given the highly variable and often turbid nature of oil sands tailings ponds however, we needed a special kind of reporter. We chose to use the lacZ gene, but characterize it as an electrochemical reporter"

The plasmid backbone was digested with phosphotase enzyme. These backbones were ligated to dCas9 over 18 hours at 16 degrees C to ensure maximum ligation product.
Considerable time spent working with RBS library calculator. Calculations ran to determine max TIR for the leader sequence that was designed as well as with the enzyme restriction site (Pst1) downstream of the RBS.

Emily purified the ligation product.
Calculations from yesterday yield very high TIR. Still no good libraries, though. Libraries ran using new initial conditions.

The ligation failed. We amplified more of the dCas9 system using PCR Rescue, in which 2 out of 4 PCR's were successful - both Emily's!. We are evaluating this difficult PCR and will be altering the annealing temperature. PCR Rescue for dCas9 were repeated at 58 degrees C and 62 degrees C annealing temperature. We inoculated LB broth with ampicillin resistance and dCas9 from cryogenic stock. We also conducted colony PCR of the second set of genome overlaps. We received our sequencing results and two out of three colonies have the correct sequence.
Overnight cultures of transformed cells streaked on plates.

PCR Rescue colE1 origin and chloramphenicol resistance cassette to construct plasmid 2, which will contain ColE1, CmR, RFP, HMF pathway, and two P. putida genome overlaps. We plasmid prepared new dCas9 to use as a template for PCR. New and old dCas9 templates were used for PCR Rescue of the third genome overlap. See the schematic here for more information.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," of two arms: Firstly, the acceptor-minihelix, where the ncAA will be attached to the 3' end and secondly, the anticodon containg arm. Synthetases interact mainly with the acceptor minihelix of the tRNA. Example measurement proving incorporation of amino acids:
Figure 2:  normalized fluorescence spectrum of mRFP1
Figure 3:  normalized fluorescence spectrum of sfGFP as a sign for successful amino acid incorporation via tRNA/synthetase pair for tyrosine via amber supression
The wild type Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair for incorporation of tyrosine at an amber termination codon (the pair containing the tRNA mentioned above) is co-transformed with pFRY , a flourescent reporter plasmid for measurement of incorporation of ncAA into BL21 DE3 gold, which is induced by 100 µM IPTG. pFRY is one part of the two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation efficiency of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two fluorescent domains connected by a linker sequence containing an amber stop. If induced with IPTG, the fluorescence can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated in response to the recoded amber stop codon, a green fluorescence intensity is also measurable. Fidelity and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of fluorescent levels. This experiment is performed in order to obtain fluorescence spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP. As shown above (fig. 3) GFP formation is measured as a result of successful amino acid incorporation via amber supression. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1 (fig. 2), and sfGFP (fig. 3) were obtained through measurements with an online-measurement set-up. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#TiffanyNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," creating devices. We worked through how we would represent some example circuits provided by Swapnil. Even now, we can see that we are going to need some more examples of more complicated circuits to work through.
Wednesday: Our PI, Orit, really liked our proposed design. From my perspective, as a biology major, there was some good stuff already where the our design would be more convenient to use than being forced to code it in Eugene. Catherine came up with the name for our UI, Eugenie! The logo includes a genie lamp and a little bacteria genie coming out of it. It's very cute!
Thursday: We continued to work to brainstorm and refine our designs for our joint brainstorming session on Friday with the BU iGem team. We met with Orit to go over everything. One of the things were struggled with was how to represent our data once it was created. We decided we could either go with a list, or display data visually. Displaying the data visually presented a problem because with all the permutations that are supposed to be generated in using Eugenie will result in an unmanageably large amount of data to represent. As a preliminary design, we came up with either a tree representation or a pile representation.
Friday: Joint brainstorming session with BU today. People really liked our idea for the Eugenie logo. People seemed to prefer the tree visualization method. The unanimous opinion was that data should just be displayed in a huge list that one could browse through and filter for certain results if desired. It was good to get feedback from everyone. I think some members of the BU team were forgetting that I focused mostly on molecular biology in my undergraduate coursework and research. They repetitively explained the same things in great detail to me. I appreciate their attention to detail, but it was a little baffling because they did not seem to believe that I really understood what they were saying.
Week 4: June 17 - June 21
Monday: Using HTML and CSS, I worked on creating a log-in page for Eugenie. This was my first time working with HTML or CSS so it was somewhat slow-going. As a Biology major who has only taken one CS course, I know I'm the weakest in terms of programming, but most people have never used HTML or CSS either so at least we were all starting at the same place. As a team, we also chose a tentative color scheme for Eugenie.
Tuesday: Evan and I went to BU to ask the BU iGem team about Eugene and about some design things. We also wanted to get some more complicated examples of circuits that they had designed or seen"

KP Today Kendall and I did PCR for the first time. Jordan and Clarice showed us how to do it. We did PCR on our E. Coli that has our lysogenic lambda encased within. We also froze down our lambda e. coli samples for future use.
KK Kelton and I worked with Jordan today to PCR amplify the CRO gene from π9907-infected E.Coli. We boiled the E.Coli to use as template and then followed the PCR protocol as outlined. Jordan actually was performed most of the protocol so that we could learn. Our control was E.Coli that had not been infected with lambda.
5/6/13
We ran a gel of our PCR product that we had created over the weekend. This was the first time I had ever done so, so it was fun and interesting! To make the gel, we mix 100 mL of TAE buffer with 1 gram of agar and heat in the microwave. The agar powder needs to completely dissolve. That mixture, with ethidium bromide, is added to the gel dock, and let set for about 20 minutes, or if you set the gel in the fridge it is a little less time. The CRO gene is about 300 base pairs. However, when we ran our PCR product against the ladder and against our negative control, our PCR product matched the control and did NOT match the length that indicates 300 base pairs. So, we know that our PCR reaction failed. It may be because we used a colony that did not include that lambda prophage.
Today we did the PCR reaction to amplify CRO again, but this time we amplified CRO from colonies that had been infected with our three distinct strains of Lambda. We will check our product tomorrow.

Overall
We are aiming to create some magic intelligent bacteria to track and ‘eat’ pollutants PCBs  (Polychlorinated Biphenyl) and dioxins efficiently, based on the methods of synthetic biology.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a family of compounds produced commercially by the direct chlorination of biphenyl using ferric chloride and/or iodine as the ctalyst.The total amount of PCBs produced in the world is estimated 1.2 million tons.Because PCBs have been released into the environment in many countries over decades, these compounds have become serious and global environmental contaminants.PCBs tend to accumulate in biota owing to their lypophilic property.
The biphenyl molecule is made up of two connected rings of six carbon atoms each, and a PCB is any molecule having multiple chlorines attached to the biphenyl nucleus.
Two distinct classes of bacteria have now been identified that biodegrade PCBs by different mechanisms, including aerobic bacteria which live in oxygenated environments and anaerobic bacteria which live in oxygen free environments such as aquatic sediments. The aerobes attack PCBs oxidatively , breaking open the carbon ring and destroying the compounds. Anaerobes, on the other hand, leave the biphenyl rings intact while removing the chlorines.
Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) were introduced into the biosphere"

Results
29.8.11
Re-Transformation of part 2b clone 5 with 20 ng vector was succesful. 50 pg vector didnt yield any colonies. RBS was tranformed succesfully. 5 ml LB o/n cultures with apropriate antibiotica were inoculated and incubated at 37° C shaking. Mini Prep and sequencing will be performed at 31.8.11
Cloning
Electrocompetent cells
new electrocompetent cells (DH5alpha) were made by the following protocol:
a 20 ml Luria medium overnight culture was inoculated with electrocompetent DH5alpha (kindly provided Andrea Mückl) yesterday
350 ml Luria medium were inoculated with 15 ml of the overnight culture and incubated at 37°C until a OD(600) of 0,7 was reached
the medium was distributed on falcons and the cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min at 4°C
after discarding the supernatant 350 ml of sterile ice-cold 10% glycerol was added and the pellets were resuspended using a pipet
the resuspension was centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 4°C for 11 minutes
after discarding the supernatant the cells were resuspended again in 350 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol ( cells kept chilled all the time)
and again centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 4°C for 11 minutes
the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in the remaining supernatant
the cells were dispensed in 40 µl aliquots and stored at -80°C for further use
Planning
In order to get ligations working, purification steps will be performed using Promegas Wizard PCR and Gel clean up Kit.  We are going to ligate PCR product into pSB1C3 and upstream of SupD-tRNA. In parallel, T7ptag will be ligated into AND-Gate Plasmid, which will be pSB1C3"

Today we made liquid cultures of and ran colony PCRs of pA13DC, pA13DB, pC13AU, pC13AT, and pC13CB. pC13CF did not grow any colonies. We then ran a gel of the PCR products. pC13CB colony 5, pC13AT colonies 1-3 and 5, pC13DC colonies 2-5, pC13DB colonies 1-5, and pC13AU colonies 1 and 5 are looked like they had the proper insert lengths from the gel image. Sequencing results came back confirming that pC13CG 3 worked We digested our site directed mutagenesis attempt from yesterday with DpnI and stored it in the fridge. We ran a gel combined with other DNA from other team members, which resulted in a smeared band that was in the correct place. We believe this will be successful, and we will transform our site directed mutagenesis product as soon as desalting membranes arrive. We mini-prepped and plated pC13AG, pAK13CR, pAK13CS. We miniprepped pC13BQ and pC13BR, and submitted pC13CC, pC13CD, pC13BQ, and pC13BR for sequencing. We ran PCRs of the inserts in pAK13BB and pAK13BU to prepare for further cloning.
Cloning of RBS + GFP, RBS + mRFP, PT7 + GFP + PtrpC + geneticin resistance, PtrpC + mRFP, and PtrpC + GFP appear to be going well.

We cultured transformants for our Gibson assembly of pC13BH using 1:2 vector to insert ratios, but got no colonies for the 1:6 ratio Gibson and the pC13BF ligation. We also digested our pA13AW minipreps for gel screening. Our PCR confirmed that pC13AG and pAK13CR worked. We picked more colonies of pAK13CS from electroporation plate to screen more colonies.
Running into some problems with PgpdA cloning. PCR confirmed that pC13AG and pAK13CR worked! We picked more colonies of pAK13CS for screening.

The insights she has given us about our project helped us be aware of the difficulties we may face in the future. For example, she told                  us that such attempts to increase bioethanol percentage in blends usually occur, however, are usually futile until supported well. Also,                  she has provided detailed and numerical information on the efficiency of agricultural wastes in Turkey. Such information helped us have a                  deeper understanding of the topic and the agricultural situation of our own country.
She also mentioned how agricultural wastes are mistreated in our country. She told that most farmers usually burn the agricultural wastes,                  as a result of which, the soil and the environment is damaged. This also helped us shape our human practices in the further stages of the                  project.
Our Meeting with the President of the Green Energy Foundation
Thanks to Dr. Ar; we got a chance to gather with the Deputy President of the Green Energy Foundation, Tülin Keskin, to discuss our project.                  Since it’s in her best interest to promote awareness on environment friendly means to produce energy, her opinion matters to us immensely.                  She commented on our survey, and we took her advice to improve it. She recommended us to shorten the survey and make it simpler in order for                  it to be comprehended by a wider, both less and well educated audience and also to diminish any problems which may occur from age differences.                  Furthermore, she contributed to the distribution of our survey, in order for it to be filled by more people; thus improving the results’                  reproducibility and ultimately increasing its accuracy.
Mrs. Keskin inspired us to celebrate the then-upcoming 10th of August; World Bioethanol day, too. Using her connections and networking, she                  gathered people and cooperated with the local authorities, Çankaya Municipality, to set up a place for the event along with the resources                  necessary.
Mrs. Keskin also used her connections to introduce us to many other people relevant to our project along with providing their contact                  information. For our further coming meetings, she encouraged us to prepare a file which will include our project description, upcoming plans,                  sponsorship file, and achievements.

2nd Mediterranean meet up
This year the devoted and strongly motivated Aix-Marseille team organized the second Mediterranean meet up in Marseille on the 9th and 10th of August. This second edition was a great opportunity to meet more teams and countries each other and to share about our projects. It was a meetup including poster presentations, to which we invited teams from most of the Mediterranean countries. It gave us an opportunity to train before the Giant Jamboree. This year, 7 teams from Spain and France participated in the meetup: UPF_CRG_Barcelona , Madrid-OLM , Grenoble , Bordeaux , Pasteur_Paris , Paris_Bettencourt , and Montpellier .

Mexico!
A first contact with the Mexican team, Tecnológico de Monterrey , was over Skype. They were interested in water pollution, a critical environmental problem affecting all sorts of different ecosystems and many communities close to natural and polluted water sources. They asked us to help by providing them with water samples from different environments in France so they can analyze them with several techniques in order to make an overview of water pollution for their project.

In order to create constitutively active ComE, Team MIT had planned to change             the aspartic acid at the phosphorylation site to a glutamic acid. Another way to ensure comE binding is by truncating             only the effector region of the response regulator. The team decided to also incorporate the effector truncation of             comE into the experiments. This would hopefully provide another positive control for comE binding to the engineered promoter.             At the end of this meeting Ross made another note about the promoter driving the histidine kinases.             In his previous experiments, it was found that one needs very little histidine kinase to have an effect on the response             regulator. He gave us the name of a constitutive promoter with lower expression than hef1a and the team decided to move             forward with Ross's promoter to drive comD expression in our experiments.
The second meeting in late July was more specifically about protein localization. For the histidine kinase             receptor to sense the Competence-Stimulating Peptide (CSP), it needed to be on the cell membrane. The team hoped             to direct the receptor to the membrane by fusing the CD4 membrane signalling peptide to ComD, but were confused             because past research was able to localize the receptor correctly without fusing any signalling peptide to histidine             kinases. Based on his past experience with membrane localization, Ross went through some standard membrane signalling             peptides and talked about different ways to check co-localization as well as a microscope recommendation. The team             decided to first attempt localization of comD using CD4.
The other main question was about the response regulator nuclear localization and export. ComE fused with VP64 is             still small enough to fit through the nuclear pores, but there are concerns about its speed of diffusion (since in             the first meeting with Ross he had mentioned that many response regulators have a tendency to spontaneously             dephosphorylate after activation). It wasn’t clear whether to include both nuclear localization and nuclear export             sequences (NLS and NES) to promote shuttling of comE between the nucleus and comD. Ross agreed that NLS and NES sequences             might help counter spontaneous spontaneous dephosphorylation, so the team decided to include the signalling sequences in             the first iteration of our DNA design.

The concept of our idea is to strengthen the bio-pattern formation in augmented reality which means we are trying to make control of the bio-pattern by computer paths and systems. The pattern formation has been a significant research field in synthetic biology over the past 50 years,there were several major breakthroughs on the mechanism of the form of biology. Many scientific research teams are trying to verify and understand these theoretical models with the idea of synthetic loop.   In the meanwhile, we also considered what bio-pattern formation could be applied for and how bio-pattern formation could influence our lives. Moreover, we did other work to help our project. And we also do some outreach activities to raise public understanding of our project.
Came to Know BioPaFiAR
            ——make reality get closer to the virtual
How does the biological pattern formation came into exist? That is a fundamental question need to be answered. BioPaFiAR stands for biological pattern formation in AR. The bio-systems always form complicated pattern or construction, for example, the stria of zebra, the plume of peafowl, the spot of leopard, the squama of fishes and the petal. The bio-process of forming this well-aligned construction was named ”the pattern formation” and it always refers to the intricate regulate and control, the alter of gene expression, the shape change of cellular, the motion\multiplication\death of cellular and the interaction of cellular with environment.
Synthetic biology is an emerging field of biology research that combines science and engineering to study the mechanism of life and for a variety of technological applications. Research in synthetic biology has primarily focused on developing an engineering dogma for bottom-up design and synthetic of biological circuits from standardized parts and modules followed by optimizing their operation on well-characterized chassis, in vivo or in vitro.
In the past decade, the synthetic biologists"

27. September 2012,Nur noch 4 Stunden!!!
Die letzten Zeilen vor dem Wiki freeze wurden eingetippt!
Jetzt ist es 4 Uhr am Morgen des 27. August und unsere Homepage mit allen Ergebnissen von ungefähr 130 Laborarbeitstag ist endlich vollständig. Um diesen Anlass zu feiern haben wir einige Berechnungen durchgeführt: insgesamt haben wir ungefähr 3000 Laborarbeitsstunden gesammelt, in denen wir – basierend auf dem durchschnittlichen Stundenlohn von Masterstudenten von 10,85 € - ungefähr 32530€ hätten verdienen können.  Wir haben ca. 3000 Petrischalen benutzt und in den Müll geworfen und unsere E. coli Stämme in und auf 150 l LB-Agar/Medium wachsen lassen.
Zusätzlich benötigen wir nun alle neue Reifen und Bremsen auf Grund des Hoch- und Runterfahrens das Faßberges mit dem Fahrrad.
Und weil wir jetzt alle schrecklich müde sind, gehen wir jetzt endlich ins Bett (natürlich nicht bevor wir unsere Gläser erhoben haben).
Wir wünschen allen einen wunderschönen guten Morgen, und wir freuen uns alle in Amsterdam zu treffen!
26. September 2012,Ergebnisse sind online!
Viel Vergnügen mit unseren Ergebnissen.

The BM40 and Igκ signal peptides were designed by us, providing additional spacing as well as a Kozak sequence to the 5'-UTR of the constructs and combined with a BioBrick encoding the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
As shown below, the EGFR signal peptide taken from the parts registry is constructed in a way that the signal peptide ORF immediately follows the RFC10 cloning scar after the CMV promoter, thus resulting in a very short 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcribed mRNA. The combination of the CMV promoter with the synthesized BM40 and Igκ signal peptides allows for a considerably longer 5’ UTR of the resulting mRNA - additionally allowing them to contain a full Kozak consensus sequence by design. The Kozak sequence is recognized by the ribosome as a translational start site; this element missing or deviating from the consensus sequence may considerably decrease translation efficiency. [3] For the EGFR signal peptide construct, a Kozak sequence is not present, as it would have to preceed the start codon ATG - a position which is occupied by the RFC10 cloning scar. Since both, the distance from the promoter to the open reading frame as well as the Kozak consensus sequence are considered crucial parameters for expression levels [4] , BM40 and Igκ signal peptide constructs are likely to resut in increased expression levels compared to proteins containing the EGFR signal peptide from the parts registry.
As the functionality of the signal peptides had to be determined before including one of these into the final receptor constructs, the three options (Igκ, BM40, EGFR) were tested via bioinformatic tools as well as by conducting a secretion assay of luciferase constructs.
Results of signal peptide functional analysis
Bioinformatic signal peptide analysis via the SignalP server
The SignalP server, being able to discriminate between the hydrophobic signal peptide sequence and the hydrophobic transmembrane domain [5] , can determine whether a sequence possesses the biophysical requirements for functioning as a signal peptide. Furthermore, it is able to predict the probable cleavage site of the signal peptide after its translocation into the ER. For all constructs, signal peptide functionality is predicted, as well as a potential cleavage site. The complete translated amino acid sequences of the respective receptor constructs were used as input. The algorithm for eukaryotes with default D-cutoff value was chosen.

Here's our log, you can read about what we've been doing in the lab and the office. (We're working hard, promise)
June 2013
Week 1
24th June
We’ve moved into our office, deep in the basement of the research labs in the Miall building.
Our time has been taken up getting acquainted with our office ( and our coffee machine!) and roughing out the fine details of our protocol.
We’ve pulled together a combination of the teams' various projects to create our final idea, we’re now looking at making a detector platform for physically binding substrates to activate a reporter. (Scintillating no?)
Our team has been busy thinking of inventive assay design to characterise our Biosystems; frantically trying to code our wiki and taking our team photos (important work)
25th June
Jeni, one of our first year biochemists has been working on her primer design, getting everything ready to start in the labs next week. We’ve been compiling our part list and getting our order ready; a buffer and bacteria shopping spree.
26th June
We’re trying to plan out our outreach programs, so watch this space. We’re going to be doing instructional videos on RFC-10 and Golden Brick assembly; as well as some more basic introduction to Synthetic Biology for younger students, alongside running some SynBio workshops for summer students that’ll be here at Leeds.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Safety#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Public relations_-_-_TEXT.html,"PhD) Student Convention at the BayArena in Leverkusen . The congress gives lifesience (PhD) students the opportunity to meet representatives of industry and academia, get information for career entry as well as improve their soft skills in workshops. Apart from the opportunity to participate in the convention, the role of the iGEM Team Bielefeld was to give a project presentation about iGEM as an example for remarkable scientific dedication during academic studies. The VIP-lounge in the stadium of the national league soccer team Bayer Leverkusen served as the venue for the two day congress.
The Audience, © yansfotos.de, BIO.NRW
The first day began with interesting talks about the perspectives, possibilities and opportunities in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries given by company representatives. One of the highlights was the key note speech “No Limits” by Joey Kelly , a former well known musician and now extreme athlete. The diverting talk showed how you can accomplish your goals with motivation, commitment and persistence. The supporting program featured a stadium tour, dinner and a relaxed evening on the grandstand.
For the 110 participants the second day started with workshops moderated by professionals coaches. The topics were for example improvement of soft skills or project presentation. Furthermore some of our team members took part in a workshop for communicating biotechnology, which has a special relevance for the public relations in our iGEM project. The workshops were all moderated by professionals

In the afternoon it was time for our iGEM project presentation. We focused on iGEM in general, the main principle of standardized DNA parts, example projects, the motivation behind participating in a competition like iGEM and gave an overview how to build up a project from the sketchbook to the final product. Bielefeld University has still the only iGEM team in the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia , one of the most populated regions in Europe and host of the convention. Therefore our goal was not to present scientific results, but to talk about what is special in projects like iGEM and encourage other students and faculty members to start a new iGEM team in their own schools.
The whole event was a success for us as a team, since we had lots of fun and learned new aspects in the workshops. Most importantly we were able to present about iGEM and show new people what is special about the iGEM spirit as well as open source biology.

Click on the animation above to see what happens when the cell doesn't make anything.
But then bad Guy #2 comes along. He’s generating AI-2 all by himself, without any engineering necessary (as a result of constitutive expression of luxS, encoding the LuxS enzyme which produces an intermediate in the AI-2 biosynthesis pathway) which is intercepted by the periplasmic protein LuxP in the Champion Cell which is constitutively bound to the LuxQ protein, a histidine kinase spanning the periplasmic membrane. The binding of AI-2 to LuxP induces the stabilization of the phosphatase conformation of the cytosolic domain of LuxQ, thereby allowing for the dephosphorylation of LuxU. The loss of phosphorylation of LuxU puts an end to its kinase activity, with the net effect being the dephosphorylation of LuxO. Since phospho-LuxO is required for the activation of the qrr4 promoter, no more clλ repressor is produced, resulting in the activation of the pclλ promoter thanks rapid destruction of the repressor afforded by the degradation tag attached to the repressor protein. ColicinE3 is transcribed, leading to the eventual destruction of Bad Guy #2, following the release of the cytotoxic protein from our champion cell. Concurrently, our Champion Cell fluoresces red to inform the viewing gallery who the invader is and in order to indicate that our champion cells are preparing to wage war!

Here's the workflow envisioned for creating system 2. Kingsley worked on the green section, Kevin was to work on the purple, Thane worked on the blue, and Dave worked on the teal.
Applications
In essence, what’s proposed above is a model or proof of concept system. Then, where could this system be useful? One evident application stems from the knowledge that specific bacterial strains create bacteriocins targeted uniquely to their populations (i.e. E. coli employ colicins while P. aeruginosa use pyocins). Combining the production of species-specific bacteriocins and reporter activity with the use of species-specific pheromone signaling systems would allow our Champion to recognize some of the real bad guys out there like Yersinia"

Abstract
A major obstacle in creating recombinant spider silk is the highly repetitive nature of the genes that encode it. Silk genes are comprised of a repetitive core region containing ~100 repeats of a spidroin gene which precludes the use of traditional cloning techniques due to non-specificity in primer binding. While other techniques such as head-to-tail assembly or concatemerization have been developed to facilitate spider silk cloning, none of these techniques can assemble silk genes in a quick and directed manner. We have adapted the use of Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) as a technique to construct silk genes in a rapid and sequence specific manner. By creating a number of different constructs this summer, we show that ICA can greatly facilitate the engineering of recombinant spider-silk.
Introduction
Recombinant spider-silks with customizable properties present an appealing biomaterial that can be used in textiles, tissue scaffolds, and other unique applications. Spider silk is a proteinaceous fiber whose proteins consist of non-repetitive N and C terminal domains, and a highly repetitive central core that consists of up to 100 repeats of Spidroin1 (MaSp1) or Spidroin 2 (MaSp2). These spidroin repeats are directly responsible for the final properties and behavior of the spider silk. MaSp1 contributes strength to the fiber, while MaSp2 contributes elasticity. Importantly, the relative content of MaSp1 and MaSp2 monomers in silk proteins can dictate the fiber properties when spun. Engineering recombinant spider silk genes of varying lengths and spidroin content is nearly impossible using traditional cloning methods, due to the repetitive core. These repeats essentially forbid the use of primers to amplify said genes due to the possibility of non-specific priming. These obstacles have made engineering recombinant spider silk a difficult process.
Existing techniques seek to remove reliance of cloning on primer annealing (Tokareva et al, 2013"

HEK293T cell line cultured in 10 cm plates was co-transfected with the IκBαM vector and 3rd generation Lentivirus helper plasmids. Positive infection control viruses were produced in co-transfection with pGreen-puro vector and 2nd generation Lentivirus helper plasmids. 48 hours later, viral medium was extracted, filtered and used to infect. Virus was concentrated using 10% Sucrose solution.
The BV-2 cell line was infected with the virus immediately after extraction in 24 well-plates using the spinfection method. As positive control for the infection process, we infected cells with pGreen-puro virus with which we previously demonstrated a visible expression of GFP and Puromycin resistance. As negative controls, cells were centrifuged with regular medium (no viral vector).
Results:
Three days after infection, selection began with 2 µg/ml of Puromycin, changing medium every other day. Wells which had cells that survived the process in them were transferred to bigger wells to grow and then RNA was extracted for qPCR analysis. BV2 cells that were infected with pGreen-puro were GFP positive with high efficiency of infection so we concluded that the virus production and infection were done properly in the technical sense.
Figure 3: BV2 cells infected with control virus, pGreen-Puro under the fluorescent microscope.
Conclusion:
Infection succeed according to positive control (infection of pGreen puro).
We were able to infect BV-2 cell line with Shikkb.

Figure 16. Agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid extractions showing two 7 kb bands at position 9 on the first gel and 4 on the second. These were both from plate 4 of the 1-4 Gibson assemblies with amplified and un-amplified gBlocks.
Plasmids extracted from the two colonies displaying a 7 kb band were sent for sequencing using primers Gb1F, Gb1R, Gb2F, Gb2R, Gb3F and Gb2R (Eurofins Genomics). These primers were selected as the combined reads should provide sufficient sequence data coverage for the complete operon. Unfortunately, the sequence reads obtained did not provide sufficient data to confirm the correct assembly. Although some reactions provided sequence reads > 1 kb, others provided little or poor quality data which resulted in insufficient coverage. One of the plasmids sequenced appeared to contain regions that aligned to the naringenin operon design, however due to gaps in the sequence reads this was not conclusive evidence of successful assembly (Figure 17). This may be due to the sensitive nature of the primers when annealing to the template during the sequencing reaction. Overall, it is likely that the relatively large size of the naringenin operon inserted into the pSB1C3 backbone (7 kb) led to reduced efficiency in transformation.

Week 10
Indigoidine Production - bpsA
For the PCR amplification of native bpsA, Streptomyces lavendulae subsp. lavendulae DSM40708 was grown on GYM agar plates. We wanted to use the native indigoidine synthetase bpsA and the PPTase svp from pMM65 and to assemble pRB1, which is similar to pKH1. In this new assembly approach, we amplify the bpsA gene from the S. lavendulae genome instead of using a codon optimized sequence. Furthermore the svp coding sequence was placed behind a weaker promoter ( BBa_B0029 ) since the PPTase has to activate every indigoidine synthetase only once and thus is not required in huge amounts (Lambalot 1996).
In the subsequent weeks we wanted to exchange the Thiolation-domain (T-domain) of bpsA with T-Domains of other NRPS modules and show that it can be activated by various PPTases. We wanted to find out whether there are differences in the PPTases' efficiency concerning the activation of engineered indigoidine synthetases.
The PCR amplification of bpsA was unsuccessful. We will try again with a new set of primers.
In addition we will try to amplify the native svp PPTase from Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003, which has been described in previous studies (Sanchez 2001).
Week 11
Indigoidine Production - bpsA
Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 was cultivated and used for amplification of the svp PPTase. We tried to extract bpsA from S. lavendulae DSM40708 with a new set of primers (Primer RB11-20).
PCR results with various primers and PCR conditions suggested that the bpsA indigoidine synthetase gene is not present or mutated in S. lavendulae DSM40708. The amplification of svp was successful.

Copies of RFP in the iGEM data base to use as template- 2012 Plate 1>18F, 2012 Plate 1>220, 2011 Plate SP4001>11H.
Redid PCR from 7/12 using all the templates above and also pSB1C3 (polymerase phusion). The reaction using pSB1C3 as template was the only one that worked. Cleaned it. Resulted in promoter Qrr4 reading into RFP.
Made a mini prep of pIG10 (AmR).
Set up 50ul digests of Qrr4/RFP and pIG12 with NEB4, XhoI, and EcoRI-HF. Ran on a low melt gel. The band with Qrr4/RFP was dim and the band with pIG12 was bright.

What is a genome-scale metabolic model?
A genome-scale metabolic model (GSM)  is a network reconstruction of all known metabolic reactions in an organism and the genes that encode each associated enzyme.1 Through the construction of these networks, we can assess the metabolic capabilities of an organism as well as its potential to produce biologically useful metabolites.
What are the components of a genome-scale model
Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) relationships
Set of known metabolic reactions represented in a stoichiometric matrix. Identifies stoichiometric coefficients and directionality associated with each reaction.
Scaled biomass equation. Assumes flux through the biomass equation is equal to the exponential growth rate of the organism. This is made from experimental measurements of biomass components.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Lab Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," for dCas9 and sgRNA. However, we have made a quasi-steady state assumption for that reaction, which requires that it reach equilibrium on a much faster time scale than the rest of the system. We thus defined a range for the possible values based on the other model parameters
Details on the more roundabout estimations are given below:
Production of dCas9 from dCas9 mRNA
We were unable to find a peptide chain elongation rate for S. aureus, so instead we used the values reported in BioNumber 107869
which gives a range of 0.59-3.17 amino acids per second per ribosome in Streptomyces coelicolor, another gram-positive bacteria. Freiburg's dCas9 part from last year
is composed of 1372 amino acids. This translates to a range of 0.0258 to 0.1386 dCas9 molecules per minute per ribosome.
We were unable to find ribosome densities in S. aureus, but found two different estimates for ribsosome density in Bionumbers: 0.22 ribosomes per 100 codons (i.e. per 3 nt coding sequence)
and 3.46 ribosomes per 100 codons
. Using our assumption of 3 nt:1 amino acid, we then multiply to get the 0.0057-0.4797 range of dCas9 molecules per minute.
Degradation rate of dCas9
We were unable to find any specific data on dCas9 degradation, so instead we used a protein half-life of sarA measured in S. Aureus by Michelik et al.
. We chose sarA rather than a protein more chemically similar to dCas9 because data on sarA was readily available and because dCas9 is transcribed using the sarA promoter, which allows us to at least capture sensitivity of the degradation rate to production.
mRNA production from the sarA promoter
We used the time-series data given by Cheung et al.
to estimate the rate of production from the sarA P2-P3-P1 promoter in S. aureus. The figure from their paper is reproduced below. After diluting 1:100, the S. aureus strains were serially monitored for OD_650. We used data from the sarA+ strain, as that's more like a wild-type S. aureus strain.
Using the laboratory-conditions doubling time of 24 minutes given in given in
, we found that the bacteria would re-enter stationary phase after 2.5"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes"

Don’t allow electrophoresis gel hogs the limelight! Transillumination camera is able to catch your best smile. Those pictures were taken in the middle of August, when we would love some vacations. Ps: Our Wet Lab Leader told us the transillumination camera secret.

Our long term goals are to develop plant biosensors that reliably measure changes in the local environment. In the process of developing biosensors, the 2010 Nevada iGEM Team need to develop fundamental promoters, reporters, and plasmids for plants. Therefore, the 2010 Nevada iGEM Team has three goals for this year’s competition. First, we are going to test the validity of utilizing Nicotiana tabacum (NT cells) as a model for the expression of higher plant genes for future iGEM competitions. NT"

WLC-Milwaukee,2014,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Anthropology_-_-_TEXT.html," utilize fiber is not expressed, and this creates problems for those who do not have a relatively unlimited source of fiber, protein, or carbohydrates.
The project for 2014 is geared toward a goal to use a probiotic strain (E. coli Nissle 1917), whose purpose is to “increase the caloric intake in the individuals who live as sustenance farmers, refugees, and in areas that do not provide enough agricultural means so as to provide sufficient calories for the population housed in the area.” Their ultimate goal was to have a fully-functioning probiotic that, upon expression of a certain gene, could help organisms to utilize them to their fullest. They hope to first test on livestock, and should it succeed, enter it into the market for human consumption.
Now, why is this important?  The WLC iGEM team’s goals mirror those of other organizations. There are several risks involved when aiding a foreign culture, the largest concern being the degradation of the culture influenced by biotechnology.  “In villages, constraints to crop production include pests, diseases, weeds, environmental degradation, soil nutrient depletion, low fertilizer inputs, inadequate food processing amenities, poor roads to markets, and general lack of information...” It is necessary, however, to not view the farmer as a “simple peasant,” but rather, to take into account their traditions; what processes have worked and what has not.
It is no easy task to help an entire continent, but perhaps, just perhaps, it can be done. Malnourishment is a widespread disease, and one that needs immediate treatment. It is dangerous; those who are underfed are more susceptible to disease and injury. This task will require all of our greatest minds and strongest hands. For the past five centuries, the influence of the west has been largely negative in these areas, but new tools are being used to heal these wounds. Communication, education, respect, and dedication are vital to curing the greatest disease of the 21st century.
