Team Activity Tests:
Negative control for the experimental setup with different pHs of the Britton-Robinson buffer. Effect of 5 mM ABTS was determined.
Today was all about finding a comfy environment for our laccases. We thought of determining the right pH before going on with substrate saturation experiments since we could not be sure, that the activity was influenced by the pH. We chose a range from pH 4 to pH 9, applied 616 ng laccase and 5 mM ABTS. Our results revealed the following results:
optimal pH of ECOL: pH 5
optimal pH of BPUL: pH 4 and pH 5
optimal pH of BHAL: pH 5
optimal pH of TTHL: pH 5
BHAL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.
TTHL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.
ECOL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.
BPUL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.

Located 5 minutes walk from the Luxembourg Gardens at the Paris Descartes Medicine Faculty in Cochin, the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity CRI was founded in 2005 as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. Our environment includes a fully-equipped seminar room, a meeting room, office space for visiting professors, a library and coffee rooms and a modelling as well as wet-lab space. The CRI supported its students over three years ago to form the first French team to the iGEM and the tradition is continuing... This is where all happened!
Our Student Team
Hi! This is our iGEM team. We are 8 undergrad students from different disciplines who have worked together over this summer to design, build and test the counting bacteria. We also had great instructors and supervisors who helped us a lot with their advise and experience. It was a great group work experience, we've learned a lot and also had fun! Everyone had a chance to work on all parts of the project, but we divided the responsibilities for different aspects among our team members.

For the other potential applications of our Light Modules and output bricks, we would consider these to only be undertaken in laboratory settings, as manipulating our output bricks would require equipment and techniques (enzymes, thermocyclers, gel electrophoresis equipment, competent cells and mini-prep kits, for example) usually only available in a laboratory.
When it comes to ownership and sharing, our project was a result of inspiring work from other iGEM teams, and a desire to build on existing work within the iGEM competition. The bright, reliable pigments developed by the 2011 Uppsala and the fantastic work on red , blue and green light sensors by various other teams encouraged us to combine the two aspects and attempt to build a full colour bacterial “camera”. Every part we have used has been linked to its Registry page in our Notebook .

In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable   parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An ""improvement"" is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. For instance: strengthening the expression of a part by mutating the DNA sequence; modifying one or a few parts in construct (Device) so that it performs its intended job better; improving a cloning or expression vector that can be easily used by the entire community; and of course, troubleshooting and fixing a part reported to be non-functional. Data from an experimental comparison between the original and improved part/ device is strongly recommended.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modelling or simulating their system.
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and"

Education and Public Engagement
Introduction
Our work in education and public engagement is aimed at intertwining society and our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology. These education and public engagement elements differ from those of outreach because they integrate the perceptions and concerns of society into our project which produces a relevant and responsible design. After meeting with our stakeholders, Kinross and the WWTP, we learned there was improvement needed in the education of our team, our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology. We developed internal and external programs, both aimed at informing iGEM members and society as well as encourage public and stakeholder interaction incorporation in future iGEM projects. University research faculties are the primary vehicles for the execution of publicly sponsored research and have great influence on the nation’s science policies, the scientific agenda, the broad nature of the public’s research priorities and the public's understanding of how new knowledge will be deployed. The understanding of computational procedures, laboratory experiments, and ethics and public policy have a significant influence on the very character of the scientific enterprise. We produced innovative educational tools and public engagement activities, such as workshops, a SynBio Forum, and a public survey, to spark new scientific curiosity and establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology from the opinions of those outside the lab.
WORKSHOPS:
BIOETHICS WORKSHOP
We understand the importance of teaching our iGEM members that with the rise of synthetic biology research and            development, bioethics becomes more prominent. Bioethics examines and determines basic human values as well as            the morality of developments in healthcare, life technology, medicine, and society’s responsibility for the            health of its citizens. The bioethics workshop provoked conversation and allowed participants to analyze the consequences of synthetic            biology research, a core characteristic of policy and practices. This workshop encouraged participants to            investigate the importance of integrating science and bioethics. Producing an adequate understanding of this            integration will result in ethical scientific development and scholarly researchers. After this workshop,            participants were able to critically analyze the development of science and"

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#switch_-_-_TEXT.html," to use that biobrick to waste valuable time further exploring a part that should have been characterized in the first place.  With the number of parts being submitted increasing every year, there has been a noticeable lack of characterization in the Registry.  It is important for the biobricks within the Registry to be tested under multiple conditions in order for the Registry to function as intended.  We have included multiple arabinose concentrations at consecutive orders to magnitude in order to show the total cell death that each concentration will induce, as well as the rate at which that cell death occurs.
The relationship between the concentration of arabinose and the amount and rate of cell death seems linear in nature. We tested K628006 at multiple arabinose concentrations to see which would best induce activation of the pBAD strong promoter.  While it might seem that the 7400 μM arabinose concentration resulted in the strongest kill switch response, the cell death of these readings is not due entirely to our kill switch.  We discovered that arabinose in high concentrations would kill cells via non-kill switch related means.  This was a problem that plagued the results of our original experiments, which were run with arabinose concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than they should have been.  While we did not have time to identify how exactly excess arabinose caused cell death, we can speculate that there was probably an osmosis-based effect, by which the cells were placed in a hypertonic solution that interfered with various other cell regulatory functions.  From the graph below, we can see that at concentrations of 7400 μM, supercompetent, non-transformed E. coli were fluorescing considerably higher levels than at 0 μM arabinose concentrations, indicating not only an increase in cell death, but that the arabinose was the cause:
Figure 3 - This graph shows the fluorescence readings at 600 nm (485 exciting) of non-transformed E. coli in solutions of 7400 μM and 0 μM arabinose.
Figure 4 - This graph shows the fluorescence readings at 600 nm (485 exciting) of non-transformed E. coli in a solution of 7400 μM arabinose concentrations.  The value of the 0 μM control has been subtracted from the fluorescence value of the 7400 μM arabinose concentration at every 5 minute reading, in order to show the scale of difference between the two concentrations' cell death.

We received from Dr Nico Claasens lab (Wageningen University) the strains containing PCB en Cph8 vectors responsible for the circadian regulation. We could now begin the genetic construction, but we faced a problem with the vectors: receptors genes were cloned into vectors incompatible with our final construction plan, so we had to look for an alternative solution.

Talking Life
Talking Life in 150 words
Do you speak to your bacteria? We do. We have designed, constructed and characterized an inter-specific translator based on light pulses that allows to literally dialogue with microorganisms. We have built seven biobricks with fluorescent proteins under the control of environmentally-sensitive promoters. The process is as follows: human voice messages are electronically- and then light-encoded in excitation wavelengths, and microbial proteins’ emission wavelengths are electronically- and voice-encoded back. We have used this system to find out the fermentative status of budding yeast and to dialogue with E. coli allowing it to answer questions such as “are you hungry?” The three pillars of our project (human practices, modeling and wetlab) yielded continuous feedback with each other, illustrating an integrated interdisciplinary approach. For example, in human practices, we qualitatively discussed the possibility of cheater mutant (“liers”), which was quantitatively supported by our results in both our modeling simulations and in the wetlab.

1.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.
Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental safety, if successful. Practical use of this project would help to ensure that radiation levels within a certain area is not within dangerous levels able to cause serious harm to a person. This helps to promote public safety such that people can be told to stay away from certain areas that have high levels of radiation easily.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry, how did you manage to handle the safety issue, and how could other teams learn from your experience?
Any new BioBrick parts for our team do not raise any immediate safety concerns, and so none are listed as such in the registry. However, should the idea behind our project become a reality, some concerns as to containment of our genetically engineered strains of E. coli should be addressed. If our bacterial dosimeter is to be used in the field proper safety and handling issues should be dealt with and are being fact"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#Barcoding_-_-_TEXT.html,"ed Next Generation Sequencing by using barcodes.
Every athlete needs the personal DNA embedded barcode. The minimal barcode length we need to generate a unique barcode for every person on Earth is 17 nucleotides as 417 is more than twice the world population. Implementing this 17 nucleotide barcode will be sufficient to mark samples of multiple athletes and multiplex in one sequencing run.
However, characterization by personal identification barcodes, for example name, date of birth, sports etc, rather than a unique identifier requires extensive barcoding. The barcode sequence should be extended due to the fact that 4 nucleotides cannot cover the whole alphabet, numbers and other characters. Therefore, we assigned sets of three nucleotides to a specific letter, number or other character (such as a dot (.), comma (,), semicolon (;) etc.). Converting the characters of the barcode into DNA allows labelling of the targeted DNA to be sequenced. Converting the DNA strand back into the athlete details after sequencing allows multiplexing of many athlete's samples.
Translating an athlete specific barcode into DNA is performed by extending the iGEM DNA translation tool developed by iGEM Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 to include more characters. Additionally, the start and stop codons are removed from the DNA translation tool since we do not require protein production. Instead, the mosaic element and sequencing adapter are implemented to flank the barcoding sequence.
3. Webtool
Name, date of birth and sport of the athlete:
The maximum size of the barcode is 50 characters. You can include alphabetic letters, number and the characters [space] [.] [!] [?] [-] [_] [@] [#] [$] [%] [^] [&] [*] [/] [:] [,] [~] and [=].
Your 5' to 3' barcode sequence is:
Your 3' to 5' barcode sequence is:

補足：
今まで、移動系、色素系、分裂系がありましたが、今現在システム全体が書き出せるものは
「物質合成→積算＆コミュニケーション→output」
の色素系であります。移動系のアイデアには、積算値が戻らないという利点があります。
しかしその位置情報を大腸菌に認識させるという、積算の次のステップのシステムが現在出されていません。
分裂系も、２のn乗で増えていくので色素系と比較すると問題点が多いです。
テスト前まで色素系を進めていこうかという話をしました。もちろん分裂系、移動系は棚上げで。

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," or T and D for A,G or T. The “DNK” composition prohibits two out of three termination codons. Additionally with this library the amino acid frequency is improved towards a balanced ratio in between the different kinds (Dueber) .
Each approach could generate up to 415 DNA sequences, which is roughly 1,07 billion. On the level of the amino acid sequence there are 3,2 million possibilities, since each residue can be taken by 20 different amino acids.  For the assay we therefore need a high throughput method.
We adapted work of DeLoache, Russ and Dueber using the violacein pathway to measure the import effectiveness of tripeptides. The pathway consists of Violacein A (VioA), Violacein B (VioB) and Violacein E (VioE). It converts tryptophan into the green product prodeoxyviolacein (PDV). The first two enzymes, VioA and VioB, are expressed in the cytosol, and the third one, VioE, is targeted to the peroxisome with a PTS1 sequence. The degree of import can be measured by the intensity of green colour of the colonies. An efficient import signal leads to a strong import of the VioE into the peroxisome and subsequently to white colonies, because the intermediates cannot diffuse into the peroxisome to its respective enzyme. DeLoache et al. showed that there is a proportional correlation between the concentration of the green product PDV and a red fluorescent substance. The concentration of this product displays the import efficiency of the respective sequence.
This assay has been used for the evaluation of the generated PTS2 sequences. The VioE-PTS2 plasmids are harvested and cotransformed with a VioA-VioB plasmid. Each plasmid contains a specific auxotrophy marker. Consequently every growing colony contains both plasmids. To evaluate the respective sequence the concentration of the red fluorescence is measured. The more fluorescence is detected the more VioE is in the cytosol. Therefore the respective PTS2 is not that efficient. The other way around a low concentration of the fluorescent substance correlates with an efficient import via the respective PTS2.
Membrane Integration
In our design we worked with both,  the cytosolic import way and the the ER-dependant one. We first tested our hypothesis and then created membrane anchors that can be fused to you protein of interest C-terminally as well as N-terminal. This allows you to add proteins to the compartment"

In this way, we learned about the current social needs and improved our project accordingly. At the same time, we established a long-term relationship with them. On the one hand, they can provide us an effective way of converting foundational research to actual application, on the other hand, we will inform them of the latest results in the lab, by which we can promote each other and make progress together.Fially, we form a research
report about our experience.
2.2.1 BGI
Firstly, we visited BGI research institute. BGI is the world's largest genomics research institute that applies scientific research results in the fields of medical health, agricultural breeding and resource conservation. It is committed to promoting the transformation of genetic science and technology, so as to bring benefits to human. We introduced our project to BGI researchers and visited the company's laboratory and breeding area.
The researchers in the gene editing laboratory evaluated our project and proposed new application directions for our project, suggesting that we can apply the genetic circuit to the anabolic design of engineered bacteria and combine it with some industries such as fermentation engineering. At the same time, they told us that their lab was also trying to apply gene-editing techniques to the genetic breeding of Marine economic fish, which may also provide us with some ideas. We are very grateful to BIG for their valuable advice and they also encouraged us to combine our project with their labs. We will keep in touch with BGI in the future.
Fig.12 BGI introduced their latest production to us.
Fig.13 BGI gave us some advice on our project and it really enlightened us.
2.2.2 Marine Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences
Inspired by BGI researchers, we arrived at the Marine animal molecular developmental biology and evolution laboratory of the institute of oceanology, Chinese academy of sciences. The main research direction of the laboratory is the development of gene resources and germplasm improvement of mariculture fish, which provides breeding materials and new breeding methods for the breeding of improved species of blue agricultural mariculture animals. Under the guidance of the researchers, we visited the laboratory and learned about the history of the laboratory as well as the results of the innovative research on Marine fish germplasm.
We asked the teacher if our project could be combined with genetic breeding, she gave us some suggestions. At present, they use traditional genetic technology in model organism zebrafish to explore the function of target gene. We wondered if our project can be applied to their"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

It is indispensable to investigate whether the surface-displayed E. coli is more potent for detoxification of mercury than common bacteria.
They found that the concentration of mercury ions should be kept at 0.1mg/l. Higher than the value, the fish would be death, lower than the value, the mercury content difference in fish is not obvious.

The cooperation with Xiamen University has begun since the summer vocation. Working as a very kind and helpful team, they asked helping us in doing TEM to confirm whether the modified protein can be seen on the surface of the bacteria when they knew that we wanted to know whether the different treatment to the bacteria can influence the TEM figure.
They culture our modified bacteria and the control BL21 in the 50mL LB medium adding with 100ug/mL AMP. When the OD600=0.6, add 10ul 0.5mol/L IPTG in IC (Fig 1F). Culture in 16℃ for a night. Before adding ions in the bacteria, wash the bacteria with water. Then add Cu2+ in H-2 to the final concentration 25mg/L (Fig 1E), add Hg2+ to the other group to the final concentration 12.5mg/L (Fig 1C and D). Separate the control in two group and one of it add the same amount of ion in it (Fig 1A and B). After cultured for another 1.5h, observe them with the TEM.

Research is fun, but it is more than just lab work. Communication is a very important part in science. Especially iGEM focuses on cooperations and collaborations of different teams all over the world. We met a lot of new interesting people during our iGEM time and hopefully we will stay in contact after the conference.
Meetup in Marburg (15/07/31-15/08/02)
Team Marburg invited all German iGEM teams for a meetup in their little city. After the arrival and putting up the tents on a camping site we split up into little groups containing one member of each team. In these groups we explored Marburg and started to connect. The next day started with the official part where every team introduced themselves and presented their interesting projects. We were pleasantly surprised that every team was very helpful and friendly – they all offered advice and gave tips in their main areas. Afterwards the fun part started when we took part in a friendly canoe race on the river Lahn. The great day ended with a barbecue followed by dancing in a rented club. All in all, the weekend helped to establish many new contacts and to connect all the participating teams.
Bielefeld - Water Samples (15/07/31-15/08/02)
Bielefeld 2015 is working on extensible biosensors to analyze the water quality and detect contaminations with heavy metals. Therefore they asked other iGEM teams to provide water samples. So we brought them water samples from Erlangen to the Meetup in Marburg, where we met Team Bielefeld.

So we had better construct our system in two plasmids to express higher level of therapeutic gene in bladder cancer cells and reduce its expression in other cell types to increase its specificity.
Green fluorescent light measurement in two and three plasmids system
To further verifying the working efficiency of the unnatural amino acid orthogonal system, we replaced the amber mutated output gene in former plasmids to amber mutated GFP. The plasmid psiCHECKTM2-CMV-GFP was used as a positive control to monitor transfection and expression efficiency. The two plasmids and three plasmids system being constructed by GFP recombinant plasmids were transiently transfected into 5637 and T24, both of which are bladder cancer cell line.
Pictures of green fluorescent light produced by target cells were taken by fluorescent microscope. From these pictures (Fig. 3), we can see there is no expression of GFP being detected in no Ack groups while the light intensities are rather high in with Ack groups no matter in T24 or 5637 cell lines. These results indicate that the output gene is expressed only in cells which have Ack in the culture medium.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that the constructed circuit based on AND GATE and UAA orthogonal system can be used to specifically identify bladder cancer cells and express therapeutic gene only when Ack exist. These results may yield a new therapeutic approach for bladder cancer.

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

Modeling of cell-free bisphenol A degradation
In our project we want to construct a cell-free biosensor that can detect bisphenol A (BPA). To be more specific we want to fuse proteins to silica beads that degrade the BPA and detect NAD+ that is set free in the reaction by a NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (also attached to the beads) in combination with a molecular beacon .
Modeling cell-free processes
The fact that our project aims at the construction of a cell-free biosensor has huge advantages regarding the complexity of the model, as it is possible to simulate our project in a small number of differential equations. There are several reasons why this is possible. First off, we do not need to consider the transcription- and  translationrate and other factors influencing the molecular amount of proteins in cells. After extracting our proteins from the E.coli cells we know the exact amount of protein introduced to our cell-free system. Furthermore we can state that the protein amount in our system is constant, as our system does not contain any proteases. Knowing the exact amount of enzymes in our system supplies the modeling with another advantage. We only need to simulate the reactions that are rate-limiting. In case of our model we state that only"

The objective of this module was to regulate the expression of bacteriophages in a living system, which would be achieved through the use of the quorum sensing system from Vibrio fisheri. The production of the phage is regulated using the pLux promoter and the insertions of LuxI and LuxR in the E. coli genome from <a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:Tec-Monterrey/ITESM14_project.html#tab_module1 "" target=""_blank"">Module I</a>.

Background
<section id=""column"">
Quorum sensing is a cell-density dependent gene regulation system. This sensing mechanism is based on the production, secretion and detection of small signaling molecules called autoinducers. The concentration of the autoinducers correlates to the abundance of the microorganisms in the vicinity. When this concentration reaches a threshold, the microorganisms undertake a coordinated change in their gene-expression profiles [1].
The first quorum sensing system to be described was that of the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, and it is considered a model organism of quorum sensing in gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria colonize the light organ of the Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes; when the colonies reach a sufficiently high cell density, the expression of the bioluminescent genes in the luciferase operon (luxICDABE) is activated [2].
There are two proteins that control the expression of the luciferase operon, Lux I and Lux R. The former is an autoinducer synthase, which produces the diffusible signal N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine-lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). On the other hand, LuxR is the cytoplasmic autoinducer receptor and DNA binding transcriptional activator. Both are necessary for the correct expression of the bioluminescent genes [4]
The system operates in the following way:
<p> First, the bacteria begin to grow while producing the autoinducer (3-oxo-C6-HSL).

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," view in the works of Kaushik Sunder Rajan (Rajan 2006). He doesn't actually write about synthetic biology but about genomics, but as synthetic biology is based on genomic technologies, we can rely on Rajan's thesis. In Biocapital, The Constitution of Postgenomic Life, Rajan wonders about the nature and value of the goods of genomics, about what companies and researchers are motivated by. The goods of genomics are informational. They rely on treatment and handling of biological materials in order to create information from it. Rajan then proposes a decomposition of that informational product, the genome. That decomposition will make it possible for us to consider how the ethical stakes have to be regarded.
Rajan's decomposition :
Genomic information = Genetic Materials + Genotype Information + Medical Information
Then, without taking anymore from Sunder Rajan’s works, we have to consider that ethical questions about biosecurity have to be seen through two angles about the nature of the goods of synthetic biology : biological material and genomic information. The informational nature of goods coexisting with collaborative platforms in order to support “free” exchange of these goods within the community (as the BioBricks Foundation) are considered risky in biosecurity concerns. By allowing anybody access to information increases the potential risks of voluntary misuse.
If we focus on public reception of biosecurity concerns, we can find some markers of the social construction of fear. In that perspective, the declaration of Roger Brent, Director of the Molecular Science Institute of Berkeley that 100 000 people are able to create anthrax is mentioned by observers and the media as the thing we have to be scared of. The very high figure, the potentiality of that risk regarding these “capacities” held by so many people and the object of this fear “anthrax”, referring to the post 09/11 alerts are very persuasive elements in order to create fear. Vivagora refers also to an initiative from the The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) about surveillance of genetic resources linked to pathogenic agents. Discourses about terrorist threats are built through these markers and effectively shift ethical concerns, but have to alarm us about what kind of social control devices are indirectly promoted here. Anti terrorism laws and devices (mainly the Patriot Act) seem necessary to life sciences in order to match with ethical concerns. Political implications, consequences and matters which underly the debates are needed to be considered seriously.
2. What Kind of answer to biosecurity concerns?
Vivagora claim an integration of the principle of precaution in social and institutional devices about biosecurity. “"

Centrifuge 5cc bacteria culture at 13000 rps for 2 minute.
Our result turn out to be a clear red color! This indicates that our fusion protein has been successfully displayed on the surface of the cell membrane.
Testing the display function and efficiency of INPNC
We designed the experiment below.
Cultured our modified e-coli containing test circuit(promoter+INPNC+CSP16+RFP+terminator) in LB liquid culture for 12 hours.
Used 96 well plate to culture above-mentioned e-coli.
Used varioskan flash spectral scanning multimode reader to test fluorescence curve and OD curve every 2 hours.
Also, compared culture in LB culture and PBS culture.
Meanwhile, LB culture +competence cell and PBS culture+ competence cell as control.
Our results
First test
After centrifugation, the supernatant is clear; we could indicate that CSP16 is not secreted out of cell. Also, indicated from the red fluorescence of the pellet, we could say that INPNC protein display CSP16 and RFP on the surface.
Second test
At the beginning, the population of E. coli is small as well as OD, so initial figure (Fluorescence /OD) is large. As time proceeds, Fluorescence /OD level increases dramatically, indicating that the INPNC protein is being greatly expressed. The OD level reaches a plateau at the end.
Fluorescence level /OD level indicates the display function of INPNC through growth time.

It employs two component systems called oligopeptide auto-inducers,                                 instead of AHL molecules (luxI from Vibrio fischeri produces AHL with a distinct                                 side chain that can’t be found in Gram positive bacteria)6.
Thus, we may try to express pluxR promoter along with luxI synthases within the gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and test whether there is a reduction in promoter leakiness in such chassis.
Suggestion for more specific recombination
While Cre-loxP system allows                                     the study of spatial and temporal gene expression, CRISPR/Cas9 can target specific site                                     to mediate gene editing. According paper published in 2017,  CRISPR/Cas9 was shown to be able to work with loxP for the first time. This has an application on site-specific genome editing in human cells where using loxP mutant that contains sgRNA could allow a selective gene excision. 7
Nevertheless, future improvements need to be made. Fayu Yang and his research team suggested that loxP66 and loxP71 mutants (which we also employed in this iGEM project) may be more suitable for CRISPR/Cas9-loxP design because they contain PAM sequences which sgRNA can recognize.
Thus, this system may enhance effectiveness in knockout performance inside bacterial cells if two or more external genes are to be inserted and knocked out at the same time. Knocking out long sequences of target gene such as sensing and time-delay module may be done more easily especially when Cre recombinase fails to recognize lox site. Due to time limits, we could not explore more in details so we consider this method as our future suggestions and possible improvement for our project

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," in sequential order over many days. In most cases, it evolving a novel functionality from scratch remains a practically impossible task to be implemented in PACE.
As result its complexity and various failure points, only three groups worldwide have successfully established PACE until today. Of note, two of these groups are headed by the PACE inventors Kevin Esvelt and David Liu themselves, while the third group is run by Prof. Liu’s former post doc Bryan Dickinson. In the course of our iGEM project, we were in contact with all three of these groups. We are extremely grateful for their advice and for them sharing their constructs with us, both of which was extremely important for us to get going.
Figure 1: Bioreactor and flow setup required to perform PACE
Of note, in iGEM, only a single team has accepted the challenge and tried to set up PACE, namely the TU Dresden 2015 team . The team thereby constructed a first PACE bioreactor prototype and tested the flow controls. However, due to the lack of time, they could not run real PACE  experiments. The team concluded: “All in all, the initial experiments helped us to grasp the idea of how such experiments can look like”
Motivation, Initial Design & Engineering Principles
The goal of our work was to make in vivo directed evolution of proteins faster, easier, more robust and expand its application scope. The primary, novel application we envisioned was the in vivo directed evolution of improved and/or novel enzymes, which would be of enormous benefit for diverse industries (e.g. chemical/pharmaceutical production, biomaterial production etc.), but remains particularly challenging with conventional directed evolution or rational engineering strategies. To reach this ambitious goal, we had to leave existing paradigms behind and rethink the concept of directed evolution. As result, we came up with a novel, highly innovative engineering concept: interfacing in vivo and in silico directed evolution by coupling PACE to deep learning of protein sequence –function relationships (Figure 2). The idea behind this concept is to fast-forward directed evolution using an intelligent algorithm. More precisely, our algorithm should enable us to skip the otherwise required evolutionary stepping stones during directed in vivo evolution by pre-evolving proteins with novel, desired target functions in silico.
Figure 2: Interfacing in silico and in vivo directed evolution as novel engineering paradigm.
As side note: As you will see below, we finally replaced the complex PACE-mediated evolution by the much easier PREDCEL protocol developed by us later on. But first things first.
The engineering approach our team used to reach our goal"
MIT,2014,Team:MIT#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," important synthetic biology is to the future and we also knew how excited we are about this field, so we thought it would be a great idea to expose a younger generation to this exciting field!
The Educational Studies Program (ESP) at MIT offers a wonderful opportunity each semester (fall, spring and summer) for MIT students to teach middle school or high school students any subject they want. We thought this was the perfect opportunity to reach out to future synthetic biologists.
Our lecture started by giving the students a review of molecular biology essential synthetic biology, including the and overview of genes, proteins, enzymes, DNA replication, i.e., components of a cell that control its function, and explained the workings of promoters and miRNA, i.e., components that control gene function. Then we explained how synthetic biologists manipulate these components to control the cells, by using different tools such as plasmids, different promoters, repressors, activators, etc. We also made sure that the students understood that synthetic biology is an experimental science, by telling them how we use models and simulations to fine-tune concentrations of the components we are manipulating. Finally, we explained to them how our project is designed using what we had just taught them.
The response to these lectures was very positive. There were compelling questions raised during the lecture regarding our project, which showed that the students not only understood what was going on, but also were thinking about the impact of our project and practical details of making it work.
In the spring, we reached around 50 middle school students. In the summer, we reached around 30 high school students and 50 middle school students. We will also be doing lectures in the fall, after the jamboree, and expect to reach around 50 high school students.
Mexico City High school iGEM team: GenetiX Tec CCM
During the summer, the before the High school iGEM Jamboree, the GenetiX Tec CCM from Mexico City came to Boston, and got together with us.
We started the day with presentations from both teams. After that we discussed difficulties we had or are having with our projects. While having a tour of our lab, the GenetiX team commented on the difficulty to grow cultures without contaminating them, among some of their problems. Afterwards, we walked to iGEM Headquarters together. There we listened in on discussions about these problems and how iGEM can help to alleviate them.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter2_-_-_TEXT.html,"     multimerization system in cytomembrane.
This system will help us achieve the goal of selective polymerization     of enzymes. Polymerized enzymes, different from normal     scattered condition, has much more opportunities to contact with     the substrates. Therefore, our project aims to increase as well as     control the efficiency of complex reactions.
The basic function, polymerization, is carried out by a circular     DNA and DNA-binding protein to polymerize enzymes. First, a     fluorescent protein, a transmembrane domain, an enzyme and a     DNA binding protein are connected in order, forming a complex     that the FP locates outside the film while the enzyme and DNA     binding protein are in cytoplasm. Then integrate specific matching     DNA sequences onto an exogenous plasmid and co-transform     this connecter with expression vectors into E.Coli to associate     enzymes.
In addition, we plan to make the enzymes selectable by remolding     the connecter with different recognition sequences and cotransforming     it with expression vectors. This will help the whole     project to work in all kinds of practical applications. During this year, our team has already had many opportunities     to interact with other teams. We find those communications     inspiring to both sides. Thus, we welcome any kinds of comments     or questions. Let’s work together to ake this year wonderful!

OUR PROJECT
With the exponential growth of interest     in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)     and their vast array of applications in     both space exploration and terrestrial     uses such as the delivery of medicine     and monitoring the environment, the     2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM     team is pioneering the development of     a fully biological UAV for scientific and     humanitarian missions.
Detection of allergens and toxins in food and water is a very     important issue, which is difficult to solve, mainly because the     detection must be done at very low concentrations. Our team is     paving the path to a cheap and accessible solution to this issue     by planning a bio-sensor system that can accurately identify a     substance of interest"
Macquarie_Australia,2017,Team:Macquarie Australia#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," throughout the environment in plants, algae, and other bacteria. These genes would not give rise to a resistance or survival advantage, because they have been engineered to produce hydrogen gas, a highly unlikely advantageous trait as they impart the organism with reduced fitness since its metabolism has been re-engineered to produce non-essential, and possibly growth inhibitory, output. Horizontal transfer could occur in the environment even if our Hydrogen Gas Production Gene Cluster containing cells were dead as the plasmid may still be transferred to another organism. This organism is likely to be in an aerobic environment, which inactivates hydrogenases. If horizontal gene transfer occurs into an anaerobic organism, our gene cluster would not be functional due to the requirement of IPTG for induction.
Australian Law
Working in an Australian laboratory places us under the Gene Technology Act 2000. Therefore we have to protect the health, safety of individuals, and of the environment. We have done so by identifying the risks posed by, or as a result of our technology and have managed these risks by regulating our dealings with our technology. We have been given approval by the Macquarie University Institutional Biosafety Committee to work with the K-12 based Escherichia coli strain, which under the Gene Technology Act 2000 is classified as an exempt dealing. And we therefore will not release it into the environment. Overall the project is still in its design phase which takes place within the lab environment. If it went to market, it would have to be trialled in a consultation phase, controlled release and then a final phase release. All of our work complied with the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, Australia’s national regulatory body.
Manchester Collaboration
Through our collaboration with Manchester we were able to examine the differences in biosafety laws in various countries, and therefore whether there would be any additional safety measures we would need to take if we were to conduct our project in another country or try to launch our business internationally.
We found that Australia was different in the way that biotechnology was regulated by having both nationwide legislation and state/territory specific legislation. Like Australia, countries such as India, Brazil and the United States have more specialised committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws. Canada was especially interesting as it does not have unified legislation for GMO’s, but instead rules are based from their individual sectors (eg In accordance with Foods and Drugs Act, Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada). Brazil is still in the planning stages of its  “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety"

In general, bacteria can be divided into two major groups that differ primarily in their cell envelope: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. E. coli is the model organism for the Gram-negative bacteria. A model organism for the Gram-positive bacteria is B. subtilis, our favorite pet. The natural habitat of B. subtilis is the soil, so it is forced to adapt to numerous environmental changes. Accordingly, B. subtilis is characterized by quick and cunning reflexes and a complex lifestyle. There are many differentiations and survival strategies that B. subtilis can engage (Fig. 1). Due to its natural competence, it can take up exogenous DNA and integrate it into its genome. To be flexible to the environment and move towards nutrients or avoid toxic agents, it is motile with the aid of its peritrichous flagella. If starved, some cells even become cannibals"

Collaboration
Synthetic Rally
In order to achieve better results, we collaborated with the CIDEB-UANL_Mexico team for iGEMhs2012 while doing the Synthetic Rally activity.  Collaboration allowed us to reach better results, organization was the key for success, but above that, it was an amazing team work. We could set different teams in order to give the talks and to set and keep the logistics while the Rally was being performed.
iGEM-MX collaboration network
On August 10, 2012, all the iGEM teams from Mexico were called to make a reunion in order to talk about their projects and to discuss about common problems for iGEM teams in this country. This reunion took place in Irapuato, Gto. Mexico at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV).
iGEM teams presented their main problems, above them there are troubles with customs. These teams decided to make a collaboration network in order to look for solutions to these problems and to achieve better results as teams through collaboration. Among the resolutions that were taken there are to look for institutions that could help us with customs troubles, to standardize the lab protocols among the teams and to make a database for the Registry Parts that we usually get with functional troubles, thus we can look into our parts in order to analyze if there is a general problem or not.
Construction of the Synthetic Biology Tunnel
While we were setting up the Synthetic Biology Tunnel we needed so much help, so we invited the other two teams from our University: the iGEMhs team CIDEB-UANL_Mexico and the iGEMe team UANLe_Mexico. They were helping us with the construction of all the materials needed for this project, and also they helped us while performing the Tunnel, with expositions and logistics.

Neptune is an open-source software tool available to biologists through Github and Nona using the BSDII license. Specifically, it is a web application that runs on a node.js express server using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. To get the software running, the biologist has to go though a couple of easy steps. First, they would have to download node.js, and our project repository.
After running our project through node.js, the biologist would be introduced to the home page of Neptune. Here, they could look at documentation or get started with their project. They can either continue working on a pre-existing project, or start a new one. The user would then be redirected to the dashboard page where they can see a layout of the entire workflow.
The first step to designing a microfluidic chip would be the specify page. Here they can specify the layout of their chip from a very high level description. This would be a simple verilog-like language. Once the description is mapped onto the chip using an automatic place and route tool, the user can then proceed to the design stage. Here, the user can fine tune their work to edit the experimental setup. Once that is complete, the chip design will be outputed as a JSON and an SVG. The SVG would be used to mill out the chip, and the JSON would help the user control the experiment later on. Following the design page, the user would be redirected to a Build page where they can select their hardware based on their requirements. Once the user maps the hardware to their microfluidic chip, they can proceed to Assembly where they would learn how to put all the pieces together. They can set up their entire experiment here including building the hardware infrastructure, milling out their microfluidic chip and sealing the control and flow layers, and so on. Last is the Control page. Here, they can Control their microfluidic device by opening and closing valves, and dispensing liquid through Neptune"

I am 17 year old student coursing fifth semester of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. The main reason I decided to become a member of Genetix was my love and interest for biology and related sciences. I really like the way that Genetix chose not only to focus on biological sciences, but become a multidisciplinary group that searches to help society and spread an overall awareness of science. In addition, I love the way that we can go further from our classes, and investigate on our own, gaining knowledge that can help in our future (given we study sciences later on) and becoming independent in the process. Finally, I love the fact that all members of the team are decided to help and improve  Genetix as a whole.

I really love this area of science and I believe iGem offers an amazingly wide range of experience to enjoy and learn from. Learning everyday not only from the project itself, but mostly from other team members has been one of the best rewards this experience has given me. I believe it is amazing how we are able to mix the practice of science with everything else the industry should involve at such a young age. We manage the project, as well as finances and important events. I especially appreciate those that allow contact with other people to inspire the great love and interest for science our team shares. GenetiX and iGem have given me great knowledge and experience, as well as a profound interest on our topic and the people involved.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Teamtest_-_-_TEXT.html,". I have been working in a research lab for more than a year. Different from the conventional undergraduate research experience, the cool thing about iGEM is that it is totally student run and we have people who major in different fields in science and even engineering! As an undergrad who has always been working and studying with people in my own major, I really look forward to working with these people coming from various disciplines and coming up with something amazing!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to explore the various parts of iGEM. IGEM is not just about designing and carrying out an experiment and presenting the result in the end. We also need to think about the practical aspects of the project: the funding, the feasibility and the social impact, etc. I hope at the end of iGEM, I can gain an insight into scientific research in general.
What inspires you:
The power of research. Research keeps pushing the limits between what we know and the unknown. The findings can be totally unpredicted sometimes and it can also shock the world.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to become a health professional and help out people in my community. And if possible in the future, I also wish to become a WHO agent and save the people who cannot afford the basic medical needs.
Hobbies:
Like many Asians, I go play badminton. I also enjoy ballroom dancing and swimming.

Why iGEM:
Having heard about iGEM from a former team member in my program, I joined the team in 2013. My interest in bioprocess engineering and genetics combined with my desire to find novel solutions to real world problems drove me to apply to UBC iGEM. Needless to say, I enjoyed the experience of iGEM so much that I decided to come back for the 2014 team!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Through iGEM, i hope to better realize the true scale of possibilities in synthetic biology and its true value in our everyday life! I also hope to gain a better understanding of the integration of science in society and develop skills to address these issues.
What inspires you:
""We were not put on this earth to be unremarkable, unimportant, or unnoticed. Make sure you live a life less ordinary."" Every individuals participating in iGEM lives by these words and I have never been as inspired as I was at the iGEM World Championships in Boston last year!

USTC_Software,2009,Team:USTC Software#When_-_-_TEXT.html," So far, this input box is perhaps the simplest one after discussing a lot with our USTC wet team. By proposing many possible solutions, they chose this one. After the publishing of current version, we hope feedback from users can help improve the next version.
Mathematical model
Q1:
The general mathematical model seems to cope with two nodes coupling together at most. How about more than two nodes?
A1:
In current version, we allow more than two nodes reaction function as user-defined form which requires the users to input themselves. Actually, it is easy to add more than two nodes form reaction functions in the model. But the condition of computation time and RAM space will drastically be exacerbated as long as the interaction is related to more than three units. For the next version, we will change our data structure to accommodate more types but more efficient.
Meanwhile, we do believe the 'two-body' approximation to be a moderately acceptable choice. With reference to the classical way physists dealing with Hamiltonian of multi-electron system, we expect the same approximation for interaction among substances - that is, all multi-substances' interaction could always be boiled down to two-body interactions.
One possible mathematical approach is to adopt Tylor Series expansion to shorten each term describing interactions. The physical nature of this mathematical method is nothing but exactly how two-body interactions are interwined to form multi-body interactions.
If three substance x, y and z have an interaction form of 1/(x+y+z), when concentration have significant differences, tylor expansion might work to introduce a perturbation in to this system, avoiding complex calcultions.
Algorithm
Q1:
Can this software run faster and faster?
A1:
Firstly, in our software, we choose and modify these best optimization algorithms carefully by comparing with possible optimization algorithm. How to improve the efficiency of optimization algorithm is an open problem in computer science and mathematics. Collaboration with experts in this field is needed.
Secondly, the speed is quite dependent on the performance of computer. We test these programs separately on Linux system in our high performance workstation. The result is fairly better than the test on our personal computer.
Thirdly, to improve the algorithm performance, parallel computing is a better choice. For this reason, the algorithms we adopt are parallel in nature and extension to parallel algorithm is possible. In the future, we will rewrite our software this form via MPI.
Q2:
Can this software run more and more precisely?
A2:
The imprecision is largely caused by Local minimum and initial value dependence. Similar as above, these are also open problems. For we adopt Monte"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#lasso_-_-_TEXT.html," course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

interview and survey
Through our human practice,we held a science festival in Guangdong Experimental High School and had a meet-up session with the other four teams from Sunyatsen University and South China University of Technology. At the science festival,we knew that many students were interested in biology,but they have never heard about iGEM.And during the meet-up, our team introduced the project and listened to other teams’ projects and their problems during the experiment process. Most importantly, our team interviewed several students from South China University of Technology and discussed the difficulties they had during preparation for iGEM competition. It was obvious that experiment teams and software teams should establish a close relationship and that our project will help experiment teams solve some current problems and satisfy their needs.
We need more accurate data,so we did a survey in order to know more about the market requirement and gap.And we found that about 4.1% of the high school students had interests in biology.However, most of them didn’t know what synthetic biology was.So we got the inspiration to create a serious of lessons on synthetic biology and then improve it into a business model.
Step2
our business product
From the survey and interview,we made up our mind to design a serious of lessons called Synsketch education system,which may be a combination of education and business.The lessons are divided into three parts:basic teaching,learning engine and autonomous learning.
Basic teaching:for those who have no basic biology knowledge,we design a video lesson.Before the class,we send students some fore exercise about the lesson.While having class,we have video lesson that teaches students to use Synsketch to learn biology knowledge.After class,we leave some homework for the student.
Searching engine:for those who have a little biology knowledge,they can chose to have our video lessons.But we prepare a searching engine for them.Learning engine is the combination of data,searching and questioning.We sent students some data,and they can use our Synsketch website to search for biology learning materials.If they have questions,they can leave a online message.
Autonomous learning:for those who know a lot about biology knowledge,we open the Synsketch usage rights for them.They can operate Synsketch to deepen their understanding on synthetic biology.

However, considering safety and public acceptance, we have chosen not to use GMOs in the environment, but only the products of the GMO. Taking into account the public opinion on GMOs and bacterial resistance, we aimed to design a product that looks as safe as possible to make the public comfortable when using our detection method.
Value Sensitive Design with modules
After mapping and interviewing different stakeholders, we were able to make a Value Sensitive Design of our project. In an extended report, we considered stakeholders values (including the values of iGEM) and translated these values to design requirements (figure hierarchical structure). We adapted our design and our project accordingly.
The reports of stakeholders mapping and the Value Sensitive Design can be found here:

Stakeholder analysis
Summary
On different levels, policy-, competition-, and user level, we investigated the values that our design had to meet. How we translated the values of the stakeholders to design requirements can be found in the figure about the Hierarchical Nature of Values (figure 1). Even though some norms were contradictory (as can be seen figure 2, summary values and norms) , we aimed to meet all the norms and values as good as possible.

Our system can work if we can prove the ""in-promoter"" will have different activities under different concentrations of inhibitor and the inhibitor can be used as a signal to sense the plasmid numbers. So we need to do two things to prove that our system could work. Our modeling part is aim at solving the two main problems to model the situation in the experiment and application.
·EXPERIMENT part·
Aim
To model the different concentrations of the intracellular inhibitor and the relationship between the inhibitor and ""in-promoter"".
Find out the threshold of inhibitors’ concentration which can decide whether the ""in-promoter"" expresses or not.
FIRST step: The relationship between the ""in-promoter"" activity and inhibitor.
In this part, in order to model the situations with different concentrations of the intracellular inhibitor, we use the PBAD promoter induced by different concentrations of the arabinose in this circuit (Fig. 1).
Fig.1 The circuit constructed to model the situations with different concentrations of the intracellular inhibitor.
So ""in-promoter"" will be repressed on different levels under the different concentration of the inhibitor.
We can separate this circuit into two parts. For the first part (Fig. 2), after adding the different concentration of arabinose, the AraC protein will combine with the arabinose and form a complex. Then the complex will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the downstream inhibitor. The reaction direction is along the direction of the DNA → mRNA → inhibitor protein (Fig. 2).
Fig.2 AraC protein will combine with the arabinose and form a complex. Then the complex will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the downstream inhibitor.
For the second part (Fig. 3), the inhibitor protein will combine with the ""in-promoter"" sequence to negatively control the expression of the RFP protein.
Fig.4 The inhibitor protein will combine with the ""in-promoter"" sequence to negatively control the expression of the RFP protein.
According to this mechanism, we modeled this circuits to build the relationship between the RFP intensity and the arabinose. Main considerations in this model are the process of repression, induction, transcription, translation, degradation and catalysis.
The assumptions we made are:

Project Description
Bacteria Mimic to Combat Vector-borne Diseases (Lyme disease)
The Rock Ridge iGEM Squad is working to create an efficient and harmless method of eradicating Lyme disease in Loudoun County and hopefully throughout the biosphere. If the project succeeds, the Rock Ridge iGEM Squad will have laid out a solid foundation for forthcoming vaccinations for other vector-borne diseases.  With the bacteria mimic, the team will create a bacteria that will mimic Lyme bacteria to combat Lyme disease. During the experiment, we will be using Drosophila melanogaster as our insect model since they are much easier to work with rather than ticks. Using E. coli as our chassis, the team will add surface protein genes from Wolbachia and Lyme bacteria to BL21 and/or DH5-alpha cells.Wolbachia surface protein will be expressed in our mimic and it will help our mimic be passed down from one generation to the next since it binds to sex cell of the female insects.  In nature, Lyme Bacteria establishes itself in the gut of the tick by expressing the protein OspA. Our plasmid is designed to constitutively express OspA and establish itself in the gut of the tick instead of the Lyme bacteria. When Lyme bacteria infects our tick it will have no place to bind itself in the gut and will not be established. A fluorescent gene will be added, which will let us know that  bacteria mimic is present in the insect. The team will then proceed to conduct the same process in ticks, which are the primary hosts for Lyme. Once the ticks with the new modifications are released into the wild, they will mate naturally and pass on the mimic bacteria. This new method can provide a strong basis for the development of other mimic for vector-borne diseases such as Dengue Fever, Malaria, and more.

Thus we have settled into implementing directed communication and delivery of proteins of interest between different cells/populations. This will possibly form the bigger part of the project and if time permits we will combine this with our magnetotaxis idea.
With respect to modelling we are interested in developing a useful tool for the community and research by possibly expanding the existing BSim software. For further information visit the modelling page of the wiki.
With respect to the lab we will pursuit the building of biobricks that will allow the implementation of proteins of interest into OMVs (outer membrane vesicles) as a first part to the project. Upon the succesful completion of this first task we want to implement some GRN for the control of responses of both production and/or message acceptance.

Vesicles with a twist
We seem to have settled down to the idea that implementing magnetotaxis in vivo in E.coli will be infeasible within the given time-frame. Instead we have decided to move in the direction where we will try implementing the usage of vesicles in our project.
We are still thinking of perhaps implementing magnetotaxis combined with bacteria in an in vitro manner.

Bacterial diagnosis
Ollie and Thanasis spent some time this week looking into whether we could use bacteria to detect and report on the state of an organism. It now seems we have now dropped the idea on the grounds it is too similar to projects attempted in previous years (NYMU, KULeuven) and would require licensing. However there was a suggestion that this idea could be taken in the direction of sequence based toggle switches to carry out a (more complicated) decision tree based diagnosis.
Magnetic bacteria
Petros prepared some slides on the biological feasibility of engineering E.coli to synthesize magnetosome (Copy of the presentation found here)

According to this result, we have interviewed those primary schools again. Most of them have committed to purchase it in the future as long as our product has been launched.
(Among the primary schools we visited 73% are willing to use our product to do regular dental health examinations for school children in the future. The other 27% of primary schools that are remote from cities have no intention of using it, since the children who study there are being reared by grandparents who do not think doing dental examination every three months is very essential.
Based on those results, we described our target market as “Taiwan national primary schools in cities.""
(Actually, we have visited eleven primary schools, but not all of them were willing to take a photo. We just got five here)
How are we done to know our customers’ needs?
1. Online product form survey and PMR survey: In the early production of products, we real took to the streets, to understand the real needs of users. We expect that our products can be more in line with the needs of users. Therefore, we conducted a survey through PMR (Persistence Market Research) to know the oral status of the community in Taiwan, and whether they have right concept of oral health care, we conducted an online form survey to observe the idea of our development of the product in the community is not really need or not.
2. Actually interviewed a representative numbers for our potential customers and demonstrated a minimum viable product：Although the target market we put on primary schools and the end users are the students study there, without parents who can supports those schools won’t accepted this proposal as well. Because the students’ parents are the person who can influence the decision of the school, we have interviewed 189 parents by working with nearby sightseeing areas, setting up a small booth at low prices, demonstrating how to use the original version of the prototype, and explaining the technology used inside. Besides, in order to better understand the stall efficiency, we participated in let the public do the before and after test, the following are the analysis results.
3. We visited Mr. Uily, the president of the dental technology company New Teeth (新芽) and Professor Zhong-guang Chen of National Yunlin University of Science and Technology. In order to make our products meet the needs of the market and be more in line with the needs of users, we invited Mr. Uily to discuss with us the development of the device.

“While safety considerations in regard to Synthetic Biology are certainly desirable to a certain extent, it is important to keep concerns in perspective. While there is always an uncertainty about risk with new technologies, genetic engineering has proved to be rather safe. The likelihood of accidently developing some deadly and devastating biological weapon, for example, are vanishingly small, especially if one considers the constant genetic rearrangement that occurs in nature, on a daily basis.  Another concern is that genetically engineered crops might outcompete their wild type. I find this rather unconvincing in itself, since genetically engineered crops are usually modified in such a way as to suit human purposes better, while wild organisms have evolved over millions of years to be good at surviving. It is therefore almost certain that the wild type will outcompete any human modified organism. Overall I think that regulations concerning synthetic biology and genetic engineering are far more restrictive than they need be and there is little reason to be concerned about incredibly unlikely catastrophes, especially when this technology could be used a lot more effectively to solve key issues facing our society.”
Daniel, 20, Immunology Student
The above are a selection of thoughts on Synthetic Biology from people from a range of backgrounds.  There are certain recurrent themes that arise from their contributions.  First Synthetic Biology is currently very much operating in the shadow thrown by Genetic Engineering and the debates it sparked in the 1980’s.  This has the benefit of interesting and engaging many people from both scientific and non-scientific areas as well as covering a lot of ground in laying foundations for debates on synthetic biology, though perhaps not as much has been established in public acceptance of such work as scientists could wish.  This brings up the negative side of this inheritance.  Many issues that plagued research in the past have been attached to synthetic biology (perhaps in part, as one person I asked about ethics mentioned, because of the unfortunate working title for the field) and in asking about its ethics, one has to make immediately clear that no race of cloned super humans is even on the horizon.   The other clear outcome of people’s opinions is that many feel some form of regulation is needed, above and beyond that of ‘professional self-regulation’ (Balmer, 2008), many agreed with the sentiments that self regulation would of course be a factor in synthetic biology regulation but not to the extent that it will ‘necessarily displace traditional interventions based on regulation, legislation and treaties’ (Maurer et al, 2006).  That said there was some disparity between respondents on the scale and style of regulation, whether based"

I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Molecular Structure and Function at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  At various times in the past I have studied cell and molecular biology (B.Sc. Toronto), molecular biology and genetics (M.Sc. Guelph), computer programming and systems analysis (dip. Inst. Computer Studies, Toronto), bioinformatics (cert. Canadian Genetic Disease Network) and, systems and matrix biology (present).  I have worked as a lab technician, teaching assistant, computer programmer/systems analyst and IS manager.  But, what I would most like to do is what I wrote in my high school yearbook about 20 years ago... Design organisms for export to far away galaxies.  Thanks to iGEM I'm 1/4 of the way there...

I am currently a 2nd year masters student in the Department of Biochemistry at the Unviersity of Toronto, having graduated with a BSc. Honours in Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at the University of Toronto.  I am currently studying the effects of micro-compartmentalization in metabolic channeling.  The creative freedom and the chance of making a lasting difference drew me to synthetic biology.  The fact the iGEM allows for both certainly does help!

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," by Dr. Andrew McBain, Biofilm Research Group, Manchester Pharmacy School. This talk helped the team understand the role of biofilms in causing infection and why they are resistant to antibiotic treatment. During his talk, Dr. McBain explained the role of biofilms in infections and how they confer ABR. He talked to us about persister cells and their importance in the recalcitrance of biofilms to antibiotic treatment. Hence, in the project design, we looked at agents that specifically target these sessile, metabolically inactive persister cells and decided on Art-175 as one of our antibacterial agents.
Professor Timothy K. Lu, from the Synthetic Biology Group at MIT recommended that we use endogenous anti-biofilm agents rather than designing them bottom up. He said that our idea to use synthetic biology as a means of fighting UTIs and ABR was “interesting” but raised to us the the problem of our bacteria being subject to resistance mechanisms depending on the agents used, but that we could overcome this by exploring combinatorial therapies.
During the summer, we also gave two talks, one at the termly Corpus Christi College Biochemistry talks and another to a group of alumni from the Oxford Biochemistry department. Again, the feedback we received in terms of our project idea was positive and our idea was described as “ambitious but achievable”. Max Crispin, Oxford Glycoprotein Therapeutics Laboratory raised the issue of whether the proteins we planned on secreting would be immunogenic. We explored this, and similar issues, in a report we wrote about the urinary biome. Another question we were faced with concerned the issue of whether our solution would make fungal infections more likely. This issue is addressed in the Future section of design.
Return to the public
Having investigated the feasibility of our idea, we approached the public again to seek their opinion. The idea working on paper is one thing, but having the support of the public and the patients who would be using our solution is another aspect entirely.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
We asked the public, “If you had the option of using two treatments for an infection, where one was antibiotics and one was bacteria that were designed to cure the infection, which would you choose?”
The majority (70%) of the people we surveyed said that they would take the advice of their doctor on this. This reinforced to us the importance of nurses and doctors backing our project idea. However, encouragingly, of those who wouldn't take the advice of their doctor, our treatment was favourite with just under half saying they would prefer the designed bacteria (48%), compared to"

Blog #21 - iGEM-Meetup letztes Wochenende -  ein toller Erfolg!
by Nina 09:27, 16 September 2014 (CDT)
Am letzten Wochenende haben sich sechs iGEM-Teams aus ganz Deutschland - nämlich Braunschweig, Darmstadt, Bielefeld, Tübingen, Freiburg and München – mit unserem Team beim iGEM-Meetup Aachen 2014 getroffen.
Willkommen, Teams!
Alle Teams wurden durch unsere drei wunderschönen Rezeptionistinnnen begrüßt.
Das Wochenende fing mit einem Empfang für alle iGEM-Teams in der Couven-Halle auf dem RWTH Campus an. Dieser beinhaltete das Spiel “Synthetic Biology Jeopardy”, entwickelt und programmiert von unserem Team-Mitglied Michael. Das Spiel war in drei Runden aufgeteilt: zwei Vorrunden und ein Finale. Zunächst traten München alias “Bier”, Tübingen alias “Most” und Bielefeld alias “Bielefeld” gegeneinander in den Kategorien Abkürzungen, Aminosäuren, Bad Science Movies, Part Categories und Sponsorenlogos an. Mit 2400 bzw. 800 Punkten erreichten die Teams Most und Bier das Finale. Obwohl Team Bielefeld in der ersten Vorrunde den letzten Platz belegte, bekamen sie noch eine Chance sich für das Finale zu qualifizieren, indem sie für Freiburgs Team einsprungen, die es aufgrund von Verke"

The negative control showed no degradation of estradiol. 6.8 % of ethinyl estradiol was decayed. The positive control TVEL0 is able to degrade 100 % estradiol and ethinyl estradiol. The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 46.9 % of used estradiol after ten minutes incubation. ECOL  was able to degrade 6.7 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % estradiol. With TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus)a degradation 29.5 % were determined.
Immobilization
Figure 16: The percentage of laccases immobilized to CPC-Beads. 99 % of ECOL, 97 % of BPUL and 79 % of BHAL and TTHL laccases were bound to the beads.
Figure 16 shows the percentage of laccases bound after incubation with CPC-beads, relative to the original concentration. The concentration of laccases in the supernatant after incubation was measured using Roti®-Nanoquant. The results showed that only 21% of BHAL laccases was still present in the supernatant. This illustrates that BHAL was successfully immobilized on the CPC-beads.
Figure 17: Illustration of ABTS oxidation by BHAL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity.
Figure 17 shows the illustration of ABTS oxidation by BHAL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity even if a direct comparison with the original and not immobilized laccase solution was not possible due to the very low concentration of purified BHAL.

We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"21 and miR217. As a preliminary test of strand displacement efficiency, we incubated DNA-21 and DNA-217 with NDC in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37C and ran a page (Fig.3). Band intensities were analysed using software ImageJ.
Successful strand displacement is shown here, because when displaced by 2 inputs, a band of the correct output size was produced and the band intensity, correlated with DNA concentration, was higher than when displaced by either 1 of the inputs.
The specificity of strand displacement was tested using two mutant DNA inputs, 21-5’ mut and 21-3’ mut, each carrying a 6-base mutation at its 5’ or 3’ end respectively. As visualized on the PAGE image (Fig. 4), both 21-5’and 21-3’ mut failed to fully displace Stand 5 to produce the expected output, leaving unbound Strand 5 and inputs as bands of around 30bp and 20bp respectively. The smeared output produced by 21-5’ mut could be explained by its interaction with Strand 5 at sequences outside the expected binding region.
After testing the strand displacement efficiency and specificity by DNA equivalents of mi21 and miR217, RNA of the same sequence as miR21 and miR217 were used as the imputs for more realistic testing. After incubation of NDC with the RNA targets in PBS at 37 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, displacement of Strand 5 out of NDC by the RNA targets were visualized as bands of size between 35 to 50bp on PAGE.(Fig. 5) This was consistent with the results of strand displacement using DNA-21 and DNA-217. We showed that the design of a DNA nano device with an output of RNA-DNA duplex was feasible and our NDC could work in a more realistic simulation.
NDC-AS
After assembly, component strands were seen to have formed complexes too large to be run through the PAGE gel (Fig.6). These large complexes close to the loading well were expected to be successfully assembled NDC that could not pass through the gel due to its large 3D structure, with a tetrahedral base of around 16nm per edge. With extended complimetary region between Strand 1-AS and Strand 5-AS.
Same as how we tested strand displacement of NDC, we tested NDC-AS using RNA-21 and RNA-217. After incubation with the RNA targets in PBS at 37 degrees Celsius for 30"

CompositionSearch
A fast, local search of protein sequences
against a specified amino acid distribution
Background
When the relative proportions of amino acids in an unknown protein product have been chemically determined, it is often useful to search a proteome for proteins that have similar amino acid distributions, in order to identify this protein product. While at least one online utility for performing this task already exists (provided by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ), the web-based nature of this program creates some limitations. Firstly, the SIB provides computational resources for the calculation, resulting in slower turnaround for the user (searches take about 15 minutes). Secondly, this program will only search for proteins already in the Swiss-Prot / TrEMBL databases. (At last check, only the smaller Swiss-Prot search was functional.) If an organism is being newly studied and has just been sequenced, its predicted proteome will not be in these databases. Thirdly, due to limited resources, only the top matches to a given search are provided. This does not allow for statistical comparison to the ""typical"" protein within a given proteome. Fourthly, for very-high-security tasks, uploading data to a third party may be undesirable.
Solution: CompositionSearch
CompositionSearch is a software tool we have created to address these issues by allowing an individual to rank all proteins in a proteome by similarity (minimum Euclidian distance) to a reference amino acid distribution locally on one's own computer. This ranking can be generated in a matter of seconds, rather than taking several minutes."
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"in Bacillus subtilis [28] Instead of 90-mer oligos, long single stranded DNA fragments of approximately 2,000 nucleotides, generated by PCR, were used [28]. Besides expression of Beta, Sun et al. also expressed homologous recombinases from other phages. The gene product of region 35 (GP35) from the native B. subtilis phage SPP1 is homologous to Beta. Gene product of region 34 (GP34) encodes an endonuclease similar to λ Exo and GP36 is an ssDNA binding protein [29,30]. This native Bacilli reecombineering system yielded higher efficiency compared to λ Red in B. subtilis, but lower efficiency in E. coli[28].
Based on heterologous expression of many recombinases of different origin in Bacillus subtilis, it was concluded that recombineering efficiencies were optimized by using a recombinase derived from a phage, whose host was closely related to the MAGE host. We noticed that codon usage of lambda beta is not optimal for expression of B. subtilis and that expression level (likely due to codon usage) varied among the recombinases tested in the study. In addition, the length of the oligo they tested is drastically different from the optimal length in E. coli based on the λ Red Lambda recombineering system and their engineering was not done in multiplex mode.
 
Our first goal was therefore to generate a MAGE compatible Bacillus subtilis strain that could be transformed with short oligos.

Cloning Strategy
First, we used gfp as a proof of principle and fused it to cgeA and cotZ . This way, we can determine if it is possible to display proteins on the spore crust and if their expression has any effect on spore formation.
We constructed the BioBricks for cotZ, cgeA and gfp in Freiburg Standard . The cotZ gene was then fused to its two native promoters, PcotV and to PcotYZ, and PcgeA, which regulates the transcription of cgeA. For cgeA we only used its native promoter PcgeA and the stronger one of the two promoters of the cotVWXYZ cluster, PcotYZ (for more details see crust promotor evaluation ). In addition gfp was ligated to the terminator B0014 . After sequence confirmation, we fused the cgeA/cotZ- and gfp-constructs together, applying the Freiburg standard to create in-frame fusion proteins. This way, we created C-terminal gfp fusion to both spore crust proteins flanked by the promoters and terminator above (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4: Section of the genome of B. subtilis with the various integrated constructs.
But as we did not know if C- or N-terminal fusion would influence the fusion protein expression, our second aim was to construct N-terminal fusion proteins as well. For this purpose we wanted to fuse the genes for the crust proteins cotZ and cgeA to the terminator and gfp to the three chosen promoters. Unfortunately, there occured"

Phototaxis
Bacterial flagellar motility
Bacteria have evolved many modes of propulsion for the microscale environments they inhabit. At these scales materials behave very different than at macroscale, and of particular interest to us is the way liquids seem more viscous [ 1 ]. One of the many ways bacteria move around in liquids, is by means of flagella. A single flagellum is a thin filament around 100-150 Å thick, that extends many cell lengths out from the cell [ 2 ]. It consists mainly of flagellin subunits that assemble into a helical structure forming a long hollow cylindrical filament [ 3 ]. In E. coli the mean number of flagella per cell is 4 [ 4 ], but there is a wide variance between strains, and even between individual cells of each strain. The environment around the cell also has a large influence on how many flagellae are present, or if they are present at all [ 4 ]. Flagella rotate to generate force that allows bacterial cells to swim through fluids in characteristic patterns, more on which later, in search of better conditions for proliferation or survival [ 5 ]. Normally flagellated strains of E. coli can achieve speeds up to 20µm/sec [ 4 ], and considering a cell length of only 1-2µm, this is an impressive feat indeed.
A flagellum  is anchored to the cell body by a large, wheel-like protein complex spanning both inner and outer membranes [ 4 ]. Through this complex subunits are secreted to the tip of the flagellar tube [ 3 ], thus elongating the filament (This mechanism is slightly different in archaea, where the filament is assembled from the base of the flagellum). The membrane anchor also functions as a rotary engine, driven by the proton motive force [ 4 ]. In E. coli the flagellar motor rotates at up to 300hz and can turn either clockwise or counter-clockwise [ 4 ],"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," for the comparison.
We have considered tuning pLuxR promoter instead of adding ABR and antisense RNA. However, we predicted                     that there will be a tradeoff. If the promoter is tuned to express low level of LuxI, that will minimize                     AHL production. Thus, the leakiness will be reduced. However, that means the impact of AHL diffusing                     across cell membrane will be impeded given that AHL concentration inside the cell affects the diffusion                     rate across cell membrane.
The adjustment of pLuxR promoter should satisfy the criteria that:
It will not constitutively express until LuxR:AHL complex induces
It can produce high LuxI product which catalyzes high concentration of AHL once induced.
Apparently, mutation of promoter to lower the leakiness cannot compensate the second criterion. Thus, the                     second suggestion for improvement is to use Gram-positive bacteria as a chassis.
CUHK's characterization
We sent our parts to CUHK to characterize and validate our sensing module’s constructs for the effect of                     antisense RNA on the basal expression level. However, their results are not consistent with our results.                     Because there was no increase in fluorescence/OD600 for our positive control I, we omit their results                     in our data processing and interpretation.
