We discovered their use of a model of sympathetic ganglion 'B' type cells of a bullfrog as described in Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Synapses to Networks [1] . The large amount of Spanish comments in their MATLAB model made it even more difficult for us to understand the link between yeast cells and these neural cells, so therefore we decided to remake this model. We were able to do so, performed a complete parameter sensitivity analysis, tried to adapt this model to the characteristics of yeast cells and finally had to decide that this model simply does not fit the calcium homeostasis in yeast cells... :'-( Let's create a new model...
Exploring the lab
Unfortunately most of our lab team members never worked in a biochemical lab before. We were used to the basics of wetwork, but performing a PCR was completely new to us. We just started to work with the yeast cells provided and made a lot of mistakes, but during the weeks we created more and more feeling with the wetwork and the possibilities of our field of interest, the yeast cells! We made a first design of the device in collaboration with the Equipment and Prototype Centre at the Technical University of Eindhoven.

“There are good, purely natural alternatives, therefore the use of glyphosate should be forbitten or at least reduced.”
“poison is poison, it harms the biodiversity and its long term effects are not known. I think the use should be at least reduced until we are sure that it is not cancerogenic! “
“It is a very effective and ecological agent. It should not be reduced neither be forbitten.”
- All the plants that get into contact with glyphosate die. Therefore it‘s good against weeds. That is in a small amount okay. But therefore arable landscapes turn into monotonous fields and insects don‘t find enough food anymore. It doesn’t have to be forbidden until there will be better alternatives but it should at least be reduced.  - new alternatives should be searched - Monsanto is the best - Unknown risks (for insects/environment/organisms) - it destroys life - usage should be controlled the following comments were made in german: - Ein Insektizid, das nicht erwiesenermaßen gesundheitsunschädlich ist, darf nicht in jedem verkauften Lebensmittel (kennzeichnungsfrei) enthalten sein. Der Einsatz von gentechnisch verändertem RoundUpReady-Saatgut in Kombination mit Glyphosat-Spritzung ist bedenklich, da so noch häufiger gespritzt werden kann. - Der alternative Landbau hat bereits Alternativen aufgezeigt, die leider immer noch viel zu wenig beachtet werden. - Da es soweit ich das verstehe, nicht selektiv ist, sterben auch Insekten, die nicht wie der Maiszünsler die Futterpflanzen angreifen. Es braucht ein System, das nicht pauschal alles tötet. - Mögliche negative Folgen sind nicht genau erforscht, aber sehr wahrscheinlich. Z. B. Insektensterben, krebsauslösend, Einschränkung der Diversität bei Pflanzen - Ich persönlich sehe das größte Problem in der Nutzung z.B. in Bananenplantagen, wo die Arbeiter viel zu viel davon abbekommen und krank werden.

x6 top agar produced bigger/more plaques than x8 top agar. For selection purposes, we decided to use x8 top agar from now on.
6) Selection - round 1
We saw a few bigger plaques (compared to the average plaque sizes) from the 45 plates. These are ones we are interested in.
7) Large plaque confirmation
Large scale contamination prevented any plaque from showing up.
VI) Conclusion
Because there appears to be no visible decrease in the number of plaques as the concentration of mutagen increases, mutagenesis probably didn't occur effectively. In order to hopefully fix this, we will try mutagenesis again with a minimal media instead of LB. (See 6.12 Mutagen Concentration Test - Perfected Protocol )

WEEK 8: 7/25-7/29/2011
I met with Swapnil and Evan, a graduate student, to discuss our plans for characterizing the simple devices the iGEM team is building using the FACS machine. Due to the delicate nature of the FACS machine, Evan and I will be running the FACS analysis for the iGEM team to avoid having multiple untrained people working on the machine.
I also met with Evan separately to come up with the detailed protocol we will follow for running FACS samples.
WEEK 9: 8/1-8/5/2011
The Wellesley team members joined us on Monday to demonstrate their new software tool called Gnome Surfer Pro. The wet team members were split into two groups and participated in the demo and gave feedback.
The wet team also participated in the BU comp team members' Clotho Dojo. The Clotho Dojo ran for the entire day and was used to demo the new applications the computational team had designed in Clotho. We also gave immediate feedback on the apps they developed and offered suggestions for improvement for use in the wet lab.
I also met with Doug, Swapnil, Jenhan and Craig to go over some very useful invertase information that Josh Gilmore had sent us previously. We used our meeting to ask each other questions and to clarify how invertases work and what other applications they may be useful for.
Given the lack of success using SBFP2 (BBa_K156010) and it's poor gel results listed on the registry, we requested a new part from the registry (BBa_K156025) which contains RBS+SBFP2 (B0034+K156010).
WEEK 10: 8/8-8/12/2011
Induction of pBad continued to fail despite adding up to 5mM arabinose to the cultures. We discovered that the pBad promoter (BBa_I13453) we were using required AraC to work and that our commercially purchased cells lack the AraC gene. To remedy this error, we have started working with BBa_I0500, a pBad promoter that also contains the AraC gene.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," However, in relative measurements, the device was proved to work.
Biosynthetic AND gate
It was expected that post-transcriptional regulation, generated synthetically by the lock of the RBS and the following induction of the key for that lock will create a time-delay device. A plan for this strategy was elaborated in this sub-project and several attempts to construct it were performed. However, none of them were successful and this strategy was left behind in order to complete remaining work.
Lock and Key Library
Based on the work of Isaacs F. 2004 , Berkeley iGEM 2006 , Caltech iGEM 2007 and Peking iGEM 2007 and impulse by the lack of riboregulators, or named as locks and keys in iGEM members, we present the design and construction of an algorithm of an online lock and key generator. This work provides a tool for future iGEM teams which wanted to use post-transcriptional modification as a regulatory system and, because design needs, the use of RBS’s with different strengths are required. Although several teams have designed different riboregulators, they always focused on the “normal” RBS from the registry; this does not take advantage of the large library of RBS present in the site. Moreover, various teams make use of this post-transcriptional tool in this year projects (for example KULeuven and Tokyo-Nokogen ), indicating a need for improvements and expansions of this tool.
The predicted secondary structure of the RNA derived from the DNA generated by the online generator, shows that the locks sequester the RBS chosen by the user, impeding the expression of the protein downstream the RBS. The online tool also generates a matching key which interacts with the lock will release the RBS, allowing expression of the protein of interest.
In order to test the functionality of the riboregulators generated by the online tool, two pairs of lock and key were chosen to be constructed and tested. The locks and the respective keys for “weak” and “medium” RBS from the registry were successfully constructed. These riboregulators were used to construct two plasmids which could help for the characterization of the locks and keys. Besides the mentioned plasmids, two controls were designed and constructed. Both, controls and plasmids, were constructed to be functional after IPTG induction. However, the lack of LacI repressor in the cells used forbids us to completely characterize the riboregulators. Future work should be done in order to characterize this new biobricks and other"

Design
Process for simple bioreactor assembly used to measure current produced by Shewanella Oneidensis strains when connected to a potentiostat
Bioreactors
Single chambered bioreactors were designed to be economical and functional.  Reactors are run on magnetic stir plates and connected to a lab grade potentiostat.
Plasmid
To produce an electric current from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in response to chemicals in a sample, the mtrB gene was first removed from the genome (ΔmtrB) then re-introduced to the bacteria in a plasmid vector under an inducible promoter. The first promoter chosen was the well-studied IPTG inducible T7A1 promoter. Next, nine promoter sequences shown to respond to different effector molecules were identified and amplified from the S. oneidensis MR-1 genome with the addition of the restriction enzyme cut sites for AatII and NdeI on either end.  Double digestion of both the vector and promoters using AatII and NdeI removed the T7A1 promoter and produced compatible sticky ends in the new promoter for insertion via ligation.
The designed constructs were individually transformed into E. coli WM3064, sequenced for confirmation, then conjugated into S. oneidensis MR-1 ∆mtrB. The S. oneidensis were then tested for induction through quantification of GFP fluorescence (marker protein) and current production using a spectrophotometer and bioreactor, respectively.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Overview ""It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed."" –Napolean Hill We reached out for 3 registered teams this year and achieved mutual benefits in the process of cooperation. As a software team, we use our skills at data processing and front-end visualization to help other teams a lot. Also, they gave lots of practical suggestions on our project from the experimenter's point of view. SJTU-software We surprisely found that the project of SJTU-software is also relative to metabolic pathway like us from the website of iGEM. So we contacted with their team leader and held a meeting to communicate on our projects and solve problems we met together. Mutual Benefits Achieved Our software contains a function of flux balance analysis with Cobra tool box. Surprisely, some team members of SJTU-software have learnt Cobra tool box in their professional classes. Since our software only evaluated the flux distribution and did not look insight into the results, they showed us some cases and taught us how to choose knockout native genes for more efficient heterologous pathways based on the results of flux balance analysis. We added this to our project and made our software more practical.
Fig.1. Discussing with SJTU-software and Brainstorming.
Fig.2. Example of FBA results in Alpha Ant. The team of SJTU-software countered some difficulties in visualizing network. During this meetup, we presented beta-version of our software. Since our team also implemented network visualization and master the skill of front-end visualization, we introduced the tutorial of D3.js package which is used for data visualization in detail and help them work it out.
Fig.3. Zhichao Ma from Tongji-Software showed beta-version of our software. Besides the assistant on project, the team member of SJTU-software Yangzhen Wei who has participated in iGEM twice shared us his experiences in Giant Jamboree and the climate, transportation and accommodation in Boston. Thanks for Wei’s reminder of keeping warm and hydrated due to the dry and cold climate in October in Boston!

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala_-_-_TEXT.html," By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple candidate peptides that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way.
Figure 4. Flowchart representing the phage display outline.
3. Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reporter to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.
Figure 5. We would be able to detect the worms in feces with this method.
4. Modeling
Optimization of the Time Between Treatments
To make sure that the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimized usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimized use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the Worm Buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model constitutes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.

A3- LasB (GFP REPORTER) OR GATE
This construct was designed to function as an OR logic gate. Our system consists in two different promoters (A3 and  LasB) expressing the same reporter gene (GFP). LasB (BBa_R0079) promoter (used by NYMU-Taipei 2009, Northwestern 2011, Tokyo-tech iGEM 2011 and Tsinghua-A 2011) requires both an activator protein, LasR, and an N-acylhomoserine lactone compound termed Pseudomonas autoinducer (PAI). A3 promoter is activated by P4, a regulatory protein from phage φ29 from Bacillus subtilis. In this way, if our target cell receive either LasR, P4 or both proteins, it will express GFP protein and we will have an OR gate.
To obtain our final construct we required the following Biological Parts:
Obtained from the Registry:

NrtA Functional Test
We expect the engineered E.coli with NrtA gene could express NrtA protein. When we co-cultured it with microalgae, the NrtA protein will capture nitrate and nitrite, and the microalgae will undergo nitrogen starvation and produce more oil. To test our hypothesis, first, we should verify whether NrtA protein could capture nitrate and nitrite or not, and then, second, we need to test whether the engineered E.coli could decrease nitrate and nitrite in the medium.
NrtA Protein
To test whether NrtA protein could capture nitrate and nitrite, we used French Pressure Press to lyse the control group (Negative control: CC) and the NrtA-expressing group, after dialysis in BG-11 medium. We used Cayman Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit to measure the nitrate and nitrite concentration in the medium with/without NrtA protein. (You can see the detail in our Notebook page: click .)
Here are our results.

The nitrate and nitrite concentration of competent cell and NrtA is significant different. The results indicate that NrtA protein can capture nitrite and nitrate! This is a milestone of our project!
The Engineered E.coli with NrtA Gene
Then we wanted to know whether the engineered E.coli could decrease nitrate and nitrite in the environment. We used Cayman Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit to measure the nitrate and nitrite concentration of the BG-11 medium submerged several hours with/without the NrtA"

Those attempts successfully resulted in the construction of responsive, wearable patches such as penicillin-producing layers. Yet, it remains challenging to create hybrid living materials which maintain sustained cell viability, allow intercellular and environmental communication, and guarantee the safe entrapment of cells inside the material (1). To date, most attempts involved caging bacteria behind a nanoporous top layer, thus limiting the diffusion of nutrients, signaling molecules and secreted products. Team iGEM Groningen 2014 tried a similar approach in their design of a burn wound patch. They used a mechanical support combined with a nanoporous membrane and a top membrane to prevent escape. Their lack of bacterial proliferation in polyacrylamide (pAA) gels may be a consequence of the limited diffusion caused by such a system, considering that they did observe growth in ruptured gels. The example illustrates that viability remains a key challenge in the design of living materials, a problem apparent in 3D printed gels with tiny pores. This approach greatly limits the range of possible applications. As stated by Liu et al., “A versatile material system and a general method to design living materials (…) remain a critical need in the field” (1).
Design & Results
Design
To maintain bacterial viability while ensuring containment, we take a new approach to living material design. Instead of limiting the pore size of the hydrogel, we equip our bacteria with a special adhesion protein with affinity for a specific hydrogel to entrap them inside. Consequently, we are free to adapt the material’s pore size to the requirements for bacterial viability and functionality. The larger pore size enables the free diffusion of nutrients, signaling molecules and targeted products into and out of the gel. This strategy thus ensures the material’s safety, viability and functionality.
Figure 4. Our approach to a living material for wound healing. The dextran hydrogel contains functional E. coli bacteria which adhere to the gel via an adhesin and secrete bacteriocins.
We thus searched for a specific combination of a biocompatible hydrogel and an adhesin with high affinity for the gel to meet the (bio)safety requirement. In addition, we needed a robust gel which provides a viable environment to the E. coli bacteria we incorporate into the material. It must be possible to sterilize the gel. Preferentially, the material should also be affordable, well-storable, sustainable and its synthesis should be straight-forward, safe and scalable. As documented on the design page , the"

BNU-CHINA,2015,Team:BNU-CHINA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," number of teams participated in this conference than the NCTU conference. After preparing for a month, we had a better experiment design scheme, achieved positive results to some extent, and made progress on mathematical modeling and device setting with efforts of all team members. In the conference, each team conducted in-depth communication and exchanged ideas on their own projects. The inspiring spark collided by thoughts and innovation among the teams made the attendees reap substantial benefits. At the conference, combining the improvement guided by the former exchange, we exhibited trail of thought and innovation to the attending teams of Chinese well-known universities with more complete and lucid system. In addition, we fully explained the scientific and practical value of our project which offered more people the access to know about the harm of roundworms and the impact of our project. In the meantime, we also held open attitude towards the sincere suggestions and comments from other teams.

the exhaust air from the laboratory room is discharged to the outdoors,
the ventilation to the laboratory is balanced to provide directional airflow into the room,
access to the laboratory is restricted when work is in progress, and
the recommended Standard Microbiological Practices, Special Practices, and Safety Equipment for BSL3 are rigorously followed.
The decision to implement this modification of Biosafety Level 3 recommendations are made only by the laboratory director.
Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4)
This level is required for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections, agents which cause severe to fatal disease in humans for which vaccines or other treatments are not available, such as Bolivian and Argentine hemorrhagic fevers, smallpox (there is a vaccine), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and other various hemorrhagic diseases.When dealing with biological hazards at this level the use of a Hazmat suit and a self-contained oxygen supply is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a Level Four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an ultraviolet light room, and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent both doors opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a BSL4 lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release.
Agents with a close or identical antigenic relationship to BSL4 agents are handled at this level until sufficient data is obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or to work with them at a lower level.
Members of the laboratory staff have specific and thorough training in handling extremely hazardous infectious agents and they understand the primary and secondary containment functions of the standard and special practices, the containment equipment, and the laboratory design characteristics. They are supervised by qualified scientists who are trained and experienced in working with these agents. Access to the laboratory is strictly controlled by the laboratory director.
The facility is either in a separate building or in a controlled area within a building, which is completely isolated from all other areas of the building. A specific facility operations manual is prepared or adopted. Building protocols for preventing contamination often uses negatively pressurized facilities, which, if compromised, would severely inhibit an outbreak of aerosol pathogens.

Results [1,2]
Each cell population, which represents different time range of the monitoring, has been subjected to an annexin V assay at the instant looked for. Unfortunately, a wrong dilution of the annexin buffer caused the death of each cell population during the test. Even if results were convincing for the monitoring at +24h, +30h and +48h by simple comparison between the control and the test population in the microscope (figure 1), we could not confirm it by cytometric analysis.
Figure 1 : cells morphology with or without p53 wild-type incorporation
Because we could only start DU-145 culture at the beginning of October, the two weeks needed to reach the necessary confluence did not let us to try a second experiment.
However, several studies showed that to bring p53 wild type into tumor mutated cells launch the apoptosis process. It is notably the case of the study leaded by Chunlin Yang in 1995, who was working, like us, on mutated p53 prostatic cancer cells (Tsu-pr1). The p53 wild type were not transfected by electroporation but by infecting tumor cells by non replicatives adenoviruses containing p53wt (AdCMV.p53). 48 hours after the infection of a tumor population with AdCMV.p53, a high expression of p53 is correlated with an important rate of cell death. If control populations (non-infected cells and cells infected with adenovirus containing lacZ gene, AdCMV.NLSßgal) show a similar and healthy morphology, condensation and cell detachment are observed in p53 infected population. To check if the death process followed by cells correspond to the apoptotic way, a migration on agar gel of their genome has been realized.
Figure 2 : Electrophoresis on agar gel of isolated non-infected DNA cells (a), infected by AdCMV.NLSßgal (b) and AdCMV.p53 (c).
Infected by AdCMV.p53, cells show multiple bands (laddering pattern) while non-infected cells or AdCMV.NLSßgal infected cells show a unique one at high molecular weight. These results indicate that the cell induced by p53 wild type is from apoptotic origin by the genome fragmentation observation, consequence to the CAD (Caspase Activated DNase) activity, a specific endonuclease of the apoptotic process.

Homology modelling
We modeled the 3D structure of our peptide-containing scaffolds (domain B1 of protein G from Staphylococcus aureus) by homology modelling. We used the Modeller library to accomplish that; since the peptide is about 20-25 amino acids long, it can be modeled as a loop inside the B1 domain scaffold for which there are already a number of 3D structures available at the Protein Data Bank.
This is the general homology modeling procedure we followed. All peptides were cloned inside a scaffold (B1 domain of protein G from Staphylococcus aureus. The peptides were short enough to be modeled as an internal loop by loop refinement; these structures should only be considered as a working model, since we do not have direct crystallographic data. A detailed procedure can be found in this link.
Results summary
Protein G scaffold
The table 2 is a summary of the models we generated for our peptides inside the protein G scaffold. Their main purpose is to give us an idea if the calculated energy profile matches our assumption that the peptide is being exposed to the exterior of the scaffold. These models are in no way definitive, since we lack direct crystalographic data. As can be seen, all the structures show two distinct domains: one for the protein G scaffold and the other for the peptide.

To Indianapolis and beyond...
‘Twas a bright and sunny Saturday afternoon when we disembarked in Indianapolis Airport. Along the way to the hotel we observed the actions of our taxi driver and were surprised to learn that texting or talking on the phone while driving was not yet outlawed in Indiana unlike in Alberta. This caused us to reminisce about the old days when driving and texting were the norm back home. We arrived at the hotel and donned our newly printed team Calgary T-shirts and proceeded to head over to the iGEM reception at the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) where we met some familiar faces from the other Alberta teams and then went on to practice our presentation.
Presentation Day
Our group was one of the earliest to present on Sunday morning, preceded only by Team Panama in our particular hall. After receiving mainly promising reviews, we went on to attend the presentations from all the different iGEM teams. We always kept a few team member close to our poster to answer any questions anyone visiting our poster had about the project. Later on in the day our poster sessions our discussions with judges also seemed promising as we received both praise and suggestions for our project and our wiki. The night was concluded with the scheduled activities including Fun Food, Games, and other activities. Though some of the members had to call it a day early and study for the numerous exams they had the week they got back.
Awards Day

This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.

Industrial Dyeing Process

Our Green Pathway to Dye Jeans
Introduction
Abstract
The world consumes over 40 million kilograms of indigo annually, primarily for dyeing denim. Indigo is currently derived from petroleum using a high energy process, and commercial dyeing involves the use of reducing agents to solubilize the dye. The development of biosynthetic and bioprocessing methodologies for indigo dyeing could have environmental and economic advantages. By combining the biosynthesis of indigo and the use of the natural indigo precursor indican, we propose a more sustainable dyeing method as an alternative to chemically-reduced indigo in the large scale production of indigo textiles. We achieved in vivo indigo production in high titers, and efficient cleavage of indican using a non-native glucosidase. Inspired by natural systems, we isolated and characterized several plant and bacterial glucosyl transferases hypothesized to produce indican. Lastly, we compare the cost and environmental impact of our alternative with the present chemical process.
Industrial Dyeing Process
The world needs to dye 3 billion pairs of jeans with indigo annually. Currently, industrial dyeing uses an extensive process, first producing indigo from the petroleum product, benzene, and then solubilizing indigo to allow it to adhere to cloth. The chemicals used in the process include strong acids, strong bases, and the reducing agent sodium dithionite. The table shown below shows the NFPA diamonds for each chemical highlighting their reactivity and hazards. Given previous iGEM interest in indigo by teams Cornell , KAIST , and Chalmers , as well as the potential for a greener, biosynthetic alternative to denim dyeing, we started our project – Project Blue Genes.
Inspiration: Indigo Chemistry in Plants
Upon beginning our search for biosynthetic routes for dyeing jeans, we learned that certain species of plants produce indigo under stressed conditions. Below is polygonum tinctor"

After gavage, we collected the feces every two days and cultivated it in 3x chloramphenicol                     LB medium overnight. (See protocols for details). The results showed that, we can still detect Nissle                     1917 left in feces at Day 5 after gavage. However, we can’t detect Nissle 1917 at Day 7. We can conclude                     that Nissle 1917 was decolonized or lost its plasmid between Day 5 and Day 7 (Figure 10).
Figure 9 The result shows that the supernatant cannot utilize urate, which is not consistent with the hypothesis we raised                     before. It may indicate that the bacteria can utilize the urate in a special stage without leakage.
We tried to establish the HUA mouse model in the first stage in our animal experiment. We divided 10 male 5-week-aged balb/c mice into two groups randomly: Group 1 (n=5) and Group 2 (n=5). Set one week’s time without special handling to let them adapt to the new environment. Feed Group 2 with special food containing 0.1% adenine since week 2 while feeding Group 1 with normal food. All the feeding condition is the same expect for food.The blood of all the mice from caudal vein was taken after 3 weeks’ feeding. Isolate the serum and demonstrate the concentration of blood uric acid with ELISA.  The result showed that, we can use the method to establish the HUA model successfully (Figure 11a.).
Then, the engineered bacteria was used in the animal experiment. We divided 25 male 5-week-aged balb/c mice into five groups randomly: Group Control (Group A, n=5), Group HUA (Group B, n=5), Group Allopurinol (Group C, n=5), Group engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 (transformed with BBa_K2334001) (Group D,n=5) and Group E. coli Nissle 1917 (Group E, n=5) [Figure 11b]. Set one week’s time without special handling to let them adapt to the new environment.

Figure 2: This graph is used to show the number of cells as a percentage of the control that have been killed as a result of irradiating the samples with 254nm UV at exposure times of    2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 minutes. The results are an average of three biological repeats and three technical repeats (n=9).
Both graphs clearly demonstrate that 10 minute exposure to the UV light caused the greatest cell death, suggesting that greater the exposure time the greater     the number of cells killed, as we would expect.    Most significantly for our filtration though, this experiment has proven that the use of UV radiation is not a suitable bactericide.    This is because in order to achieve an escape frequency anywhere close to the current legal requirement (which is of the order 10-8) the water would have to be irradiated     for a period much longer than 10 minutes which is not practical for our intended use. Therefore we need to explore possible alternative to UV.
Other Comments
Whilst plate counting it was noticed that some cells on the plates were larger than others, (see image image below). At first, as this had not been observed    before, we assumed it was because we had left the plates in the incubator for too long which had allowed for them to grow to such a size. However after reducing     the time the plates were incubated for and still seeing the same results, we consulted our PIs. It was     suggested that these anomalies could be a result of mutations where the UV was not powerful enough to destroy the cell but had managed to damage the cell's DNA. This    idea is supported by the fact that the observed larger cells were most common on plates that had been irradiated for 5 and 10 minutes. The occurrence of these mutated cells strengthens our claim that the use of UV is not suitable. This is because it has the potential to cause further mutations to the E. coli's DNA which could bring about unforeseen impacts to the surround ecology.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Notebook#Funding_-_-_TEXT.html," of science. He placed the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, he could pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass.
The end of one whisker was reinserted by the use of the flame, in this way he could create a very small, high quality glass sphere. Eventually these spheres became the lenses of his microscope; the smaller the sphere, the higher the magnification. Since his technique wasn’t very complicated, he realised it was critical that no one would know how he did it. If the scientific community  knew his simple method for creating the critically important lens, they would disregard or might even forget his role in microscopy. Therefore he allowed others to believe that he was laboriously spending most of his nights and free time grinding increasingly tiny lenses to use in microscopes. However, the fact remains that van Leeuwenhoek made hundreds of microscopes.
The discoveries of van Leeuwenhoek began in 1674, when he examined samples from the cloudy water of the Berkelse Meer. (a lake near Delft which no longer exists). Nowadays van Leeuwenhoek is generally mentioned in connection with the discovery of microorganisms. However, his studies were much broader than microorganisms He dissected insects and examined anything that would fit on his microscope.
The first letter to the Royal Society illustrates this clearly, as it covers the sting, head and eye of a bee, and the structure of a louse as well as his observations of fungus that he said grew on leather, meat and other things. In 1673 his earliest observations were published by the Royal Society in its journal: Philosophical Transactions. Despite the initial success of Van Leeuwenhoek’s relationship with the Royal Society, this relationship was soon severely strained. In 1676 his credibility was questioned when he sent a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Since previously no one had ever seen single-celled microorganisms, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with scepticism. Eventually, in the face of Van Leeuwenhoek’s insistence, the Royal Society sent an English vicar together with a team of respected judges and doctors. Finally in 1680 the observations of Van Leeuwenhoek were fully vindicated by the society.
Using a Microscope
Nowadays the van Leeuwenhoek microscopes usually end up as curiosities in musea, while many of them could still be used.  One enthusiast, Hans Loncke ,  aims to make exact copies of the existing authentic AvL microscopes."

Constructing an optimized human ferritin BioBrick
In general ferritins are found in all kingdoms of life and in many different cells of multicellular organisms. They fulfill manifold tasks synthesize iron concentrates required for cells to make cofactors of iron proteins (heme, FeS, mono and diiron) as well as caged ferritin Fe2O3*H2O is acting as an antioxidant crucial for bio metabolism of proteins [1]. Human Ferritin (huferritin) consits of two different domains, light and heavy chain.
The presented plasmid DNA construct JBFS_Mil_Ferritin <partinfo>BBa_K1438025</partinfo> from our iGEM Team Berlin 2014 is a standardized pQE80L plasmid backbone containing human ferritin. This part was built from a iGEM Calgary 2013 part that they provided us. We were able to improve this part further, please see the part in the registry for informartion
We created this construct according to a paper published 2010 in Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) [3], they presented different compositions of Ferritin made of light (L) and heavy (H) chain, linked with an Glycine-Serine - construct (GS-Linker,*).
“We found that the L*H chimera exhibits significantly enhanced iron-loading ability [...] compared to wild-type ferritin [3].“
Therefore it was necessary to combine different methods used in standard molecular biology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of single light and heavy chain. Assembly PCR for combination of amplified light and heavy chain containing GS-Linker sequence and furthermore ligation and transformation [2,3].

The Minnesota iGEM team created a pamphlet that will contain a variety of safety systems for biocontainment that iGEM teams have made. Examples of safety systems include, but is not limited to, antibiotic resistance plasmids, auxotrophy systems, and kill switches. This is intended to be resource for the future if teams are or will be considering a hypothetical release of their project into the environment and want to study how the system will behave in an ecosystem. It is of the utmost importance to consider safety precautions and implement them into the project beforehand. A google submission form was added to the iGEM news board so that teams across the world could input how they plan on retaining the safety of their project.
We received feedback from three different iGEM teams; iGEM Linkoping Sweden, iGEM Bulgaria, and iGEM Groningen.
We thank all the teams that made this collaboration possible.

Neural Networks – From brains to machines and vice versa
The use of neural networks is not confining inside new types of prosthesis. Indeed, continuous advances in machine learning have enabled groundbreaking progress in diverse fields such as computer vision or strategy games by making use of artificial neural networks. In parallel, new technologies for recording and manipulating biological neural networks allow us to probe the behavioral function of neuronal activity in unprecedented detail.
This event organized by the Institut Pasteur, brought together leading experts in the fields of biology, applied mathematics and physics, aiming to bridge our current understanding of how biological and artificial neural networks operate. Naturally, participating to this event was a major boost for our project NeuronArch. We presented a scientific poster with our results and got really good feedbacks from professionals on how to push it further.

Educating and Engaging the General Public
National Science Fair - Fête de la Science 2018
The National Science Fair is held every year all over France to vulgarize science to children, teenagers, and families. This year the Pasteur Team decided to take part of this event inside the ESPCI engineering school (École Supérieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris), hosting multiple stands around what is DNA and how you can modify organisms with synthetic biology. To illustrate this, we used candies, origami DNA to allow children and the general public to understand the potential of synthetic biology.
We organized stands, open for children and adults on different themes: “What is DNA?”, “Creation of Synthetic Biology and GMOs”, “Application of Synthetic Biology”, “iGEM and NeuronArch”. We also developed a game, an interactive comic, to help embody synthetic biology for the youngest attendants, showed them what a bacterial culture looked like and also raised awareness on disabilities on our stand ""NeuronArch"" by challenging children to grab multiple objects without their thumbs.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Most views are not based on knowledge, but on opinions. Communication must be based on this fact, but we also need to define society. She got us to understand the importance of understanding that society is heterogenous. We, as individuals, are far from the same, and in order to address society we need to start from there. That was the spark to questions of the kind “Do people in different groups want different things? Are people more affected by where they were born, or what decade they were born in?” rather than “What does society know about these matters, how do we make them understand?”. It also made us understand that we need to approach different groups in society to learn more.
Misse also talked with us about the importance to understand that we are not here to change people’s beliefs or to teach them about synthetic biology in that sense. We are here to find people who are willing to listen to us and help us make our project valuable for society as a whole, by integrating thoughts from different societal groups.
Thus, the question that we were left with in the end was “What do we do for those who want to make a change and can make a change?”. How do we make them join us in the open discussion about synthetic research? We thought about this for a long time, and it resulted in fruitful discussions with many people from different stages in their lives, and people with different experiences. These questions were of vital importance for our product design and implementation. Misse influenced us to focus on risk assessment and ways to make sure that our product would not be unethical or directly harmful to the environment, by consulting with Per Sandin.
Misse specifically inspired us to do these events and products, amongst many others that we did, have a look!

One way to invite the younger part of the society into the world of biology is by illustrating and telling them a story about how our microorganisms inside the body work, even though we cannot see them! That’s exactly what we did, writing the children’s book “Charlie and the magic microscope”. The book was translated into Swedish and English and books were distributed around libraries and hospitals in Stockholm as well as different events in the UK with the help of iGEM Warwick.

On the slide we prepared, the negative control was wild type yeast cells transformed with empty pSB416 GPD plasmid, while the test was yeast cells transformed with pSB416 GPD containing mls-yeGFP gene in it. With the help of Purdue University, a Nikon microscope was used to observe fluorescence in yeast mitochondria with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.  After localized florescence was observed we then used MIto ID Red florescent stain to verify that the florescence of mls-yeGFP is targeted to mitochondria.
RFC 10 Yeast Expression Vectors
BBa_K2077000: pSB416-GPD: RFC 10 Compatibile URA3-selectable S. cerevisiae Expression Vector Overview
This is a RFC10 standard yeast expression vector adapted from the widely used plasmid p416-GPD. The MCS of p416-GPD was replaced with the standard BioBrick prefix and suffix and an illegal PstI restriction site near the URA3 promoter of p416-GPD was removed. In the resultant plasmid, pSB416-GPD (5743 bp), the BioBrick prefix and suffix is situated between the yeast GPD promoter and CYC1 terminator allowing for facile cloning and expression of translational units in yeast. M13 primers flank the transcriptional unit.  The plasmid has a ColE1 origin and ampicillin resistance for replication in E.coli. It also contains a yeast CEN/ARS providing high fidelity maintenance and low copy number in yeast.  We used this vector to express mRPS12 TU and mls-yeGFP in BY4741 S. cerevisiae.
Design
Originally p416-GPD had an illegal PstI site in the URA3 promoter region.
Removing the PstI site from p416 GPD required simply cutting with SbfI, blunting the sticky ends of the DNA removing the PstI site, and then ligating the plasmid back together.  Giving us the resulting region with the PstI site removed.
We also needed to replace the MCS in pSB416-GPD with the RFC 10 standard prefix and suffix.  We removed the MCS in p416-GPD by cutting the XbaI and XhoI and running a NEBuilder assembly with a fragment containing the BB prefix and suffix flanked with 40 base pairs of homology to the vector on both sides.

The conversion from fluorescence units to concentration in mol/L was calculated as k = 2.5 * 10-6 mol*L-1 (Furtado and Henry, 2002) and the volume of the used capillaries was V = 3.14 * 10-9 L The rate of protein expression with 1.0 % arabinose is:
$$\frac{3.14 * 10^{-9} L * 2.5 * 10^{-6} mol L^{-1} * 87,500}{36,000 s} = 7.85 * 10^{-14} mol*s^{-1} (1)$$
According to (1) the increase of OprC with t0 = 0
can be described with (2) and (3):
$$\frac{dOprC}{dt} = 7.85 * 10-14  mol*s^{-1} (2)$$     $$OprC_t = OprC_0 + t * 7.85 * 10^{-14}   mol*s^{-1} (3)$$
The next step is to determine the increase of the copper concentration inside the cell. OprC transports copper ions with a rate of vmax = 0.144 mol/s into the cell and has a substrate affinity of KM­ = 1.66 mM (Parmar et al., 2018). The volume per cell in this model contains VC = 1*10-15 L-1. The starting concentration was taken from the first accumulation test with [Cu2+0] = 0.003 M. Due to the missing catalytic interchange number kcat the other definition of the Michaelis-Menten equation had to be used:
$$\frac{d(Cu^{2+}_{inside})}{dt} = \frac{-d(Cu^{2+}_{outside})}{dt} =  v_{max} * \frac{Cu^{2+}_{outside}}{Cu^{2+}_{outside} + K_M} (4)$$
After solving the differential equation (4) with the conditions t0 = 0:
$$[C_t]- K_M * ln{[C_t]} = v_{max} * t + [C_0] - K_M * ln {[C_0]}   (5)$$
Due to the fact that this only describes the kinetic of a single molecule of OprC the (3) and the Avogadro number NA = 6.022 * 1023"

ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI), a special social activity for every iGEMers at ShanghaiTech. For this year’s iDPI, a Lab Open House Day was held where delegating high school students from Shanghai Coordinate International School paid a visit, aiming at arousing their interests in science, especially in synthetic biology. Moreover, we introduced the iGEM to them during the day, and are now helping them to build up their first-ever high school team for the future iGEM. Besides, this year our team closely collaborated with two iGEM teams in China, JSNU-China at Jiangsu Normal University and Tsinghua-A at Tsinghua University.

Social Research on the Energy Issue
Background & Introduction
As previously addressed, the importance and urgency to seek a feasible solution to the energy issue is undebatable. The energy issue is neither just a regional nor national problem, but instead a global one. In response to the urgent need, vast efforts and time have already been devoted to those relevant studies, however, only few of which is really able to be put into real applications. Actually, the biggest obscure restraining the feasible solution to alleviate the energy stress is mainly due to the huge gap between the research results and the massive industrialization. In another word, not only should we emphasize the technological advancements, but also we ought to raise a strong awareness to integrate the scientific results into real industrial application to yield concrete social values.
To understand the energy issue from a border aspect, our team carried out a social research discovering the gap between the academic research and the industrial application, especially in the context of the energy issue. The main objectives of this social research aim at socially figuring out the relevant background as well as getting the project prepared for the further industrialization. We hope to hear various opinions from different aspects, or to be concrete not only the public and the academic, but also the industrial and the authority. Only when we understand comprehensively, could we figure out a series of feasible solutions in the social context, to profoundly contribute to the world.
Our social research started as early as we just decided to work on the energy issue. We built up a long-term real-time interaction with the society, instead of just a simple glimpse, for the comprehensive understanding on the issue required continuous communications and thoughts exchanging. Generally speaking, this social research consisted of two main parts, the public questionnaire and interviews. The public questionnaire was implemented to be familiar with the general public attitudes. We carefully analyzed the data collected, and according to the main concerns and opinions we"

Fluid Functionality
Summary
During the process of developing the MARS repository there were many questions that we found ourselves asking consistently:
Why is this chip not working?
Is this what this chip should be doing right now?
What part of this chip is failing?
The common theme underlying these questions was our inability to explain why our microfluidics chips were not functioning correctly. When we had performed a literature review there were no papers published regarding a standardized method of evaluating microfluidic chips. With that problem in mind the team went on to create an evaluation system known as Fluid Functionality.
Fluid Functionality is based around analyzing the functionality of each primitive in a microfluidic chip (refer to Microfluidics 101 on our Wiki for more information regarding primitives.)  These primitives can be thought of as the individual electrical components that are a part of a larger circuit. If one and/or more primitive malfunctions the entire system will not work. However, how do we go about analyzing each primitive? Primitive analysis can be broken up into two parts:
Qualitative: Observations that provide any indication of failure.
Quantitative: Calculations that show whether your primitive failed or not.
By inter-relating the qualitative failures we have observed with a corresponding quantitative analysis method we can explain why a microfluidic chip is not working. If, for example, a primitive has a qualitative failure and fails its quantitative test, then there is something wrong with the primitive's dimensions. But if a primitive has a qualitative failure and passes its quantitative test, then there is some other source of error such as poor assembly.      At this time these relationships are not fully defined. More work in the future can yield a better relationship between which qualitative failure pairs with quantitative test. Fluid Functionality can primarily be utilized as a modeling framework.
iGEM has done an excellent job of defining modeling projects related to wet lab experiments, however since MARS is a hardware project this was our team’s approach of modeling our work. The sections below describe the qualitative and quantitative analyses we have developed.
Qualitative Failure Modes
Leak (Initial)
This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid leaking out of a channel and/or primitive into the space between the PDMS and flow layer. An initial leak"

However, our model still needs optimization. We plan to enhance the docking model and the more professional direct would be supplied by it.

I'm really excited about having these new members on the team. There were many awesome interviews, but now we have to sit down and make hard decisions on who to take, as most of last year's members are graduating, so there's a limit to how many new members we can train. This is going to be a tough weekend.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," to train the new team members in the early stages of team formation. First of all, we will introduce our team and International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition through presentations, posters, WeChat pushes, etc., and also convey our requests for new recruits. We will then train the interviewees in groups and we will select them during the training process. Our training is mainly to share the learning materials for students and let them learn by themselves.
Our two teams made recommendations on each other for training new members. They suggested us add a literature reading part to the training to teach students how to read literatures and how to extract important information from the literature. Then they shared with us some materials for teaching students to read the literature. Their advice has helped us a lot, and we plan to adopt their suggestions to improve this year's training. At the same time, we also suggest that they increase the opportunities for students to practice, let the students design their own topics, increase their free space, make them more creative and have more new ideas. In addition, we exchanged our training materials on modeling, hardware, software, art and web design with each other.
Finally, we communicated with the daily management of the team. At the beginning of each team, all the students will participate in the design of the project and conduct laboratory training. After the preliminary determination of the subject, the students were divided into different groups, responsible for different labors like experiments, modeling, human practice and so on. We hold group meetings every week, each group reports the progress of the project, and different groups communicate with each other. In addition, we will also hold regular entertainment activities such as picnics, parties, etc. to relax and enhance team friendship. Both of our teams have one thing in common. Most members are in multiple roles, which better strengthens the communication between groups. It shows that iGEM competition is a common combination. There are different groups in this team. Everyone is not working separately, but is always intimately connected.
Through the exchanges with the NAU-iGEM team, Our team has a better construction model, and we have more experience in the follow-up training this year. Thanks to the NAU team for their help.

THERMOGENIC RESPONSE NUTRIENT BIOSENSOR (THE RENBO)
File:Image-Size.gif
INTRODUCTION
In the engineering field, robust sensors are needed, and they must be able to work under different conditions and ranges.
In past iGEM editions, there were attempts to get more and more organisms, such as machines & sensors, to be functional and resistant into multiple stress conditions.
The UTP-Panama team in its vision to develop engineering tools from biotechnology, seeks to create and improve more robust sensors to environmental and climatic conditions.
In this sense, one of the biggest challenges is to give microorganisms the ability to continue working under temperature changes, since they loose capacity at low temperatures (D'amico, et al. 2006). This problem has been attacked by different teams, like the UNAM-Cinvestav 2010, using the CspA promoter as a better promoter for low temperatures in combination with an antifreeze protein (AFP) [1]. Our Team, the UTP-Panama seeks to extend the range of sensors from the use of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase), which primarily has been designed to be expressed in response to a Cold-shock, raising the temperature as we explain next.
The biosensor chosen for the improvements is the Nitrate Biosensor (PyeaR - composite GFP) developed by BCCS-Bristol Team 2010, which is a sensor that measures levels of nitrogen (nutrients) on the ground, (important parameter for agriculture)
Project Description
The original BioBrick that senses the levels of nitrates in soil developed by Bristol iGEM Team 2010 [2], was designed to operate at room temperatures, especially for 37 ° C using the PyeaR BioBricks promoter [3].

Several attempts with numerous process optimisations were performed, but unfortunately without success. To circumvent this, another attachment site was chosen. The assembly of the complete fragment by PCR was achieved and chromosomal insertion by electroporation was attempted several times, but in vain. In consideration of the fact that RelE is a bacterial toxin, the cloning of this gene was inconvenient. The model indicated, that overexpression of the antitoxin RelB would bypass this difficulty. As the homologous recombination of this fragment emerged such a challenging task, it was decided to focus on the conduct of the OmpR-regulated promoter on different plasmids, as this was evidently the more convenient approach of the general implementation of the OmpR-regulated promoter.
An Inducible Promoter was Chosen to Regulate the Gene Expression of the Antitoxin RelB
Originally, it was thought to place the antitoxin RelB under a constitutive promoter of appropriate strength. However, as the modelling revealed, strict regulation of RelB is essential to counteract the toxic effect of RelE and enable a functional dormancy system. Thus, it was deduced that it would be more suitable to utilise an inducible promoter for this purpose and it was decided to put RelB under control of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 . The William and Mary team found that the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter had a low level of noise,  a measure of the variability in gene expression between cells in the population, when cloned into a low copy vector. Therefore, this regulated promoter was chosen.
To mimic the expression of  RelB, a reporter system composed of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and GFP was assembled. Hereby, the appropriate concentration of IPTG required to induce the promoter on a low copy vector, was identified. During the cloning, it was discovered that the site between the LacI-regulated, lambda hybrid promoter and this particular construct under the tested conditions had formed a hotspot for transposons. In the light of this finding, another inducible promoter was chosen. The HKUST-Rice iGEM 2015 team demonstrated that induction of the AraC-regulated promoter, pBAD, caused a gradual increase in gene expression when cloned into the low to medium copy plasmid, pSB3K3, in contrast to an all-or-none behavior when cloned into the high copy vector,"

To give this law some context, in the late 1400’s Venice was in the middle of the Renaissance: glassworking, art, and new methods of manufacturing were blossoming in the city. The Provveditori di Comun concluded that 1) A novel creation by an inventor is intellectual property, and, 2) protecting an inventor’s intellectual property stimulates the economy and encourages new ideas to grow. These conclusions are reflected in most modern IP systems today, and the Venetian Act of 1474 went on to directly influence IP statutes that would be established in England, the United States, and much of the rest of the world centuries later.
Significant inspiration was drawn from the Venetian Act when England first implemented its own major patent and copyright laws. The Statute of Monopolies (1624) and the Statute of Anne (1710) [United Kingdom], a patent law and copyright law respectively, were implemented as a response to the tendency of the English crown to grant monopolies to ‘favored individuals’. A great example of this abuse of power was Queen Elizabeth I, who would grant monopolies to  ‘favored individuals’ in return for a cash payout [3]. In effect, the Queen sold trade monopolies to individuals in an effort to raise money (who knew – monarchs can run into financially tough times as well!) These two statutes acted to rebuke the power of the monarchy to grant trade monopolies; instead, individuals with original intellectual property could now apply for patents and copyrights to protect their ideas [4]. The United States IP system was directly influenced by these English statutes. One thing to note from these two statutes is that IP laws have a place in preventing market dominance, protecting individuals unique ideas, and stimulating competition.
The origin of IP protections in the United States came from the Patent Act of 1790 and the Copyright Act of 1790. Since we are interested in looking at the evolution of these IP protections over time, the first detail to note is the scope of these protections. In this original copyright act, applicants’ work was guaranteed protection for 14 years. Fast forward to today:"

Seminar and Meetup of Indonesia iGEM Teams
The ITB_Indonesia is proud to be able to host the first meetup of all of iGEM Teams of Indonesia this year at June, 27th 2015. By this great opportunity, we also collaborated with UB_Indonesia and UI_Indonesia to held a seminar. During this seminar, we also had the chance to share each of team’s project this year. In addition, we also asked the participants to flll the Oxford Team’s questionnaires as the form of our human practice collaboration. Not only that, we were also very happy to welcome the iGEM HQ representative, Ana Sifuentes, through the live chat via skype video call. At the end of the seminar, while having the dinner, we had a discussion regarding the opportunity for collaboration in the next future.Through this seminar, the audiences learnt the sciences behind synthetic biology shared by our first speaker. There were also a lot of questions from the audiences. We believe that through this activity, one of our goals for education and public engagement, which is to spark curiosity was achieved.
Shanghai Meetup
On June, 8th, the public relation of ITB_Indonesia had an opportunity to meet with three teams of China iGEM teams: NYU, STJU, and Tongji in Shanghai, China. A discussion was held to share our project and to learn from each other. On this short visit, our PR learnt and gained insights about the great idea of those three teams ideas and shared them to us in Indonesia.

We learned about the more technical side of synthetic biology - how researchers find the section of the gene they want, how the cell duplicates genes, etc. Professor Kuldell then discussed ""Eau d'coli,"" an iGEM submission from MIT in 2006. It was very interesting to learn about their project, as it is a real application of synthetic biology that our software project aims to improve. MIT's goal was to genetically engineer E.coli cells to smell like banana and wintergreen. We covered their entire process, as well as that of the cells and cell parts. In addition, we watched a video of MIT's presentation at iGEM to fully understand the challenges they came across. As I learned, I connected their process with our semantic search project, and wondered a couple things - how did they search the smells and narrow them down to only banana and wintergreen? How did they know what promoter to use? Was it written somewhere that indole was what produced the natural smell of E.coli? After Professor Kuldell's lectures, we went through a lab safety lecture and then headed to the lab to conduct some experiments of our own. The first lab, titled ""What a Color World,"" was related to the MIT iGEM's ""Eau d'coli"" project. We prepared 2 different E.coli strains for transformation and then transformed them with purple-color generator and green-color generator. In the second lab, titled ""iTunes device,"" we examined promoter and RBS (ribosome-binding site) combinations to optimize beta-galactosidase output. We used test tubes, pipets, petri dishes, and a spectrophotometer to determine which combination was the best. I was shocked by how precise the measurements had to be, the length of time it took to see any results in experiments, and how much work had to be done to prove one small thing. Our day ended with an overview of the day and our impressions of synthetic biology.
Jun 6: Continuing research
We spent the day conducting more research and preparing for our presentations. My team discussed the possibilities of using semantic search in a synthetic biology environment. We examined several semantic search engines with APIs we could potentially implement. In addition, we brainstormed advantages of using semantic search and semantic zoom.

Even though they disapprove genetic engineering, they have no problem with the usage of microorganism like bacteria or yeast. In fact, if the product would be more environmentally friendly produced, healthier, and has better socioeconomic production conditions people would be more likely to accept and buy products with biosynthetic produced palm(kernel)oil. Some of our survey findings are attached below. To avoid going beyond the scope the demographic data had been excluded.
As comparison, we took out a similar survey among passers-by on one of our University’s action days. The random sample was ways smaller than the CodeCheck sample (51 to 1139) and additionally only 33 sheets could be used for analysis (completion rate was 64,71%) and therefore might be not representative, but there is a similar trend discernible. The rejection of palm oil usage in food, cosmetics and biofuels is very strong in both groups, but the mistrust of genetic engineering is lower among the passers-by.
The majorities of both reference groups are willing to spend more for biosynthetic palm (kernel) oil.
As conclusion, we learned, that the target group of conscious consumers might be a good way starting to reeducate people about genetic engineering and raise awareness, as they are hungry for information and more willing to set environmental benefits above their prejudices about genetic engineering. Further, we once again found out, that the public has a lack of information about genetic engineering, but maybe also about certification processes. For the Codecheck users’ certificates, like bio or RSPO, are very important. It would be important to find out the reasons for this in the future."

Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20-30 μl water (heated up to 55°C) added to the center of the column. After 1 minute the tube containing the column was centrifuged for 1 minute to collect eluted DNA.
Midiprep
For larger amounts of bacterial cultures the QIAGEN® Plasmid Plus Midi Kit was used to isolate plasmids. According to the instructions included, all necessary solutions were prepared and 25 ml bacterial culture harvested after 12-16 hours incubation. The sample was centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pelleted cells were completely resuspended in 2 ml Buffer P1. Then, 2 ml buffer P2 were added and mixed thoroughly by inverting until the lysate appeared viscous. The solution was incubated at room temperature (15–25°C) for 3 min. The QIAfilter Cartridge was placed into a new tube. Afterwards, 2 ml buffer S3 were added to the lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. The lysate was transfered to the cartridge and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. During incubation the QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column was put into the vacuum manifold and tube extenders inserted into each column. The plunger was inserted gently into the QIAfilter Cartridge and the lysate filtered into the tube. Thereafter, 2 ml buffer BB were added to the cleared lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. Lysate was then transfered to a QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column on the vacuum manifold. Vacuum was applied until all liquid remains were drawn through the column. To wash the DNA 700 μl buffer ETR was added and vacuum applied. Residual wash buffer was removed by centrifugation of the column at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The column was put into a clean 1.5 ml tube. Finally, 200 μl water (55°C) was added to the center of the spin column. The column was let stand for 1 minute and centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the eluted DNA.

UNITN-Trento,2015,Team:UNITN-Trento#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," domestic energy. In an ideal world we should reach a situation where the heating and cooling energy gets close to zero, and the only energy needs of a house will become the one for lighting, computers and small appliances.
We can all make a difference by adopting responsible habits to reduce the waste of energy in our house. Every action can have an impact:
Substitute old household appliances with high efficiency ones
Decrease the dispersion of heat/cool, by substituting old windows, isolating roofs, and not leaving windows open excessively when operating these systems.
Replace old heating systems with low consume ones
Installing roof photovoltaic panels
Different approaches , different country needs
Different countries have different sensibilities to this problem and had adopted different strategies to reduce domestic energy waste. We tried to take a look at the different laws in Asia, Europe and the US. The information were not always easy accessible. Also, it was not easy to compare the data that we found. However we discovered that in different ways every country is trying to make a difference. The major difference that we observed is the mandatory or voluntary nature of the program/strategy being applied in different countries.
The European Community has developed energy standards for both new and old house appliances. It has been estimated that new buildings consume 3 to 5 liters of heating oil per square meter per year, while older buildings consume about 25 liters and sometime reach up to 60 liters. Currently, about 35% of the EU's buildings are over 50 years old [6] .
The 2010 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive are the EU's main legislation on this topic [6] . Under this directive:
Each house must have an energy performance certificate based on the energy consumption. This is a one-letter label assigned to the house by a professional (i.e. energetic engineer, or architect) on the basis of the consumption of energy and waste of heating and cooling. Therefore, the type of heating systems, the windows, the isolation of the roof, as well as the territory where the house is located, they all play a role.
Performance Energy labels must be included in each rental or sale transaction.
All new buildings must be nearly zero-energy buildings by the end of 2020 (public buildings by the end of 2018).
Each country must set minimum energy requirements for new and remodeled buildings.
House energetic class standards in Trentino Alto AdigeDifferent parameters are needed to reach a specific class in different countries and regions according to the climate conditions.
To achieve this goal many European countries are financing renovations to help people meeting these goals. For"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to localize the source of a volatile molecule. Depending on the mechanical specifications and legal framework for our robot,  GMOs would be considered to be brought outside the laboratory.             be brought outside the laboratory.
In the interview with Philippe Schenkel from Greenpeace, we discussed possibilities for biological mechanisms ensuring biocontainment. Instead of MG1655, the strain we used in our experiments, we propose to use the GRO (Genetically Recoded Organism) generated in the study from DJ Mandell et al. 2015, which uses the re-assigned codon UAG to code for L-4,49-biphenylalanine (bipA). The latter is a non-standard amino acid (NSAA), which cannot be found in nature. However, its is compatible with protein cores and is integrated into essential enzymes, causing NSAA auxotrophy. In this way, even if the bacteria were to escape the mechanical barriers on our robot, they would not survive due to the artificially induced auxotrophy. Moreover, their genetic material could not be transmitted to other strains, since the information would be that of a truncated and therefore non-functional protein due to the recoding of the stop codon.
We decided to choose this novel approach as a biological containment strategy, since it shows unparalleled robustness to genetic drift. In the future, the realization of devices like AROMA will depend on legal frameworks defining what can be considered as an “extension of the laboratory”. For this, synthetic auxotrophies alongside mechanical barriers represent a useful tool to ensure biocontainment of GMOs.

CCU_Taiwan,2017,Team:CCU Taiwan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," of bacteria which affect our oral condition.
After we finish improving about our product, we will try to expand the market.
Our future plan is divided into two parts, one applying for the patents, the other expanding our home-based market.
(The following web address is the whole Website which we build for our customers contacting with us in the future.)
Carindex website
Apply for patents
First of all, we will modify the consumptive materials so a large amount can be mounted at once, so that we can satisfy the primary school demands to reduce the effort preparing the units. We will try to apply for a provisional application from United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Expand consumption market
To expand our consumption market we will make our product suitable for home use. We focused both on markets in Taiwan and other countries including Macao, Hong Kong, China, and United States. There is a comprehensive health insurance system in Taiwan, so if we want to make our product for home use we have to cooperate with dentists who are professionals in this field. Dentists can help us to promote the product to their patients.In addition, we will in the next two years cooperate with dentists to obtain marketing endorsements to help us to promote the product, while dentists can also use our products for their customers to establish a dedicated database, to assist the dentist in tracking the oral condition of the client, and to increase the loyalty of the customer to the dentist's clinic and to increase the customer's satisfaction. We have visited some dentists, who said if our product is more developed (more personalization and customization), they will be very willing to cooperate with us to create a win-win situation.
Furthermore, to get into the foreign market, the cost of foreign clinics compared to Taiwan is much higher, so we hope that by using our products to understand their own oral condition it could reduce the cost of regular evaluation and treatment. By doing so, it would not only help people avoid more serious future oral conditions with higher costs but also save time for follow-up treatment. To meet different countries’ policies and consumer behavior, we not only designed a questionnaire but also figured out how to get into those market we plan to target. We sent this form to countries where the medical environment is better, but the cost is also relatively high, such as: Macao, Hong Kong, China and the United States (Total 80 samples).
The results showed that:
