Current operation
Jeans are complex products that are produced in several stages: cotton harvesting,                                 spinning, dyeing, weaving, design and finishing. Once manufactured, the jeans are sold and used, then discarded or recycled. Cotton growing is one of the few stages in the                                 production of the product that 1083 is forced to do abroad. In fact, the French climate is not                                 compatible with this type of culture.
Cotton spinning makes it possible to obtain a ribbon which will be transformed into thread.                                 The longer the fibers, the more resistant the wire will be. Traditionally, jeans are made using                                 blue yarn, dyed with indigo (the natural color of cotton being white). The next stage, weaving, makes it possible to produce fabric from yarn. When weaving, the thread has to be taut.                                 Engraving allows the raw canvas to stabilize. The fabric is wetted and then heated                                 between two rolls. When wet, the plant fibers are compressed which makes the fabric shrink.                                 Once dry and leaving the rollers, the fabric is then stretched to make it regain its initial                                 size. Then comes the cutting of the fabric, the assembly of the different parts and                                  mounting of the accessories. Value can be added back to the raw material itself by recycling. Jeans can                                 be converted into Bermuda shorts or shorts for example. The fabric can also be used as                                 insulation or as fuel.
Our innovation
Although organic cotton reduces the environmental impact due to the absence of pesticides,                                 it is very water-hungry, as is the fixing of indigo. Using bacterial cellulose could reduce this                                 ecological impact. When spinning, uniform yarn quality has to be maintained, thus different arrivals of cottons are mixed and spun together. Bacterial cellulose has the advantage                                 of being of constant quality because the entire production environment is perfectly                                 controlled.
The dyes used by 1083 create problems because the color of the jeans does not fade.                                 However, this is a characteristic of jeans that is sought by consumers. The molecules used for                                 our project risk, on the contrary, being fixed only to the superficial part of the thread and be very                                 quickly unhooked during jeans use which would cause the desired colour loss.                                 Textile produced by bacteria without cotton could be interesting as it remains clean                                 and ecological. On the other hand, we must try to think about the recycling of the material.

     Our team have been to summer                                     trusteeship school in local area to organize a                                     community class for children to introduce our iGEM team and knowledge about sleep.                                     As the project of our                                     team this year is to regularly express the melatonin in the intestine environment,                                     our project is closely                                     related to sleep. According to the results of our survey, most people don't pay much                                     attention to their sleeping                                     quality, or their ways of sleep regulating is not scientific. Their knowledge about                                     sleep needs to be strengthened,                                     and we believe that teaching children sleep is an important way to solve this social                                     problem. Thus, we stressed the                                     importance of sleep, and informed them when is the best time to sleep as well as how                                     long they need to sleep per day.
     The children in trusteeship school are all devoted                                         into our class. Actually, some of them has considerate confusion about sleep,                                         but they did not have much chance to access the knowledge about this area. They                                         asked why we will dream and why our eyes will                                         move when we sleep. In order to let student fully understand what we taught to                                         them, we have arranged a schedule of our activities.
     At the beginning, we separated all the students in                                         two groups. During our activities, we had lots of questions for the students,                                         which group’s answer was right, we gave them one point. At the end of all of our                                         activities, we awarded the higher group’s students                                         a peppermint.
     And then came to the first activity. The name of                                         the activity was “how long will you sleep”. The aim of the activity was to                                         know most student how long would they sleep and then gave them some advice. We                                         offered the students the opportunity to discuss                                         how long will they sleep at their age is most reasonable. Then two groups of students told us how long and why. Their answers were                                         literally convincing. At last we drew the conclusion that how long should a                                         person sleep varies from different ages.
     The second activity was that our"

PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Autoclave: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. Note that any autoclaved materials may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.
SOC Materials and Equipment
Note: this recipe is for 500mL of SOC.
Reagents
1.802g glucose
10g tryptone
2.5g Yeast extract
0.584 g NaCl
0.093g KCl
1.016g MgCl2 (anhydrous)
1.234g MgSO4 .7H20
500ml of dH20 (distilled water)
Materials
2 x 1L pyrex bottle (must have cap)
Note: A smaller pyrex bottle may be used to accommodate the glucose solution.
1L graduated cylinder
weighing boats and scupula
70% EtOH wash bottle
paper towels/wipes
SOC Lab Protocol
Part 1. Making the SOC broth
This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.
Obtain two 1L mL pyrex bottles. Ensure that the bottles can be sealed with a cap - this will help prevent contamination and enable long term storage.
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500ml of dH20 (distilled water).
Using filter paper, separately measure out 10g tryptone, 2.5g yeast extract, 0.292g NaCl, 0.093g KCl, 1.016g MgCl2 anhydrate, 1.234g MgSO4, heptahydrate. on a scale and add them to the 1L bottle. Add 400mL dH20. Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
In the separate bottle, and measure out 1.802g glucose on a scale and add the rest of the 100mL dH20. Recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
* The 1L autoclaved separately, as the contents will react if autoclaved together.

A DNA Ligase seals the nicks while the gaps are refilled by a DNA Polymerase. During the 50 °C Incubation the T5 exonuclease is heat inactivated. Since there is no competition between the T5 exonuclease and DNA polymerase reaction, both enzymes can be simultaneously active [1].
2. 3 A Assembly
Meanwhile 3A Assembly is utilized to enhance the number of target sites on a high copy plasmid. The term 3A Assembly is an abbreviation for 3 antibiotic assembly. It uses three different inputs for the assembly and the antibiotic resistances for the selection of correct assembly products. The needed inputs are the up- and downstream part which should be combined and the vector, in which the combined parts should be inserted. The antibiotic resistances of the three inputs need to be different. Each part/ input consists of a BioBrick pre-and suffix. The BioBrick prefix shows an EcoRI and a XbaI site, whereas the the BioBrick suffix is composed of a SpeI and PstI site.  The three different inputs are in the first step digested by different restriction enzymes. The upstream part is digested using EcoRI and SpeI, the downstream part using XbaI and PstI and the vector using EcoRI and PstI. Because the digestion with XbaI and SpeI causes identical overhangs, the upstream and the downstream parts are ligated and form a XbaI-SpeI gap. By ligation into the opened vector backbone a plasmid is formed [2]. This Plasmid contains the two parts in a defined order and can be selected by its antibiotic resistance. In a next assembly cycle the product can be used as one of the inputs and another DNA fragment as second input. By conducting several 3A assembly cycles more DNA fragments can be added stepwise to the construct. DNA fragments showing the BioBrick prefix and suffix and no further EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI or PstI site in their sequence are belonging to the BioBrick Standard and can always be used for 3A Assembly [2].
3. TAR
The needed constructs of the second approach are created using TAR . The term TAR is an abbreviation for transformation associated recombination occurring in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The process is similar to the gap repair during homologous recombination. This technique can be used for the selectively recovery of chromosome segments up to a size of"

Plasmid construction
To purify the components of BAM complex we have constructed 6 plasmids:
pET28b-BamA
pET22b-BamA
pET22b-BamB
pCDFDuet-BamC-BamD
pET22b-BamE
pET28b-SurA(more details in protocols)
which encode products of BamA-HisN6, BamA, BamB-HisC6, BamC, BamD, BamE-HisC8, SurA-HisN6. (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5)

Protein purification
We relied on three different strategies to purify the separate BAM complex components:
For our experiments we needed an unfolded BamA. Therefore, we overexpressed BamA , which we isolated in the form of inclusion bodies and then dissolved in 8M urea without any further purification steps.

Bam B-D lipoproteins were expressed with the pelB signal sequence, leading them to be exported to the periplasm where lipidation takes place. We then isolated the proteins from the membrane fraction, which we solubilised with specific detergents before purification using Ni-NTA (Fig.7 and Fig.9) and gelfiltration (size-exclusion) (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) columns. BamCDE were purified as a single subcomplex via one octahistidine tag on BamE.

Uppsala,2013,Team:Uppsala#zeaxantin_-_-_TEXT.html,"i DH5alpha we put together a standardized method for zeaxanthin extraction and measuring. Since zeaxanthin in its pure form is extremely expensive (~ 480 €/mg) we bought maize at our local supermarket and carried out liquid-liquid extractions using methanol and performed spectrophotometry measurements. We compared literature absorbance values of zeaxanthin to the peaks we obtained from our own measurements and continued our experiments until we believed to have an optimized extraction method.
Figure 1. Maize bought at our local supermarket that was grinded and later used to make a standardized zeaxanthin extraction method
Figure 2. Extraction experiments carried out on grinded maize using methanol.
The operon acquired from Slovenia iGEM 2010 consists of the genes CrtE, CrtB, CrtI, CrtY and CrtZ connected through zinc fingers and linkers and assembled with the inducible promoter pBAD/AraC. In our project the zinc fingers were not put into a lot of consideration.
Since we would eventually like to produce zeaxanthin in Lactobacillus in yoghurt it would be preferable to have a constitutive promoter, such as the CP-promoters. Parallel to the characterization of zeaxanthin in E.coli we therefore attempted to remove the pBAD/AraC promoter from the zeaxanthin operon.
Results:
Spectrophotometry
Production of zeaxanthin in e-coli DH5alpha was detected trough spectrophotometry measurements performed after liquid-liquid extractions using methanol. The resulting absorbance curve was compared to the standardized curve. In both graphs you can find the two peaks corresponding to zeaxanthin.
Figure 3. E.coli culture believed to have zeaxanthin production
Figure 4. A liquid-liquid extraction was carried out on the E.coli culture containing the plasmid above. Methanol was used as an organic solvent.
Figure 5. Spectrophotometry of zeaxanthin extraction from maize resulted in the graph above. The two peaks are characteristic for zeaxanthin.
Figure 6. Spectrophotometry of an E.coli culture containing the plasmid with the zeaxanthin operon. The characteristic peaks of zeaxanthin are present, indicating that zeaxanthin was present in the sample.
Spectrophotometry measurements were also done on unmodified E.coli, as a negative control. These measurements did not result in the peaks that are characteristic for zeaxanthin.

Therefore, we compared the fluorescence activity of the two constructs above against a GFP generator driven by phlFp (the construct that was used to characterize phlFp promoter strength).

Figure 3. Comparison between the fluorescence expression levels of phlFp with and without TetR transcription unit Negative control represents BBa_E0240. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bar present SD from 3 biological replicates.
Our results showed that there was no significant differences between the fluorescence activity of phlFp with and without the LacI transcription unit. Therefore, it is likely that the crosstalk between LacI and phlfp in our system is very low. As for crosstalk between TetR and phlfp, we were unable to draw any reliable inference from our results due to a great variation in measurement . Due to time constraint, we did not repeat the characterization.

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," \frac{d s}{dt} = \alpha \cdot \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{P_i} - \beta \cdot s,$$  with a steady state solution
$$ s_{ss} = R^{-1}(\frac{\log 2}{\tau \cdot r_i}),$$  $$ \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{P_{i,ss}} = (\frac{ \beta \cdot s_{ss}}{\alpha}).$$
In a simplified way, with two identical plasmids, we get: $$ P_{1,ss} + P_{2,ss} = K.$$   It is noticeable that plasmid levels are not independent. Small perturbations can increase the relative level of one plasmid, favoring its growth. As they are repressed as a function of the total number of plasmids but they grow depending on their number, the system is prone to introduce asymmetries  $$ \frac{d P_1}{d P_2} = \frac{r_1 \cdot P_1}{r_2 \cdot P_2} .$$   If growth rates are constant, the slope is determined by the initial conditions $$ m = \frac{P_{01}}{P_{02}} .$$
Quasi-steady state approach
To simplify our equations, we assume inhibitor dynamics are faster than plasmid growth, so RNA levels are a direct representation of plasmid levels  $$ \frac{d P_i}{dt} = r_i \cdot P_i \cdot R(P_i) - \frac{\log 2}{\tau} \cdot P_i .$$
Dependence on initial conditions:
To test our hypothesis, we integrate our differential equations using numerical methods with several initial conditions. As expected, small differences in initial proportions are amplified by the dynamics.
Figure 1. Dependence on initial conditions A) Steady state distribution of plasmids from different initial conditions. As seen, small differences in initial conditions are amplified. B) Phase space map of plasmid growth.
Stochastic model
The deterministic model assumes negligible noise. However, this might not be the case and small variations in plasmid levels could be highly amplified. Hence, we now discuss the importance of noise in plasmid growth. We used the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) developed by Gillespie (see [13]). In short, SSA simulates by iteration which processes occur at any time using a random number generator.

uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," of yeast and is not introduced to the wild strain.
Regardless, we follow the following stringent confinement strategies:
Molecular: The components of the system are not adjacent. dCas9 is in a plasmid, while the gRNAs will be integrated directly to the yeast genome. Study is performed on a mutant strain, not a wild strain. No genetic parts are produced commercially. We use homologous recombination to construct our entire network.
Ecological: Study is performed in a sterilized and confined laboratory environment, outside the habitable range of the host organism. The area contains no potential wild mates.
Barrier: Our transformations are performed in sterilized, low-temperature environment. Because our project does not consist of a gene drive, neither does our BioBrick.
Experience with dCas9
Our lab setting has previous experience working with synthetic gRNA networks. We have undergone necessary biosafety training from the Office of Risk Management - Environmental Health & Safety (ORM). We have thus fully assessed the project and have concluded that it is safe. Lois Sowden-Plunkett, Assistant Director, Biosafety, Radiation Safety and Laser Safety, whose contact information is given below has allowed us to proceed with the project. We are also in contact with Miles Gander, expert on dCas9-involving circuits and author of ""Digital logic circuits in yeast with CRISPR-dCas9 NOR gates"" (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms15459) from the University of Washington.
Conclusion
Despite using dCas9 to construct a NOR gate, no gene drive is created. By following the due process, we were able to design a project that is safe for the lab team and the greater community. Furthermore, by thoroughly understanding the established safety procedures we were able to gain insight into the policy surrounding research. uOttawa iGEM has an ongoing commitment to promoting safe research environments for the students and community.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"combination [5]. Homology-directed repair requires another, un-cleaved copy of the broken site, to act as a template for repair of the cleaved one. We thus model it as a second order process, dependent on both the number of cleaved and uncleaved sites. The rate of degradation is considerably less than the rate of recombination [6], and so here we neglect it, leading to the following expression for a given target site:
Eqn 6
Where:
Ntarget[i] is the number of un-cleaved copies of the Cas9 binding site
Ntotal[i] is the total number of both cleaved and un-cleaved copies of the binding site, such that Ntotal[i]-Ntarget[i] is the number of cleaved copies of the binding site
kh is the homologous recombination rate parameter
As we are neglecting the possibility of degradation of the cut site, Ntotal[i] will be equal to the chloroplast’s copy number, Ncopy, for all sites but the on-target site (i.e., the site which exactly matches the gRNA). However, for the on-target site, Ntotal[i] will steadily decrease, as these sites are converted to containing the gene of interest, and are no longer viable Cas9 binding sites. Here, we assume perfect selection pressure – i.e. that once the on-target site has been cut, there is 100% chance of it being repaired using the gene of interest, and once it is converted to containing the gene of interest (and the antibiotic resistance which is found on the same cassette), there is 0 probability of it being converted back. The first assumption was somewhat validated by our sensitivity analysis (see below), and the second seems reasonable considering that once the site is converted, it is no longer a target for Cas9 cleavage. This leads to the expression
Eqn 7
Here, NGOI is the number of copies of the gene of interest present in the chloroplast, with flanking homology regions. This will initially be the number of “gene of interest” cassettes inserted via the transformation method (e.g. biolistics), but will increase as more copies of the genome contain the gene of interest, following the expression
Eqn 8
PARAMETERISING THE MODEL

As with all chloroplasts, regulation of gene expression in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast is a complex process. The majority of gene regulation happens at the post-transcriptional level, with factors changing the shape of mRNA’s 3’ and 5"

Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Abstract
Human practice has been a focus of Neon Coli since the very start. While building our project, we were eager to explore whether and how our design is going to have an impact on different groups of people in our society. Our members helped to communicate the concept of synthetic biology, not only to students in cities, but through teaching assistance programs to those underdeveloped areas in China. As our system aims at expression optimization, we conducted surveys to investigate how it is going to help improve other iGEM teams’ projects. Through discussions and meet ups, we took advices on how to adapt the NEON system to other teams uses, and how our designs could be better integrated and simplified.
General Human Practice
Team Tsinghua has always been an active force in the public education of synthetic biology. This year we went to Changsha Yali High School, Hunan, where the 27th China High School Biology Olympiad was being held. Also we prepared synthetic biology lectures for students at the Tsinghua summer school. By introducing iGEM and our project, we hope to attract more young masterminds to the field of synthetic biology.
As we aim to expand our public education program, we held a conference with members in the conjoint Chinese-International teaching assistance programs, discussing how we were going to help communicate the idea of science and biology to those students in economically and educationally underdeveloped area in China.
As an active member of the community, Tsinghua is well engaged in meeting and sharing with other universities and iGEM teams. We attended the annual meetup held at Beijing Normal University at the beginning of this year, sharing our experiences. Our presentation was awarded with the First Prize. In summer, we shared the history of our iGEM projects with students from USTC.
At the end of August, Tsinghua attended the 5th CCiC hosted by Shanghai Tech. CCiC, the biggest iGEMer community in China, provided us with a great opportunity to establish new friendships and renew old ones. We received much help from other teams in many ways. Team Peking, in particular, generously shared a new transformation technique. Also in September, we attended a regional meet up held by UCAS"

Looking one step ahead it is conceivable to use a moss-filter in order to clean ponds or streams etc. Places that are not continuously supervised by humans. So our aim was to engineer a low cost and low energy solution, that maintain the filters autonomy.
Figure 22: Idea for a measuring device
This is where Arduino comes into play. Arduino is a platform that is based on one microcontroller which is attached to a circuit board. Its convenient handling and easy programming,  the lots of available hardware and the great community support make it one of the most popular prototyping platforms these days, especially for multidisciplinary applications. Among its many fans it already enjoys cult status. We first used the Arduino Uno. It is the most commonly used board. The first revision was released in September 2010.  Designed for beginners, it gave us an easy start into the handling, since none of us had any experience working with microcontrollers. Most libraries already worked out of the box and all shields and sensors we ordered came with an example code.  But the Arduino Uno came to it's limits, when we tried to get a display, WiFi and several sensors working.
Therefore we ordered the Arduino Due, which is the most powerful Arduino board at the moment. It has 16 times more flash memory (code storage) than the Arduino Uno and its clock runs 5 times faster. Instead of 2KB SRAM there are 96KB.  At least there are a lot more free pins that can be used for sensors etc, and still its costs don't exceed 50€ (~60$).
We installed a solar powered Arduino on one edge of our remediation raft in order to monitor the setting. A temperature and a light sensor collect weather data and a water sensor attached to the side of the raft registers, if the raft's tubes take on water and whether it lowers its height on the surface. For testing purposes we even attached a display to the microcontroller. All collected data are sent via WiFi and stored at a server's MySQL database in real time. Alternatively the data can also be sent via GSM if there is no WiFi hotspot close by. All data can then easily be displayed.

Figure 23: How it works
The controller can easily be extended by other sensors, such as a color sensor to monitor the moss's health or a potential die off, a pH-Sensor or even a webcam.
Concerning the low costs, the unlimited capabilities and the handiness we highly recommend the use of the Arduino as measuring device. We have"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," and emission maxima of CFP are ~ 45 nm apart and thereby very precisely differentiable. Nevertheless, we could detect that the emission signal of the CFP is approximately five times higher than that of RFP, if both of them are excited at their absorption maxima under comparable conditions. We could replicate these results in vitro and in vivo.
We demonstrated that our FRET system is functional. Excitation of the YFP-CFP fusion protein at wavelength specific for YFP excitation (475 nm) or CFP excitation (430 nm) both leads to strong YFP fluorescence signals. This means that the energy of the CFP emission is transferred to the YFP and thus the FRET system is working. Also there was still a clear CFP signal present at 475 nm which means that only the whole fusion protein of CFP and YFP forms the FRET system, and that solely CFP, where no ncAA was incorporated in the linker, still is present and detectable alongside with the FRET system.
By comparing the emission spectra of our improved test system when cotransformed with different aaRS, the efficiency of the aaRS was analyzed. Our results imply that a comparison of different aaRS is possible, just by comparison of the relative emission at 475 nm, representing the CFP amount, and at 525 nm, representing the fusion protein amount of the cotransformants when cultivated with and without the specific ncAA.
Therefore, we developed a ranking system for the evaluation of synthetases based on initial work by Texas 2014. This new scoring system is suitable for our improved FRET system due to the integration of a negative and a positive score.
RFP and CFP Activity of the Systems in vitro
First we characterized the first translated units of the aaRS-test systems by transforming them solely into E.coli BL21(DE3) without any aaRS. This way only the RFP of the Texas part and the CFP of our improved part were expressed.
We cultivated each transformant in 50 mL of LB-media in a 500 mL cultivation flask for 16 hours. Protein expression was induced with IPTG after 6 hours of cultivation at 37 °C and 150 rpm. We harvested the cells and lysated the cell pellet with the Ribolyzer and centrifuged the cell debris. Afterwards, we measured the fluorescence in 200 µL of the clear lysate.
Figure 1 shows the results of the absorption measurement of the RFP from wavelengths of 475 nm to 750 nm. We detected two absorption maxima at 505 nm and "

Growth Curves
Calibration
Mini
Before we could try running growth curves with GCODe, we needed to check that its readings were linear. We calibrated the Mini (then called Version 1.1) against a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800) at 648 nm by running serial dilutions of KMnO4 solutions and milk. We used a cuvette in the spectrophotometer, test tube in the Mini, and calbrated against cuvette reading with the Mini's electronic circuitry (the Cuvette Reading Graphs).
Data for these graphs available here .
As you can see, the graphs are linear to within experimental error!
Pro
The Pro is still under development, so we do not have much data from it yet. However, we did manage to measure its dilution capabilities:
As you can see, the Pro dilutes quite linearly, (once we correct for the offset) with an r-squared value of 0.996 !
(Data for this curve available at HW-Results-Pro-Dilution-Linearity-Data.xlsx )
Growth Curves
With the knowledge that the GCODe Mini's readings are linear, we are now ready to run growth curves! There is a slight hitch, however. Optical Density is calculated using Beer-Lambert's Law[1],
\[       \text{Absorbance} = \epsilon c l ,\\       \\        \text{ where}\\       \epsilon \text{ is Absorbance coefficient}\\        c \text{ is Concentration }\\       l \text{ is Path Length.}  \]
But we realised that l and ε are different for our optical system as compared to the spectrophotometer. However since the concentration will still be the same in both cases, the OD will be proportional. We can then compare the graphs by normalizing, ie dividing by any one reading.
Growth curves of Salmonella typhimurium (STMwt14028) and Escherichia coli were made. The optical densities were simultaneously measured using a spectrophotometer at wavelength 600nm [In the graph as OD600] and our device"

A .xls version of this table with relevant filters can be found here .
Promoter identification
To identify potential promoter regions in Marchantia's genome, we looked for gene sequences from other species, mainly Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens. We were particularly interested in genes that were:
Nitrate inducible
Sulphate inducible
Phosphate inducible
Circadian rythm driven
Metabolism related
Development related
Light responsive
Development
Standard templates for proteins
Standard templates for genes
Reading recent research papers in search for these genes and looking for their sequences on GenBank and ThaleMine, we constructed a list of protein sequences to compare to the Marchantia predicted scaffolds. (For genes where only the nucleotide sequence was available, instead of the protein sequence, a C++ code was written to perform the translation). We ran a tblastn search in BLAST for the best matches between our candidate proteins and the Marchantia scaffolds. Then, for the best matches (~60% and above, with some judging by eye), we annotated the 2kb upstream of the start codon as a potential promoter region.
Example of a BLAST hit, matching an inducible nitrate transporter sequence to a Marchantia gene
We identified 30 candidate promoters this way, that we are planning to screen by inserting in a construct driving the yellow fluorescent protein Venus. For each promoter, we will make a construct with and one without amplification by GAL4 and GAL4 UAS, to evaluate the promoter strength and get around any leakages due to the use of GAL4.

Antti Koistinen
Biotechnology at Aalto University
Mostly, I have been working in the lab with many projects including fluorescent protein testing in yeast and constructing our biobricks. I also did some modelling since somebody needs to teach biology to the mathematicians.
When I heard that you could be part of research project where designing and execution is done by students I knew this is something I want to part of. Little bit more researching about previous year's iGEM projects, synthetic biology and its opportunities got me completely hooked.
Laura Laiho
Molecular Biosciences at the University of Helsinki
In the research and lab I constituted one half of the degradation team. Outside the lab I, as our team captain, tried to keep everything on track and make sure that we were getting stuff done. I also got to hold presentations to companies and drew the pictures for our introduction video.
I joined iGEM because I wanted to do something awesome and learn new stuff and see what a team full of students can achieve - a lot apparently!
I came to iGEM knowing quite little about synthetic biology, but now I am confident that my future career will be in this field of science.
Nidia Obscura
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
I worked on the modelling of the detecting mechanism of our project. I modelled mathematically the potential activity of our promoters and their mechanisms through a theoretical model and some simulations.
I joined IGEM to learn more about the state of the art in synthetic biology and how mathematics could be of help in a task -I thought- so distant. I was pretty excited of applying my knowledge in a very interdisciplinary team.

My main responsibility has been to make sure everything is moving forward in the lab. This has meant lots of lab planning, background research and experiment design, as well as making sure lab work is distributed and everyone knows what to do. And of course, plenty of actual lab work too!
I wanted to work on an independent research project where I’d get to apply what I know and do lots of problem-solving, so a student-driven team project seemed like a good fit. And I wanted to learn more about synthetic biology, which made the match even better!
There had been lots of challenges during the project, but for me, getting to tackle those challenges has been the best part"
Dundee,2013,Team:Dundee#Project#MopTesting_-_-_TEXT.html," the ELISA kit as before. Sadly, our Mop device did not successfully reduce the microcystin concentration. We have since repeated the experiment with a longer incubation time (24 h) and still there was no reduction in microcystin concentration. Our final experiment involved using 4 g of the cell suspension, but again the microcystin concentration in our sample was not significantly reduced. However, according to our results from the direct contact experiment, described above, for the ‘Mop’ device to be as effective then we would need 70 g of cells. This is based on the fact that 70% of the mops were occupied in the 0.5 g of cells used. So assuming that cell/microcystin interactions are not inhibited by the dialysis bag then 0.35 g of cells would be sufficient to clean up 1 mL of microcystin to the level that we saw in the direct contact experiment. Since we had 200 mL of contaminated water then we would need 200 x 0.35 g (70 g) of cells to clean the water to the same standard. We are currently working on a number of methods utilising pumps and filtration to increase the number of PP1/microcystin interactions. We are also working on methods to increase the number of PP1 mops in the periplasm by overproducing the Tat transport machinery. We are hopeful that we can develop a device that overcomes these issues since the principle of using our E. coli cells as a mop has been proven.

Ron Weiss
Professor Ron Weiss joined the BE and EECS faculties as dual associate professor (with tenure) starting in July 2009, having moved from Princeton University where he held comparable rank in their department of electrical engineering and with a joint appointment in their department of molecular biology. His degrees are double BA in Computer Science and Economics from Brandeis University (1992), followed by SM and PhD in EECS at MIT (1994, 2001). Professor Weiss’s research focuses on programming new cellular behaviors by designing and embedding synthetic gene networks that perform desired functions in single cells and multicellular environments. This nascent field of synthetic biology holds promise for a wide range of applications such as programmed tissue engineering, cancer therapeutics, environmental biosensing and effecting, biomaterial fabrication, and an improved understanding of naturally occurring biological processes.

We developed a Flow-chart diagram to make the reactions that happen before, during and after the washing steps visible. Subsequently we developed chemical reaction equations and formulate differential equations after them. Here appeared the parameters we had to determine. After carefully considering these equations, we introduce several simplifications, either because the expected information was marginal, or because the information was experimentally not accessible.

Conclusions
To determine the Affinity k_D, experiments to find out the binding affinity of the plastic binding domain are necessary. To get a direct access to these values, we cloned the plastic binding domain in front of a GFP. Then, dilution and washing assays could be performed on polystyrene microtiter plates, red out by a fluorescence plate reader.  The desired parameters could be calculated by measuring dilution rows of GFP proteins and measuring the fluorescence signals at the different concentrations. C_total could be determined by a dilution row with subsequent washing steps, to find out at what [P] concentration there is a saturation. See description of the plastic binding subproject for more detailed explanation on the experimental setup.
A qualitative experiment to prove that Nickel is binding the Precipitator is sufficient, since k_2 >> 1 and does not play a significant role in our setup. This experiment could have been done using a nanofilter that blocks protein but let through ions. The Nickel concentration of the flow through can then be measured.
Alternatively purification of the Precipitator by fusing it with a GST-tag could be done, to subsequently measure the absorbance of the protein, before and after adding Nickel to the solution. After Jordan 1974 a detectable change in the absorbance should be detectable after the complex is formed. A similar effect – a colorshift from white to blue -  is visible when one prepares a Ni-NTA column. For this purpose we cloned the GST domain in front of the Precipitator. However towards the end of the project there was no more time to perfom these experiments.

Results
The above equations were modelled in COPASI, and the following graphs show the behaviour of the system over time at different IPTG concentrations.
IPTG concentration = 1000 nmol/fl
Figure 1.1
In Figure 1.1, at a IPTG concentration of 1000nmol/fl, due to the high concentration of LacI*, it is difficult to view the results for the other species, such as, KinA, LacI, mRNA_KinA, and mRNA_LacI as they are all concentrated at the bottom.
Figure 1.2
Figure 1.2 shows the behaviour of KinA, LacI, mRNA_KinA and mRNA_LacI more clearly, at the IPTG concentration of 1000nmol/flu.
From Figure 1.1 and 1.2, it is observed that the concentration of LacI* is significantly higher than the other species when the IPTG concentration is set at 1000nmol/fl. Looking at Figure 1.2, while the concentration of KinA is increasing, it is still lower than that of LacI.
IPTG concentration = 3000 nmol/fl
Figure 2.1
Comparing Figure 1.1 and 2.1, though the IPTG concentration in Figure 2.1 is 3000nmol/fl, the LacI* concentration is not particularly different.
Figure 2.2
As the IPTG concentration increases from 1000 to 3000nmol/fl, the KinA concentration is greater than the LacI concentration. However, upon a closer look, the KinA concentration did not increase due to the higher IPTG concentration. The KinA concentration"

Outcomes
1. Acquiring the CAT-Seq enzyme
In order to choose the enzyme to prove the concept of CAT-Seq method, a library of various hydrolyzing enzymes were expressed using In vitro transcription and translation kit. The newly synthesized proteins were mixed with substrate nucleotide of our choice - N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. This type of substrate nucleotide shows a strong absorbance at 310 nm due to the benzene ring conjugating with the pyrimidine ring of cytosine. The removal (hydrolysis) of the substrate from the nucleotide abolishes this absorbance making it convenient for tracking catalysis and kinetics of enzymes. Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of 16 different hydrolase family enzymes as a decay of substrate absorbance intensity at 310 nm. As seen from these results some of the enzymes show no affinity to this type of enzyme, some of them catalyse a minor. Based on the speed of catalysis the RM537 (The CAT-Seq esterase) was chosen.
Figure 1. The hydrolase library screening results. The larger absorbance signified the removal of the substrate cytidine modifications. The chosen esterase for CAT-Seq is colored green (CAT-Seq Esterase).
Kinetic characterization of CAT-Seq Esterase
After the biomolecule of interest for Substrate Nucleotide Catalytic conversion was chosen, we termed it CAT-Seq esterase. This enzyme will be used to prove the workflow concepts of CAT-Seq.

Survey
Part of our Human Practice work, we have established a little survey under the form of a mini quiz. It                         aims to establish a state of knowledge regarding what people know about forest in general, and the                         resulting industry. We diffused the survey to all IGEM teams contacted by social networks such as                         Facebook and Twitter. As the objective was not to collect only igemers participation, we diffused                         the survey among our university classmates, friends and family. The survey was available under both                         English and French version. In that way we hoped to reach a maximum of people to establish a great                         overview of the results.
Survey structure
The quiz has 8 questions with 3 answers and only one is correct. At the end of these questions the participant                         must fill personal information fields in order to see who is participating. We asked for the age                         group, the country of residency and if the player is participating to the current IGEM competition                         or not. After sending his answers the player is assigned a mark on 8pts and he can consult a correction.
Questions theme
All questions refer to the concept of Forest in general and worldwide. Some were more oriented to how                         the forest are used, and how they are managed. They are listed below:
Approximately how much of the total forest represents the modified natural forests worldwide ?
Which country has the largest forested area ?
Which country generates the most industrial profit from its forests ?
What type of forest is the most represented in the world ?
How many people are employed in the forest trades ?
In Brazil, which activity is the most responsible in the reduction of forests ?
Which country is the leader in pulp and paper industry ?
Today, how are recycled sub-products from wood industry ?
Results
We collected a total of 127 answers. From these 127 participants, 60 are participating to the IGEM                         competition which represents 47.2%. The average mark is 2.33/8. The proportion of correct answers                         is visible on the histogram.
The low average mark score is indicating a lake of knowledge in most of the questions. However, it is not surprising to see such a fact as some of the questions were very specific. We can see that half                         of the answers from question 4 are correct. At the opposite, only 15.2% of the answers from question                         6 are correct. The little score for the question 6 highlights a weakness concerning the"

Different weight functions will produce distinct, but formally equivalent HDMR expansions. There are two commonly used HDMR expansions: Cut- and RS(Random Sampling)-HDMR. Cut-HDMR expresses <math>f(x)</math> in reference to a specified cut point, while RS-HDMR depends on the average value of <math>f(x)</math> over the whole domain <math>\Omega</math> . We adopt RS-HDMR to do global sensitivity analysis. For RS-HDMR, we first rescale variables <math>x_{i}</math> such that <math>0<x_{i}<1</math> for all i. The output function <math>f(x)</math> is then defined in the unit hypercube
<math>K^{n}={(x_{1},x_{2},...x_{n})|0<\leq x_{i}\leq 1, i=1,2,...,n}</math>
by suitable transformations. The component functions of RS-HDMR possess the following forms:
<math>f_{0}=\int_{K^{n}}f(u)du</math>
<math>f_{i}(x_{i})=\int_{K^{n-1}}f(x_{i},u^{i})du^{i}-f_{0}</math>

Evaluation of the high dimensional integrals in the RS-HDMR expansion is carried out by the Monte Carlo random sampling. Orthogonality conditions are used to obtain the above formulas.

Abstract
Biological parts ,one of the most important tools in the research of synthetic biology ,have been designed ,created and documented in large numbers, most of which ,however, lack scalability. To be more precise, the scalability of a biological part refers to its ability of handling of expanding scale of input and output and the ability of expansion in function. In our project, we aim to demonstrate that a scalable biological part could be devised through proper arrangement of certain sequences in the presence of some protein. We resort to an scalable electronic component ,PLD or Programmable Logic Device in this project. The definition of PLD from Wikipedia is quoted as below:” A programmable logic device or PLD is an electronic component used to build reconfigurable digital circuits. Unlike a logic gate, which has a fixed function, a PLD has an undefined function at the time of manufacture. Before the PLD can be used in a circuit it must be programmed, that is, reconfigured.” That is, digital systems could be integrated to it at will through computer programming by the user, instead of producing an electronic component with a fixed function. Actually, we have constructed a biological part that functions as a PLD, though primitive. The most basic elements in digital circuits are the AND gate and OR gate. We resort to Cre/LoxP system to enable the biological part with the ability to interchange between AND gate and OR gate by regulation of the concentration of the protein Cre. readmore
Design
With the help of site-specific recombination, we manage to change the logic from the physical layer. To a further step, we design a system whose logic changes between AND and OR. readmore
Scalability
We can transform AND gate into OR gate through a flip of the sequence between opposite loxP sites. Moreover, based on a similar idea, our system shows a strong scalability in further design. readmore

Project: the idea
We came to the ""AI-2 Controller"" project after many brainstorming meetings including all the team members. It would be reasonable to attribute the idea of the project to all the team members because we all contributed to the design of the project..
AI-2 Controller Construction:
All the experiments including AI-2 controller gene circuits construction, AI-2 response device construction and AI-2 controller biosafety construction were designed and conducted by Fankang Meng, Xinyu Ma, Yujie Zhao and Jingzhe Dong.
This part of construction includes the construction of pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxS-Mtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK, AI-2 Response Device A and B using homologous recombination method. Whats more, the four people listed before also took advantage of mf-lon protease to create safer engineered bacteria.
AI-2 Controller Characterization:
All the experiments in AI-2 controller characterization were designed and conducted by Fankang Meng, Xiao Liu and Xinhao Song.                     This part of construction includes using qPCR, Western blot, microplate reader and HPLC to characterize pTrcHisB, pLuxS, pLuxS-Mtn, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK, pLsrACDBFGK.

Meetups
Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International                         Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project and feelings of iGEM. We made a brief introduction to                         our project and answered questions asked by experts and journalist, in which we gained a better                         insight into our project.
Meetup held by team Peking
We participated in an exchange meeting organized by team Peking. The other teams are team                         Tsinghua, UCAS, BNU, THU, OUC. Every team had a presentation on their projects, including the                         idea, the process, and their superiority. We received a lot of pertinent suggestions from other                         teams, which helped a lot to our project. Especially, team Peking gave us plenty of suggestions                         and we had a pleasant discussion. Due to these, we set a collaboration with team Peking.
CCIC
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. CCIC (Central China iGEM Consortium) is a national iGEM exchange meeting                         held by domestic universities, which provides an important pre-competition exchange and                         learning platform for teams from China. It not only promotes the exchange and cooperation                         between the national iGEM teams, but also further promote synthetic biology to domestic                         universities. Taking part in CCIC allowed us to have a more profound understanding of our own                         project, so as to find some improving thoughts, and a few other teams reached a friendly cooperation on the project design with our team. Through the expert's reports and several                         predecessors experience exchange, we had solved many confusion in our laboratory, and had a                         deeper understanding of synthetic biology.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate"

This communication signal is IL-2 in T cells and autoinducer molecules in V. fischeri.

Conceptual Framework: Community Integration
The secreted signal will be produced and is transmitted between all cells in the population.
While in our experiment, we will stick with simple culture tubes, the location and structure of how cells are arranged and allowed to move can impact how the secondary signal is integrated. T cells are usually arranged in the highly structured lymph node when first exposed to pathological antigen.
Next Prev
Conceptual Framework: Community Response
Each cell in the population will also have receptors to recognize the secondary signal. Receptor binding will trigger a signaling cascade to induce expression of a downstream reporter gene to indicate cellular communication levels — in this case, fluorescence.
In V. fischeri, one can find an analogous community response once the population has reached quorum. This response, however, is processed to binary form while our circuit will strive to output a signal that reports the continuous distribution of community responses.
Next Prev
Implementation
Here we diagram the realized implementation of our circuit design.
There are two components to the overall circuit. The first (left), is a cell autonomous response driven by induction by a small-molecule (doxycycline). This induction is read out by the reporter GFP.
The second component integrates communication by stimulating the production of a secreted signaling factor after doxycycline induction. This factor can communicate to the originating cell as well as neighboring cells, and receptor binding of this signal stimulates RFP reporter expression.
This design thus allows us to view both individual cell responses (GFP) and community responses (RFP) simultaneously in a population of cells.

Implementation: Doxycycline
For our stimulus, we have opted to use the well-characterized small molecule antibiotic, doxycycline, as an inducer.

Implementation: rtTA
Doxycycline is able to induce gene expression by binding to the engineered transcription factor rtTA. This protein is a fusion between the E. coli Tet repressor (which binds doxycycline) and the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Msn2 [ 3 ].
We have further elaborated on this component of the circuit by engineering yeast strains that respond differently to doxycycline induction. We have achieved this by altering the constitutive promoter driving rtTA expression. We have implemented the endogenous pTEF1 promoter as well as several mutants (see promoter characterization below) which have altered expression levels [ 4 ]. The altered doxyc"

Procedure
Retrieval of the watermark should be easy, in the event of a rogue bacteria spreading havoc in the environment. Standardized placement of the watermark within the part should make it possible to easily retrieving the watermark through sequencing. Thus, if a rogue bacteria is discovered, it should be a simple matter to sequence the part, and obtain the license. Then it is just a matter of consulting the parts-registry to access all available information on the part and on how to contact the creating team. Getting a bacteria sequenced is a technology which is easy to access, and a lot of companies worldwide offers sequencing of bacteria, in addition it is a relative speedy process, which further makes the identification of a malign bacteria, and its properties relatively easy.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," S. cerevisiae would be promising for considering potential production in eukaryotic organisms such as P. pastoris. This gave us additional motivation to use S. cerevisiae as the chassis in our project.
If the enzyme is a membrane protein as suspected, secreting it would likely not be possible. However, as it had been previously expressed in a soluble, active form in the cytoplasm of E. coli , and there is no certainty of the structure, we thought secretion might be worth attempting. A widely used secretion tag in S. cerevisiae is the mating factor α (UniProt ID: P01149), which is involved in the signaling between two yeast cells prior to conjugation. It is composed of several domains, each having different functions (figure 9). The first domain is the signal sequence, which directs the protein into the inner membranes for modifications. The second domain is the propeptide sequence for the secretion of the protein, which ends in signals for proteolytic cleavage. The propeptide is followed by the actual mating factor α sequences, each separated by spacer peptides that contain proteolytic processing signals. (Kurjan and Herskowitz, 1982)
Figure 11. Domains of the α mating factor protein sequence. SP - signal peptide, α - mating factor α peptide, PP - propeptide. The first propeptide of 70 amino acids is key for protein secretion. Sequence information obtained from UniProt.
When the mating factor α is used as a secretion tag, only the first two domains are used. The tag, composed of these two parts, is added in front of the protein sequence and it guides the protein out of the cell. The mating factor α is also used as a localization tag for membrane proteins. Membrane proteins usually have hydrophobic regions, and as the mating factor α tries to secrete them, these hydrophobic regions get stuck in the plasma membrane. However, placing the signal sequence in front of the actual enzyme coding sequence might also cause some problems with correct folding of the protein or decrease the enzyme’s activity.
Because there was contradictory evidence relating to MlrA being a membrane protein, using the mating factor α served a dual purpose; if the enzyme is a membrane protein, as suggested by homology modeling, localizing it to the plasma membrane might allow for better activity against microcystin. The membranes could then possibly be purified along with the enzymes. On the other hand, if the enzyme isn’t a membrane protein, as previous reports of its expression might suggest, the mating factor α would allow for its"

Lisa did a very beautiful colony PCR of some of the transformants which indicated that the right plasmids are among the colonies. Sadly the colonies did not want to be marked, so they were not be found on the plates.
The quest for the missing transformants will continue.

September 20th & 21st 2010
PCR’s are finally alive and working!
Today was the deadline for having to send in our track selection, project abstracts and team rosters. Having to make the track selection was a bit tricky as our project theoretically can fall under many of the areas available; we picked the most relevant and interesting one though.
So after many attempts of running PCR’s, we switched back to the old PCR buffer which seems to be the contributing factor in making them successful once again.  The repressor group still seems to be having some issues with their PCR’s, but this could be due to several reasons, i.e issues with the primers they’re using, PCR mix, etc.
Many restrictions need to be performed this week as we still require a good amount of ligated products towards the final construct in the anti-terminator; so far so good though, many hours have been spent these past two days in the lab with a lot of good results, hope my lucky streak continues.

Successful ligations!!
As soon as I arrived at the lab today after my morning course, I rushed to the incubator to take a look at the plates and I was very pleased to see that we had a decent amount of colonies on all the plates we expected to see growth on, and only a small number of colonies on the negative controls. Malthe from my group, the Antiterminator group, started a load of PCRs to amplify the backbone plasmids that we're going to need later on when constructing our systems, as well as a PCR of the GFP we're going to be using as a reporter. The Repressor group did PCRs of the pBAD promotor, an inducible promoter that both groups plan to use as part of our charaterizations, as well as ligations of the parts they plan to submit to the Registry.
Outside the lab we are putting the finishing touches"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,", a DNA plasmid of high purity and water of high quality are recommended. For sfGFP expression plasmids we found that plasmid mini-preparation kits, especially from Promega and Qiagen, provide sufficient DNA quality.
Shaking can be helpful, especially when oxygen is needed for the reaction (see Caschera and Noireaux 2015 ). In our Tecan measurements we shaked 5 s with 1 mm amplitude every time before fluorescence was measured.
PRIA protocols
Plasmid Repressor Interaction Assay (PRIA)
After every step the reaction tube is centrifuged with 1000 g for 1 minute.
The supernatant after centrifugation and every wash step (starting from the step when the protein is added to the agarose) is stored for analyzing the samples for protein and DNA amounts.
As negative controls no protein to the agarose were added.
Steps:
25 µL Ni-NTA agarose is put in a reaction tube. Then the sample is centrifuged.
The agarose is washed three times with Kpi buffer (Volume: 50 µL).
250 pmol protein in 20 µL Kpi buffer is added and incubated for 30 min. Then the sample is centrifuged.
The agarose is incubated three times in Kpi Buffer (Volume: 50 µL).Then the sample is centrifuged.
0.75 pmol plasmid (lacO) is mixed with 20 µL binding buffer (Incubation time: 15 min).
Unbound DNA is washed away three times with binding buffer (Volume: 50 µL, Incubation time: 15 min). Then the sample is centrifuged.
3x elution with analytes in binding buffer (Volume: 50 µL, Incubation time: 15 min)
Imidazol solution (50 µl) is used to release proteins from the agarose.

iGEM
Detect and Destroy: Building FRED and OSCAR
Tailings ponds are large bodies of water containing toxic compounds that accumulate as a byproduct of the oil extraction process in the oil sands of northern Alberta. These toxic and corrosive compounds are a potential environmental and economic concern to Alberta and to other areas. The University of Calgary 2012 iGEM team aims to develop a collection of toxin-sensing and degrading organisms to detect and destroy (bioremediate) the toxins, turning them into useable hydrocarbons.
FRED and OSCAR are the two projects we are working on this year. Take a look at the descriptions below to learn more!
iGEM Style!
Take a look at our music video--sung and produced by our very own members--that's taking the iGEM world by storm!
Synergy
We have lots of new data since Regionals! Click here to see how we brought the three aspects of our project together!
Intro Video
Click here to see the introductory video we played at the beginning of our Jamboree presentations!
The Concept
Our project consists of three major components: FRED, OSCAR, and the overarching Human Practices considerations informing their design. Click on the boxes to your left to learn more about what iGEM Calgary has done so far!
Human Practices
Great consideration was put into our Human Practices component this year, as safety was the guiding principle behind the design of FRED and OSCAR.  iGEM Calgary has undertaken many human outreach initiatives this year. Roll over the boxes to see each of them!
Initiative
We took the initiative with the oil sands industry and established a dialogue"

Meet Ronja Kothe
Hello! I’m Ronja Kothe, a student at Winston Churchill High School. This is my second year in iGEM and I have had an amazing time. I joined iGEM because I find the field of synthetic biology very fascinating. I also want to gain more experience in lab work, which is my favourite aspect of iGEM. However, the Human Practices component of iGEM interests me very much as well. In the future I would like to continue to perform experiments and venture out into the biomedical field. In addition to iGEM, I also enjoy playing the clarinet and going camping with my fellow Girl Guides.

Meet Jessica Semmelrock
My name is Jessica Semmelrock. I am seventeen years old. Art and science interest me, which is why I plan to continue studying the subjects in post secondary. I joined the Lethbridge iGEM team because of the unique experience it offers. The opportunity came up a short while after I discovered what synthetic biology is and I was psyched to learn more. It is incredible that a team of high school students and a few advisors can create innovative solutions to world problems. I love getting involved in various activities, including sports, volunteering, and visual arts. A belief I hold close is that learning is the best part of any activity, which makes IGEM all the better.
They told me to choose a chemistry themed pick-up line, but all the good ones argon.

Meet Madeson Singh
My name is Madeson, I am going into grade 12 at Chinook High school. In my free time I enjoy drawing, painting, and pretty much anything artsy. My favorite things about iGEM was learning more and getting a hands on approach with synthetic biology, as well as getting to know new people.
I wish your name was Avogadro, because then I would already know your number.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," are expected to boost its usage rates in the future13.
The growing aging population coupled with increasing automotive and industrial exhaust gases have remained the key drivers for the global asthma and COPD market, especially in the low-income population in the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, and Russia.
Increasing disposable income levels in emerging economies as well as developing countries of Latin America, Middle East, and Africa has led to the increased usage of asthma pumps and sprays in these regions. However, the unknown etiology of asthma and COPD in medical industry may restrict the market growth in the next six years. Upcoming treatment methodologies such as once-a-day combination products and monoclonal antibodies have created new opportunities for market growth. New bio-based medications in combination with biotechnology promise immense growth opportunities along with sustainable development for asthma and COPD market over the next decade.
Currently, North America leads the global market for asthma and COPD drugs and devices, followed by Europe in terms of market capitalization. However, because of the expiration of several patents, these regional markets will lose out some of the market shares to other emerging regional markets. Asia Pacific is expected to become the fastest regional market for asthma and COPD14.
Who are the key players of the market?
For cystic fibrosis, the key companies are AbbVie, Inc.; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.; Gilead; Novartis AG; Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.; AIT (Advanced Inhalation Therapies); Alaxia; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Merck & Co., Inc.; Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc.; Allergan; and AstraZeneca15.
For asthma and COPD, the key companies are AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Novartis, and Merck. Other significant companies operating in the global asthma and COPD market include Abbott, Amgen, Actavis, AptarGroup, Aurobindo, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cipla, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Glenmark, Mylan, Pfizer, Ranbaxy, Sunovion, and Vectura.
Which stakeholder could recognize the greatest value created by a new solution?
The patient is the most valuable stakeholder for all three diseases. Their life quality is affected by their sickness, and they are the ones carrying the daily difficulties to get rid of the mucus, Finding a new medication that works affects them the most and, they are also the ones ready to take a “risk” developing GMOs, for a better life.

For example, since their team's main project is similar to team Tokyo-Tech's 2011 one, they've searched with restriction: team:Tokyo-Tech and year:2011. This team & year restriction enabled them to obtain the desired parts quickly. And they decided which parts to use in important parts such as ArgBox and terminator.
Also, they gave us a lot of feedback. So, we took their comments into consideration.
The main points of improvement are:
Save the history of the words you've searched at the top of the page.
Add a link to Parts Registry's page.
*Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
・Sharing :
Our “ BioBrick Search ” allows you to search the desired BioBrick parts quickly.
This means that you can access the accumulated knowledge of past iGEM projects quite easily.
It also enables users to share the knowledge of BioBrick parts, which will result in determining the parts to use much easier.
・Human Practice :
Our educational software tutorials (“ BioBrick Puzzle ” and “ Gene Network Game ”) made synthetic biology easier to approach.
We think it would be beneficial in human practice, especially for beginners in that it could help them take part in the field much easier.
Also, these tutorials may be helpful when you want to give lessons in synthetic biology to newcomers. So, tutorials may expand the scope of synthetic biology.
*Develop and document a new technical standard that supports : the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
Our software, “ BioBrick Search ” allows the sharing of the information of BioBrick Parts information via internet.
Best Interaction with the Parts Registry
*Propose an alternate interaction with the registry. Clearly document this on your wiki in a page explicitly dedicated to this aspect of your tool. You should clearly show how to use this tool in a design flow used by experimental iGEM teams.
Our software, “ BioBrick Search ” propose an alternate interaction with the registry.
BioBrick Search improves PartsRegistry in that :
Search result is sorted by combination of 3 factors (reliability, relevance to your query and popularity)
Filters can be set by various conditions, such as year submitted, team name, category
->Users can obtain desired parts quickly.
User-friendly interface
->Users can easily know the parts information, such as which team used the parts.

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#hoWAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," offspring for successive generations. The probability of an individual mating is proportional to the fitness of the environment. The generation with better fitness will be obtained generation by generation. As the topology, the interaction forms and the parameters for each component function are all necessary in the final result, we employed a multi-level optimization. The lowest level optimization is to give the suitable parameters with the topology and the interaction forms known. For the next level, we are trying to find the interactions forms of component functions with the known topology with genetic algorithm. At last, for the upper level, the potential topologies are selected also with genetic algorithm. And the fitness functions are the similarity between the dynamic behaviors and the target, which are measured by the standard error.
Optimization Processes of GA
Step1: Randomly generate a population of topologies.
Step2: For each topology, generate a population of networks with a serial of random interaction forms.
Step3: For each network, obtain the fitness score by optimize the parameters.
Step4: Obtain the fitness score of a topology by searching the most favorable network.
Step5: Evolutes the topologies with each fitness score.
Parameter For GA
Population: the number of members in one generation
Mutation ratio: the ratio of each gene alter its status in a generation
Recombine ratio: the ratio that whether a gene change with its allel in mating
Max_cycle: the maximum number of generations considered for the evolution
Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO)
Introduction to PSO
What's PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is an optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence theory. Motivated by the evolution of nature, a series of evolutionary computation techniques, such as evolutionary programming, genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, are proposed, in which a best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, individual swarms are evolved through cooperation and competition. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. The position of each particle represents a potential solution to a problem.
The following is excerpt from"" http://www.swarmintelligence.org/ "", it shows clearly how PSO works: ""Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space which are associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far. (The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best"

7/5/08 調査内容の報告＆第33回ブレインストーミング
場所：工学部1号棟3階会議室
参加者：香取、小林、冨永、福富、Craigさん
Craigさんを交え、「調査内容の報告」および「システム案の提案」を行いました。
調査内容の詳細は、勉強会のログに、随時記載されていきますので、ご確認ください。
システム案は、特に福富くんの「ステップスイッチ」について話し合いました。
案の詳細は、福富くんが画像付きで載せてくれています。

補足：
今まで、移動系、色素系、分裂系がありましたが、今現在システム全体が書き出せるものは
「物質合成→積算＆コミュニケーション→output」
の色素系であります。移動系のアイデアには、積算値が戻らないという利点があります。
しかしその位置情報を大腸菌に認識させるという、積算の次のステップのシステムが現在出されていません。
分裂系も、２のn乗で増えていくので色素系と比較すると問題点が多いです。
テスト前まで色素系を進めていこうかという話をしました。もちろん分裂系、移動系は棚上げで。
５日に話した色素系に必要な条件を書き出します。
