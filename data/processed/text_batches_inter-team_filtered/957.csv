Goodwin Oscillator
Repressilator
Amplified negative feedback oscillator
Fussenegger Oscillator
We’ll give a very brief overview of the Goodwin and the Amplified negative feed- back oscillators . The Danino Oscillator is essentially a quorum sensing version of the Amplified negative feedback oscillator.
Goodwin Oscillator - This was the first synthetic genetic oscillator to be  studied. It consists of a single gene with negative autoregulation. Models  suggest that oscillations occur in the goodwin oscillator if repression is mod- elled by a nonlinear Hill function with a high cooperativity coefficient [3].  Further, this oscillator has been shown to have a robust time period.
Amplified negative feedback oscillator Leaving aside the biological im- plementation, this abstract topology is the one used in the Danino Oscillator.Under this architecture, the activator gene A activates it’s own repressor gene  B. In the Daanino oscillator there is a latent phase when both the activator  and repressor accumulate, thus allowing large amplitudes to be achived for  this configuration.The qualitative behavior of this oscillator is discussed in  the modelling section using the mathematical model suggested in [4]. One  crucial benefit that the Danino oscillator has over this topology is the prop- erty of quorum sensing; the AHL molecule can diffuse across the cell mem- brane and be exchange with neighbouring cells. This offers a mechanism to  synchronize the oscillators.
Project
The main focus of team iGem IIT Delhi has been ’reconfigurability’. Keeping this  in mind, we have divided the project into two modules; each centred around the  idea of reconfigurability. Module I is a tunable oscillator where we can change the  frequency of oscillation. Our proposed design focuses on using an optogentic mod- ule to achieve control over frequency. While Module I would switch the frequency  of oscillation between two non-zero values, Module II implements a toggle switch  over an oscillator. Thus, the idea is to be able to kill the oscillations in a manner  that the concentration of one of the components stays at a low value, while that  for another component stably stays high.
Module I - HOTFM
We call this module ’Highly Optimized tunable Frequency Modulator (HOTFM)’.  The idea is to modify the Danino Oscillator so that we can tune the frequency of os- cillations. Further, we wish to use optogenetics"

UIUC_Illinois,2015,Team:UIUC Illinois#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," components for a single transcript of this retron cassette: a reverse transcriptase, and two RNA portions, msr and msd, which are the primer and template, respectively, for the reverse transcriptase, which are flanked by inverted repeats. When this gets transcribed, base pairing within the transcript leads to the formation of a secondary structure. Reverse transcriptase will then recognize this secondary structure, and use the internal guanosine residue mentioned earlier as a priming site to reverse transcribe the msd sequence. The reverse transcriptases lack an RNase H domain, therefore, cellular RNase H assists in the production of the mature form of msDNA [5].
It was later found that there were strict structural requirements of the transcript for the successful production of msDNA [6][7]. As such, certain sequences cannot be replaced without the complete loss of function. However, it was found that only the lower portion of the msd stem (the first 21 bases on the 5' end and the last 23 bases on the 3' end of msd) is essential for successful reverse transcription, and that the rest of the stem and loop could be replaced by a sequence of interest.
This cassette, with a modified msd region, can be put under the control of a promoter, which allows for the production of ssDNA to be related to the presence of a defined input. Furthermore, this can be coexpressed with Beta recombinase, which has been shown to efficiently and precisely introduce ssDNA into sites of the genome that have a minimum of 20 base pairs of complete homology [8]. Beta recombinase works by helping these single strands integrate into the genome at the replication fork during DNA replication. The efficiency of the recombinase is at a relatively medium level, with 10E-4 recombination events occurring per generation. Therefore, the recording of an event is contained within the portion of cells that undergo the recombination event, which can be found through functional assays designed to show the presence of mutations, or sequencing.

Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks?
We did not utilize any design features to mitigate risks. Expressing our protein causes the chassis bacteria to be metabolically disadvantaged, and so it would likely not survive in the wild.
Standard Operating Procedures
While the biological materials that we were working with did not present any hazards, a few of our solvents and chemicals did. Lithium bromide and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) are used to solubilize natural and lyophilized silk, respectively. They were critical to our project, but due to their hazardous nature, we had to familiarize ourselves with how to safely and properly use them. We drafted the following Safe Operating Procedures for training and for reference:

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," our parameters were at fault, rather than the fact that we were examining CRISPR in S. aureus instead of E. coli, we consulted fluorescence results from the laboratory, which showed that unrepressed YFP continued to fluoresce after several hours.
Parameter Adjustment
Confident that the initial model was inaccurate, we had to update some of the model parameters. We were least sure of our estimates of the mRNA production rates from the literature and manual fiddling showed that CRISPR interference in the model with adjustments to the production rates only. Accordingly, we used MATLAB fmincon to find updated mRNA production rates and fixed all other parameters.
In the MATLAB fmincon parameter search, we generated an error function by comparing the sum of squares error of the model YFP dynamics to time-series data derived Qi et al.
, who measured repression with CRISPRi and found a short delay followed by exponential decay with a 35-minute half life. We assumed that the delay and rate of decay would be similar in our system, but fixed the final level of repression according to the two extremes reported by Bikard et al. (6-Fold and 35-Fold)
. The simulated time-series data and the model output after the parameter search are compared below.
Satisfied with these fits, we simulated the system again using the fitted values for the mRNA production rates. The model output using the novel parameter sets are shown below for both the 6-fold and 35-fold simulations. The results with and without CRISPR interference are contrasted as before, though now a difference is observed when CRISPR inteacts with YFP
Simulated System Dynamics with 6-Fold Repression
Simulated System Dynamics with 35-Fold Repression
The system dynamics differ quite notably depending on the fit: in the 6-fold system, the equilibrium levels of sgRNA are quite low while the equilibrium levels of dCas9 mRNA are high, which is reversed in the 35-fold system. More laboratory characterization would be needed to determine which model most closely replicates the actual system dynamics. However, the two sets of parameters provide a basis for sensitivity analysis and some idea of the expected time-series repression.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Quorum sensing module: influence of AHL degradation
Overview
The basis of quorum sensing is the leaky production of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) in absence of an external cue which is crucial to allow for basal levels of AHL needed to trigger quorum sensing upon colocalization of several bacteria. Unfortunately, this leakiness interferes greatly with our system, since the main point of a binary signal like we want it, is the tightness in absence of a trigger. We thought of several strategies to deal with this issue. One option was the introduction of AHL degradation which would help us eliminate basic production levels of AHL. We therfore included constitutive expression of the AHL Lactonase AiiA in our design. To validate our design, we tested the influence of AHL degradation on the sensitivity to a large range of AHL concentrations.
We tested the response to AHL for the following genetic setups:
a reporter GFP under control of Plux ( pluxR (R0062) - RBS (B0034) -sfGFP)
a reporter GFP under control of PluxR along with constitutive LuxR ( pluxR (R0062) - RBS (B0034) -sfGFP- terminator (B0012) , promoter (J23118) - RBS (B0032) - LuxR (C0062) - terminator (B0012) )
a reporter GFP under conrol of Plux along with constitutive LuxR and constitutive AiiA ( plux (C0062) - RBS (B0034) -sfGFP- terminator (B0012) , promoter (J23118) - RBS (B0032) - LuxR (C0062) - terminatr (B0012) , promoter (J23118) - RBS (B0034) - aiiA (C0160) )

Given two vcsfmt files, find the difference between them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcscmp.
Reproduce the original input file from a vcsfmt or vcscmp file.
Convert genomic file to version-controllable format (vcsfmt)
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file> [-w]
This produces a specially-formatted file which preserves the information of the original genomic file: the input file can be completely restructured from the output. The important point about the specially-formatted file is that it applies a variety of optimizations to run more quickly under most normal version control systems. If the '-w' option is specified, then dwndiff writes out the output file to a file named the same as the original, but with "".vcsfmt"" appended to the end of the filename. Otherwise, it will write the output to stdout. If '-w' is given as an option, then multiple files can be given as input, and dwndiff will produce vcsfmt versions of all of them.
Take two vcsfmt files and produce vcscmp ""diff""
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file1> <file2> -c [-w -p]
As before, this takes in files and produces an output, which can be written to file or stdout. If written to file, it will have the "".vcscmp"" suffix. The difference between this and the previous command is that dwndiff can only have two input files for this mode of operation, and the input files must already have been preformatted by dwndiff. The resulting output, whether sent to stdout or to the specified file, will be the difference between the two, which, when reviewed by a version control system such as git or svn, will appear extremely small.
Recover original file from vcsfmt or vcscmp file
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file> -u
This faithfully reconstructs the original genomic file from the specially-formatted version dwndiff had previously reproduced. The file is produced in the same directory as the input file, with the "".vcsfmt"" or "".vcscmp"" suffix removed, as appropriate.
Using this in a Version Control System
The dwndiff utility still leaves a lot of work for the user to do. The user must scan in the file to track to produce a vcsfmt file, then track that using an external version control system (many suuch options are noted above). The user must then perform the same operation"

He have made great progress in website techniques, experimental operations and communication skills in this year. All of these make his iGEM journey a precious and memorable experience in his life.
He participated in topic selection, devoted all his summer to wiki programs, and assisted other teammates in modeling and hardware design. He used to be a piano player, outdoors amateur and movie fan, but now he only enjoys sweet sleeping after overnight debugging.
Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Shiyang WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2017. This idea was then modified and improved by Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG. Our investigators Prof. Xien-en ZHANG, Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leaders, Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG, separately responsible for the sensor part and degradation part, designed and monitored our experiments. They also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI gave their suggestion on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Ruiling CAI, Jianyi HUANG, Shubo YUAN, Jiang WU, Jingnan YE, Yi WU, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU, Yuqing LEI.

We can see in Figure 17 that our lysate seems to increase the percentage area of the β-III Tubulin compared to the control without NGF. Our results with the commercial NGF seem to be equivalent to the results we had from our first experiment (Figure 15), with a decrease of axons at a concentration of 900 ng/mL. We can hypothesize that the lysate does have an effect on axon’s growth from the increasing percentage area of β-III Tubulin, increase similar to the one we observe in our first experiment (Figure 15) and that the activity of our proNGF could be equivalent to commercial NGF with a concentration between 500 ng/mL and 900 ng/mL.
We also could see an influence of the commercial NGF on the survival of the cells, similar to our first experiment (Figure 15). Our lysate, put at a concentration of 1/10 and higher, seems to have the same effect (Figure 18).
Figure 18: Image of the whole well of the 96-well plate. Neurons were put in culture in Neurobasal, B27, GlutaMAX, and our lysate at a concentration of 1/10 medium.
Of course, those data require further statistical tests, since we only had time to analyze one well per condition, and for only 2 days of culture due to French customs administrative delays that came with the order of the E18 cortex pair from the USA.  Still, in those 2 days of culture, we have been able to observe a difference in both the percentage area of β-III Tubulin and nuclei counts.

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Symposium - Limits of Life
Lectures

Survey
Introduction
The aspiration to explore how, what we are doing fits into the society required us to first reach out to the public. Connecting to the general public, academia as well as those who our project is directly aimed to help, the horse owner community, required some different approaches. We have kept the goal throughout the project to make our science approachable to as many as possible although at times we did dive into specifics. In order to introduce ourselves to different groups with different interests and different knowledge we have been working on several mini-projects such as a symposium “Limits of Life”, lectures for various audiences as well as reaching out via different media.
Symposium – Limits of Life
Human Practices is all about bringing the science to the people and what better way to do this then to create a big event, where everyone (scientists, academics and further citizens) is invited? This was the start of the collaboration between iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Stockholm with further support from iGEM Lund. Our goal was to organize an event that would break down the differences between scientists and non academic people by bringing up subjects that everyone can recognize themselves in, as well as introducing synthetic biology to those who wanted to learn more about it. Together we organized a symposium in Uppsala called “Limits of Life” that was divided into two sessions.
Understanding Your Limits
The first session was called “Understanding Your Limits”, where topics covering iGEM, burnout, stress, mindfulness and general tips of balancing your life, no matter what background you might have, were presented. To this session we had invited 3 different speakers, starting with Will Wright (iGEM ambassador), Marie Åsberg (professor emerita at Karolinska Institutet) and Jonas Nielsen (member of Uppsala iGEM 2018). Mr Wright introduced what iGEM is to the mixed audience and explained what challenges every iGEM team encounters no matter what field they may work within, considering the stress factor, and tips of how to avoid them by"

Science café at MIRAIKAN,Tokyo
We participated in science café held at National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (http://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/) on 11th, Oct. Science café is a party opened for ordinary people to mingle with science-related people over a cup of tea.
This time, the theme was “~Artificial life and cells~ the future of synthetic biology ”. Early in this year, group of scientists succeeded in synthesizing Mycoplasmic genome chemically, which made the definition of life more and more vague (Gibson et al, SCIENCE 329:52 (2010)).
We shared our views with the participants whose age ranged from 12 to over 60, and this was a nice experience. This is because we thought the field of synthetic biology become more ethically difficult, and we have to reconsider how we are going to approach toward synthetic biology.

Preparation of AI-2
Pure AI-2 is very difficult to harvest or synthesize. However, as a quorum sensing messenger, AI-2 is present in intercellular medium in considerable amount. In this project, AI-2 was indirectly harvested by obtaining cell supernatants at different time points of cell growth. Glucose was added to the growth medium as it promotes AI-2 production significantly (Liang Wang, 2005).
A colony of E. coli W3110 was grown overnight in LB for 16 hours at 37°C . The overnight culture was then diluted in LB plus 0.8% glucose to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.02. The cells were incubated at 37°C  with shaking at 225 rpm in 500ml Erlenmeyer flask. Cell aliquots were removed at each time point for measurement of the OD600. The measured values were shown in the following table:

As was discussed in Promoter characterization part, MerR protein, in the form of homodimer, binds to a dyad sequence between the -10 element and -35 region of element PmerT. The binding, however, is independent of the presence of Hg (II). When the apo-MerR dimer binds to the dyad symmetrical operator DNA between the -35 and – 10 elements of mercury inducible promoter, PmerT, which has an unusually long spacer of 19 bp, the contact of RNA polymerase is sloppy. When Hg (II) is available in the environment, ions bind to the interface of MerR dimer. The Hg-bound MerR dimer can result in a structural distortion of PmerT, allowing the RNA polymerase tight contacts to be made, leading to the expression of down-stream genes (Fig.1).

Our team has created a virtual reality which allows everybody to have access to a synthetic biology lab. Also, it makes possible to teach in an easy and comprehensive way what SynBio is and how it works.
Help a registered iGEM team from another university in a significant way by characterizing a part:
We developed a satisfactory collaboration with Norwich team, by testing their plant-expression constructs in our lab. They sent us their Mo-Flippers, which allow to convert our Golden Braid assemblies to BioBrick standard. Aditionally, we will be participating along with the Cambrige team in the plant workshop in the Jamboree!
Our team and Tuebingen team joined forces and made a modelling collaboration , as they are working with the same inductor as us.
We also participated in small surveys in order to help a bit other teams, as we consider any help given is valuable.
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM):
PhiC31 (BBa_K1132009) has been proved to work in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. It has been also codon optimized for its use in plants in order to improve its function (BBa_K1742004).
ePDZ (BBa_K1470005) has been tested in plants bound to AsLOV, with good results.
Achievements
﻿Design of a synthetic biological circuit that acts as an eukaryotic decoder able to produce 2N outputs in response to N inputs. Results: Circuit
The circuit is genetically controlled by applying only two different light wavelengths inputs due to the implemented optogenetic elements.
The circuit has memory. It is able to ‘remember’ sequential light inputs in order to obtain the desired output due to the implementation of phage recombinases.
Capable to process the information remotely according to people specific needs thanks to the use of light as inducers .
An in silico approach of the biological decoder that has allowed a wide understanding of the   key control elements for a proper functioning of the circuit. Results: Modeling
Identifying the key components which are critical in order to get the desired response of our device:   fast enough recombinases, good light sensing of optogenetically controlled switches.
Exploring conditions to improve the performance of our circuit, reducing the time"

Using BLAST, a sequence alignment was ran using Yen’s sequence and the one Anuved used.  The results showed no significant sequence similiarity. Upon looking into the sequences, it was found that our original gBLOCK was designed from the PDB file, which was from the paper 2.  The most recent, which may be the one from Yen, is this paper "
Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#InternalCellular_-_-_TEXT.html," to act as a standard two-component signalling pathway. These types of systems have been characterized by well established mathematical models in the past (Chen, He and Church, 1999) (Ingalls, 2012).
More specifically, our model hypothesizes the following process, represented visually in the video below.
  1. Ethylene diffuses into the cell, and binds to EtnR2.
  2. The EtnR2-Eth complex phosphorylates EtnR1.
  3. Phosphorylated EtnR1 (now activated) binds to DNA, forming a DNA-EtnR1 complex.
  4. The DNA-EtnR1 complex activates the ethylene response promoter and transcribes the AmilCP gene.
This pathway seems to be plausible, since EtnR1 has confirmed DNA-binding activity. For more evidence supporting this hypothesis, see Sense .
View the video for a visual representation of our hypothesized signalling mechanism.
Signalling Kinetics
In cell signalling, molecules (called ligands) bind to their receptor sites which triggers a conformational change in the receptor. This results in a change of function. These ligands bind to their receptors with varying rates and affinities depending on the molecules involved.
These rates of binding are crucial, as they determine how fast the biosensor responds to the ethylene it is detecting. Low rates will lead to low expression (no blue), and high rates will lead to high expression (lots of blue).
We model these rates using the Law of Mass Action kinetics. This principle governs that the rate of a reaction (d/dt) is proportional to the concentrations of the substrates.
For a particular reaction, for example:
the rate can be written mathematically as:
But most biological reactions are reversible, like this:
So when we want to model the rate of reaction we have to take this reverse into account, by adding an extra term.
Applying these principles to the phosphorylation of EtnR1 and EtnR2 yields:
So, what are the values of these ""k"" numbers?
The answer is we don't really know all of them. So we take a few guesses. Our model begins and ends with these k values. If the output of our model matches that of the experimental, then we know that the k values we have guessed below are correct, and that the overall system behaves as hypothesized.   Before we can do this, we have to consider the downstream processes of our biosensor (transcription, translation) and ensure that these processes have been modelled correctly.

Genspace,2016,Team:Genspace#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," will turn out the way we wanted tomorrow. The plates will be viewed tomorrow as well.
7/28/16:
Objective: Checking transformed cells, completing linearized backbone, and making yeast media
NEB 2.1 digests of the backbones (1A3, 1C3, and 1K3)
PCR cleanup
Reviewing transformed cells
Positive worked, negative worked, other colonies exist in other plates but it's taking awhile for those colonies to take in the fluorescence
Made yeast media
Discussed Stony Brook collaboration
Gel was ran with the digests of the backbones
Results: The plates came out to be ok. It took the colonies a while to turn red. On the good side the positive and negative controls worked. The gel for chloramphenicol and kanamycin came out good. But the ampicillin did not have the correct base pairs.
7/30/16:
Objective: Receiving and working with materials from Stony Brook
Transformed plasmid into competent cells (top10)
Gave Stony Brook materials for our experiment for replication of our experiment
Confirming they have same results
Began liquid culture of Stony Brook yeast (BY4741)
Results: First collaboration with a different iGem team. This fulfills one of the gold medal requirements.
Week 6: July 31 - August 6
7/31/16:
Objective: Continuing to work with Stony Brook materials
Created 4 aliquots
Took 1 colony that had been transformed with plasmid and turned into liquid culture yesterday
Result is significant amount of colonies, possibly not right amount
Results: First collaboration with a different iGem team. This fulfills one of the gold medal requirements.

Objective: Cloning Biobricks, Re PCR-ing linearized backbones (ampicillin only), performing colony PCR on plates from 7/27/16, and making yeast competent cells
Transforming Stony Brook yeast into competent cells
Received Zymo Prep Kit competent cell and transformation protocol
Performed colony PCR on plates from 7/27
Result lacked orange color, thus performing another colony PCR
PCR’d linearized pSB1A3 plasmid backbone
Introduced to g-blocks and cloned RFP, AAVLEA3, and pSB1C3 backbone
Results: Received g blocks from IDT and we can now start the iGem project by re suspending those g blocks. The ampicillin backbone from the other day did not turn out great so therefore we"

Outreach activity workshop with year 12 students at the sutton trust summer school Thursday 28th July
UCL iGEM does Outreach:
Last Thursday Michelle, Amandeep & Abbie presented to a group of year 12 students about synthetic biology, iGEM and ageing (and even got invited back to present later this month)! We encouraged discussion throughout the lecture and it was great to teach them a little bit too.
We then proceeded to have two debates: one focussing on ageing, another on synthetic biology.
The arguments were eloquent, well thought through and focussed on aspects such as the economic, ethical and even emotional impact of this research. The debate was particularly poignant at times and the students all had their own opinions which we encouraged the discussion of. We were not only impressed, but inspired by their enthusiasm and the feedback we received. Especially now some of the students want to get involved with iGEM and even study biochemical engineering- a degree they previously didn't know existed.
Outreach activity workshop with year 8 students at the sutton trust summer school Friday 29th July
Friday was another day of presenting for us 3- this time to year 8 students - we gave them an insight into ageing in London and again encouraged participation. After our talk we again set up a debate in which the students represented one of the following stakeholders:
'Business person wanting to build a gym', 'scientist wanting to build an ageing research institution', 'doctor wanting to build a walk-in clinic' and 'the council wanting to build a community centre'.
Again, great arguments were constructed which considered the negatives of the other parties as well as the strengths of their own. They considered the different types of job prospects, ethics and short vs long term investments. We were particularly pleased with the vote outcome in which the students favoured a research institution to be built.

Oxford University (who have entered iGEM for the 1st time this year), hosted a meet up for UK teams at the start of the summer. It was an excellent follow-up to SULSA, as we were able to meet teams from across the UK and Ireland (this year also marks the first entry of an Irish team, from University College, Cork).
The event consisted of some excellent and inspiring talks by Jaroslaw Bryk, Richard Kelwick and iGEM president Randy Rettberg. Afterwards, all the teams got together for an informal chat and poster session where there was some excellent sharing of ideas and general discussion about Synthetic Biology. It was a great way to do a little friendly brainstorming with other teams before everybody’s projects really got underway. The event culminated in a tour of the beautiful town of Oxford.
Café Science Extra
Café Science Extra is a series of events where up and coming scientists present their research to the public over a cup of coffee. This was an opportunity to engage the public with our project and to get more feedback. The presentation allowed us to introduce the public to the iGEM competition, Synthetic Biology, genetics and Cystic Fibrosis. To aid our presentation some props were used to illustrate how CF patients have difficulties to remove mucus from their lungs compared to non-CF people. The event was well attended and livestreamed! Two members of the wet team presented for 25 minutes followed by another 25 for Q&A. The entire team attended the event, which was a great support, and also allowed questions regarding our device to be professionally and accurately answered.

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#ScienceSam_-_-_TEXT.html," you should should get on it. Twitter was useful for networking but I wanted, as a communicator, to reach people not in science. I wanted to change attitudes and perceptions of scientists. I wanted people to see us as friendly and normal people that they can talk to when they read sketchy news. Now they can ask an expert who seems like a friend. So I asked myself, where are the rest of people, where are non scientists? They’re on Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube. Instagram has a longer half life per post, so your post will continue to gain likes for a week while a tweet is dead like 10 seconds after you post it. And I find with tweets too, it can be difficult to summarize everything in 140 characters. Exactly! I’ve had debates with people on twitter and they go sour so fast. You’re being so brief so you’re really blunt. While on Instagram I’m doing video, and nice pretty pictures and long explanations where I’m commenting back. There is just so much room for personality. I’ve never had fights on Instagram. But I have on twitter. It just escalates so quickly in 140 characters. So would you say your audience is non scientists? On Instagram, not necessarily. I don’t know the exact demographics but anecdotally I have a lot of scientists, a lot of inspiring scientists like undergrads and high school students and they reach out often. Like me haha No! you have stuff figured out, you don’t need me. But the high school students need guidance. I get a high school student messaging me every few days. That’s great! And there are non-scientists that come across because I try and give the angle of fashion and trendy and cute and aesthetics. My pictures are cute so I try to pull in the non-scientists and through my friends friends [pulls in non scientists through friends-friends]. So it’s split pretty evenly I’d say.So when you started 3-4 years ago kind of getting into science communication, did you have a science communicator that you looked up to or aspired to be? Was there anyone in your life that inspired you to start sci comm? I had a lot of people encouraging me but in terms of people I wanted to emulate, not so much. Which was kind of the point. Not that I haven’t been inspired, of course I have. I grew up on Bill Nye, I love Bill Nye, I think he’s great. But now I see the way he interacts with people and I’m not a fan of it and I also think it’s a bit"

Basic Assumptions
Our solid model has several basic assumptions that are indispensable.
I. A colony-to-grid representation in a 200×200 mesh grid (one grid represents a cell colony) is good enough to simulate bacterial growth in a real medium. (See Overall Discretization )
II. The time it takes for AHLs and nutrient to diffuse into surrounding grids and meet concentration balance is very short compared to the time for cells to grow into colonies. [2] (See Placement Rules )
III. We suppose decomposing rate of AHLs and utilization rate nutrition are constants, and decomposing rate is relatively high compared to growth rate of cells. [3] (See Placement Rules )
Overall Discretization
In the first place we do spatial and time discretization. The whole medium is discretized into a 200×200 mesh grid, and valid space for living is a disk inscribed on it with a radius of 100. Using assumption I , we set each cell colony (abbreviated as ‘cell’ in following sections) into a corresponding grid to represent its presence. In software simulation, we keep three matrices of 200×200 size to record the amount of cells, nutrient and AHLs in each grid, respectively.
Meanwhile, the whole time we take to cultivate cells is discretized into 1,200 iterations. After each iteration, the number of substances in each grid changes according to certain rules (will be discussed in following sections).
Placement Rules
When we place a cell onto a corresponding grid, concentrations of substances in adjacent grids also change as a result. We apply assumption II to develop a set of synchronous placement rules: (1)The event of placing a cell triggers concentration incline in surrounding grids synchronously (2)Cell’s influence keeps unchanged in subsequent iterations as long as the cell exists.  (3)Removal of a cell has inverse effects.
According to assumption III , concentrations of AHL and nutrient will decline in each iteration if their generative sources are removed.
Different types of cell affecting different kinds of substances are illustrated below:
Placing Farmers
When placed, a farmer will eject nutrient to surrounding 5×5 grids, and the amount of nutrient in each grid will increase by 1. Then the amount of nutrient will hold on until the farmer is killed. When a farmer is removed, the amount decrease by 1.

Researchers and the public
General interest in the reasons for people to work in synthetic biology lead to the first of the following question. Insight in the goals of synthetic biology can help in defining the fields were possibly more regulation is needed. One of the problems in science in general is the way to communicate research to the public. It gets even more difficult when controversial subjects raise ethical issues that might be hard to understand without any scientific background knowledge. Should the scientific community inform the public about every detail, or is the material to complex to communicate? Should ethical questions be dealt with together, or should the scientific community self-regulate and decide on dilemmas without informing the public?

The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models to simulate and predict the process of biological systems. Our team established two models simulating the process of sweeteners binding on T1R2-T1R3 receptor and the process of sweeteners signal transduction in GPCR pathway. After that we designed and improved our biological systems based on the simulation results.
We developed our models for the following four main purposes:
1. Simulate different sweeteners how to bind on receptors.
2. Build a structural model to provide us with a solution for retrofitting and designing Gα.
3. The establishment of the GPCR signal transduction model gives us a better understanding of the sweetness signal in our system.
4. Simulate the relationship between sweetness signal and RFP fluorescence intensity and define the relationship between sweetness and fluorescence intensity.
Our structural model used the method of homology modeling on the SWISS MODEL server and then used AutoDock for molecular docking. The GPCR model was established by the reaction kinetics equation (RKE) of each signal transduction process. We used MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we obtained the relationship between sweetener concentration and fluorescence intensity of our biological system.
System Overview
Our goal is to detect the sweetness of the sweeteners by retrofitting the GPCR signal transduction pathway in yeast (Cen.PK-1C).
The structure of TIR2-T1R3 (Picture from：Molecular mechanism of sweetness sensation)
In order to make the signal more accurate and reliable, we established T1R2-T1R3 receptor structure model and took aspartame, glycyrrhizic acid, stevioside and so on with its docking. And we got the binding sites of different sweeteners with T1R2-T1R3 receptor.
The design of sugar hunter
As you can see, this is a simple line model for our biological systems. We can divide it into four modules: the T1R2-T1R3 receptor module, the nucleotide exchange reaction module, the MAPK kinase module, and the RFP expression module.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," about synthetic biology was rather restricted. Most people associated it with man-made biology or just something that they need to know nothing about. Based on this, we really thought that there was a need to increase knowledge about synthetic biology. We didn’t leave this on the level of thought, as we tried to raise the level of knowledge by talking in university lectures, in a biology olympiad training camp, and by telling about synthetic biology in magazine and radio interviews. In the beginning, we didn’t really understand how scary and strange a branch synthetic biology seems to be for people not involved in it, but during the project we started to understand this. It is probably also one reason for why investors are not so easily attracted to projects related to this branch - they don’t know enough about it. Our team participated also in a bioeconomy seminar hosted by VTT, where this subject was brought up. It was discussed that communication really is the key when trying to create business in this field, and that researchers should learn how to communicate about this seemingly outlandish field to the general public. For this reason, too, we see a huge need to spreading knowledge, and we hope that in some years, it will start to show.
Besides gaining information about the need of synthetic biology outreach, we wanted to see what people know about blue green algae and if it has caused problems for them. All of the interviewed people were familiar with it but didn’t know much about the health or economic problems it causes. Still, as each of the interviewed people had encountered blue-green algae, it means that our project can touch their lives and possibly to facilitate their life in the future.
We didn’t change much in our project topic itself based on the interviews but we increased the importance of talking to the public. Additionally, as we learned how restricted the knowledge about our topic is, we have been able to adjust our presentations better for the targeted audiences. Some of the most important modifications we did in our presentations to people with limited biological background was dismissing almost all scientific terms, assuming no background information, focusing on what we can achieve with our project instead of the exact methodology, and leaving more time for questions. One result of our efforts to communicate with the non-scientific community was our project introduction video “Matti and the cyanobacteria”, found on our Project page.

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Customizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," overhang are complementary and can be ligated together. Each silk monomer was modified via pcr to have one of these overhangs at the 5’ end of the sequence and another at the 3’ end of the sequence.  One version of our silk monomer had an A overhang at the 5’ end and a B overhang at the 3’ end, which we called (5’)AB(3’).  Another version was (5’)BC(3’), and the final version was (5’)CA(3’).  We therefore end up with 3 versions of the same silk monomer.   Making these modifications for all of our different types of silk monomers potentially gives us the ability to assemble a hybrid silk gene composed of different monomers in a matter of hours.  Following restriction digestion of all our monomers  with BsaI  to create the sticky ends, each silk monomer would be able to ligate to the preceding piece due to the complementing 4bp on their ends.  For example, if we wished to ligate a MaSp 2 monomer to a (5’)BC(3’)MaSp1 monomer, we would simply add a  (5’)CA(3’) MaSp2.   With the 3 subsets of MaSP1 and MaSP2, we could eventually program gene sequence of desired physical properties with various ratios and orders of each monomer type.
A key aspect of ICA is that the gene to be assembled is fixed to a solid support as it is being ligated together.  Streptavidin beads act as the solid support in this case.  Conjugating our gene to the beads therefore necessitates an “initiator oligo”, a biotynilated  sequence that contains both the biobrick prefix as well as one of the A,B, or C overhangs at its 3’ end.  An advantage of fixing our growing sequence to the beads is that it allows us to remove all traces of the previous ligation in a “wash” step before adding the next silk monomer to the growing gene.
Fig. 4: Immobilization of the initiator to magnetic beads. Figure from Briggs, et al. [5]
When dealing with repetitive sequences, regular assembly techniques would give products of various lengths due to the uncontrolled ligation among pieces. Another powerful aspect of ICA is that it increases the frequency of producing a full-length sequence that we intend to build. This is achieved by adding capping oligos that ligate to a chain where"

1. Catalytic Biomolecule Library - in the form of nucleic acids or cells that encode a particular catalytic biomolecule library.
2. Reagents for biomolecule production - described with more details in later sections.
3. Substrate Nucleotides - the target for catalytic biomolecule. It can be attached to any of the four dNTPs . All four different nucleotides can be used in order to record the activity information using 4 different substrates.
The goal of the catalytic biomolecule is to recognise the substrate and catalyze a particular chemical conversion which depends on the substrate and biomolecules type. In many cases such conversion helps the substrate to detach from the nucleotide. Such detachment can be achieved by the first catalyzed reaction or subsequent spontaneous reactions that follow the initial one.
Please see the Methods and Protocols section for a more detailed description of microfluidics techniques.
Proof of concept
As we have already chosen a combination of esterase enzyme and a substrate nucleotides, our initial encapsulation consisted of following:
1. Esterase mutant library created with the help of in-silico modelling.
2. In-vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) mix for catalytic biomolecule production.
3. Substrate Nucleotides (N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphates) as the targets for the esterase enzyme.
How such encapsulation looks can be seen in the video below (Video slowed down 2000x):
After the encapsulation each droplet on average contains single copy of a mutant DNA sequence from the Esterase library. Also every droplet contains the same amount of IVTT reagents and Substrate Nucleotides. We call these droplets the Substrate Droplets.
After encapsulation, does every droplet contain only a single DNA fragment from the library?
In order to ensure the fidelity of the data collected using CAT-Seq only every 10th droplet houses a DNA template after droplet generation. If the concentration of DNA molecules in the starting encapsulation mix is too high, the likelihood of encapsulating multiple mutant templates per droplet increases drastically. Such events disrupt the data acquired by CAT-Seq or any droplet microfluidics technique. Encapsulation events can be precisely described by Poisson distribution:
P(X = k) is the probability for the single droplet to house k DNA molecules. λ shows the average number of DNA molecules per droplet.  For example, if you want"

SensiGEM - A biosensor database
   We decided to collaborate to answer these questions. Since our initial meeting in London, members of each team have conferenced weekly on Skype. After accustoming ourselves to the eight hour time difference, we developed SensiGEM, a collaborative database in which we catalogued all the biosensors in the history of iGEM.
Before studying the past Wikis, we realized that we had different definitions of biosensors. We asked each other a fundamental question: What is a biosensor? We developed the following definition: A biosensor is an engineered system that relies on biological systems or components to detect and report a condition. The condition(s) detected and reported could encompass an environmental, biological, chemical or synthetic aspect or compound in the sensor’s environment or surroundings.  Once agreeing on the nature of biosensors, we split up the Wikis from 2007 onward between Calgary and Paris-Bettencourt. We analyzed 936 project Wikis from 2007 to 2013 by hand, incorporating the projects which matched our biosensor definition into the collaborative SensiGEM database. We included 229 projects on
the database, some of which were biosensors as per the definition, as well as other projects containing biosensor elements that aligned with our definition.
We designed this database with future iGEM teams in mind, with tools for efficient navigation biosensors according to inputs, outputs, and their intended application. We made both SensiGEM’s source code and underlying data available under the permissive MIT license. This means that other teams can either collaborate with us on our version of the database or host their own independent copies. We foresee SensiGEM as a resource where future iGEM teams can showcase their biosensors.
Lessons from SensiGEM
   We conducted some preliminary analysis of the database in SensiGEM to see how our projects stand in the current iGEM biosensor landscape as well as to get an overview of what types of biosensors have been developed for iGEM"

$$ P_{FP}' = \frac{1}{1+\frac{\alpha \sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}} \tag{9}$$
From our experiments, we estimate α$=452$. In the case of no amplification, we can set α$=1$. The amplification step improves the reliability of the system from 10% up to 40-95%, even in the case of higher mismatch tolerance ($\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$)
Figure 8: Reliability of a positive output for crRNA 1 to 4 on the genomes of four organisms. Reliability of positive output as represented by the ratio between the probability of a true positive output (blue) as compared to a false positive output (orange). Simulation with $\Delta C=0.30$,$\Delta I=0.85$. We take into account a 452-fold amplification of the on-target signal as a result of the gene amplification and in vitro transcription. For each crRNA, the different bars represent the E. coli genome, S. aureus genome, S. epidermis genome and Bos taurus chr. 27 from left to right respectively. The reliability of the system is improved from less than 10% to 40 to 95%.
As such, gene amplification and sensitivity not only increase the sensitivity of the detection method, these two steps in sample preparation also reduce the probability of false positive results and thereby increase the reliability of the detection system. We can now simulate $P_{FP}^\textrm{'}$ for different ratios between on- and off-target cleavage probabilities, and determine the amplification factor required to achieve reliable detection above a desired threshold $\beta$ (Figure 9). Analytically, this amplification factor can be calculated as follows by setting $P_{FP threshold}'=\frac{1}{\beta}$:
$$\alpha_{required} = \frac{\beta}{1-\beta} \frac{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}} \tag{10}$$
We can see the reliability of the system increase as a function of α for different rations $\left( \frac{\sum_{on}\mathcal{R}}{\sum_{off}\mathcal{R}}\right)$ and can read-off the amplification factor required to achieve an input that"

Calgary_Ethics,2008,Team:Calgary Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,", environment and technology), future potential and an example for each of these aspects of synthetic biology. However  for us its less clear what the level of understanding and knowledge and views  around the ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) issues attached to synthetic biology are from various groups involved or very likely to be  involved in synthetic biology.
The main aim that synthetic biology strive to achieve is to make life better by securing resources, increasing production, protecting the environment, making new drugs/medicine, improving technology with a different and new touch than what has been applied before to achieve the same goal. We feel that this aim can only be achieved with a strong embedded ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) analysis of proposed and envisioned projects.
We  the University of Calgary's iGEM ethics team do not see the evaluation of the  ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) issues  as a means to devalue synthetic biology work or to question the work from fellow iGEMers and others but we see our work as providing knowledge that should enhance the work of fellow iGEMers and others by adding to a constructive discourse that can only improve the chance of synbio for being seen in a positive light and for the synbio products and processes envisioned to reach their full potential    During our work this summer, we collaborated with two wetlab teams of iGEM 2008 to evaluate the practical application and acceptance of their project in the society, and we were not surprised to find how many concerns they had related to ethical issues of biosafety, biosecurity, environmental effect of their engineered organism, how society will take their product, effectiveness, cost and benefits.
So one of the main focuses of our project was to understand where the general public stands in terms of their awareness about the current application of synthetic biology, what they think synthetic biology's potential is. Most importantly we strived to find out their expectations of synthetic biology and their fears/concerns  with the purpose  to convey their message to the synthetic biology practitioner community. Our approach was such that while asking them questions, we tended to encourage them to go out and search for information/literature themselves about current approaches without making any biases.
So are they ready? - The answer is neither yes nor no. We found that many times a ""technological manipulation"" was being identified both as ""scary"" and ""beneficial"" by a single individual at the same time. So where they stand is in a maze of confusion. The literatures in scientific terms is  not easy for a"

Proof of concept——Mini GRE
Circuit construction
To explore the feasibility of MINI-GRE by combination of promoters and terminators as we mentioned above, we designed four promoter-terminator pairs, and constructed four different report circuits for them (fig. A)
For circuit 1, we pair promoter CYC1 with terminator CYC1, which are among the most commonly used native promoters and terminators and also have a relative medium strength in yeast.[4] For circuit 2, promoter CYC1 is paired with terminator MINI. The MINIp-CYC1t and MINIp-MINIt, respectively, serves as the chosen pair for circuit 3 and 4.
For convenience, we named the“CYC1p-yECitrine-CYC1t-mStrawberry-CYC1t”as“CC”,“CYC1p-yECitrine-MINIt-mStrawberry-CYC1t”as“CM”,“MINIp-yECitrine-CYC1t-mStrawberry-CYC1t”as“MC”, and“MINIp-yECitrine-MINIt-mStrawberry-CYC1t” as “MM”,hereafter.
Fig. A the plasmid map of our circuit CC, CM, MC, MM. The CC circuit includes the commonly used native promoter CYC1 and terminator CYC1. The MM circuit includes the combination of MINI promoter and MINI terminator.
Results
For each circuit, the strength of promoters was characterized by yECitrine, a kind of yellow fluorescent protein was used to detect the output level of particular promoter, terminator or promoter-terminator pair. And the red fluorescent signal from RFP mStrawberry can represent the relative read-through efficiency of particular terminator in the circuits including the same promoter.
While monitoring the growth rate of four strains containing different expression regulatory devices, we also characterized the expression strength of the promoter-terminator pairs by detecting the fluorescence intensity of yECitrine in each circuit. As we can see in the bar chart, the ratio and relationship of the signals from 4 circuits become relatively stable at the early stationary phase, which hints that the expression level may reach the"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"), the range that KillerRed does not. There is a β-barrel present in both these proteins. A water-filled channel that is in contact with a chromophore area and located at the cap of the said β-barrel is thought to confer these proteins with their phototoxic capabilities (Pletnev S et al, 2009).
Fig. 5 Structure of KillerRed showing the open channel which allows contact between the chromophore and the solvent.
The mechanism by which ROS kill cells isn’t completely understood. However ROS have been shown to have various detrimental roles in cells such as the oxidation of thiols, ascorbate and proteins containing (Fe-S)4 clusters as well as reducing various transition metals (Farr and Kogama, 1991). Prolonged exposure and or high levels of ROS triggers apoptosis like mechanisms (Held, 2015).
Our metabolic kill switches build on previous iGEM projects which have used the expression of highly phototoxic  fluorescent proteins to kill the cells by exposing the culture to light. In 2013, the iGEM team from Carnegie Mellon developed a phage delivery system of the KillerRed gene, which was then expressed in the infected bacteria, killing it on exposure to light. Carnegie Mellon 2014 continued characterisation of KillerRed and its monomeric form Supernova by analysing their photobleaching characteristics. Neither team tested the longevity of the kill switch or provided details on the light intensity that the cultures were exposed to. We aim to quantify the length of time for which the kill switch remains viable and provide absolute values for the intensity of our light source.
Firstly we improved KillerRed, an existing registry part, by codon optimising it for E. coli and  improved its characterisation by exposing cultures expressing the protein to previously untested light intensity. We designed and submitted KillerOrange as a new part and tested it in the same way. We compared the phototoxicity of KillerRed and KillerOrange to the commonly used Red fluorescence protein (RFP). This was to determine how phototoxic KillerRed and KillerOrange are in relation to RFP and if prolonged excitation of a commonly used fluorescent protein is deleterious to bacterial growth. Once we had established the efficiency of KillerRed and KillerOrange, ministat chambers were  inoculated with samples of each to determine the robustness of the kill switches over time.
Method
The following samples were tested for phototoxicity by exposing them to 1.2 mW/cm2 of white light from a 4x8 LED array (Fig. 6) for 6"

Part 3: THU-E Bitter Defender Part
This is a plasmid providing selection pressure for the evolution and enrichment of  tryptophan overproduction microorganism phenotype by defending the toxicity of  tetracycline. This selection pressure was based on the tryptophan dependent tetracycline  antiporterexpression which functioned in tetracycline culture condition.It is  achieved by cloning E. Coli tetracycline  antiporter gene (tetA) downstream of  our previously constructed tryptophan biosensor which wascontrolled by tac  promoter in pTrc99A vector. Three different RBS (RBS-ori (RBS upstream of wild  typeE. Coli tryptophanase(tnaA) operon),  RBS-30 (B0030), RBS-32 (B0032)) were placed upstream of tetA gene.
Previously  engineered E. coli with different  tryptophan productivity (trp000, trp007, trp015 with the overall  productivity as 0, 0.07, 0.15g/L, respectively. unpublished data) were used to test the performance  of this part. The tryptophan productivity of each strain wasmeasured, andit was clear that transformation of the  engineered bitter defender parts didn’t significantly influence original  strains’ tryptophan relative productivity according to Figure.3.
We thus tested  these three parts’ performance by measuring the growth rate of these nine  strains (three kinds of strains with different tryptophan productivity carrying  three kinds of selection pressure plasmids. They were named after trp000-30,  trp000-32, trp000-ori, trp007-30, trp007-32, trp007-ori, trp015-30, trp015-32  and trp015-ori, respectively) in different tetracycline concentration.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#thermo_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 16 shows the illustration of ABTS oxidation by TTHL with time compared to the negative control. The increase in ABTS oxidized proves laccase activity even if a direct comparison with the original and not immobilized laccase solution was not possible due to the very low concentration of purified TTHL.
Substrate Analysis
Figure 17: Degradation of estradiol (light green) and ethinyl estradiol (dark green) with the different laccases after 5 hours without ABTS. In the graph it is shown that the bought laccase TVEL0 which was used as positive control is able to degrade more than 90 percent of the used substrates. None of the bacterial laccases are able to degrade ethinyl estradiol without ABTS but estradiol is degraded in a range from 16 %(ECOL) to 55 % (TTHL). The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The measurements were made to test if the produced laccases were able to degrade different hormones. Therefore the produced laccases were inserted in the same concentrations (3 µg mL-1) to the different measurement approaches. To work with the correct pH value (which were measured by the Team Activity Test) Britton Robinson buffer at pH 5 was used for all measurements. The initial substrate concentration was 5 µg mL-1. The results of the reactions without ABTS are shown in Figure 17. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (blue) and ethinyl estradiol (red) are indicated. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 30 °C. The negative control was the substrate in Britton Robinson buffer and showed no degradation of the substrates. The bought laccase TVEL0 which is used as positive control is able to degrade 94.7 % estradiol and 92.7 %  ethinyl estradiol. The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 35.9 % of used estradiol after five hours. ECOL  was able to degrade 16.8 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 30.2 % estradiol. The best results were determined with TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus). Here the percentage of degradation amounted 55.4 %"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Executive#_-_-_TEXT.html," include securing grant and private investment funding for research and development and a thorough market analysis. By year three we plan to secure one million in investment from venture capital funding as we bring our first product to market. Finally, by year five, we hope to reach a break-even point as we begin to expand into international markets.
Our overarching goal is to develop a biosensor technology with clear advantages in the oil and gas industry that can revolutionize how current testing is performed. The technologies we are leveraging to build our biosensors have immense potential as platforms, giving them flexibility to respond to changing market trends, industry needs, and new market verticals.
Company Description
FREDsense Technologies focuses on the development of novel, field-ready electrochemical detectors for oil sands applications. We are a product and Research and Development company based out of Calgary, Canada, focused on synthetic biology and electrochemical biosensors.
Our flagship product is a general toxin electrochemical sensor for use in water quality testing. The system involves the use of an electrochemical detector unit with a cartridge system to which water samples are added. This represents a renewable income stream, as customers must continuously purchase new cartridges for each sample tested. Our unique bacterial strain senses the presence of various toxins and reports if the sample has a high enough threshold toxicity to be of concern.
Our principal market is within environmental consulting and monitoring, specifically for the oil and gas sector. However, the general toxin sensor is a first generation product that will allow us to move into various markets over time, with applications in the environmental, health, and even manufacturing sectors. Next generation products will include related sensors for a variety of other compounds of concern for environmental toxicity and industrial processes, including sensors for naphthenic acids and hydrocarbons.
We have developed a technology with distinct advantages compared to competing products. The components of our system are cost effective, reducing the cost per unit to our consumer while maintaining valuable profit margins. Secondly, our technology is a rapid detector that is faster than any other system presently on the market. This is a significant competitive advantage, particularly as market conditions evolve to meet more stringent and dramatically increased regulatory requirements for the number of monitored sites.

Red light Sensor
The red light sensing domain consists of two genes. The first gene encodes the information for the phycobilin synthesis. Phycobilin is a red light sensitive chromophore which is assembled in the light sensing domain of the cph8 transmembrane protein. The chromophore is essential for the functional light sensing activity. The other gene encodes the fusion protein cph8. Cph8 is composed of two original different encoded proteins. The light sensing extracellular subunit cph1 and the intracellular envZ part. EnvZ phosphorylates and activates the ompR-regulator. The phosphorylated ompR induces the gene expression of the following gene, in our case the SupD-tRNA.
Outlook
Our vision beyond the proof of principle of this project could be to fixate bacteria inside the gelrite which could express collagen and hydroxyl apatite instead of a dye. Following we can generate bone material directly in the block without any further scaffolds. After protein synthesis and secretion one could simply peel off the gel and get a bone imagined and “drawn” with the light.
Since easy artificial production of human tissue and bones is still a difficult task, we think this approach could be a way to overcome certain problems in the field of tissue engineering. Assumed that all bacteria left over have been removed or at least destroyed. We would expect less immunrejection because the material does not show any surface antigens as other mammalian material does. Subsequently, the bone could be coated with cells of the recipient and a complete bone structure could have been created.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"yzae. Several studies have shown that expression of heterologous genes in some cases can be largely increased (15). The effect of the codon optimization could potentially be measured by comparing expression levels of the optimized and the original gene.
Fig 4: - Working hard on our transformants.
Cell wall structure and GfaA
The choice of building materials is always based on a set of parameters like strength, weight, thermal conductivity, durability, and price. Fungal materials are typically lightweight, good thermal insulators, have a good compressive strength (16), and in the context of Martian settlement, they could likely be made comparatively cheaper than building materials brought from Earth. Long-term durability is still somewhat an open question - especially in the context of Martian use. Biodegradability, which is a potential issue on Earth, is not a significant problem on Mars due to its extreme environment, thus suggesting that long-term stability might be achievable.
Fungal materials have shown to be sufficiently strong to make structures and various fibreboards. Given the lower gravity on Mars, fungal structures should be able to sustain themselves. We have models which suggest that fungal materials might also be able to sustain the internal pressure of habitats, yet it seems that making the materials stronger would be a desirable phenotypic characteristic to attain. Research suggested that the gene gfaA might be of interest having materials in mind. The structural strength of fungal cells walls comes from $\beta$-Glycans and chitin. gfaA encodes for a fructose-6-phosphate transferase that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthetic pathway, the immediate precursor of chitin (17).
Studies have shown that after induced cell wall stress in A. niger, there are higher levels of gfaA mRNA present and that this is accompanied with higher levels of chitin deposition in the cell wall (17).  We theorized that over-expression of this enzyme in Aspergillus oryzae might lead to a higher-than-normal chitin content of the fungal cell walls and hence, hopefully, stronger materials.
Colors and selectable markers - AmilCP
Finally, we have also been working on with the amilCP gene . amilCP encodes a blue chromoprotein and exhibits strong blue color when expressed in E. coli, and we wanted to use amilCP constructs as a reporter system to test transformation success of different fungi.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Silver Medal Human Practices
iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices page .

German teams' proposal
iGEM teams gather at Munich!
At the end of May, Julia Menzel and I (Lara Schmitz) went to Munich as representatives of our iGEM team to meet members of 11 iGEM teams from all over Germany. The weekend started with an official welcome by the iGEM team Munich and we heard a really interesting talk from Prof. Dr. Friedrich Simmel from the TU Munich. After that, we had a get-together with a barbeque to get to know the members of the other iGEM teams. Because of the good weather and the nice people we had a great evening with a lot of fun.
The next day, all teams had the opportunity to present their projects. Most of the projects were really interesting; some teams were working on really intriguing topics. A discussion was held and the teams voiced their suggestions and comments about the projects of others. The day was wound up with a nice dinner at a typical Bavarian beer garden.
On Monday, the last day of our trip, we had some free-time to explore Munich, visit the English Garden and relax a bit. Along with people from the iGEM teams Darmstadt, Freiburg and Saarland, we visited the Marienplatz in Munich and had lunch with them. After that, we joined the meeting at the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) with a focus on Synthetic Biology with international speakers. We were one of six teams which had introduced our project to the audience in another brief talk. After that, we were really tired and took the last train back to Göttingen. But because the ICE had a delay, we missed our connecting train leaving us stuck at Fulda thereby compelling us to stay for a night in a hotel. This"

Jacob Toth I am a biochemistry student at UBC going into my second year. I joined iGEM to get involved in the world-changing field of synthetic biology, and I am very excited about our project! Outside of science, other interests of mine include playing my violin, studying philosophy, and enjoying nature. My roles on the team include preparing two versions of the 1,8-cineole synthase gene to be put into yeast to be over expressed and working with the ArcGIS program to model the spread of the mountain pine beetle when treated by our products.
Laura Bain I have many loves in life including snowboarding, windsurfing, sailing, biking, gardening AND Biology! I am pumped to be on this year's iGEM team because we are a diverse bunch and have so much to learn from each other! I am very enthusiastic about biology and people so it is a natural fit for me to be spearheading the Human Practices project. I am keen to engage the community in discussions about synthetic biology in non-traditional ways: Creative art projects, videos, forums, roadside chats. Also, It is especially exciting to be partnering with Science World in mentoring and educating Vancouver high school students. We hope to inspire these teenagers to pursue future opportunities in Science and maybe even a 2012 Vancouver Highschool iGEM team!
Graduate Advisors
Alina Chan I am a PhD student in the Hieter lab utilizing yeast as a model eukaryote to study the connection between chromosomal instability and RNA processing. This is my second year with the UBC iGEM team and I'm super excited that the team is using yeast to produce monoterpenes. My main wet lab role is to train team members in the art of working with yeast and help with general troubleshooting, experimental design and wiki design. I also advise the modeling and human practices sub-teams by helping them set objectives and integrate our wet lab experience into the models and outreach. Additionally, I'm responsible for the yeastie comics and xtranormal videos on the wiki. Boston, here we come!
Rafael Saer I am a PhD student in the Beatty lab, studying the ramifications of aliphatic side chain mutations on the rate of primary electron transfer events in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers. This is my second year being a Graduate advisor for iGEM.  My purpose in the team is to provide advice during the meetings as well as troubleshooting assistance"

In order to get those datas, the prototype would display a restricted amount of information and the website would be fully accessible only when the survey is filled. This ensure the degree of data filling. Other ways include offering visibility and advertising from partners.
We met Mr Pujol and Mr Rémondet: “Scientific officers” at HBC to enlighten us on all questions concerning GMOs. The HCB is responsible for informing the public decision. It advises us on all matters of biotechnology, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs). During this interview, we presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get advice to improve our presentation. We particularly discussed about some techniques to do “GMOs” accepted by the laws by using New Plants Breeding Techniques. They also help us to place our project in a GMO category for the society security. To finish, they encourage us to continue to be engage with farmers and consumers because they will helps us to integrate SofterShock in the society.
Mrs Roure is an economist, chair of the Committee """"Safety, Security and Risks"""" and Ministry of Economy in France. The goal of this meeting was to discussed about the place of synthetic biology in the current economy context. Our interview with Mrs. Roure was at the beginning of our iGEM adventure! She helped us build our human practices and advised us to address certain point such as the toxicological study or the sustainable soil development. We also discussed a long time about the killswitch system and she gives us some idea to develop one. Mrs Roure has been very helpful for this aspect of the competition. She found us many contacts in order to have the the best expertise for our project.
Plant protection conversation at UIPP with Mrs Eugénia Pommaret - 09/12/2017
The goal of this meeting was to talk about the plant protection and specifically on the regulation and the communication around the agricultural world. This company called IUPP worked on the development of good practices for farmers. Eugénia Pommaret the executive director of UIPP (union of industry for the protection of the plant) met us in order to help us in the elaboration of our project softer shock. She advised us to look at the European regulations because it will define what our biological solution is"

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," casing of the hairdryer had been removed. We placed a heat sensor inside the tin to measure the temperature of the air inside the machine.  By wiring the heat sensor to the arduino we were able to receive input/feedback from the sensor and adjust heating of the device to maintain our desired setpoints. We were able to regulate the heat of the machine and CHIP now thermocycled.
At this point, we tried to perform our first PCR reaction, unfortunately we soon found that we had melted our tube. We learned that the machine had difficulty with evenly distributing the heat, since the tin foil was a rudimentary cover with holes punched into it without a proper understanding of what these holes would do to the heat distribution(see picture below). To better distribute the heat we removed our tinfoil lid and replaced with with a soda can. This can was designed with evenly spaced holes enabling for better heat distribution. Although we did not and still have not modeled the heat transfer of between the can's surface and the convection heating generated by the hair dryer, we were able to experimentally conclude that the heat distribution was more even across the can than the tin foil. For a better understanding we are currently in the process of modeling the heat transfer within the can to better design the apparatus.We are also in the process of milling aluminum with certain specifications in order to better regulate heat transfer.
After construction of the can based cover we tried PCR once more and still found that the reaction did not occur. We assumed that the heat sensor might have been an issue,; the sensor was exposed to the convected air and was relaying information about the air temperature instead of the temperature inside of the PCR tubes. This meant that our feedback system was not accurately responding and controlling the temperature inside of the PCR tubes. Assuming the temperatures inside the machine were not representative of the temperatures inside the PCR tubes, we put the heat sensor inside a PCR tube with mineral oil and placed this inside one of the holes. We ran another PCR reaction, ran the products on a gel and saw a large band of the correct size, indicating that CHIP worked.
Problems and Current issues
We have had one successful amplification with our machine however we understand that repeatability is a vital component of all lab work and currently we are attempting to make our device repeatable. From our early days of testing we found that peltier units were not powerful enough to enable PCR tube to reach 95 degrees. Although conventional PCR machines use these units frequently they are often specialized and tailored made to perform PCR. With this tailoring comes a high price tag that does not suit the DIY"
Paris_Liliane_Bettencourt,2010,Team:Paris Liliane Bettencourt#Project#Population counter#model_-_-_TEXT.html," kdiff = 8.10-2
In the following figure, we show that it is still possible to count the number of pulses thanks to the number of recombined bacteria, although it might become uncertain. Nevertheless, it seems that we can still choose a threshold of AHL beyond which bacteria should be designed to luminesce. For instance, if we wanted our timer to stop at 4, then a threshold of 0.70 in standardised unit seems reasonable.
Figure 3: Switched bact., AHL, LuxI for T2 = 120 and kdiff = 2.10-2
Although we have been able to count six pulses thanks to the previous graph of AHL, it is not always possible to do so. For instance, if we shorten the time between two pulses, decreasing the diffusion coefficient, then it is no longer possible to distinguish pulses:
Figure 4: AHL for T2 = 100 and kdiff = 10-3
Achievements of our model
Our model gave us a better understanding of the dynamics and helped us explain and suggest experiments a posteriori. Together with the results of the experiments, we may be able:
to have a better determination of some parameters such as caracteristic times for recombination and their statistical distribution, which we can then plug in;
to set up parameters in a way that allow us to count with RFP, or to make a timer thanks to AHL and GFP. Those parameters are for instance the speed of the flow in the microfluidic device, the dimensions of the microfluidic device, the initial number of bacteria or the viscosity of the medium fluid.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#HP-content_-_-_TEXT.html," day ended with a science slam in which we presented our project in an entertaining way and actually won first prize - which we consider to be a positive sign for the future of synthetic biology at our university.
Our Intern Benjamin
In August, we had a visitor in our lab for two weeks. Benjamin, a pupil from a local school, had decided to expand his knowledge on synthetic biology and biotechnology. He proved to be very keen to learn new things and to become a valuable (albeit short-term) member of our team. Here is how he evaluates his stay with us:
“During the past two weeks I did an internship at the Institute for Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics of the TU Braunschweig. It was unique in several ways: I had the opportunity to look over the iGEM team members’ shoulders, to ask questions and I could even contribute to their project by carrying out some smaller tasks. These two weeks were eventful and exciting for me and I do not regret investing part of my holidays for them. I got a great insight into biotechnology, especially the lab work.”
And although he may be a little too young for iGEM, he still acquired a taste for the idea behind the competition:
“Concerning iGEM, I am particularly fascinated by the fact that the project is in the students’ hands from start to finish and that they can get so much out of their contribution. Maybe I will also take this direction later and take part in the competition… Lots of luck to the Braunschweig iGEMers and I keep my fingers crossed for E. cowli to eventually be able to degrade methane. THANK YOU for the great internship!”
Survey on Eating Habits
""Could you imagine changing your nutrition such that there are no more dairy or beef products on the menu to reduce the output of greenhouse gases?""
Recent reports show that the public interest in vegan diets is on the rise [1]. Indeed, if more people forwent consuming beef and dairy products, methane emissions caused by livestock farming could be drastically reduced. In order to get further insight into the public’s willingness to change their diet for the sake of the climate we conducted a survey - before the revelation of our project, so that they would not be influenced. The exact question was: “Could you imagine changing your nutrition such that there are no more dairy or beef products on the menu to reduce the output of greenhouse gases?” The results are shown in the diagram at the left.
Even confronted with the possible consequences of their consumption of dairy and beef products, most people were not willing to change their nutrition for"
