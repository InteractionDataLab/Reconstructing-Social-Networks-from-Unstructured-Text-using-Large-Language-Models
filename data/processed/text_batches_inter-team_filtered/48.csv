Pneumosensor Module Description
Overview
Pneumosensor primarily adopts the quorum sensing pathway components in Streptococcus pneumoniae to detect populations of S. pneumoniae. The main     advantage of this system is its detection specificity- the Gram-positive quorum sensing mechanism is incorporated into the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli to     eliminate possible cross-talk of the autoinducer molecule, competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) with native E. coli molecules.
There are two modules to our Pneumosensor- the Detection Module and the S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module. The Detection Module comprises of the CSP     receptor ComD, its response regulator ComE and the promoter PcomCDE which is induced by phosphorylated ComE. The σx Promoters Module involves a     highly specific reporting system, whereby σx is associated with RNA polymerase and binds to promoters PcelA and PcomFA which     are specific to σx for activation. These promoters then drive the expression of GFP as a reporting system. Another protein, ComW, is expressed alongside the     σx as its stabilizer against proteolysis.

Detection Module Description
Figure 1. Detection Module Diagram
CSP released by S. pneumoniae is detected by its receptor ComD, which autophosphorylates at the expenditure of ATP. ComD~P then phosphorylates         ComE. ComE~P then induces the promoter PcomCDE, which drives the expression of GFP.
Transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, like many other species, depends on specialized state called competence.      Competence is achieved during the exponential growth stage of pneumococcal culture by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), which is a 17-     residue long pheromone that is species-specific"

Self Regulatory Module
Self-regulatory module is designed to repair the inefficiency of system due to formation of inclusion body. Inclusion body is formed from aggregation of misfolded protein caused by overexpression of LC Cutinase protein (degradation module). Besides being inefficient to the system, inclusion body may also kill the organism because it gives a cytoplasmic stress to cell.
When inclusion body occurs, inclusion body inducible promoter (PibpAB) will active and the expression of TetR repressor will take place. This TetR repressor then corresponds to TetO in degradation module and inhibits the expression of LC Cutinase protein. This inhibition effect will eventually decreasing the inclusion body present in the cell and improving the system efficiency.

Meeting of Young Minds Debate Proposal
This October, the Rathenau Instituut (in collaboration with the African-European iGEM organization committee) will stage the Meeting of Young Minds Debate 2012, in which young people representing the worlds of science, the public and policy making will come together to debate around the topic of synthetic biology and society.  Our proposal (‘A synthetic biology future, a synthetic biology crisis’) is one of two themes selected for debate.  For more on the Meeting of Young Minds debate, see here .
Collaboration with iGEM Bielefeld
This year we had an opportunity to collaborate with the iGEM Bielefeld team which is also working with laccase enzymes, although Bielefeld is working on laccase from several species. iGEM Bielefeld kindly sent their laccase from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). As we are working on laccase from W3110, we welcomed the opportunity to compare our enzyme activities using the same protocol. Bielefeld team’s laccase seem to have higher activity in comparison to ours. This is due to the fact that our laccase is periplasmic, whilst theirs is extracellular, therefore more of it can be found in the supernatant after centrifugation. For more details about the assay used to determine laccase activity and the results obtained, please see the following link: http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K863005:Experience

Introduction
In yesterday's lab session the products from the PCR reactions on the C0, V1, V2 and V3 samples were purified. The gel electrophoresis carried out on the unpurified samples the previous day showed hazy bands however it was uncertain that these bands were the promoters or just primer-dimers. Today, we aim to carry out DNA gel electrophoresis on these purified samples (in 1.5% agarose gel) to determine whether any PCR amplification reactions worked.
Preparing samples and DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The purified PCR products were treated in a similar way to which DNA samples are treated in the gel electrophoresis protocol except 5ul of each sample was extracted and to each of these 1ul of loading buffer (dye) added. 15ul of HindIII' ladder will be added in the first and last wells of the 1.5% agarose gel. This is how the wells will be organised:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = 15ul of HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = 6ul of C0 (Sample 1)
Lane 4 = 6ul of V1 (Sample 2)
Lane 5 = 6ul of V"

Dr. Sarah Gray
We approached Dr. Sarah Gray and her lab for safety and lab etiquette advice, as the lab bench we used was adjacent to theirs. As we spent our time working in a shared lab space we used Dr. Gray’s expertise to translate proper lab etiquette to our team. This information helped us work safely and efficiently in the lab, especially for the team members whom were not familiar with research lab safety."

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," acidifies the vacuole [46,47]. The difference in electrochemical potential for protons across the tonoplast, generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase and AVP1, can then be      used by vacuolar transporters, e.g. AtNHX1, to pump ions into the vacuole [46,48,49].
Resulting from that, there will also be a compensatory transport of anions to maintain electroneutrality [50]. Through expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPi- ase AVP1 in yeast it       is possible to increase the translocation of protons and anions over the tonoplast and thus acidify the vacuole [44]. This increased proton-influx leads to more cytosolic Na+ being       sequestered inside the vacuole via the NHX1 exchangers and in general leads to a higher solute accumulation through H+-syn- and antiporters [40,39,43]. This shows that the vacuole       acidification through AVP1 plays a key role in facilitating vacuolar Na+ sequestration [51] and increases the concentration of cations in the vacuole [39].
Fig.10: AVP1, together with AtNHXS1 leads to an increased sequestration of sodium in the vacuole. This system is added to the altered native one
We have integrated the gene AVP1 together with AtNHXS1 into the yeasts vacuolar membrane (Figure 10). Together with the changes we carried out in the native transporter system of S. cerevisiae this can be described as an expanded and optimized sequestration model to maximize the salt concentration in the yeast and remove it from the wastewater. You can compare the salt       uptake of different combinations of transporters we integrated into S.cerevisiae in our results page. We also compared the salt tolerance of the different mutants because       this is a good indicator for the functionality of our laboratory work and model. Before we integrated the different combinations of channels we created a mathematical model of our       system to determine the maximal amount of salt our system can take up.
Following our intensive Integrated Human Practice work, we realized that contamination of wastewater through salts is not restricted to Na+ and Cl- but that ions like K+ and SO4-       lead to problems, too. Read more about the negative effects of these ions in our integrated HP section. Potassium contamination is discussed in the section about the Werra while details about       problems with sulphate can be"

[ more news ]
Here you find our considerations on the following topics of biological safety for our project:
1) Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
a) researcher safety?
b) public safety?
c) environmental safety?
2) Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
a) did you document these issues in the Parts Registry?
b) how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
c) How could other teams learn from your experience?
3) Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
a) If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
b) If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
4) Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Answers:
In general:
To assure safe working practice throughout the competition, every team member participated in a general safety meeting regarding good laboratory practice and working with genetically modified organisms (GMOs), including storage and disposal. We work only with non-hazardous, non-pathogenic organisms like Escherichia coli (lab strain XL1 blue) and Bacillus subtilis (W168). We follow the safety regulations that apply for the biological safety level 1 classification.  That means we wear lab coats and single-use gloves.

New PCR product using the RBS insertion primer and the Reverse Primer from above (only prefix end shown)
This PCR product was ligated into a backbone and transformed into E. coli again and confirmed with sequencing to be ready for Promoter Primer PCR.  To add a promoter in front of the RBS, a promoter primer previously developed for our own project was used since it was compatible with the Prefix/RBS site.
Final Mambalgin Sequence with regulatory RBS and Promoter regions inserted
This PCR product was ligated into a backbone and transformed into E.coli one last time and confirmed with sequencing. After all of this was accomplished, we sent a sample of this new plasmid to GSU and assisted them in the protein characterization process. The collaboration effectively created mambalgin expressing E.coli in a much more time and cost-effective manner than via traditional digestion and ligation or 3A assembly. Our RBS and Promoter PCR Primer Design and PCR eliminate the need to buy constructed sequences and the success of insertion can be confirmed quickly via gel electrophoresis.

During the summer the Georgia Tech iGEM team aided in critiquing the Lambert High School iGEM team’s presentation for the manufacture of chitosan, which helps preserve fruit and vegetables from spoiling rapidly. On two different occasions, our research team oversaw the Lambert iGEM team’s presentation, helping them improve their presentation format, style, and slide orientation.
Our Team's Wiki Czar also contributed to the design, formatting, and HTML coding of Lambert High School's Wiki. Just three days before the iGEM 2014 High School Wiki freeze, Lambert High School's wiki was difficult navigate and with formatting and a color palette liable to give the reader a headache if stared at for too long. All of this was alleviated over the next 3 days as our Wiki Czar and the Lambert Team coded together to create a wiki that really captured the value of their work and that they could proudly display at their own iGEM Jamboree.

""The important thing is to never stop questioning. "" - Albert Einstein
I decided to take part in iGEM because I think it is one of the best education for our students. It is a rewarding personal and professional experience for students but also for supervisors. iGEM is the opportunity to develop a whole multidisciplinary project with students from different scientific backgrounds and so a great human adventure. My aim was to enable this group of students to develop their own project by contributing my experience on different aspects (scientific, project management, seeking funding) while leaving them a large autonomy in order for them to acquire their own experiences and to improve their skills.

""A man's value to the community primarily depends on how far his feelings, thoughts, and actions are directed towards promoting the good of his fellows."" - Albert Einstein
My conception of school is a place where students are more motivated to learn than teachers to teach. I noticed that last summer .. thus all is said about my motivation as a teacher. As a scientist, synthetic biology is a wonderful domain where creativity is endless. Synthetic biology may be an essential source of progress related to environmental and societal impact along with ethical and philosophical concerns, which is closely connected to Albert Einstein's vision and my own scientific one.

To further understand what parameters could make the system oscillate, we did bifurcation analysis on the Hill parameters. What we had to do was find the critical points where the system can nearly oscillate but a little disruption may lead to a steady state.
Depicting all those critical points, as shown in the figure, the system could oscillate when cellB's Hill parameters were located in the  area named Bistable.
The figure right is the phase trajectory of two signal molecules in environment,  the more it looks like a circle, the more steadily our system will oscillate.
Our system oscillates when parameters were selected in the area named 'Bistable'
By adjusting certain parameters, we saw that the oscillation’s period and phase could be controlled properly, which is the most impressive character of our system. Here we present a figure that the oscillation phase was adjusted by adding araC, which could induce the pBad promoter, in cell type B. After adding araC to our system at certain time, the oscillation was interrupted at beginning, but could gradually recover and finally, the phase was changed.

Dimensionless Model
In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, and sensitivity of parameters, we further simplified the model to make them dimensionless. In addition, we tried to introduce feedback to  our system and made a brief analysis on different types of   feedback we introduced. Some analyses were similar to the simplified  DDE model, and you can see more details by clicking read more

Quorum Sensing Effect
What we have analyzed so far is focused on two-cell oscillation. Quorum-sensing oscillator is not simply a matter of expansion in magnitude, but a matter of robustness in allowing difference of each individual cell. Moreover, we test the adjustment of phase and period of oscillation in this part.
As we all know, no two things in this world are exactly the same, so do cells. The major differences between individual cells that we take into consideration include:
●Each cell's activity of promoter is varied, so each cell has different rate to generate AHL.
●The initial amount of AHL may be disproportionally distributed among cells.
The rate of generating AHL is closely related to parameter m and n. Therefore, we introduce randomness to both parameters by letting them obey normal distribution, that is:
m(i)= μ1+N(0,σ1);
n(i)= μ2+N(0,σ2);

Figure 8 and Figure 9 shows the process of comparison of two models mentioned above.
In Figure 8, the tendency of the two curves is very similar. However, in Figure 9, when two models are linear treated, the slopes are quite different. We will improve the method of parameter sweeping, hoping that two models will be more similar.
After comparison, we finally determined the value of parameters.

Figure 10 shows the tendency of Ptet Strength Kinetic Model. Here the value of incubating time is constant value.
Figure 10 shows that when the expression level of tetR reach 1.5, expression level of cjBlue will have a great change. Then its expression will be repressed. Here we assume an ideal situation that tetR won’t degrade or be secreted. The expression level of tetR is regarded as independent variable.
However, the expression level of tetR is regarded as intermediate dependent variable. After superposition of the models, a graph shows different colors in different concentration of intracellular cadmium ion which reflects the effect of our system as follow.
Figure 11
Figure 11 shows the tendency of PcadA Strength and Ptet Strength Kinetic Model. Here the value of incubating time is constant value.
Figure 11 shows that when the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion approximately equal to 0.75 μmol/L, the system will reach the color transition point (from blue to red). Its color change interval approximately equals to 10^(-0.4)~10^1.4 μmol/L.
For the whole system, two 3D graphs shows the situation of the color change more vividly and scientifically.

For example, DelC is unable to activate synT 1 but activates synT3, whereas svp activates synT1 but is unable to activate synT3. Note also, that activation of synT3 by EntD results in the highest amount of indigoidine production among all the combinations shown.
As a comparison between the left and right panel of Fig. 8 shows, PPTases working best with one T-domain might not lead to any indigoidine production when used with a indigoidine synthetase containing a different T-domain ( Fig. 8 , pink line, delC). In addition, as distinctly visible in Fig. 9 , indigoidine production over time is not a strictly monoton function (blue line). After an indigoidin production peak at 16 hours, indigoidine production caused by indC containing the synthetic domain 4 decreases again. The indigoidin production in cells transformed with indC/synthetic T-domain 3 is still increasing.
Figure 9: Indigoidine Production Varies Among Engineered Indigoidine Synthetases. The absorption spectrum of liquid cultures expressing engineered variants of the indC indigoidine synthetase were measured for 30 hours. The graphs show the OD590 of indigoidine in E. coli liquid cultures over time. The absorption of the cell suspension has been subtracted (see OD Measurement in the Methods section). The red graph relates to an E. coli TOP10 negative control, the green graph depicts the indigoidine production of an indC variant, in which the T-domain has been exchanged with our synthetic T-domain #3, whereas the blue graphs refers to synthetic T-domain #4.  The amount of indigoidine reaches a maximum before it drops again. This is due the instability of indigoidine, which is reduced to its fluorescent leuco-form under the influence of reducing agents, light and high temperature [6]. The local absorption maximum at 590 nm (keto-indigoidine) decreases after 15-25 hours, whereas the absorption maximum at 430 nm (leuco-indigoidine) increases (data not shown). Note that the maximum level of indigoidine differs among the engineered indigoidine synthetases.
Engineered Indigoidine Synthetase is More Efficient than Native Enzyme
After applying the domain border combination A2 (see Fig. 6 ) to all T-domains we inserted to the indC gene, we"

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," sensitivity of △sst2 strain to α factor will be increased. Meanwhile the larger antibacterial circle will appear when the amount of α factor is reduced.
(3)The far1 of △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 is knocked out successfully, and this strain will still keep growing under the effects acted by α factor and antibacterial circle will not be shown either.
Conclusion： Because far1 can make cellular period stop at the G1 stage by  α factor and sst2 can reduce the intensity of the transmitted signal. So we want to knock out of  far1 and  sst2.From the above results we can see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain will be inhibited by  α factor. With the increase of the concentration of the alpha factor,the radius of Antibacterial circle increases and the inhibitory effect of the growth of the strain was enhanced. And more obvious. Knocking out of  the sst2 gene, making the strain respond to α factor enhanced.
The growth curve
The impacts acted by the various concentration of α factor to the growth of the bacteria immersed into liquid.
The research of the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the growth of Cen.PK2-1C,  △sst2 of CEN.PK2-1C.
The plan and method
The gowth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains were determined by measuring the initial rates of α factor at concentrations of 0-15 µM . We take out 5ml cultivating bacteria liquid of each of them during  30h and correct them by the YPD solution which not inoculates yeasts after  shake culture. We obtain the value of OD600 at position of wavelength of  600nm by UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
The results and discuss
(1)With the increasing  concentration of α factor, the growth curve of CEN.PK2-1C is inhibited by α factor.
(2)the growth curve of △sst2  is bit lower than CEN.PK2-1C. It’s strongly inhibited by α factor.
Conclusion：From the above results we can see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain will be inhibited by  α factor. With the increase of the concentration of the alpha factor, the inhibitory effect of the growth of the strain was enhanced. And more obvious. Knocking down the sst2 gene, making the strain respond to α factor enhanced.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html,"The overall result is random movement in the absence of a chemical gradient, and           movement towards or away from a chemical when a gradient exists (3).
The response of E.coli to environmental signals is achieved by intercellular reactions. Chemo-sensing is carried out by a broad repertoire of chemoreceptors. Most have a N-terminal  region that spans the membrane twice, which results in an intertwined periplasmic domain that  can sense an extracellular signal. The C-terminal cytoplasmic region comprises a HAMP region (that connects the extracellular sensory domain with intracellular signaling domains), a dimerization domain and a kinase domain  that interacts with its RR (3)
Ligands bind to the periplasmic domain of the chemoreceptor, at the interface between the           two monomers of the dimer, with residues from both monomers being involved in the binding           process. Ligand binding alters the interactions between the periplasmic domains, and           between the transmembrane dimer (3).
The cytoplasmic region of the chemoreceptors interacts with two additional proteins - CheA and CheW, to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals.            The activation of the receptor by an external stimulus causes auto-phosphorylation in the histidine kinase ,           CheA. CheA, in turn, transfers phosphoryl groups to residues in the           response regulators CheB and CheY, which are cytoplasmic proteins. CheW is an adaptor protein, physically bridges CheA to the chemoreceptor to allow regulated phosphor-transfer to CheY and CheB. CheB (methylesterase) regulates the chemoreceptor methylation state. It works oppositely with CheR, a methyltransferase. When an attractant is bound to the receptors binding domain –  the chemoreceptor is methylated by CheR. Then, CheY transmits the signals to the flagellar motors. The phosphate in CheY is continuously removed by CheZ. The short life time of phosphorylated CheY means that the bacteria are very responsive to changes in attractant concentration. This mechanism of signal transduction is called two component system , and is common form of signal transduction in bacteria (1).

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," consists of less than 30 amino acids [3] and is recognized by the signal recognition particle upon translation at the rough ER, mediating cotranslational translocation of the nascent peptide chain into the ER. [4]
During this project, three different signal peptide constructs were tested in order to determine that resulting in the highest expression levels:
The EGFR signal peptide was taken from the iGEM parts registry ( BBa_K157001 ) and combined with a BioBrick containing the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
The BM40 and Igκ signal peptides were designed by us and synthesized with regard to adding additional spacing and functional elements to the 5'-UTR of the constructs, and combined with a BioBrick containing the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
The EGFR signal peptide taken from the parts registry is constructed such that the signal peptide ORF immediately follows the RFC10 cloning scar after the CMV promoter, thus resulting in a very short 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of transcribed mRNA. The combination of the CMV promoter with the synthesized BM40 and Igκ signal peptides allows for a considerably longer 5’-UTR – and can thus be made to contain a full Kozak consensus sequence by design. The Kozak sequence is recognized by the ribosome as a translational start site; if this element is missing or deviates from the consensus sequence, this may considerably decrease translation efficiency. [5] For the EGFR signal peptide construct, a Kozak sequence is not present, as it would have to precede the start codon ATG, i.e. the position occupied by the RFC10 cloning scar. Since both the distance from the promoter to the open reading frame and the Kozak consensus sequence are considered crucial parameters for expression levels [6] , BM40 and Igκ signal peptide constructs are likely to result in increased expression levels compared to proteins containing the EGFR signal peptide from the parts registry.
In order to predict whether our designed signal peptides would be functional, we used the SignalP server, which allows to make theoretical predictions about signal peptide functionality and cleavage. [7]

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," of scientists and industry professionals seek to create standard interchangeable parts from living organisms that might serve as construction units for the development of living devices that carry out functions not readily found in nature. In this case, the parts are natural (biological) but their arrangement and assembly are not (synthetic); so far the term has been well received and has become one of the most important branches within modern genetic studies (Benner & Sismour, 2005) . One of the greater promises of this new discipline is the ability to create gene networks that emulate digital circuits and devices. Through the use of an industry standard that enables easily exchangeable parts, scientists will be more able to “program and design” cells according to some of the basic principles of modern computing (Friedland, Lu, Wang, Shi, Church, & Collins, 2009) .
In the last decade a group of scientists defined a new standard for the creation of standard interchangeable parts in Synthetic Biology. Tom Knight from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory defined what he called the Standard Biobrick Sequence Interface. This initial Interface consists of a circular vector or double stranded DNA that contains the sequence of interest. This sequence is flanked by upstream EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites and downstream SpeI and PstI restriction sites. In order for the parts to be interchangeable, the mentioned restriction sites must be unique within the whole vector; this enables a simple two enzyme digestion to release the fragment and unite it with another one with a ligation reaction. (Knight, 2003) In 2006, Ira Phillips and Pamela Silver refined Knight’s Sequence Interface in order to prevent a change in the reading frame when ligating two Biobricks. The change in the interface was small, but it effectively reduced the mixed site that results from a ligation to contain only 6 base pairs instead of the 8 base pairs that resulted from using the first Interface. (Phillips & Silver, 2006) This new Standard Biobrick Sequence Interface has enabled a free exchange of DNA parts with the certainty that they are compatible with other Biobricks that use the same standard.
As a result of this standardization, the field of Synthetic Biology has begun to expand within the international scientific community. The results of one research team can now be easily shared with others enabling a fast growth within the discipline. Numerous countries and institutions have increased their support to synthetic biologists because of the great promise of the field and the applications it can have in the future.

Antimicrobial gauze ( Top )
As an alternative to our Bacto-Aid, our hybrid silk could be used as an antimicrobial gauze. The gauze could then be used for larger wounds and for wounds producing a lot of fluids. The fluids was a problem that Laura Jakobsen made us aware of, and the gauze could be a way of solving this. An addition to this idea would be to dip the gauze into the analgesic Ibumetin.
Soft implants ( Top )
Soft implants have been subject of interest the last couple of years. Here it has been suggested that spider silk could be braided in a structure and grafted to the bone Li, G., et al. (2015). ""Silk-based biomaterials in biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants."" Adv Healthc Mater, 4, 1134-51. . This would allow quicker healing of the bone and ensure the creation of proper bone structure.
Nerve scaffolds made of spider silk have likewise shown great potential. Usually bigger motor neurons will not regenerate if degraded or cut. Silk as nerves, could lead to the gain of motoric activity in extremities that could otherwise not be regained after major accidents Li, G., et al. (2015). ""Silk-based biomaterials in biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants."" Adv Healthc Mater, 4, 1134-51. .
Some types of silk have great mechanical strengths and they can therefore be used as an artificial ligament or tendon. The combination of silk with stem cells could allow cells to proliferate and differentiate into the proper type of cells. This could potentially make tendons and ligaments heal, a thing that does not occur naturally Li, G., et al. (2015). ""Silk-based biomaterials in biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants."" Adv Healthc Mater, 4, 1134-51. .
Textiles made from silk ( Top )
Silk could be used as a textile for surgeons or for patients with skin disorders. The spider silk is compatible with today’s sterilization process, making it possible to use silk for different forms of medical interventions. Already existing silk products have shown good results towards reducing the reaction of the disease in question Li, G., et al. (2015).

THE VALENCIA ETHICS SURVEY
This year, the University of Calgary participated in the ethics survey put on by the Valencia iGEM Team. The survey asked questions regarding understanding of what synthetic biology was, and general opinions surrounding ethical issues such as genetic modification and patenting. Along with some of the participants in our iGEM Summer Camp, we are the largest team to have all members complete this survey.
The medal we have earned from the Valencia iGEM Team is shown below, and the complete results of their survey can be found HERE .
While Valencia (and other teams) chose to explore the multiple viewpoints of SynBio issues through surveys, we decided to try a different approach: that is, an online conference done in Second Life. The accessibility of the online community in Second Life (as long as one has an internet connection), allows us to reach a large range of potential participants, similar to a survey. However, there are some key differences in these approaches, and they have been outlined HERE .

ThiE/GLF:
VG:All the colonies only grew on CMR, except for colonies 14 and 19, which grew on both AMP and CMR. The first twenty colonies that grew on CMR plates only were minipreped using the Qiagen protocol and the sequencing for GLF was checked using blast. It appeared that there was a high chance of GLF being in the pUC57 vector. Thus, we decided to digest GLF from the pUC57 vector and pSB1C3 with EcoRI and SpeI and trying another ligation.  0.5mg of the first twenty CMR only colonies from the INV/pSB1C3 ligation (Elaine) were digested with EcoRI HIFI and PstI, along with GLF (5) in pUC57 and pSBIC3. Colonies 9, 11, and 15 on the gel looked correct, showing two bands at 2000bp and 1600bp. They will be minipreped and checked further with EcoRI and SpeI digests, EcoRI digests only, and sent in for sequencing. The GLF digest did not show up on the gel. Thus, we will digest GLF again along with pSB1C3 and try a ligation.
AGP/INV:
Procedure: KNR was PCR amplified from pUC4K vector in order to produce a large amount of the cassette for use in gibson assembly of the AGP knock-out/INV operon. KNR was amplified from 1 ng/ul pUC4K using the AGP_KNR forward and KNR_petBD reverse primers and an initial annealing temperature of 57 degrees C.  Successful PCR was confirmed on 0.7% agarose gel. Gibson assembly was performed to construct KNR+petBD and petBD+INV, with the rational that either construct could be used to assemble the entire AGP knockout. Equimolar ratios of each part were used for both reactions, and the master mix was prepared as outlined by University of Cambridge. Gibson assembly products could not be verified by electrophoresis so PCR was performed on each reaction in order overcome the possibility of small reaction yields. Potential KNR+petBD was amplified using AGP_KNR forward and petBD_INV reverse primers and an initial annealing temperature"

Module 3: Genome Deletion Overview
Dam methylation
Restriction enzymes often come together with methylation enzymes to form a restriction-modification system.  This well-known combination prevents the genome of the cell from being cleaved by its own restriction enzymes.
There is a strong asymmetry between the function of restriction enzymes and methylases.  Restriction enzymes can cause just one cleavage, which if unrepaired, kills the cell.  However, to effectively protect the cell, methylases need to methylate all the recognition sites. There is a fine balance that exists naturally between rstriction enzymes and methylases which can be easily disrupted. This is why endogenous promoters are often preferred.
Methylation as a protection device against resriction enzymes is well documented, and has been proven to work.  In our system, to protect against DNA destruction due to basal levels of restriction enzyme production, we have made use of the native E. coli Dam methylase protection system.   The Dam system is chosen as both DpnII and TaqI enzyme activity can be blocked by Dam methylation.
Dam methylases recognise the sequence GATC and transfer a methyl group to the Adenine base.  This prevents the restriction enzymes from recognising the sequence and cleaving it.  Therefore, only high levels of restriction enzyme (ie. after thermal triggering) will cleave the DNA.

Plasmid amplification and cloning experiments for reporter constructs

To produce a reporter system, we needed to identify promoters from genes that are induced upon glyphosate treatment. Our hypothesis is that the promoter of trpE and trpP are induced by glyphosate, as described in the design section (TO DO, link hier einfügen!!!). Therefore, PtrpE as well as two variants of the EPSP-synthase (encoded by aroE were amplified by PCR using primers iGEM2018_25/26 and iGEM2018_27/28, respectively.

Bacteria found by the Maasstad burn wound center in burn wounds include Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococci, Pseudomonas (e.g. P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Enterobacter, E. coli, Serratia, Proteus, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter baumanii. However, not all of these are of equal danger. S. aureus is recently getting more problematic because of a surge in dangerous toxin-producing strains found in burn wounds. This is also what drew Dokter’s attention to our project. Other strains considered particularly toxic are Streptococci, Pseudomona, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. General, Dr. Dokter told us that Gram-negative bacteria pose a higher threat to patients than Gram-positive ones. The team also warned us that bacteria such as S. aureus growing in biofilms are particularly challenging to get rid of. They were thus very happy to hear that lysostaphin targets bacteria growing in biofilms.
Another problem recognized by the medical practitioners regarding the current treatment methods is the systemic use of antibiotics which increases the risk of resistance. To find out which bacteria contaminate the wound, they usually culture them. However, this takes four days, forcing the doctors to use systemic antibiotics to prevent the outbreak of an infection. As the systemic antibiotics used are not specific, this treatment contributes to antibiotic resistance while the treatment may not even be effective against the specific bacteria colonizing the wound. Once the results of the culture are known, a more specific treatment is selected. The medical team therefore believed it would be very beneficial if we could expand on our patch by integrating a sensing system, to secrete the appropriate type of bacteriocin only when the relevant bacteria are present. This would decrease the risk of resistance developed against our bacteriocins drastically. They said it would be great if we could include different types of bacteria secreting different bacteriocins in combination with a sensing system, as it would directly improve the treatment efficacy and prevent building antibiotic resistance.
We would like to once again thank Jan Dokter and the entire team of the Maasstad burn wound center for their hospitality and kind feedback. Inspired by some in-depth knowledge of the most problematic bacterial strains and the requirements for wound healing and encouraged by your positive feedback, we will continue our efforts to improve our design even further! 😊

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.

We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html,"0 = 0%): Green = 0.6, Cyan = (0.6+(p(t)/10)), Red = 0.6*p(t), Black = 0.6*p(t) + (p1(t)/10), Blue = 0.6*(p(t)^3).
As it can be seen in the video, the speed at which the bacteria travel is very similar. The red and green colonies, however, do not congregate as tightly around the source of food as the others do.
All the data and probabilities of tumbling when moving up a chemotactic gradient have been chosen without scientific grounding except educated guess-work after reading through the literature. If actual data could be obtained about our strain of bacteria, the parameters could be tuned to fit experimental findings. Therefore, another useful comparison is to look at how the bacteria move depending on the basic probability of not tumbling, chosen originally as 60% in our model. In the embedded video below the following colours have the respective probabilities of not tumbling: Green = 40%, Cyan = 50%, Red = 60%, Black = 75%, Blue = 90%.
As it can be seen, the blue colony finds the source far better than the others. The green and cyan colonies, however, find it hard to even locate the source in the given time. The red colony, which corresponds to our choice, does show some bacteria unable to find the source quickly. In our experience of watching E.coli under the microscope, however, some bacteria do take more time to find the source than others. Exactly which probability to use here is not an easy choice, although through experiments in the lab we hope to be able to decide upon a value with confidence.
Another parameter is how often the bacteria decide to check the concentration gradient. Last year's University of Bristol team used the figure of bacteria checking their concentration every three seconds, whereas after reading the literature and comparing papers we have decided to use a figure of once per second. This is because the tumbling rate in other papers seemed to be around one Hertz, or sometimes higher, and if they only checked their concentration every three seconds this level of tumbling could never occur. In the embedded video below the following colours correspond to the following times for how often the concentration is checked: Green = 3 seconds, Cyan = 2 seconds, Red = 1 second, Black = 2/3 seconds, Blue = 1/3 seconds.
As the bacteria are attracted to a chemical, in our case aspartate ions - which diffuse from a source into the surrounding water"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Techniques_-_-_TEXT.html," method, a model of the metabolic network is needed. These models are constructed based on experiments where reactions that occur in a cell are identified. Subsequently, the fluxes through a reaction can be given constraints. However, in practice this is not done very often, as it is difficult to obtain these constraints experimentally. We used two different models, the core model of E. coli, which consists of all the essential reactions of the metabolism and an extended model, the iJO1366 model, which contains 30 times more reactions and 25 times more metabolites [1].
Firstly, all the metabolic reactions of the model are mathematically represented in an m by n matrix, called the stoichiometric matrix (S). For instance, if we analyse a metabolic network that consists of the following two reactions:  $$ A + 2 \  C \ \rightarrow \ D $$  $$ 3 \ B \ \rightarrow \ 4 \ A $$  We get the following stoichiometric matrix:  $$ \boldsymbol{S} \ = \begin{bmatrix} -1 && 4 \\ 0 && -3 \\ -2 && 0 \\ 1 && 0 \end{bmatrix} $$  So, each row represents one unique compound and each column represents one unique reaction. The values in the stoichiometric matrix are called the stoichiometric coefficients. These coefficients indicate which metabolites are involved in a specific reaction, where the number represents how many molecules of the metabolite are involved in this specific reaction and it is negative when the metabolite is consumed and positive when the metabolite is produced. The stoichiometric coefficient is zero for every metabolite that is not involved in a particular reaction.
Secondly, a vector v is defined which gives the fluxes through all reactions part of the model. Thus, it has a length of n, as there are n reactions.
Thirdly, a vector x is defined which gives the concentrations of all the metabolites of the system, so it has length m.
The basic assumption of FBA is that the system is at steady-state, so that \(\frac{d\boldsymbol{x}}{dt}=\ 0\). Subsequently, the following system of equations is solved:   $$ 0 \ = \ \frac{d\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = \ \boldsymbol{S}\boldsymbol{v} \tag{2}$$  Because there will be more reactions than metabolites in any realistic large-scale metabolic model, there is no unique solution to this system of equations (there"

Once the presentations had finished, all group members met together and talked about what we thought about the other projects and how we could help each other. We had some very constructive talks for our projects and ourselves.
After the presentations, all members of the group went out to have dinner together. We took advantage of this opportunity to better know all groups and mostly to have fun. We even changed our seat in order to be next to different people and get know all of them better.
It was a fun night and we enjoyed with friends, even if we are different teams!.
On Saturday, Valencia UPV Team had a surprise. As we didn’t know the city, our friends from Valencia were our guides and told us a lot of interesting historical information and some ancient legends of Valencia (such as the bat logo of the city).
Another surprise was a picnic that the team from Valencia had prepared for all of us. It was a very nice surprise and the food was really tasty. That evening we enjoyed together playing different games and recording funny videos.
Last day was for farewells. Nobody wanted to go home.
We took advantage to enjoy the beauty of Valencia until the last moments, through the City of Arts and Sciences and the Malvarrosa beach with some friends from Valencia. Sadly, we had to say goodbye at the train station.
The 3 groups (UPO-Sevilla, UPF-CRG Barcelona and Valencia UPV) discussed constructively on different projects and applications and contributions to science. It was a wonderful way to collaborate and help each other. All projects were applauded and congratulated by the others. We felt really delighted and integrated when interacting with the different disciplines that make up a team, from biotechnologists and biomedical scientists or computer engineers, to a journalist.
Thanks to this meeting of different teams, we all made good friends and we are now a great family where everyone helps each other.

Informed Design
The goal of our project is to build a sensor for rapid detection of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) to prevent foodborne illness caused by these pathogens in water, vegetables and beef. This project was inspired by recent recalls of infected beef in Alberta and outbreaks in North America and Europe where water supplies and produce can become contaminated with these pathogens. At the early stages of planning we realized that the industry works reactively to search for E. coli in meat products after harvest. Initially, we brainstormed methods where we could supersede accepted methods such as PCR and bacterial culturing, but as we dived deeper into the problem our lack of understanding of how cattle get turned into the food on plates became apparent. We needed to learn how the beef industry works.  To inform our design, we sought out the people who work with cattle every day.
The Rancher
To start this dialogue, we spoke to Dr. Bob Church, a prominent Alberta rancher, researcher, and expert, who has helped bring genetic technologies into the livestock business. We asked him how cattle businesses operate and proposed some ideas to detect E. coli in beef. He answered our questions and spoke about the tremendous sensitivity for testing E. coli in beef. To remain competitive with current industry methods, we would have to sense five individual bacteria in about a pound of beef!
After this reality check, Dr. Church proposed a different approach that shifted the entire focus of our project. He told us to consider developing tools to monitor E. coli in cattle prior to harvest. We learned in populations of beef cattle, about five percent of the animals are “super"

Our last year’s project, which involved a meeting with the Delhi Govt., has been turned into a full-fledged collaboration and startup. Its components and prototype were patented as well.
We organised a Skype video conference between the iGEM teams of IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IISc Bangalore and ourselves. This pan-Indian iGEM meet involved 15-20 minutes presentation by all the teams. This was followed by a Q&A session which proved to be extremely fruitful for all the participating teams.
iGEM IIT Delhi conducted seminars and workshops on synthetic biology in IIT Delhi and various schools of South Delhi. These workshops were aimed at informally introducing the students to this field. ‘Just like you join together Lego blocks to create structures, you can join together genes to create new biological systems’ was the main theme behind most of our workshops as they were meant for people with very limited knowledge of this upcoming field.
We also presented our past and current projects at the various festivals of IIT Delhi such as Tryst. Tryst, IITD’s technical fest, is one of the largest and most successful technical festivals across India. It seeks to bring together the world’s leading scientific minds and budding enthusiasts and witnesses an annual footfall of over 40,000. Our team also gave a presentation at Open House, which is IIT Delhi’s annual research presentation and lab demonstration event featuring presentations from all the academic departments of IIT Delhi. Moreover, we ensured proper exposure of first year students to synthetic biology and its multi-disciplinary aspects by setting up a stall at the Tour of Stalls, IIT Delhi’s annual club orientation, which has an annual footfall of nearly 1000 students.
Apart from these, we have been conducting lab workshops to teach interested students basic lab work and techniques. We started by teaching them plating and pipetting followed by plasmid isolation .We gave them an overview of our project and its potential applications. The images of our microscopy experiment were shown to the students to introduce them to the beauty of synthetic biology."

Plant Rubbing & Making Ambers
we held the plant rubbing & making ambers activity in our campus in April 11 to 12 as the first human practice activity , trying to interest the public, especially children and let them know the fantasy of animals and plants with some sensitivity. We are glad to see hundreds of people participating in our activities and manufacturing their own linen pocket with plants rubbed on it and ambers guided by our staffs.
Plant Rubbing
We orginally put forward an idea to let chlorophyll or anthcyanin rubbed directly on the pockets. However, considering its possibility of degradation, consequently we decided to suggest participators applying the paint on the leaves. So we pick up some leaves from acertruncatum,metasequoia glyptostroboides,Broussonetia papyrifera and ginkgo biloba. The whole procedure goes like this: participators pick up a leaf they like and then apply some paint on the back of the leaf evenly and uniformly. After that, rub the plant on a linen pocket with hammer. Later, the leaves appears on the pocket. Some people decorate the different pigment on leaves and other draw a loving heart beside the leaves for their lovers. Well we explain to children about photosynthesis based on pigments like chlorophyll and light reaction system simultaneously. We hope they remember the knowledge of biology and enjoy the experience in Plant Rubbing.
Making Ambers
The 'making ambers' activity is held for making the public know the process of formation of natural ambers and triggering their interest in insects. We bought some insects specimen online with colophony prepared for drawing it. So we in advance melt the colophony and then direct the kids and parents to poiled the colophony into a glass bottle with a insect inside. After a while, colophony sodificated and amber was completed.
Many kids said they enjoyed playing with insects in spare time, intrigued in picking up and recognizing animals and wanted to get into the nature more. Thus, we sincerely hoped that our activity again motivated their impetus to discover more magical things in our world.

This bend will generally take a long time, and need to try more times technologically. Once the spleen is over, the most difficult part of the colonoscopy is cleared, and the next one should be affordable. When the scope is retreated, it is said that there is no pain.
Mission Three——Questionnaire in Shanghai & Ottawa
We designed a questionnaire for the quality of life of patients with colorectal cancer in conjunction with the European Cancer Survey and Treatment Tissue Quality of Life Center questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), trying to understand the living conditions of the survey population through some simple and easily measurable questions and does not touch patient privacy.
Fig 1.European Cancer Survey and Treatment Tissue Quality of Life Center Questionnaire
According to the 78 questionnaires we collected from Ottawa and 65 from Shanghai. We draw the following conclusions:
The physical condition of the Ottawa test population is better than that of the Shanghai area. Interestingly, the scores of the questionnaire related to dietary modules ofthe participants in the Shanghai area were better than those in the Ottawa area. We speculate whether this result is due to differences in dietary habits between the two regions. The diet in Shanghai is milder. Does it indirectly affects the incidence of intestinal diseases such as colon cancer? Due to the limited number of people we test, we don't know the result. I hope that in the future, big data analysis can tell us the answer.But at the same time, we have reason to believe that our indirect diagnosis of colon cancer by ultrasound examination of bubbles will have wider recognition and significance in North America.
Acedemia
After we decided to choose the direction of colon cancer diagnosis, we interviewed Zhang Shiyi, a professor who is engaged in the research of colon cancer and cancer prognosis. We hope he can give us some advice in a specific direction. After Professor Zhang Shiyi listened to our vision of the project direction , he gave us such guidance and impressions:
There are many approaches to the current treatment of colon cancer, but the treatment effect for advanced colon cancer is not ideal. The key to colon cancer prevention is not to focus on advanced conditions doing hard treatment, but how to find them earlier. The team members need to understand more about the current diagnosis and treatment methods later, and then consider whether you can focus on diagnosis rather than advanced treatment if"

Genomic fragments worked well, but longer backbone fragments mostly failed.
Extractions of DNA from these gels failed almost completely. Will try purifying directly from PCR products next time - results may not produce such a high purity of the precise DNA we want, but the increase in yield should outweigh this problem.

We were asked questions about distribution methods and our timeline, and people were excited to hear about the potential impact of our project.
UCSC Bioethics in the 21st Century: Science, Business, and Society
As is tradition for UCSC iGEM teams, we presented our project to the UCSC summer session class Bioethics in the 21st Century: Science, Business, and Society. The purpose of the presentation was to explain our project, gather feedback on the ethical implications, and inform students on campus about iGEM. Prior to speaking to the students, we considered potential ethical issues with the project, such as cultural differences regarding attitudes towards contraceptives and biosafety of engineering the Yali genome. Our presentation included a brief overview of the iGEM competition, an explanation of the goals of PoPPY, a discussion of the genes to be inserted, the methods we considered for insertion into the genome, and the questionnaires we sent out. Following the brief presentation, the class broke into smaller groups iGEM members and students. In those small groups, we discussed the potential ethical issues of our project in more detail. Many students offered perspectives on our project that we hadn’t considered before. For example, some students offered additional questions to improve the questionnaire. Sandra Dreisbach, one of the Bioethics professors, also encouraged us to contact the UCSC Institutional Review Board (IRB) to have them review our questionnaire and approve it for distribution. As part of the final project for their class, the bioethics students will make recommendations on how the ethics of our project can be improved.

This festival is a great opportunity to get the community excited about extracurricular activities and encourage them to participate, and iGEM was no exception. To prepare for the festival, our team worked on perfecting a poster to display at the booth. We also created small quarter-flyers to hand out to those interested. The flyers contained general information about iGEM and how to go about joining the following year's team. We printed a total of 200 flyers and ran out only an hour into the festival.

Patch particle transport
With what density should the hydrogel be seeded with E. coli bacteria?
What is the optimal composition of the patch to maximize lysostaphin delivery and minimize nutrient delivery to  the exudate?
Summary
For a hydrogel patch with a fitting shape to cover a wound on the arm, COMSOL was used to simulate the transport of lysostaphin and nutrients in this patch. Parameters, variables and boundary conditions were set according to literature, previous models and experiments on diffusion and lysostaphin production. It was found that a patch with a thickness of around a millimeter lysostaphin definetely reached the skin but in concentrations too low to eradicate S. aureus on the wound. This might be caused by a boundary condition we set on the bloodstream, as we set concentration to zero because blood would flow away from the wound with the lysostaphin. Later we realised this is probably not realistic since proteins diffuse very poorly through the line of cells forming the bloodvessel
With nutrients having higher diffusivity constants than lysostaphin, nutrients feeding our infected wound seemed a problem at first glance. However, we eventually concluded that the amount of nutrients in exudate neglects the nutrients flowing from applied nutrients to the infected wound, not causing problems.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Bacillus Promoters
To provide a set of promoters of different strength we characterized several promoters in Bacillus subtilis. They can be divided in three different groups:
the constitutive promoters from the Anderson collection from the Partsregistry
the constitutive promoters PliaG, Pveg and PlepA from B. subtilis
the inducible promoters PliaI and xylR-Pxyl from B. subtilis
For the characterization of the different promoters we used the lux operon
. Here, promoter activity leads to expression of the luciferase and hence light production, which can be measured as luminescence.
We also used the reporter gene lacZ
. Here, promoter activation results in expression of a β-galactosidase, whose activity can be measured by breakdown of the chromophoric substrate ONPG (β-galactosidase assays). We used the reporter vector pSBBs1C-lacZ. See below for an overview and background information of all evaluated promoters and see the Data page for more details.
Overview of all evaluated promoters
This section gives an overview on the strength of all evaluated promoters, which span a large range of activities. For more details and informations of the experiments see the Data page of the promoters. Note that Pveg was not evaluated with luminescence measurements and this bar is just projected from the results of the β-galactosidase assay.

IISER_Pune,2015,Team:IISER Pune#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,".Electron Microscope To further confirm the formation of self-assembled VLPs, the supernatant of transfected 293T cells was characterized by electron microscopy. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, 293T cells were fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetraoxide, dehydrated with ethanol, and then embedded in epon resin. Thin sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and observed byelectron microscope.
As shown in Figure 1B, the morphology of VLPs resembles the morphology of influenza virus particles with spikes on their surfaces, characteristic of influenza virus HA proteins on virions. Particle sizes ranged from approximately 100 to 120 nm. 5.Purification of H7N9-Derived VLPs The culture supernatants containing extracellular VLPs were harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min followed by concentration using ultra-filtration system Startocon slice 200(Sartorius stedim biotech, Aubagne, France). VLPs were pelleted for 4 h at 100,000 g at 4℃ using SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). The pellets were re-suspended in 5 mL of PBS(pH 7.2), and loaded onto a 20%–60% (w/v) discontinuous sucrose step density gradient, and sedimented by ultracentrifugation for 6 h at 100,000 g. About 1 mL fractions were collected and pelleted by a second ultracentrifugation and then re-suspended in PBS. Total protein concentrations of VLPs were determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. 6.Mice Immunization Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University, China. Mice were randomly divided into three groups (8 mice per group). Mice were immunized intramuscularly with 40 µg (total protein) of VLPs or purified H7N9 whole influenza virions(WIV) in Freund’s complete adjuvant (Sigma) for priming and in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant for two times of boosting at an interval of 2 weeks. Negative control mice were immunized with PBS in the same adjuvant. On days 0, 14, and 28, blood samples were collected through the tails in for antibody detection.

CIEI-BJ,2018,Team:CIEI-BJ#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," are from several schools. We arranged 3 publicities in 3 schools. During these publicities we not only received many valuable suggestions, but also enhanced our social impact. In every speech, we first introduced the history and the main characteristics of iGEM, especially how it gathered groups of students together, chasing their dreams about synthetic biology and trying to work out a public issue through their own method. Then, we introduced our project, which is using our own biocircuits instead of preexisting biological and chemical methods to detect and degrade aflatoxin. Meanwhile, we helped our audience know the importance of food safety and deepen their awareness of this issue. We hope that these speeches can attract more people to join us and solve the potential human health threat in food.
1）Enterprise sponsorship
In order to apply our research results to real life, our team members completed a corporate plan, which included our project background and project objectives. We contacted some biotechnology companies such as BAYER, Syngenta, KWS and BASF, as well as several companies in purifying equipment section like Hansen in Changsha. We managed to liaise with the heads of these companies and presented them our corporate plan. In the end, we got positive responses from companies and received sponsorship fee of 11000 Yuan. The team members have learned how to introduce our scientific research projects to relevant enterprises, which improved our communication skills and gave us a deeper understanding of our own projects.
2) Crowd-funding
Aiming at meeting our budget for lab work and group activity as well as promoting our project, we initiated a crowd funding. We spread the link and received 7697 Yuan. Thanks to our sponsors, we were able to launch more integrated events to develop our project.
3) Survey to public
In order to investigate into people’s level of understanding of aflatoxin and its effect on people’s health, we conducted a public survey. Besides the questions on respondents’ age and general information, the questionnaire contains 5 questions concerning respondents’ consumption need for Pu’er tea and their knowledge about aflatoxin. The questionnaire was distributed both online and offline. 1,164 responses, from middle-school students to elders, provided us with representative information about the public’s knowledge on AFT and their acceptance for our bioengineered product. An analysis of the result of our survey is as below.

Our design of the device will prevent E. coli from leaking out, and the E. coli in it will be annihilated after use. In the end, it can be freely disposed of without causing any potential health concern.
Mechanism
UV receptor
Rice University found that protein UirR and UirS can be used as a photo receptor. The UirS protein is anchored in the bacterial membrane where it “sees” the color illuminating the bacterium. If the illumination is UV, UirS activates itself and releases the protein, UirR. UirR will then be phosphorylated, and become active. Active UirR is mobile, capable of binding a specific promoter called (PcsiR1), and triggering the expression of the desired gene.
Temperature thermometer
The RBSTemp only allows ribosomes to bind to it at the temperature of 37 degree Celsius or above. The main feature of all RNA thermometers is that they function through conformational shifts in structure. These shifts cause conformational changes to expose the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which acts as a binding site to allow translation.3 For translation to occur, the ribosome must have the aforementioned SD sequence. The structural differences are caused by the transcription regions, but the SD sequence is common.

The chromoprotein cj-blue, and the fluorescent proteins BFP and RFP can perform different colors.
Chromoprotein
The LVA tag served as a degradation peptide sequence, is one of the most effective of them. If we put LVA tags on our desired gene, we can make them degrade faster.
Target
The principal application for our sticker is to monitor the WHOLE delivery process. That is, from the minute the manufacturing of the product is completed in the factory to the moment the customer receives the product, every moment will be monitored. In fact, the monitoring will continue until the customer finishes using the product. This not only guarantees the quality of the product, but helps to solve the possible legal disputes between the factory and the transport company, since you can add a new sticker in each stage of the delivery process. If the transport company or the customer receives the product with red or blue stickers on it, it indicates that the previous transporting condition is not acceptable. Likewise, the transportation company can also use this kind of stickers as evidence to prove that their employees do treat every cargo properly. This way, we can avoid consumer disputes and the ensuing problems of compensation, and  the company"

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#CholeraDetection#Summerexp#Period5#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," via heat shock transformation.  Dr. Grose thinks it would be best if at this point, the two cholera sub-groups united into one project.  We began working with Nathan and Michael to purify biofilm-degrading enzymes.  Work has been met with plenty of obstacles for them.  Specifically, they are trying to PCR amplify a gene called dispersinB (DspB).  They received the template from an iGEM team in France, successfully PCR-ed the gene, and performed a restriction digest. However, something went wrong and running the digested PCR on a low melt, they didn’t see a band.  Since then, they had to re-PCR … but the tube with template DNA was misplaced!  They’ve had to use a cleaned-up PCR as their template, but they haven’t been able to copy the gene.  Michael and I started a reaction for DspB.

The transformation of pIG 90 into DH5alpha was successful, but I let the cells incubate at 37 degrees C far too long – today makes three days.  So, I redid the transformation procedure today.
Visualized on a gel, the DspB PCR smeared miserably along the length of its well.  Tomorrow we’ll set up the reaction again.

New plans. We have decided to try to manipulate the natural system that E.coli already has for quorom sensing to get a reporter for cholera. Literature suggests that when a quorom sensing receptor protein SidA detects quorom sensing molecules from other bacteria it by some unknown mechanism causes and lysogenic lambda phage to become lytic. We want to use site directed mutagenisis to mutate the recognition pocket in SdiA so that it will only be able to recognize auto-inducers from Vibrio cholerae. The SdiA recognition area is similar to that found on CqsS (cholera QS receptor protein). We hypothesis that if we mutate 3 amino acids to be the same ones found in CqsS, SdiA will become a cholera auto-inducer specific response receptor protein.

We performed PCR of DspB again using a cleaned-up PCR that Whitney did a while back.  Hopefully we don’t see the same result as the last PCR reaction.

What we did
We used standard parts from the Registry from the Gronigen Team (K190015: ArsR-regulated promoter) and the Endy Lab (E0840: GFP-generator) and from the MIT 2006 Team (J45119: Wintergreen generator).  We made two composite parts with the ArsR-regulated promoter and the GFP-generator or the Wintergreen generator.  We then joined them together to make our device which scientifically detects arsenic by a green fluorescent glow and warns about arsenic with a wintergreen smell, in case you don't have any scientific equipment.

The common concentrations of DNA and free RNA polymerase in an Escherichia Coli cell were taken from the bibliography [3].
STEADY STATES
Waiting our system for arrive to a steady state doesn’t make any sense, because the output to study is the concentration of GFP in a given time and not in the steady state. Doubtlessly the GFP concentration arrive to a maximum (where the production rate and degradation rate will reach the same value) and afterwards it decrease till the completely disappearance of this protein.

CURLISYNTHESIS
One of the main goals of our modeling work this year was to understand the structure of the curlin subunit protein, CsgA and its behavior when engineered with a tag constituted of either six histidines (that we will call His1-tag from now on) or twice that motif (His2-tag), since this peptide is known for its nickel chelation properties. We then discussed over our results with the wet lab members to define a way to confirm the accuracy of our model, and so we were able to assess that, in accordance with literature, the best position for the tag was by the C-terminus end of the protein. We also determined that the His-tag was more likely to take a floating conformation instead of folding itself around CsgA.
Methods
For a numerical molecular model, what is required in the first place is the program that will be used. As far as we were concerned, we chose to use Sybyl-X, which is a program we started to use this year and that offers a number of useful tools as well as powerful calculation algorithms. Then we had to find a file containing the structure of CsgA. Indeed, reproducing it from scratch (we only had its amino acid sequence) would be close to impossible since what the program allows us to do is only theoretical, so it cannot know the right conformation of a complex protein just like that. Thus you have two possibilities:
-  build the protein yourself, by specifying the sequence, angles and distances between amino acids, which will almost certainly result in failure for a protein as complex as CsgA;
-  provide the"
Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," The FDA BLA process can be divided into five distinct stages [19].
The first stage is the ""Filing Determination & Review Planning Stage,"" where reviewers from the FDA determine if the BLA meets the minimum standards that the FDA has set for filing an BLA, the amount of review required for the specific needs of the BLA, and the primary areas of the BLA that reviewers must focus on. FDA officials convene to produce a timeline for the rest of the review process. This process can be considered a planning stage, where all BLAs that meet the FDA requirements advance to the next stage [19].
The second stage is known as the ""Review Phase,"" where FDA officials not only review the merits of the application itself, but also distribute the application to outside investigators, who can provide their own evaluations of the BLA. During this process, FDA officials are in constant contact with the BLA applicant, who may be asked to provide additional information depending on the requirements of the reviewers [19].
The third stage is known as the ""Advisory Committee Meeting Phase."" This stage occurs when ""the clinical study design used novel clinical or surrogate endpoints, the application raises significant issues on the safety and/or effectiveness of the drug or biologic, or the application raises significant public health questions on the role of the drug or biologic in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease"". In the case of bacterial therapeutics, due to lack of precedent, any BLA based on such technology would most likely undergo this third step [19].
The fourth stage is known as the ""Action Phase."" During this phase, the FDA officials, based on the information obtained during the ""Review Phase,"" will outline a series of requirement for the final therapeutic product. In this phase, specific requirements for the labeling of the product, as well as the conclusions reached by the FDA officials is summarized [19].
The final stage of the BLA approval process is known as the ""Post-Action Phase,"" where FDA officials analyze their performance during previous BLA evaluation stages, and improve upon them for future BLA applications [19].
The BLA approval process is time consuming and can discourage the commercialization of may biologics. However, this process also has several advantages. Firstly, while SMEs are much easier to approve, they also allow for Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs). The ANDA process allows for generic drug manufacturers to produce generic versions of SMEs after five years, a factor that significanly reduces the incentive for applicants to submit an appliation for a SME. However, no ANDA analog"

I am a Junior Mechanical Engineer at The Cooper Union. I thoroughly enjoy designing components for the FSAE Cooper Union Team. Occasionally, I will book spontaneous flights to Colombia to visit family. I am the team's official World Cup Expert.
Hua Joe Fung
I am a Junior Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union minoring in Biomedical Engineering. You can find me walking around the lab, asking everyone what they're up to and making sure everything is moving along smoothly. I enjoy rowing quite a great deal (I am an officer in Cooper's Rowing Club), and try and go visit my ""family"" in France any chance I get. I am the best in lab - don't let Shoshana or Alexa tell you otherwise. I also have the best hair ever.
Lily Lin
I am a Sophomore Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union. Aside from being my group's math adviser, I also flex my linguistic muscles by helping Dionne learn Spanish. Speaking of languages, I love learning them and am often found repeating Italian, Arabic, or Korean phrases that I've just discovered. I'm also Sara's partner-in-crime in CSA, and I exercise my eloquent oral skills in Toastmasters. *eats toast* It sure does smell like yeast in here... Also, I'm surprisingly the tallest member of the group despite the fact that I've been told that I'm short by a good number of people.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," We also digested dCas9 with XhoI and ClaI restriction enzymes and ligated it into two of our Plasmid 1 backbones. This is an overnight ligation, so we will transform it tomorrow. We also picked new Plasmid 1 colonies to plasmid prep and try to improve our yield after the two serial digestions with ClaI and SalI-HF and gel extraction. We made cryogenic stock of Plasmid 1 constructs #1 and #9, two of our best sequenced plasmids.
Sequencing results arrive. There is an insert in the backbone, but it is not the one that was expected. Expected GFP4, received GFP2. This must be due to a contamination or mislabeling. Just the thought of this gave Clay the heeby jeebies, which were so bad that God knows he might still have them. Because only two of the four primers annealed in the sequencing reaction (the two that anneal into the backbone), it was decided to retry the reaction using the other two primers (that anneal in the CDS) and send for sequencing again. This was attempted, but the sequencing center on campus responded that the plasmid (template) DNA concentration was too low. Six cultures inoculated with cells on plate streaked on 7/1 to be plasmid prepped tomorrow.
Thursday, July 10, 2014
Ashlee and Emily plasmid prepped 6 Plasmid 1 constructs - 3 from #1 and 3 from #9. We changed the plasmid preparation protocol to a 30 minute centrifuge spin after the cell had been lysed and digested with RNase because we were not seeing clean and compact cell pellets after 20 minutes. 30 minutes improved the pellets significantly and we got higher DNA concentrations. We then digested these with ClaI for 7 hours (instead of the previous 4), heat inactivated for 25 minutes, then PCR cleaned the digest. We then digested with SalI-HF overnight for 7 hours. We hope that this additional digest time coupled with increased centrifuge time during plasmid preparation would result in greater amounts of digested backbone. We also performed two transformations of the dCas9-Plasmid 1 ligations.
Plasmid prep of six tubes inoculated yesterday. Samples re-sent for sequencing on campus with higher DNA concentration. (76.5 ng/ul today vs 24.1 ng/ul yesterday). Several improvements made to plasmid prep"
