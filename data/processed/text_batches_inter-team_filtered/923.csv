Today:  I called the following companies:
Let’s start with the bad news: Called Company 1– she spoke to Dr. Moloney and he said they spent all the money that was allocated for charity/sponsorship so they can’t sponsor us. When I asked to meet him anyways to discuss next year’s sponsorship…she said they allocate money in January so call back to meet up sometime in November
Company 2 : Called VP but he he wasn’t there so left a msg  follow up tomorrow
Company 3: Called left a msg, I need an email address to send a msg  follow up tomorrow
Company 4: looking over pkg …..left a msg  follow up july 31 or tomorrow
Company 5: Called President and left a msg  follow up july 31
Company 6: sent sponsorship pkg before to the Marketing leader …called today and left a voicemail…follow up tomorrow Cayman chemicals  needs more time to think it over…follow up july 31 or august 3
BioAlberta’s president wants to meet me next week and he said he’ll call me when he comes back to town.
Then I sent out the July newsletter to about 20 companies (I didn’t list them all so plz refer to Gmail excel sheet b/c I updated it  so you’ll know which companies I’ve sent the newsletter to)
After our outreach meeting, I started jotting down ideas for outreach activities which I’ll share with Emily and fahd tomorrow since they didn’t have time today.
Also I confirmed the bake sale for next Wednesday with the rest of the team. If you guys are ok with this then I’ll go book tables tomorrow. Oh and I also have to call Linden Labs tomorrow to see if they’ll sponsor us.  Yesterday  I wrote the general acknowledgement blurb and today I  wrote up the acknowledgement for each individual on the wiki.
I also wrote up an email to Ms Ellechuk (my high"
Duke,2017,Team:Duke_-_-_TEXT.html," problem when on average contract workers in the region make $0.67/hr USD and the median average hourly wage is $0.53/hr USD (Wage Indicator Foundation). These tests also have a large window that they cannot detect within. Generally, these tests do not work as well when a patient is newly infected or has only been infected for less than three months. The newer rapid tests are attempting to isolate and solve this problem, but there still exists a window where the tests are unspecific and really insensitive.
Our team this year is working on a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) that would be able to test for HIV. This is done using griffithsin, a novel protein, that can be produced from E.coli cells. Through production, optimization, and isolation of this protein our team plans to design a lateral flow RDT to test for the presence of HIV-1 and HIV-2.
Our Team, Our Community, Our World
Our team is based out of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. While we focused some of our engagement and community efforts on our local community we wanted our design to really focus on the global problem of HIV and Zika diagnostic issues.

The PCR worked and we saw bands of the same size for all three sets of PCR. (Unfortunately, the picture we saved is not a good one since some of the bands faded away under UV due to prolonged exposure. Following this, PCR purification was performed to obtain the pure hpaC with biobrick prefix and suffix attatched to gene, which would allow us to insert the sequence into a biobrick standard backbone. 3 sets of digestion, ligation, and transformation (using pairs of X&P enzymes, E&S enzymes and E&P enzymes) were carried out in order to insert the hpaC gene into the pSB1C3 vector. All the sets grew successfully. Following the above successes with hpaC, the arrival of our Rhodococcus strain afforded us the opportunity to begin investigation of the Dsz operon using the primers current in our possession. This strain is an environmental isolate that has been shown by someone to be an active desulfurizer. The gram-positive nature of the strain also dictated we explore various lysing strategies before the genes encoding the Dsz enzymes could be amplified for further purification and biobrick construction steps. PCR was carried out using dszA primers on three different treatments {microwave, lysate buffer, and a control} which yielded banding pattern around 1200 base pairs for the lysate treatment (2%SDS and 10% tritonX-100, plus heat for 5mins at 98C).

Collaborations
Let's Work Together
Besides the competitive aspects of iGEM, it also provides an excellent platform for collaboration between teams. As well as attending various meetings of iGEM teams to discuss projects, our collaborative efforts involved:
Scottish iGEM team poster session
We arranged a poster session for the four Scottish iGEM teams where teams would be able to discuss their projects at a high profile science convention in Scotland. It was held at the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 16th of October and was part of The Scottish Science Advisory Council (SSAC) event to launch their report 'Synthetic Biology: opportunities for Scotland'. This gave the teams a great chance to share their projects with some of the top synthetic biologists in the country and prepare for the Boston competition only a few weeks later.
Our final outing prior to Boston was to the Royal Society of Edinburgh for the official launch of the Scottish Science Advisory Council’s report on synthetic biology Synthetic Biology: Opportunities for Scotland where a small group of core research and industry representatives led by Chief Scientific Adviser for Scotland Professor Muffy Calder were gathered to discuss the future of SynBio in Scotland.
After an introduction by Prof Calder, a summary of the report’s findings was given by Professor Nigel Brown who highlighted the significance of synthetic biology to the futures of medicine, with a focus on the development of new antimicrobial drugs; agriculture, outlining how the use of synthetic biology to assist in screening plant lines for desirable traits could significantly streamline the"

BBa_R1062
Promoter, Standard (luxR and HSL regulated -- lux pR)
Designed by Vinay S Mahajan, Voichita D. Marinescu, Brian Chow, Alexander D Wissner-Gross and Peter Carr Drew Endy
Group: Registry
[Note: This is the same part as R0062 except that the -10 and -35 sites and spacing have been changed to comply with BBa_S0001]. Promoter activated by LuxR in concert with HSL The lux cassette of V. fischeri contains a left and a right promoter. The right promoter gives weak constitutive expression of downstream genes.This expression is up-regulated by the action of the LuxR activator protein complexed with the autoinducer, 3-oxo-hexanoyl-HSL. Two molecules of LuxR protein form a complex with two molecules of the signalling compound homoserine lactone (HSL). This complex binds to a palindromic site on the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription.
BBa_C0261
AHL-making Enzyme, luxI (+RBS)
BBa_B0015
Double terminator
Designed by Reshma Shetty   Group: Registry   (2003-07-17)
BBa_P1003
Kanamycin resistance cassette
Designed by Reshma Shetty   Group: Knight Lab, MIT   (2006-01-23)
Kanamycin resistance cassette including promoter and coding sequence. It lacks a terminator.
Usage and Biology
Used for modular BioBrick vector construction using BioBrick base vector BBa_I51020.

Conclusion
Looking at our data, we can see that our data suggest that the amount of cells in a 1 mL culture is between 60,000,000 and 100,000,000. Our Dilution 4 data estimates the number of cells to be much lower than our dilution 5 data almost by half. However, with large dilution factors and differences in techniques, the variability between cell count estimates could be higher than ideal."

We prepared 2 eppendorf tubes for each ligation reaction. We incubated one ligation set at 4°C overnight and the other ligation set at 25°C for 3 hours.
We received sequencing results for BBa_I14032: the sequence was 37 bp long, but it was not PlacIQ. We contacted Meagan to try to solve this problem.
06/13/08
We prepared 5 glycerol stocks taking 800 µl from 9 ml cultures grown.
Miniprep for these cultures
We sent all the 5 purified plasmids to Primm for sequencing.
We transformed the whole volume of the ligations.
We plated the 10 ligations.
06/14/08
Only one of 10 ligation plates worked: BBa_B0030-BBa_C0078 showed one colony...Horrible result!
We decided to dedicate the following week to debug our protocols and to change something:
Reduce ligation volume to 10 µl
Inactivate T4 Ligase after ligation heating at 65°C for 10 min
Heat at 65°C for 5 min ligation mix before adding T4 Ligase and its buffer
Use different amounts of vector and insert
Don't use Antarctic Phosphatase

BACKGROUND
Prostheses aim to enhance the quality of life, independence, mobility, and safety of amputees. The frequency of amputations worldwide has created an increased demand for improved prosthetic technologies. Within developing countries, the population with physical disabilities in need of a prosthesis is estimated at about 0.5%. There are currently almost 2 million people living with limb loss in the United States. In 2050, this amount will exceed 3 million people[1].
Over the past decade, many types of prostheses have been created. One of them is the myoelectric prosthesis, which captures the electromyographic (EMG) signal of residual limb muscle through surface electrodes on the skin. These kinds of robotic prostheses allow amputees to recover some autonomy and to accomplish simple everyday gestures. However, they are still limited by a number of controllable movements and by the lack of sensory feedback [1].
Today, the direct attachment of the prosthesis to the skeleton introduces the concept of osseointegration. This kind of prosthesis provides the patient with precise and reliable control of the new limb, regardless of the environmental conditions or the position. The opportunity to record and stimulate the neuromuscular system allows intuitive control and a better understanding of sensory perception [2].
The central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and the spinal cord, helps integrating, influencing and coordinating activities across the whole organism. The neural tissues bring information from one region of the body to another by sending electrical signals along the axon [3]. The efferent motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) communicate with muscles and are under voluntary control. They go from the spinal cord to the arms, hands, legs, and feet and allow for nerve impulses to be transmitted from the CNS, leading to an"
USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a computer                                 monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device                                 that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in                                 languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a                                 desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to                                 making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games. The module we used is                                 Raspberry-PI 2B.
Figure 5: The real electric part we built
As the picture shows, the battery powers the little fan and the laser part. The little                                 fan is necessary because of the need to lower the temperature of the board.
Figure 6: The electrical source and the transformer
The transformer transforms 12 volts to 5 volts, and the breadboard supplies power for the                                 laser and the fan.
A breadboard is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. Originally it was                                 literally a bread board, a polished piece of wood used for slicing bread. In the 1970s                                 the solderless breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and                                 nowadays the term ""breadboard"" is commonly used to refer to these. ""Breadboard"" is also                                 a synonym for ""prototype"".
Then let's see the screen , keyboard and mouse.
Figure 7: screen , keyboard and mouse
The screen, keyboard and the mouse are connected to the RaspberryPi via USB.
We use CCD camera to capture images.
Figure 8: CCD camera
A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a device for the                                 movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the                                 charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved                                 by ""shifting"" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move                                 charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer                                 of charge between bins.
Optical Part: Michelson Interferometer
Figure 9: 2nd Michelson Interferometer
The Michelson interferometer is common configuration for optical interferometry and was                                 invented by Albert Abraham Michelson. Using a beam-splitter, a light source is split                                 into two arms. Each of those is reflected back toward the beam-splitter which then                                 combines their amplitudes interferometrically. The resulting interference pattern that                                 is not directed back toward the source is typically directed to some type of                                 photoelectric detector or camera.

1-Butanol has low water solubility, is biodegradable and therefore not expected to  significantly accumulate in nature. In open spaces, at normal temperature, 1-butanol  decomposes due to photolysis. It is a combustible and flammable liquid, sensible to static  discharges. Flash point of butanol is 29°C so spontaneous ignition is possible on hot days.
But compared to gasoline butanol is much safer to use. Gasoline is more hazardous to health  as butanol, because in addition to skin, eye and respiratory irritation, dizziness and  drowsiness, it is also mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic to reproduction, causes damage to  organs (liver, kidneys, bladder, blood, bone marrow, nervous system) through prolonged or  repeated exposure and may be fatal if swallowed or inhaled. Gasoline`s flash point is -43°C  and as such significantly lower than the flash point of butanol. In addition gasoline poses a  greater threat to the environment than butanol, because it is poisonous to aquatic life. Gasoline safety sheet
To conclude, common use of butanol as a propellant may require certain safety precautions  during production, transportation and storage. Possible dangers of its use could be  eliminated with the same preventive measures that are already implemented for other  flammable liquid car fuels.
Butyric acid
Butyric acid is a medium-strong carboxylic acid. Because it is the first and most important  substrate of our engineered metabolic path, its dangers should be taken into consideration  before any large-scale production of butanol is established. Butyric acid is corrosive and can  cause pain, redness and severe deep burns on skin and loss of vision. If ingested, it can cause  abdominal pain, shock or collapse. Inhalation may result in sore throat, cough, burning  sensation, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. Butyric acid safety sheet It is  also combustible and forms explosive vapours above 72°C. With proper action these dangers  should be eliminated.

We can grow S. elongatus under low light until it reaches stationary phase. Upon achieving maximum cell density, we can increase light levels, triggering sucrose production. Using this promoter also keeps sucrose production in phase with light intensity, which is desirable as sucrose acts as an electron acceptor and should mitigate oxidative stress under intense light.
Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to collect data on this aspect of our project, but hopefully, other iGEM teams can carry on our work!
Lab Automation, Directed Evolution, and Open-Source Protocols
Unfortunately, we encountered many roadblocks in our project. We originally wanted to automate protocols that used UV-based random mutagenesis and artificial selection for different phenotypes such as high growth rate and high sucrose production, as a proof of concept for directed evolution of our strain. However, we were not able to pursue all of our goals due to DNA synthesis issues and contamination (we did not have sugar-producing cyanobacteria to use directed evolution on). We did collaborate with the Queens Canada iGEM Team to make a video explaining directed evolution.
This year, our team had the honor of winning an Opentrons OT-2 robot that we used for lab automation. We programmed several protocols with the Opentrons, including InterLab protocols and well plate setups.

The model of MerR’s action is shown in Fig 2. In (A), merR (showed as green dimer downside the DNA strand) bound to PTPCAD and recruited RNA polymerase but was unable to form an open complex. Hg (II)’s binding to the dimer  changed its conformation and transcription was initiated.  (Brown, Stoyanov et al. 2003)
By annealing PmerT-forward (5’-3’) and PmerT-reverse (5’-3’) primers, PTPCAD carrying a sticky end of EcoRI and SpeI was cloned upstream of BBa_E0840, a GFP generator. With exogenous expression of  MerR in bacteria, GFP’s expression could be induced by Hg (II) in a dose response manner. The PTPCAD-E0840 was then cloned into pSB3K3 backbone and the BBa_J23103 (constitutive promoter)-merR into pSB1A3.
Protocols for promoter characterization
An overnight culture of bacteria carrying the two plasmids pSB3K3 and pSB1A3 were grown in LB broth with ampicillin and kanamycin at 37°C was reactivated by diluting the culture in a ratio of 1:100 with fresh LB. When OD600 reached 0.4-0.6, the bacteria was disposed to several EP tubes, each owning 500uL, and different dose of Mercuric chloride solution was supplied with 3 duplicates and the final concentration varied from 0 to 1.0E-6 mol/L. 100uL of the 500uL was added to the black-96-well plates for GFP intensity’s measurement and another 100uL was pipetted to the transparent-96-well plates for OD600 measurement. In-plate culture fluorescence and OD600 was recorded at 20min intervals from 0 to 275min and the GFP intensity of 20min before induction was also measured. Temperature was constant at 37°C.

OVERVIEW
Aside from plastic degradation and alkane metabolism, generation of electricity was another important focus of our iGEM project. For this module, we focused on generating a stable electrical current by utilizing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism. In order to better harness its electrogenicity, we housed a culture of the bacterium within a microbial fuel cell of our design, aiming at maximizing electrical output for a given amount of substrate.
While many other microorganisms are capable of electron transport by reduction of suitable substrate, we chose to work with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain as it is a relatively well-studied facultative anaerobe capable of generating current by reducing a broad range of substrates, utilizing them as metabolites. While the processes behind this electron transport mechanism are not yet fully understood, it is known that a few outer and inner-membrane Cytochromes are responsible for the shuttling of electrons from within the cell body to the extracellular substrate. The multiple heme-centres present within these Cytochromes allows for efficient transport of electrons to the extracellular space. The extracellular electron transport mechanism is described in figure 1.
Figure 1 Extracellular Electron Transport mechanism of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
According to literature[1], electrons are shuttled from the inner-membrane Cytochrome c molecule CymA to another Cytochrome c molecule, MtrA, present in the periplasm. They are then transported to the outer-membrane Cytochromes MtrC and OmcA. These outer-membrane cytochromes are in fact lipoproteins associated to the outer membrane and outer-membrane protein MtrB. By this arrangement, the outer-membrane Cytochromes are exposed to the extracellular space where they may reduce suitable substrates. This reduction may occur by direct contact between cell surface and substrate or may be mediated by Flavins[2] to reduce substrate far from the cell surface"

The 2017 ACC/AHA Focused Update Heart Failure Guideline for the management of heart failure recommends the diagnosis, progress monitoring, prognosis prediction, and prevention of heart failure with the support of a Randomized Clinical Trial research. The results show that the diagnosis using echocardiography of patients with no clear sign of cardiac malfunction but with a potential for heart failure development and also with high levels of NT-proBNP leads to a decrease in asymptomatic left ventricle malfunction. I think the HAPPI your team has been developing can be a meaningful device for heart failure patients. Moreover, it would be useful in not only early diagnosis of heart failure but also real-time monitoring with mobile phones. However, I concern the price of the diagnostic chip. You should consider if your proposed method would be more cost-effective than the NT-proBNP method which is currently used in clinics.
What we learned
Kyung-Jin Kim is a professor who has extensive knowledge in the field of clinical cardiology. She has provided us with detailed advices, citing a clinical heart failure guideline and comparing our project to the NT-proBNP method currently utilized in clinics. She has also raised meaningful questions on the applicability of HAPPI for us to consider. Thanks to the professor, Kyung-Jin Kim, our team was able to take some time to compare the specifications of our HAPPI with the conventional method. These considerations helped us to contrive our HAPPI in specific ways for its feasible implementation in clinics. Therefore, we have focused on a low-cost fabrication method of HAPPI in this study.

HAPPI will obviously have a positive impact on people, especially the elderly. Diagnosing heart failure isn’t easy because heart failure has a poor prognosis. Usually, within three years, 30-40% of patients with heart failure pass away. Furthermore, with the aging, heart failure patients may not be aware of the disease and miss the golden time for their appropriate treatment. For example, heart failure is common among the elderly, therefore they often think that the symptoms of heart failure are due to their age. From this point of view, HAPPI could be very meaningful as it gives people the opportunity to diagnose heart failure early.

The Problem
There are only around 4 widely-used N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems, while there are over 100 different systems found in nature
AHL molecules are not completely system-specific, as crosstalk can occur between systems-this causes problems with developing functional genetic circuits
AHL quorum sensing is used to regulate factors such as virulence and biofilm formation, potentially activating pathogenic bacteria
Brief Summary
Quorum sensing is the ability of bacteria to scan their surroundings and detect concentrations of their own population. A species of bacteria will produce an inducer protein, which generates chemical signals in the form of N-acyl homo-serine lactones (AHLs). When the AHL reaches a high concentration, the bacterial cells will respond by collectively activating a set of genes. In nature, these AHLs are able to drastically influence the growth behavior of bacterial cells, activating biofilm formation, bioluminescence, virulence, motility, etc.
The objective of our project is to design and test a variety of quorum sensing networks. We have developed a flexible testing platform in which the QS system is separated into two components designated the “Sender” and the “Receiver”. The AHL synthase is expressed in the Sender cell, while the inducible promoter and regulator are carried by a Receiver cell. When the Sender produces a signal, the HSL, it diffuses across cell membranes and activates the Receiver. In our current system, Receivers will express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in response to induction by Senders from different bacterial species. Ideally, the designed systems would have low amounts of interference and form a functional genetic circuit. Our team has built 10 senders and their respective receivers.
Our iGEM team is investigating the diverse applications that fit with our quorum sensing project. Some of the sub-projects include: investigating the Aub strain, which originates from unidentified soil bacterium; writing a white paper on addressing potential safety concerns with AHLs, a visual optical density test on AHL production by Senders, a more comprehensive characterization of AHLs produced by our Senders using gas chromatography, a direct comparison induction test on Senders using the well-characterized part F262"

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," rights to each part would create what is called to be a ""patent thicket"" (Rutz, 2009). Attaining rights to so many parts does not only hinder innovation, but is time-consuming and costly
Opportunities
1.Patents add value, reputation and credibility to an invention. Although this legal concept is frowned upon in the R&D field, it brings a source of financial opportunity that would bring forth strategic partnerships and lump some funding to further progress research. At an economic perspective, patenting would be useful in advancing one's research.
2.Patenting requires thorough documentation and characterization of each aspect of the part, streamlined patenting protocols could add standardization to the part development process
Threats
1.European patent law states that ""iventions of commercial exploitation to morality are omitted from patentable rights"" (Rutz, 2009).  The general public fears that if rights to a biological process or part are give they may be abused.  Examples are biological warfare or the unintentional release of pathogenic organisms.
2.""Patent sharks and trolls"" (Rutz , 2009) may find it simple to file lawsuits against such patents. •On the other side of the coin, some have claimed that finding a patent application for a biological part is similar to finding a needle in a haystack. Moreover, it is not the job of a scientist to be rummaging around in identifying his legal rights to using a biological part, nor should his time be consumed by understanding the patenting process relevant to his field.
Conclusion
The concept of patenting makes scientists cringe at the thought that their research and advancements would be diminished by the monopolistic power held by the broad patent holders within synthetic biology. There is currently no established set of specific protocols for patenting products in synthetic biology. Moreover, the attempt to blend the patent laws applicable to a range of disciplines to one as intricate as synthetic biology is difficult. Additionally, companies who wish to have a formalized process in examining and submitting processes would have to understand that a large number of additional resources would be needed to accommodate for the labour intensive, time consuming and costly process of patenting such biological parts. So the underlying question is that what is of greater value in today’s market, leading innovation through open-source strategies or banking on profit-making opportunities by securing an idea with a patent?
INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
Before we attempt to understand the impact of synthetic biology on the business world as a whole, we must first understand what kind of an impact it will have on specific sectors. The goal of the industry analysis was to"

Combining modeling and experimental work in iGEM
Background
Mathematical modeling is a key component of synthetic biology and also played a central role in our project. Collaboration between modelers and biologists can however be challenging, something we also noticed in our project. We wanted to study how iGEM teams tackle these challenges and are able to integrate modeling to their experimentation.
Figure 4: Educational background of questionnaire respondents, 2014 iGEM participants and professional synthetic biology researchers categorized. ""Mathematical"" includes mathematics, computer science and physics.
Outcome
Created a questionnaire for iGEM teams on collaboration between modeling and experimentation, and studied 2014 teams and professional synthetic biology groups to find out what educational backgrounds team members are coming from
Biggest issues in collaboration between modelers and experimentalists are: lack of knowledge of the other field, lack of common terminology and differences in ways of thinking
Both modelers and biologists need to understand the basics of the other field to be able to effectively collaborate.
Having experimentalists and modelers work close together is beneficial. One approach generally found successful is to have some biologists get involved in modeling to help ensure models are useful for the project and connected to reality. Modelers can too take some time to get familiar with the wetlab in the beginning of the project
Regular team meetings for presenting and discussing progress and issues of every field take time, but ensure all team members stay informed and can voice their insights.

After returning from Amsterdam we had a meeting to organize the work until the World Championship Jamboree. Now I am going to focus mainly on integrating the basic and improved flip-flops into Escherichia coli chromosome using the miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit.
Working with flip-flops. I prepared mini-preps of the basic and improved flip-flops, digested them with EcoRI and PstI and ligated with pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm, also digested with the same enzymes. The ligation products were electroporated in DH5α-λpir electro-competent cells. I did this process twice without results, probably because of the low electroporation ratio of the competent cells.
Characterizing attTn7 BioBrick. In order to characterize this BioBrick I prepared electro-competent cells harboring pSB1C3-attTn7 plasmids and electroporated them with pTNS2 and pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm. The results would be analyzed the next week.
Continuing characterizing pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm. I already measured the transposition frequency of this miniTn7 module by chemical transformation. Then I attended to determine the transposition frequency by mating because this plasmid has an oriT. That week I performed the first steps to cause mating with two receptor strains: E. coli MC4100 and S. typhimurium LT2.

Also we would stay within bacterial CBD and didn't have to spend time thinking about post-translational modification and glycosylation.
To get to know more about these two domains, their properties and their proteins we consulted NCBI and used the BLAST -tool to identify the cellulose binding domains and ExPASy-tools for further measurements.

Figure 6: Protein-BLAST of Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 exoglucanase gene
The CBD of the Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 exoglucanase gene (Figure 6) is a 100 amino acid long domain, close to the C-terminal ending of the protein with a theoretical pI of 8.07 and a molecular weight of 10.3 kDa. It is classified to be stable and belongs to the Cellulose Binding Modul family 2 (pfam00553/cl02709). This means two tryptophan residues are involved in cellulose binding, this type of CBD is only found in bacteria. Also a CBM49 Carbohydrate binding domain is found within the protein domain, where binding studies have shown, that it binds to crystalline cellulose, which could be a possible target for immobilization.

Recapitulation
One of the primary focuses of our project is to study the nature of the symbiotic community of fermenting kombucha. Recapitulation refers to the reformation of kombucha by singly adding isolated microbes to a mixture of black tea, sucrose, and water similar to the mixture used in home-brewing practices. Through this process we determined that the microbial community could be recreated from its constituent bacteria and yeast. We also identified the microbes that appear to be vital for the proper recapitulation of kombucha. However, because we cannot taste our lab-brewed kombucha, these conclusions are solely based on qualitative observations. Successful recapitulations indicate that it is in fact possible to produce kombucha with known microbes rather then simply propagating new kombucha from a previous batch. These results also elucidate the symbiotic relationships that must exist in order for kombucha to form. Future research may allow us to create kombucha with distinct flavor profiles by varying the combination of strains added to the brew.  Additionally, based on our conversations with Greg Goodman of KTonic (see human practices) these non-GMO containing beverages would likely be most appealing to the industry.
Ethanol
During the fermentation process, yeast in kombucha produce ethanol, the type of alcohol present in beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages. This presents a challenge to kombucha brewers who wish to market their product as a non-alcoholic beverage. If the alcohol content of a manufacturer’s kombucha exceeds 0.5% at any point during production, the manufacturer may not market their beverage as non-alcoholic and must be regulated as a producer of alcoholic beverages.1 Most kombucha on store shelves contains live yeast that continue to produce ethanol before being purchased by the consumer. Through our interactions with the kombucha industry in Austin, we learned that the expiration date of kombucha is often limited to the length of time the kombucha can be stored without exceeding 0.5% ethanol. Therefore, finding a way to slow ethanol production would allow brewers to keep their product on store shelves for longer. One way to tackle this problem with synthetic biology is to ferment with yeast that produce less ethanol. However, this may be impractical because ethanol must be present for the bacteria in the brew to oxidize it to acetic acid, a major component of the beverage"

So the problem may be the parameter of the promoter strength.
When Junhui Peng modified the promoter strength to a lower value and simulate, he found that this time with enough amount of the AHL inducer, the system is able to switch between the two steady states.
During the spare time, we hang out with our wet friends and talked a lot.
We are going to collaborate more in the future.

If the user wishes to work with a different MINT description, they can simply import that file here. Also within the Design page of Neptune is the INI file. The INI file contains detailed parameters for the features of the microfluidic chip. This file takes into consideration factors such as design rules, performance, and hardware constraints. It provides the capability for rapid prototyping designs with ease, since through the INI file, a user may edit all features on their chip of the same type at once. For example. If Dr. Ali (from the example above) realizes he made the channels of his chip too small, he can widen all of them all at once by simply editing this parameter in the Design stage instead of manually changing each individual channel with one at a time by hand in a CAD tool. The user can compile his MINT and INI files in the Design stage and move on to the Build and Assemble stages.
In the Build stage of Neptune, the user can select the hardware he or she would like to use for their system. The Build page guides the user through this process based on their design step in order to provide them with the most optimized hardware solution for their needs. When the user is finished, Neptune’s Build page provides them with an ordering list of all of the necessary components they will need to assemble and use their device. Once they have ordered and received these parts, they can proceed to the Assemble stage.
Neptune will guide the user through the process of milling out their chip (using the SVG file outputted from the Design stage), 3-Printing supporting hardware infrastructure (the files for which are dynamically generated and provided to fit the user’s needs based on their current design in this stage), and assembling all of their ordered components to complete their microfluidic system.
After the user has Assembled his or her microfluidic, he or she may control their device from within Neptune in the Control stage. On the control page, the user can connect Neptune to his arduino by opening a serial communication connection. He or she can then open or close valves or set a volume to be dispensed evenly over a given time for dispensers all with the click of a button.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of the IGEM competition. Besides IGEM, we also discussed many frontier life science progress and appreciated their unique views.
We then showed them our lab space and facilities, including cell sonicators, ultra-centrifuges and flow cytometry. We explained the principles using analogies and metaphors. The IDPI ended around 6 pm and we can see through their eyes and faces that these high students were reluctant to leave. As one of the visiting students commented, this tour was 'so impressive and amazing'. We believed that the one day IDPI truly delivered the IGEM core value by arousing their curiosity to explore the secrets of nature. A few days after the visit, the teachers contacted us to consult us for building a biology lab. We really hope that this is the beginning of another amazing adventure!
Poster
During the investigation of intestinal diseases, we realized that IBD is a world-wide threat to human health with a great morbidity and severity. And we found that, unfortunately, public awareness intestinal diseases like IBD is insufficient.
Thus, we decided to introduce IBD and its hazard to the public. The symptoms, diagnosis and related information about IBD were collected.
A poster was designed by our team to show the public that IBD is threating our health, and we need basic knowledge about it. The poster includes the definition, morbidity, diagnosis, symptoms and potential causes about IBD. Our IGEM project Gutrio and the idea to utilize synthetic biology to treat IBD were also introduced.
We have introduced IBD to many communities, and wish more and more people to realize the severity of IBD.

BU/MIT Meetup
Today we came into the lab on a Saturday to meet up with the BU and MIT teams to show them our work and to view theirs. It all had a really good time and it was very useful to receive feedback for our project. Both of the other teams are on the syn-bio track so they had very different projects than the one we are working on. In addition, the feedback that we got was unique since it was coming from a completely different perspective. I also really appreciated the atmosphere in the lab where people from different backgrounds got to play around with all the different gadgets that we have. In general, I think that it was a great experience for all parties involved and that we all got very informative feedback that we integrated into our projects.

Brainstorming with Romie and Anja
Prior to today the lab had tossed around some general ideas as to what our iGem project was going to be, but Romi and Anja's visit marks our first real brainstorming session. Since we're creating an interactive exhibit for The Tech Museum of Innovation in California, it's important that we got a chance to speak to both of them since they will be the exhibit's curators. This brainstorming session was one of the few times everyone in the lab was together working on the same project. As a group we managed to come up with and finalize a direction to take our project in. I'm really looking forward to our final project and think museum visitors will be enticed to give it a go!
NEGEM
I was able to attend NEGEM, a meetup of all the iGem teams in the New England area, last year and was looking forward to going again this year. It was fun seeing the new faces and hearing about the projects local teams have decided to tackle. NEGEM is held at Boston University. In addition to having lunch together, all the teams in attendance are given 20 minutes to present and receive feedback on their projects. Wellesley brought in the only team that didn't have any biology or chemistry major members, but despite that we were able to give some solid feedback on the other presentations. In addition to getting good feedback on our own iGem project, we were also able to find collaborators (Boston University and MIT). Once everyone has had a time to come back together and reflect on what was said during NEGEM, we'll start setting up a day to meet with BU and MIT later in the summer.

Even though the appropriate processing is performed by changing the binarization threshold, there inevitably exist some small systematic error. If the similar phenomenon can be avoided in the next experiments, the accuracy of the data will surely be able to improve. 2. In the 6th assumption, ‘As to the fuzzy edge of the plaque, the area is considered to be the largest and smooth edges simply connected region. ’, which really brings convenience to the image processing, but it will make a large systematic error in the calculation of the number of bacteria produce. Taking into account that the experimental purpose is to explore the elongation ability of the bacteria in the unit time in the dish plane, however, and the main aim of the calculation and analysis of the number of bacteria is to increase the reliability of classic model. Therefore, this error can be accepted. 3. Plaque on a plane may be different in thickness; there may be impurities in plaque; plaque may also be non-dense. The factors above will all result in the absolute number of bacteria is not proportional to the area of plaque on the photo. If the error cannot be ignored, the calculation of the number of bacteria will be influenced. But as it is described in 2, they do not affect the primary purpose of the study.    1.6 Reference [1] 许金泉,张娟,马琼瑜,李云.细菌(数量)生长规律的数学模型[J].云南大学学报(自然科学版),2008,30(S2)：157～159． [2] 夏结来,徐雷,陈长生.S型曲线的一种新的拟合方法[J].中国卫生统计.2001,18(4),195～197.    1.7 Download You may download pdf. version of this article here: Analysis of E.coli and Bdellovibrio’s growth in the number of speed by a group of photographs. pdf

Feasibility of using bio streams
Is it ethically fine to use already used waste streams for producing plastics? Most cellulose containing waste streams are already in use, for instance foodstock and bioethanol. Our yeast strain will be competing with the people and companies who currently use those waste streams. We will make plastics, something that possibly benefits the environment less than the current uses of cellulosic waste. It will definitely be very valuable to look into waste streams that are not already in use. We did this in a concrete way by talking to companies that process cellulose containing waste such as KNN cellulose who make recell: recycled toilet paper. Furthermore we will have to look into how beneficial it is to make plastic from cellulose compared to making it from fossil fuels. One of the ways we did this is by performing a carbon footprint analysis.
Breaking down cellulose with or without yeast?
One of the biggest difference between our project and the one of Bordeaux is the way in which we turn cellulose into glucose. We use our yeast cells for both the conversion of cellulose to glucose and the conversion of glucose to styrene while the Bordeaux team plans to perform the first step in a chemical way and only do the conversion from glucose to plastic with their micro-organism. It will be very interesting to compare which way is more optimal and efficient, not only by looking at the yield but also at the byproducts and  the effects of the environment. While in order to completely weight all positive and negative sides of both strategies we need more experimental results there are already some things we can hypothesize about.
The chemical way, using acid hydrolysis, will entail using dangerous chemicals, however acid hydrolysis is is a process that’s used widely and can be done in a large reactor. There will be a byproduct consisting of polluted acid, which could potentially be reused, but this is something the Bordeaux team will have to look into. In contrast, our enzyme complex won’t have any dangerous byproducts as it just uses water. The efficiency of the enzyme complex will however likely be a lot lower than using acid hydrolysis. Furthermore we will have to take the growth medium our cells using the enzyme complex grow on into account.

Welcome to the Dry Lab!
The goal of the Dry Lab has been to support the Wet Lab by answering questions of interest. The primary function of the models is to instruct the data analysis once results are gathered from the lab. Conclusions from the models aim to provide the team with a functional understanding of the system as well as design considerations that should be addressed in the genetic constructs. We have implemented several  models, explaining the behaviour of different parts of the system. Below is a summary:
Modelling in this project has been important in defining the ""Engineering constraints"" of the project, and in particular, we have focused on quantifiying the temporal control .

Druga strategia wykorzystuje bakteryjne wirusy charakterystyczne dla E.coli. Podczas infekcji bakteriofag wstrzykuje do komórki bakteryjnej swój kod genetyczny, wymuszając produkcję kolejnych cząsteczek wirusowych, a w końcowym rozrachunku jej śmierć i uwolnienie nowych wirusów, atakujących kolejne bakterie. Podejście to wykorzystuje efekt domina, który pozwala na zabicie dużej liczby bakterii, przy stosunkowo niewielkiej ilości komórek-zabójców.
Jako nieodłączny element pracy laboratoryjnej, zespól prowadzi komputerowe modelowanie nowo zaprojektowanych elementów. Symulacje tego modelu pozwalają na analize zachowania systemu, oraz usprawniają planowanie pracy eksperymentalnej.
Aktualnie zespół Heidelbergu znajduje się na półmetku swego projektu. Studenci pracując dzień i noc osiągnęli już wstępne rezultaty zarówno w części komputerowego modelowania jak i pracy eksperymentalnej. Cały zespół jest przekonany, iż osiągnie zaplanowany cel przed prezentacją wyników na początku listopada na MIT w Bostonie i wystartuje z pozycji pozwalającej na konkurowanie z międzynarodowymi zespołami z Harvardu, Cambridge czy Tokio.

Hi,I am Jue, a Math majored senior student. As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring, I want to handle the ideology of maths to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life. iGEM provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization.
In this group, I am the unique girl among nine boys, and the most frequently spoken of mine is ""Oh, it's my duty to get some soy sauce! "" Strange, huh?  The  connotation of it is not words but meanings. Those guys are too gentle to arrange me doing something of coding.So I am more involved in clerical works, I design the team uniform and our logo,arrange the scheduling and get in touch with sponsors and alumni connection. My life is full of unpredictable tasks, who can tell me what is the next?

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

We have access to the original MG1655 (""Parent"") and its derived strain, MG1655 PT5-dxs PT5-idi PT5-ispB PTe-ispDF (""Roche""). We first transformed these two strains with pPCB15 for orange beta-carotene production ( Week 3 ). pPCB15 was also transformed into TOP10 to see if it would work in a strain with normal FPP flux. pPCB15 has chloramphenicol-resistance selection marker so the transformed bacteria were grow on media with chloramphenicol.
On agar plates, pPCB15 produced yellow pigments in all three strains, with increasing intensity in the order: TOP10 < original MG1655 < MG1655 PT5-dxs PT5-idi PT5-ispB PTe-ispDF (photo below). The results indicated that it is feasible to introduce carotene synthesising pathway in E.coli, and that even in strains with normal FPP flux (i.e. TOP10), the yellow pigment production is still relatively fast (overnight incubation) and easily visualised. However, as mentioned above, since the effects in MG1655 and its derivative are much stronger and easier to assess, we used them as a tool to prove our concepts and test our Biobricks.

Construct composite Biobrick CrtEBI
We wish to produce the first coloured compound in the pathway, lycopene (red), which can then be converted into other colours by subsequent enzymatic reaction.
In order to “pause” at lycopene, we need enzymes CrtE, CrtB and CrtI only. Currently in the registry there is no available Biobrick containing CrtEBI, so we decide to construct our own.
After transforming E. coli with K118014 (rbs+CrtE), K118006 (rbs+CrtB) and K118005 (rbs+CrtI), we construct composite biobrick by ligating the three genes together.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," with human practices, we talked with Dr. Robert Meckin and Dr. Andrew (Andy) Balmer to discuss and learn about Human Practices and the social implications of synthetic biology. From the start, we wanted to explore the possible areas to implement the project. We thought that the water industry, specifically water treatment plants where phosphate is removed would be a good target market. Another possible area is for bioremediation purposes within eutrophic lakes or water bodies.
Throughout our team discussions, we agreed that we would need to approach companies in the water industry to understand the feasibility of our project. In addition, discussion with Robert brought up the idea of innovation in water treatment companies, in particular to answer the question: what drives water companies to adopt a new technology? The answer to this question would be important to determine whether these companies would be willing to adopt new technology such as the application of synthetic biology for water treatment. One interesting point which came up during our discussion with Andy was how we might apply our project at a large scale after iGEM and to take this into consideration when designing our product. This challenged us to think about the project’s feasibility and how it would be implemented in a real world/business scenario.
Water Industry
To determine the feasibility of our project, we had a number of detailed discussions with the water industry. Our aim in these talks was to discover how innovation works in the water industry. The answer to this question would be important to determine whether water companies would be willing to adopt new technology such as synthetic biology to treat water. By talking to various experts, we were able to understand the background of the water industry in innovation and the requirements our synthetic biology device would need to meet in order to successfully sell it to water companies. We summarized all our findings here , check it out!
Interviewing an Expert - Water Innovation (Dr. Duncan Thomas) 05/07/2017
We wanted to understand the water industry further, especially after Robert brought up an interesting point regarding innovation. We set out to interview Dr. Duncan Thomas from the Manchester Institute of Innovation in the University of Manchester that researches water technology and innovation policies.
From our interview, we learned a few important points about innovation in the water industry:
1. The UK’s water companies are heavily privatized. Each company in the water industry is very different and thus, our technology will have to fit with the different existing frameworks on a case-by-case basis. This will mean assessing the following criteria for each company/regional treatment facility:
-Current treatment methods
-Do they have a phosphate problem?
-Do they specialize in removing phosphate?
-What"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#landmines_-_-_TEXT.html," go up to €10.000,- for the screening a single construction site, ELECTRACE has only moderate fixed costs and low variable costs.  The two main elements of the ELECTRACE system, namely the genetically modified bacteria, and the potentiostat circuitry, have great potential to be mass-produced. Mass production will allow the economy of scale effect to arise, making the system very inexpensive. Also, the novel technique of paper microfluidics provides an opportunity to make our device even cheaper.   In addition to direct costs, indirect costs of using ELECTRACE as a way to detect landmines are also lower, compared with the methods currently in use. For instance, the labor costs can be greatly reduced by the fact that no expertise or advanced training is required to handle the device.
Second, ELECTRACE is a portable device , fact that makes it even more attractive to be used as a detection system for landmines. During the interviews conducted during the development stage of our system, we discovered that  poor infrastructure pose several limitations for the methods that are currently used. Mr. Brady recalled cases on Angola, where the equipment was not able to arrive at the field.By replacing the heavy machinery with our hand-held device, this limitation will be overcome.
Anther great advantage of ELECTRACE as away to screen for landmines, is the fact that is easy to handle. In this way even persons that are not familiar with technology can easily adopt and use it. This implies that organizations that are active in this field, could hire more locals by using our device. Indirect benefits represents cost-reduction, but also social integration of the people leaving in the proximity of affected areas.
Fourth, our device provides a quantifiable output. This functionality can help the organization dealing with landmines problem around the globe to chose the areas where further actions are need, based on the degree of contamination.
Ethical considerations
ELECTRACE has a two-sided impact on the world. While, the benefits (previously identified) are very easy to grasp, our iGEM team, as main developer of this device, took in consideration also the possible negative effects that  might arise by using ELECTRACE to detect land mines.These issues will be further addressed.
One main concern that may arise against using this device includes a general argument against synthetic biology is the danger that the modified organisms that are generated in the lab will fall into the wrong hands. If ELECTRACE would be a device that can be bought without any restrictions, bombs can be easily tested by their manufactures. Then, they can work on improving their quality"

This is the first BioBrick part that succeeded in 3OC12HSL dependent CmR and C4HSLproduction. In our experiment, we used 3OC12HSL instead of 3OC6HSL as an inducer in order to circumvent crosstalk. Using this part with the plasmid that is constitutively expressing LuxR, we succeeded in confirming LuxR activates the expression of CmR and RhlI in the presence of 3OC12HSL.
To confirm C4HSL production, we measured the expression of GFP in reporter cells by flow cytometer. (Fig. 5-1-2-2).

Now we have focused on how parameters affect more the output of the system. Firstly duplicated the strength of the promoter 2.

If we don’t do any more we can see that LacI still wins the battle with c1ts
Turning off the bistable
It is logical to think that if the c1ts promoter is stronger the state 0 will be more stable. However, there are still oscillations that finish with LacI victory. In any case is interesting to remark that in this experiment a sharply increased in c1ts is produced at the end, that suggests that the competition is not so unbalanced.

The behavior is the same that in case 0. Temperature is a effective way to turn on the bistable.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#interlab_-_-_TEXT.html," OD600 measurements to cell concentrations and hence cell counts.
Counting colony forming units (CFUs) from the sample. Since a colony on a plate can be grown from one cell, an easy method to count how many living cells are in a particular medium would be to plate an aliquot of it and count how many colonies form. We can then use the absorbance measurements made from the same samples to convert between absorbance and CFUs.
If the data from these 2 experiments appear reproducible across the range of iGEM teams undertaking the study, we will have helped create a new powerful technique for the Synthetic Biology community as a whole.
Protocols
An important criteria for the interlab to be valid is that all teams used the same protocol in carrying out their measurements. These protocols can be found on the following link: https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/0/09/2018_InterLab_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf
Results
Initally the tranformation of all plasmids gave colonies on LB+Chlor plates but we had issues with some devices (1,4 &5) failing to grow during the 6 hour incubation periods during day 2 of the plate reader protocol. After a few attempts and the same failed results we resorted back to transforming directly from the kit plates again. By now, we were running low on many of the supplied materials - namely the kit plate plasmids and the silica beads to calibrate the plate reader. This led to us collaborating with the University of Warwick iGEM team where they gave us their spare materials and we gave them other iGEM supplied plasmids that they required which were unrelated to Interlab.
After the second round of transformations we were able to conduct the whole protocol and get results that passed common sense checks and these were what we eventually submitted.
Evaluation
After completing the Interlab project here are our thoughts:
To try to develop a protocol which ensures results can be compared between scientists, the Interlab protocol requires all the plate readers must be calibrated against known concentrations of Fluorescein. These preset concentrations resulted in high fluorescence requiring a low gain to cover the range. This  resulted in the measurements made of the cells being incredibly low, making noise an appreciable factor. Hence we would suggest either altering the preset concentrations to be lower or finding an alternative method of carrying out this calibration.
We could not understand the reasoning for growing the cells in foil-wrapped falcon tubes and felt this was an unnecessary step and time/material wasting.
We believe that since the Interlab protocol is meant be"

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," T7 Express Iq cell lines. From the results shown here and other experiments, we  concluded that the NEB T7 Express Iq cells produced higher levels of the acetaldehyde intermediate.
Alcohol Dehydrogenase Activity
Ethanol production was tested using EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems). The figure below shows percent ethanol production in T7 Express Iq cells (NEB) in 2% versus 10% glucose medium over 24 and 48 hours. The sample grown in 2% Glucose over 24 hours yielded 0.02% ethanol, and the sample grown in 10% Glucose over 48 hours yielded 0.018% ethanol. From the results shown here, and other experiments, we have concluded that our modified E. coli is in fact producing ethanol.  Furthermore, we have also concluded that increasing amounts of glucose does not lead to higher ethanol production. It is possible that these lines are only producing low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase and we are seeing a buildup of acetaldehyde in these same lines. It may be necessary to re-evaluate the original operon and re-engineer it to improve the adh gene thereby increasing production of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme.
Construction of a Glucose Insensitive Inducible Promoter in E. coli
Although the constitutively expressed Escherichia coli sigma 70 promoter (J23101) has proven to be adequate for expression of our fatty acid and alcohol genes, the hope was to construct a new promoter for the iGEM registry that was inducible, but not sensitive to glucose or other sugars. The inducible promoter, trc, was a promising option.  This promoter originated as a fusion between the trp (tryptophan inducible/glucose repressible) promoter and the lac (lactose inducible/glucose repressible) promoter (De Boer et. al. 1983). The trc fusion promoter was engineered in such a way that gene expression can be up-regulated in the presence of IPTG, but expression is unaffected by fluctuations in glucose concentration.
In spite of the encouraging research, trc has proven to be a complicated promoter to work with in the lab. With only 62 base pairs it is hard obtain definitive visual results and manipulate such small fragments between plasmids, cells, etc.  There has been little success with this small fragment. Many techniques have aimed at transforming trc into pSB1C3 iGEM plasmid for submission to"

Thousands of years ago, nature spirits and humans coexisted as one. They walked the ground we walked on. They lived in the valleys we lived in. Until humans began harming their homes, their families. That was when gods split their world with ours. The Night of Crystal Rift. We only know about Karuna from ancient scriptures, this alternate dimension on Earth. It is said the spirits still walk the ground we walk on, but we don't see them. We don't hear them. Then two decades ago, the gods decided to give humans a second chance. Scyllarus. That's what they call her. When she was born into Karuna, sages on Earth saw the dark night glow. An orange aurora streaked the sky. She is the daughter of the wild, destined to synthesize the bridge between the human world and the spiritual world. The day she stepped into the human world, she took the name of Nupur. Her spiritual powers took form in tangible human abilities. Her strong base notes. Her swift coding skills.

Outreach
CHEM21 Conference in Stuttgart
On 26.03.2015 we joined the CHEM21 conference in Stuttgart to start off our joined iGEM project. CHEM21 brings together six pharmaceutical companies, 13 Universities and four small to medium enterprises from across Europe with the aim to develop sustainable biological and chemical alternatives to finite materials.
Since the Graz University of Technology and the University of Manchester are also part of CHEM21, it made perfect sense to introduce partners in industry and other universities to iGEM and our project ideas. We presented our project goals in the CHEM21 meeting and talked to participants of the conference in front of our poster.
For us it was also an excellent opportunity to get feedback on our idea of a trans European team and also hear some opinions on our research project concepts. Based on these comments we finally decided on a joint project and were able to start working out the details and design experiments.
School Visits
Austria
As part of our public outreach we visited two Highschools in Austria, BRG Kepler in Graz and HLW Deutschlandsberg, to talk about biotechnology, synthetic biology and our iGEM project.
To make sure the students (most of them 17 or 18 years old) knew what we were going to talk about we began our presentation with a short explanation of DNA,  genes, transcription and translation followed by the principles of plasmids, cloning and their use for BioTech and SynBio. That theory was also illustrated by several examples of how those two research fields are a substantial part of our everyday life, even if we might not always be aware of it. Thereafter we took time to answer questions arising from our audience regarding these topics as well as biotechnology programs at university.
After all that talking the students got a chance to get their hands right onto the topic and isolated DNA from strawberries.  It was surprising to see the huge amount of slimy mass consisting of DNA and proteins they could isolate from a small amount of strawberry; they even took their results home in micro centrifuge tubes.
For us it was quite an experience to talk about synthetic biology in front of pupils since we were only used to discussing our results and scientific topics in front of fellow students or teachers. Especially explaining complex biological processes (such as transcription and translation) and methods (for example PCR) made it quite challenging for us, as we had to simplify our language to make sure"

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Public Engagement and Education
Sharing new means and methods of teaching and learning with students of all ages.
Developing teaching resources has been integral to our Human Practices focus; we wanted to spread the word about synthetic biology to those who may not have encountered in detail the options this field offers yet. Furthermore, we wanted to offer safe insights into how individuals could gain access to this knowledge and use it wisely.
In fact the scope of our efforts - generating multiple platforms for sharing educational material and making new knowledge and practical skills accessible - became our iTECH model: integrating activities in the areas of TEACHING, EVOLVING, COMMUNITY and HEALTH.
Teaching
Our A-level Teaching Programme
Our education programme incorporated work on 4 main areas (detailed below). For each area participants had to imagine themselves in a position of authority and respond to an issue at hand. We also emphasized the importance of ethical decision making. Just because we have the know-how, does it give us the right to continue to modify our world through biological manipulation, and what are the risks and benefits of doing so.
How does it work?
Each of the first 3 subject areas (health, environment and art & design) constituted 2 separate case studies linked to a variety of resources (videos, scientific articles, images and websites). One main question or task was set in relation to each available case, encouraging students to research specific questions and present an opinion, idea or perspective on one of the two options. For the health area we in fact received such good submissions that we judged these as separate categories in the end!
Each set of 2 cases were left running on the website for a period of 2 weeks, following which work was submitted by email to a central contact point and assessed by the Human Practices team.
Any submission was carefully read and individuals or groups were given personalized feedback by email (we were always impressed with the quality of the pieces entered!).
Rewarding student efforts
Once the students had submitted all their work on the various case studies, we compiled their efforts in each category and presented them through igem.se.
Here, viewers were invited to vote via an integrated survey on the best work in each field; the overall"

UT-Tokyo,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo-Software#Project#GeneNetworkGame_-_-_TEXT.html," modeling and creating simulations.  It will be a first step towards using more technical modelig software such as Matlab.
Background
Planning Biobrick construction is perhaps the most important iGEM activities. To do this, participants have to be able to understand constructs designed by other teams and go on to design their own. This includes knowledge on what will happen when a specific BioBrick promoter is connected to a gene, and further when such complex parts are combined.
In addition, in order to reach a full understanding of how a developed construct may behave, we believe it is important for one to be able to create an image of how protein concentrations may evolve in time. We have found that this is often especially difficult for students getting started with iGEM, at which time many seem to have a fuzzy image of how protein production could be 'on' or 'off.' As the project proceeds, students may need to assess the feasibility of the constructs they intend to create (for have already created). Many teams do not get around to doing this or in some cases attempt this at a stage when construction has already ended and it is too late to turn back. If you open a textbook on systems biology to learn the dynamics, students may find themselves put off by the mathematical knowledge required or the volume of the text, often unnecessary for a simple iGEM project. So it would be helpful if there is a tutorial from which beginners can learn sufficient information about gene network dynamics for an iGEM project. Such aid should result in more teams being able to predict and to test the behavior of their constructs,  leading to improvement of the quality of the parts submitted.
We have also created a tutorial for the purpose of helping users understanding what modeling is and what sort of information can be gained from it, as well as creating their own model. We have noticed that many iGEM participants want to make models for their project,  and also that iGEM HQ is recommending modeling. However, large number of students do not even know what modeling is, and tend to leave it up to members who have technical skills, if present. We wanted to make a tutorial for such people to learn what can be achieved by modeling. This basic program will hopefully be a sufficient stepping stone before beginners move on to more advance software such as Matlab.

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," form with the predicted total γ-polyglutamic acid production Equation (32),  which confirms the correctness of the established model. Here we designed an interactive part to show the result dynamically:
The fitting result for total γ-polyglutamic acid production is also shown in Figure 8:
Figure 8: Total γ-polyglutamic acid production changing over time in one fermentation. Parameter m indicates the intracellular glutamate concentration threshold. Only the bacteria whose intracellular glutamate concentration is greater than m can survive when tetracycline is added to the medium. We fit the process of increasing m from 20 to 200 mM with interval 3 mM, generating 60 curves, which is expressed in different colors in this figure.
It can be seen from Figure 8 that the concentration of γ-polyglutamic acid increases first and then decreases with increasing m at a certain point in time (e.g. t=32h). When m is too small, the total concentration is small due to the presence of low production cells; and when m is too large, the total concentration of γ-polyglutamic acid is small because the tetracycline has a strong inhibitory effect and the total number of cells is small. When the concentration of tetracycline is too high, the bacteria hardly grow, which is also consistent with the observed results.
We chose t=32 h as the time of one fermentation. When γ-polyglutamic acid production reaches the highest at t=32 h, m equals to 132 mM, which is shown in Figure 9. This result demonstrates we need to adjust the concentration of tetracycline to make the strains whose intracellular glutamate concentration below 132 mM to die, and the strains whose intracellular glutamate concentration is above this threshold can continue to survive. In that case, the maximum production increase is about 35%. We can also find the fact that production will drop quickly after its increase reaches the peak, which indicates that precise regulation of tetracycline is needed near the critical point in industrial production.
Figure 9: Relationship between total γ-polyglutamic acid production and threshold m at t=32 h. Only the bacteria whose intracellular glutamate concentration is greater than m can survive when tetracycline is added to the medium. Maximum production increase is achieved at m=132 mM.

Sample Guided Questions
Should the government be able to grant patents over biological materials, such as specific genes or bioengineered systems?
The iGEM Foundation encourages student researchers to develop biobricks that are open-source and freely available to the scientific community. What is your opinion on this practice? Do you think students should be allowed to obtain patents for their research?
In regard to your area of expertise, do you think it is ethical to edit the human genome using CRISPR/Cas9? How do you foresee the government regulating this practice?

Janus are proteins that are produced by filamentous fungi, such as Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Many different aspects of fungal development have been attributed to Janus. For example, they are thought to play a role in the formation of aerial hyphae and fruiting bodies. Because Janus could assemble at the medium–air interface and cause the surface tension to be lowered, they could allow hyphae to breach the water–air interface [2].
Figure 3. Janus could assemble at the medium–air interface and cause the surface tension to be lowered, they could allow hyphae to breach the water–air interface.
One of the most important features of Janus is that they are able to assemble spontaneously into amphipathic monolayers at hydrophobic–hydrophilic interfaces [3].What's more, the stability of assembled Janus differs and on the basis of this characteristic two classes of Janus can be distinguished [4]. And the essential differences lie in the occurrence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues i.e. according to their hydropathy plots [1]. Class I Janus generate very insoluble assemblies, which can only be dissolved in strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid, while assemblies of class II Janus can be dissolved in ethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate or through the application of pressure or lowering of the temperature [5].

RMI Gala (Maryland Regional Manufacturing Institute)
May 26, 2016
We were invited to showcase our iGEM research project at the Regional Manufacturing Institute, along with many other student demonstrating projects in coding, robotics, 3D printing, and more. The RMI gala is acclaimed as one of the best networking events in manufacturing. Throughout the event, we talked to leaders in manufacturing, engineers, and scientists, discussing the future of manufacturing, how we, as students, envisioned our role in that future, and how synthetic biology could one day be a significant aspect in the future of manufacturing.
We received positive feedback regarding the manufacturing aspect of our research; many on the business side of manufacturing affirmed the benefits of innovating biological solutions as alternatives to the current solutions. Furthermore, many commended us for pursuing a project designed to be implemented in manufacturing, and how having bright young minds will further the field of manufacturing.

Kil Protein
BACKGROUND
      In wild-type E.coli exist a plasmid named colE1, the plasmid encodes colicin gene, the release of colicin gene, immune gene of Escherichia coli in chain( in plasmid colE1 were known as CEA, kil, Imm gene). The expression of kil gene can promote the colicin release to kill the other strain . This is because the expression of kil gene can significantly increase the bacterial outer membrane permeability, so as to effectively promote the secretion of periplasmic colicin secreted to the extracellular.
      We cloned kil gene, to construct a recombinant plasmid vector,to connect it to the downstream of alkaline cellulase gene,which was screened in the Saline Lake of Inner Mongolia.
      Then we transformed the recombinant vector into the BL21 E.col., when a particular efficient promoter, they successively expression. Kil protein accumulate in the periplasmic space of the bacteria and the periplasmic space was increased and the membrane permeability of bacteria was improved, thereby the alkaline cellulase can secrete out of bacteria.It can reduce the enzyme extraction separation process and can solve the problem of large number of secreted alkaline cellulase.
1.The acquisition of kil gene
       It has not wild-type Escherichia coli in our laboratory and we don't have the colE1 plasmid. Considering the length of the kil only 138bp, we obtain the gene sequence by ncbi and synthesize the total gene of kil.
