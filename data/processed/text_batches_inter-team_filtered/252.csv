DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," I were happy to see that the transformations I did yesterday looked good, meaning the ligations Patrick did Wednesday most likely went well! We have a few colonies on our negative controls, but not at all as many as we have on the actual ligations, which is a great sign. We restreaked 4 colonies from each ligation so we can start overnight cultures of them on Monday. We also ran verification PCRs of the ligations we did last week and gave Maya a hand with the 20 minipreps and 40 verification PCRs she had to do! Hopefully they all work out, because working in the lab until 18:00 really sucks :P.

Meeting with supervisors and the 2009 team
Today we had a meeting with Mogens and Chris, our supervisors, Sebastien, our instructor, as well as Hans and Christian from last years iGEM team. We prepared a rough draft of our jamboree presentation and presented it to them to get their feedback. We got alot of great input about things we could add/change in the presentation to make it more understandable, so that was great. Hans and Christian also told us about their last 5 weeks before the wiki freeze last year and gave us alot of great tips. It was really great that they were able to answer all our questions about the jamboree, the poster we have to make as well as the wiki. We also talked about the requirements for the Gold Medal, and how we plan to fulfill one of them, and got some great input from everyone. All in all it was a great meeting.
Since we had to prepare for the meeting, not a whole lot got done in the lab. I transformed some ligations that had been done the day before, with the help of Anja from the Repressor group. The Repressor group started 20 overnight cultures of their ligations so they can miniprep them tomorrow and run some verification PCRs on the plasmids.

In the quest of the missing transformants!
The transformations we made last Thursday containing the backbone plasmid pSB1C3 and one of the four inserts Gifsy1/2 promoters or the promoter region plus repressor had grown on the plates. We unfortunately had a lot of background growth on our negative controls. But as we are a very positive group, we decided to check our colonies to see if we would be lucky"

Customers and Sales - Both having a customer base (market segment control) and sales to these customers were taken into consideration based on the number of customers and the size of the contracts that we would hold with these members based on previous evaluations made in our financial reporting
Investment - Finally, contribution through investments or loans are considered to count towards the value of the company. This was determined by estimated contributions from 2014-2016.
See the figure below for a summary of our evaluation:
Funding Our Venture
In order to gain the funds required, a financial commitment is required.  To achieve this we have demonstrated a need for multiple rounds of funding from government granting programs, industry collaboration and partnerships, angels, and venture capitalists.
At our present stage, we plan to facilitate the need for our approximately $450,000 start-up costs through government granting programs, personal funding, and industry collaboration.  Our team aims to use numerous provincial and federal opportunities to subside salaries, reagent and equipment costs, as well as the legal and administrative concerns.
In the subsequent years we plan on strategically targeting angel investment as a method to ensure our technologies development.  Manufacturing opportunities will allow for decreased cost of prototyping development and producing our product.
After release of our product into the market in 2016, we aim to seek venture capital funding to take our company to the next level, expanding into new domestic and international markets across the world.

Introduction of Interlab
Reliable and repeatable measurement plays an important role as an engineering discipline in synthetic biology. The InterLab Study aims to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurement, thus to improve the measurement tools and methods which can enable labs to reliably build upon others’ work. It will promote the collaboration within the synthetic biology community. Hence, it may propel the synthetic biology to achieve its full potential.
The previous InterLab studies showed that measuring GFP expression in absolute fluorescence units calibrated against a known concentration of fluorescent molecule can greatly reduce the variability in different labs’ measurements.
The Fifth Year InterLab’s goal is to remove another source of variability, the number of cells in the sample, by using new cell-counting method.
GreatBay_China investigation had helped in answering the question:Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

Phylogenetic analysis
Using Clustalw2, we could describe adenine aptamer sequences evolution change. Thus, sequences in category 1 more similar than category 2 since the sequences in category 1 have the same secondary structures. However, the sequences in category 1 and 2 mixes in the whole sequences guide trees. Since the adenine aptamers have completely different secondary structures from theophylline, we didn’t compare adenine aptamer with theophylline.

Secondary structure and free energy
Two representatives of the adenine aptamers have been reported (Figure10). One is ydhL A-riboswitch and the other is add A-riboswitch. Both of them have the same secondary structure which have been demonstrated by our previous prediction (Figure 6A).
A remarkable feature of the ligand bound scaffolds is the formation of a junctional core involving five stacked triples (Ronald R. Breaker,3 and Dinshaw J. Patel1et al.2004). The crystal structures show that the bound ligand is directly involved in a Watson-Crick base pair at position 65 making this residue particularly important. Our sequence alignment also indicates that position 65 is consensus sequence.
Notably, the structure-function relationship in adenine aptamer would be more precisely described by their crystal structure nut not the secondary structure. In fact, we cannot predict the two conformation of the adenine aptamer by mfold.

Results
To find out the structure-function relationship and correlations between these aptamer sequences, we did sequences alignment which indicates several important consensus sequences and the analysis of secondary structure give us more details about the dynamic processing."

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#TERRA Software_-_-_TEXT.html," closed and control syringe B is open. When dispensing into a well, the output specified by the user is selected and all other outputs are directed to waste. Once the dispensing is completed all outputs are directed to waste while the XY Plane moves to the next well; this process is repeated until all wells specified by the user have been hit.
Controlling the XY-Plane
The XY Plane software is responsible for taking the well coordinates given by the user and moving the the plate to each coordinate during dispensing. The software snake loops through all the wells, going through row by row, on the vessel and compares each to the coordinate array given by the user. If there is a match between the a well on the vessel and a well in the coordinate array, XY Plane moves to that well to dispense. This process continues until the software has hit all the wells in the coordinate array.
To accomplish we needed to calculate the number of steps between wells to program the stepper motors. Given either a 24, 96, or 384 well plate, we calculated the steps between wells for each plate by using the distance between wells and the circumference of the pulleys.
In addition to moving the well plate for dispensing, the XY Plane software is also responsible for homing TERRA. Before a run on TERRA, the system needs to be homed in order to start from a known location. The system is homed by moving the well plate so that left-most corner is under the nozzle. Because the well plate can be in any location on the XY Plane, contact switches are used on both the X and Y paths send a signal to to halt the stepper motors once they’ve reached either end.

responsible for holding up the common sense in the chem lab.
With Carla, we have a trueblood noble in our ranks. That said Carla had the funniest reply to her lacking attendance for one of our weekly seminars, stating that she had to supervise the gardeners which took longer than expected on that day. Noblesse obliges.
On a more serious note Carla was one of the driving forces in the design of our chemistry departments experiments doing a lot of research and burying us under a mountain of synthesis papers, which was necessary to derive the reactions to synthesize the three siderophores from scratch for testing purposes.
Additionally, Carla enabled a lot of our early lab work in the biochemistry department by accompanying the few Life Science people which had time to come to the lab, so our promise to work in groups of two in the lab could be fulfilled.

Nico is a 23 year old German and Slovene. Since 2013 he studies nanoscience as a graduate student. As part of the nano division his job in the iGEM-Team is to produce a lung-on-a-chip to simulate the in vivo functions of lung cells regarding toxicology of our siderophores, while also substituting animals as laboratory test subjects. He joined iGEM because of the great opportunity to work in such an interdisciplinary team. As the best styled wizard in the lab, he is not only able to perfectly well dress like a muggle, but also matches his lab coat with his wand.

Valerie has been in the team since the beginning of the project and established herself as sponsoring queen involved in organising everything. She is probably the only morning person in the team and spent every free minute in the labs where she proved herself irreplaceable. She took care of keeping everything in order and made sure we did not descend into chaos, mainly overseeing the lab books and pushing everybody in keep themselves updated (hence her deep-seated contempt for loose paper). Besides she worked on our wiki and helped to organise Human Practice activities.

Starting the team
Beginning in january and february members of the former iGEM team from Bielefeld started seminars to inform interested students about synthetic biology, iGEM and the past Bielefeld projects. In March the final 2012 iGEM Bielefeld team was formed of 15 students and weekly meetings began. Our team was established and it was time to find a suitable project.
Find a project
The first weekly meeting were more like big group brainstorming and we discussed idea, which in some cases were totally different from each other. Everyone had to inform about ideas of others so that, in the end, we all could discuss together.
First project ideas were:
the detection of multiresistent pathogens
communication between bacteria and fungi using quorum sensing
a bacterial hand warmer
a possibility to detect and destroy mold fungus
something about spontaneous combustion of hay bale
an enzyme dispenser
For most of the ideas little information was available. For example spontaneous combustion of hay bales is probably a combination of the metabolisms of different microorganisms and fungus. After some reports in media and press about the environmental effects of steroid hormones, we decided to go for hormones. From the beginning our aim was not to detect but to degrade hormones. We found several possible ways for degradation as there are the hydrolysis"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," zif268, now the most-commonly studied zinc finger. This paved the way for construction of binding models to describe how zinc fingers bind to DNA, setting the foundation for future custom engineering of zinc finger proteins.
CEO Edward Lanphier founds Sangamo Biosciences
Edward Lanphier leaves Somatix Therapy Corporation and makes a deal for exclusive rights to the work of Srinivan Chandrasegaran of Johns Hopkins University who combined the Fok I nuclease with zinc fingers.
Srinivasan Chandrasegaran publishes work on fusing the Fok I nuclease to zinc fingers
By attaching nuclease proteins to zinc fingers, a new genome editing tool was created. The DNA-binding specificity of zinc fingers combined with the DNA-cutting ability of nucleases opened up possibilities for future research in gene therapy by allowing researchers to directly modify the genome though use of zinc finger nucleases.
Sangamo enters the public sector
In April 2000, five years after its founding, Sangamo Biosciences goes public offering 3.5 million shares at a starting value of $15 per share.
Sangamo patents zinc finger nuclease technology
Sangamo's patent, titled ""Nucleic acid binding proteins (zinc finger proteins design rules)"", ensures that any use or production of zinc fingers with attached nucleases is the intellectual property of Sangamo.
Rapid open source production of zinc finger nucleases becomes available
Researcher Keith Joung of Harvard University and Mass. General Hospital develops a method for making zinc finger nuclease proteins that bind to custom target sequences, utilizing a bacterial two-hybrid screening system to identify specific zinc finger binders to a DNA sequence of interest.
Zinc finger nuclease enters clinical trials
Sangamo and University of Pennsylvania begin clinical trials with a zinc finger nuclease designed to target the CCR5 gene and inhibit HIV. Success of this therapeutic could prove a significant advance for gene therapy.
Context-dependency improves open-source zinc finger engineering
Keith Joung publishes tables of zinc finger binding sites that account for context-dependent effects and can be rearranged to form custom zinc finger proteins that bind to a variety of DNA sequences. This greatly increases the ease of engineering novel zinc fingers based on the structures of previously characterized zinc fingers.
Harvard iGEM develops a novel method to engineer custom zinc fingers
Using novel integration of existing technologies, we have developed a rapid, comparatively low-cost, open source method for making thousands of custom zinc fingers by integrating MAGE, lambda red, and chip-based synthesis technologies. Our work greatly increases the ease of"

Each fraction contained active laccase able to oxidize ABTS (see Figure 12). After 1 hour saturation was observed with ~52 µM oxidized ABTS. After 12 hours ~10 µM ABTS got reduced again, if referred to fraction 6. This behavior has been observed in the activity plot of TVEL0 before, indicating, that the oxidation catalyzed by this laccase is reversible. Additionally protein concentrations of each fraction were identified using the  Bradford protocol. The tested fractions showed different amounts of protein after rebuffering,  ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 mg mL-1. Fraction 7, containing the most protein and also most of active laccase was chosen for subsequent activity  tests of ECOL . The protein concentration was reduced to 0.03 mg mL-1 for each measured sample to allow a comparison between  TVEL0 measurements and ECOL measurements.
Figure 12: ECOL laccase activity measured in 100 mM sodium acetate  buffer (pH 5), 0.1 mM ABTS, to a final volume of 200 µL at 25 °C over a time period of 12 hours. Each tested fraction  reveals activity reaching saturation after 2.5 to 4 hours with a maximum of ~52 µM ABTSox (fraction 7). (n=4)
ECOL pH optimum
Note: The experimental setup for the pH acticity assay was not well chosen. The buffering capacity of sodium acetate buffer is restricted to a smaller pH range than used in this experiment. The activity assay was optimized after the Regionals in Amsterdam to ensure correct measurements and values.
To determine at which pH the ECOL laccase has its optimum in activity, a gradient of  sodium acetate buffer pHs was prepared. Starting with pH 1 to pH 9 ECOL activity was  tested using the described conditions above and 0.03 mg mL-1 protein. The results are shown in Figure 13. A distinct pH  optimum can be seen at pH 5. Saturation is reached after 2.5 hours with 53% oxidization of ABTS by the ECOL laccase at pH 5 (53 µM oxidized ABTS). The other"
Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Biobrick Design_-_-_TEXT.html," protein allows the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons that carry a methyl group, i.e. xylene, toluene and 1-chloro-3-methyl-benzene. The A domain of the XylR protein (sensing domain), binds to the pollutant molecule. This leads to the formation of a tetramer. The C domain is involved in the dimerization of XylR, which is ATP dependent. The made up tetramer acts as an activator transcriptional factor for the Pu promoter through the DNA binding D domain.
Figure 8: The XylR CDS structure
Pu promoter
Pu is a promoter found in the toluene recognition system and is composed of 320 bp. This promoter is available on the iGEM registry at this ID access: BBa_I723020.
We chose to use this promoter because of its sensibility to the transcriptional regulator XylR bound to xylene, toluene or 1-chloro-3-methyl-benzene.
GLuc gene
This gene is found in a well-known organism, the copepod Gaussia princeps. It encodes for the Gaussia luciferase enzyme, also known as GLuc, which is involved in a bioluminescence process. This enzyme degrades its substrate, coelenterazine, into a product, celenteramide. With an optimal substrate level, this step produces energy in the form of light that can be detected with a fixed spectrophotometer at 488nm.
We chose to use the GLuc-His part, a gene of 522 bp, available on the iGEM registry at the (BBa_K1732027) which codes for the Gaussia luciferase followed by 6 histidines and optimized it for E.coli. In our plasmid, this gene is positioned after an inducible promoter, the Pu promoter, to report the activation of the toluene recognition system.
The Gaussia luciferase needs the addition of substrate to ensure its activity because this molecule is not synthetized by our biosensor. Therefore, in the laboratory, luciferase substrate can be added at the same time in each sample ensuring that every measurement will be taken at the same time. This allow a better consistency between our different results. Also, due to its secreted form, lysing cells in order to assay GLuc activity is not necessary.
The Gaussia luciferase is an ideal reporter gene because of its stability at high temperature thanks to disulfide bonds and because it has extremely high activity in light"

Plasmid PCR redo from July 21 to verify signaling circuit in AC plasmid
Purpose: use PCR to verify the presence of PQ-B-R-OU-B in the psB1AC3 vector for colonies 6 and 7, and to have a clean negative control lane. A pTaq PCR was set up using BBK CP F/R and LuxPQ F and LuxOU R primers using the following conditions: 94ºC for 3 minutes; 36X (94ºC for 30 seconds; 55ºC for 45 seconds; 72ºC for 6 min 30 sec); 72ºC for 10 minutes; held at 4ºC. The products were then run on a 0.8% agarose gel. The only bands seen on the gel were those of the positive control (PQ-B-R-OU-B in AK), and we must therefore either repeat this PCR, or use a different verification technique (i.e. Restriction Digest).

Implementing the Notecard Reader
The bacterial transformation activity was fixed in the morning and I added to the conditionals that tell you if the question has already been answered so once a question has been answered it cannot be answered again unless the quiz has been completed or reset at any time. I also added a further instructions option to the PCR machine, which gives a notecard for now, but I am interested in trying the instructions as audio. The instructions are for those who throw themselves into the lab first thing or those who need a reminder of how to operate their tools in second life.
The first and second construction site now use the notecard reader and I added more options to the Sequencing station so more can be sequenced. Now I just need to know the sequence of base pairs for each notecard I will be using. At the moment the notecards I am testing with contain random data. Ligating two genes together may be something I will be adding to the restriction digest activity once I can get it all working together since it is just adding more conditions. However, I would have to redesign how you could put things together so I believe I will hold off coding anymore of this until the activity has been"

The 1/8” diameter holes are arranged in a grid, spaced 0.3” from one another and 0.15” from the edge of the board, enabling two boards to be connected forming a space of 0.3” between all holes. This is compatible with an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside. Neptune’s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.
To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts. These parts hold and align the servo and syringe combination and enable the fluid motion of both. From 100mL to 10uL, Neptune’s 3D printed hardware will adjust in shape to accommodate different size syringes and servos to meet synthetic biologist’s experimental needs. While Neptune has tested servos and syringes on file to choose from by default, should a biologist need more volume to dispense or more precision in flow-rates they can input their own servo or syringe to obtain the exact response they desire. The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringes’ dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.
To bridge the gap between clicking a computer screen and moving fluid through a chip, users must select servos and syringes to move this fluid in the first place. In order to perfectly match the requirements of synthetic biologists to an appropriate servo/syringe combination, Neptune has an algorithm to convert the desired max volume and minimum tolerance of each dispenser to published values for servos and syringes. On the Build page this is seen clearly, when entering in fundamental requirements results in all servo/syringe combinations that can fulfill those specifications—even including price ranges.
Reliability and repeatability of experiments are essential for Neptune to deliver results. The firmware developed for the Arduino Mega ensures these standards are met and maintained. Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates. In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use the Arduino IDE should"

Introduction
The next step in this point is to model the actuations that allow us to modify the state of the system, inducing a switch in the flip-flop.
These actuators are:
Using a thermosensitive repressor protein. By increasing the temperature of the bacteria, the protein is rapidly degraded, thus helping the change.
Adding IPTG. The IPTG molecules bind competitively to the other repressor. Therefore, the inhibition of the transcription by the repression is not permitted. The IPTG induction is achieved assuming a Hill kinetic for the ligand-binding.
Diagram
Then, the model is complemented with 3 new elements:
IPTG: it represents the level of IPTG specie.
Reaction from Repressor2: It represents the forced degradation of Repressor2 when we increase the temperature.
Equations
Before describing the equations of the modified model, the next list shows the new species, and parameters.
Species:
IPTG
Repressor1
Parameters:
Ki: Binding constant for IPTG to the repressor
η: Maximum number of bound IPTG molecule per repressor
ktemp: degradation constant due to the temperature effect
Also, some further assumptions are made:
The thermosensitive protein reacts to a rise temperature disappearing faster.
To model the IPTG induction, we use a simple expression for the ligand-binding. This expression is taken from the document ‘Design and Construction of synthetic gene regulatory network’ by Timothy S. Gardner. This formula assumes an effect similar to a repression reaction. It modify the transcription rate law again.
Then, the equations are:
Increase of temperature:
repressor2 → null
IPTG Induction:
RNAp + promoter1 + repressor1 + IPTG → + promoter1 + repressor1 + mRNA1"

Update on our general tasks
The mock-up for our presentation is finished and looks marvelous, thanks to the ICMS Animation Studio! Besides this great news, there was also sad news. The iGEM team from Delft quit organizing the Discovery Festival. The remaining four Dutch iGEM teams (from Groningen, Wageningen, Amsterdam and Eindhoven) are now working extra hard to accomplish the ideas.
Lab results
The PCR-step and gel extraction for the BioBricksTM had to be redone because of mixed up microcentrifuge tubes. Furthermore, the restriction and ligation for the BioBricksTM are made. We made chlorampenicol plates and we transformed the Nova Blue E. coli with the ligation mix to obtain colonies carrying the BioBricksTM. But since we didn't place the plates containing E. coli upside down, they dried out and the transformation failed. Therefore the transformation is repeated. Unfortunately, the BioBrickTM assembly of pSBIC3+GECO failed. We couldn't find any colonies on the plates and in the bottles. To check the PCR product we used, we tested it on a gel. The gel showed that we got the right inserts. The problem seemed to be the ligation and restriction. A new PCR product of the GECOs is made as preparation for the assembly.
Luckily, the results of the yeast transformations are positive. The single-plasmid transformations worked out well, the co-transformations however were not successful, except for the MID1+CCH1-EGFP. The medium for another co-transformation was made, but one of the required ingredients for"
GZHS-United,2018,Team:GZHS-United#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". These target sequences were then assembled into the expression vector pEASY-Blunt and then transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed protein was extracted after cell lysis.
That is the expression vector. It is controlled by T7 promoter and regulated by LacI and LacO. The expression of the two target proteins CryAa could be induced by IPTG, and both of them would be purified using nickel column due to the his-tag.
Virus design
pUCA
The plasmid pUCA contains the genome of Adedes aegypti densoviruses in pUC19.
p7NS1-GFP
The plasmid p7NS1-GFP is mostly similar to the plasmid pUCA. The difference is that the segment of gene which codes the structural protein VP is replaced by GFP.
NS1-BIT-GFP
When we insert the our target gene BmK IT1 into p7NS1-GFP, NS1-BIT-GFP was formed.
This is an overview of our virus part. First, we transformed our initial plasmids pUCA and p7NS1-GFP, respectively, into E.coli DH5α to culture in large scale, and we extracted them after some time. Then, we assembled our target gene BmK IT into p7NS1-GFP and we will get the plasmid NS1-BIT-GFP. After that, we cotranfected plasmids NS1-BIT-GFP and pUCA into Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660). Recombinant viruses were then produced by plasmid NS1-BIT-GFP, with the helper plasmid pUCA.

The different PUFs would be linked to different enzymes creating a biological conveyor belt for faster picetannol production. And then you can control when this mRNA is being made.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#OtherApplications_-_-_TEXT.html," the new poly-A tail after ribozyme cleavage ensuring the cas9 mRNA translocation and translation.
Figure 1, the sequence for the hammer head ribozyme.
Figure 2, the Sequence of the Synthetic Poly-A tail
To use the two parts in the system, the protein-encoding sequence should be put immediately downstream of the promotor and RBS. The protein-encoding sequence should be followed by the synthetic poly-A tail and then a hammerhead ribozyme. After the ribozyme the wanted non-coding RNA sequence (here: the gRNA-encoding sequence) should be placed and last another ribozyme.
Figure 3, Mechanism of the CGC1 system. The CGC1 gene is transcribed and the natural 5’ cap and the poly-A tail are added to the sequence. The two hammerhead ribozymes (HHR) induce their own cleavage, which separates the protein coding sequence from the gRNA. The natural 5´cap and the synthetic poly-A tail (Poly A) ensure the translation of the protein coding sequence (Cas9).
Gibson 2.0
The world of synthetic biology is growing tremendously fast and part of it is the development of new tools. In the year 2003, the BioBrick standard was introduced as an intelligent way of using restriction sites to construct genetic constructions, however the method is limited due to the fact that the DNA sequence needs to contain those specific restriction sites in the end of the fragments, and it can’t have any of those restriction site inside the DNA fragment.
In 2009, a method was introduced which avoids potential problems associated with restriction sites and –enzymes, called Gibson assembly. The method utilizes sequence overlaps between the two DNA fragments to fuse them together. Unlike BioBrick assembly there are no requirements on the overlapping region which is one of the strengths of Gibson assembly
Figure 4, the mechanism of Gibson assembly. 1) An exonuclease chews of one of the two strands of the two DNA fragments (blue/green and orange/green). 2) The two fragments bind together due to their overlapping region (green). 3) A DNA polymerase fills in the gaps and a ligase repair the backbone nicks. 4) The DNA fragments are fused.
Now we introduce a concept for next generation of DNA assembly, Gibson 2.0. The concept is very similar to the normal Gibson assembly and is also compatible with normal Gibson reactions at the same time, but it removes the need for a specific overlap all together. The method is inspired by our"

Using Matlab and Simbiology we modelled the stages of YF1 and like Wageningen 2016 iGEM team we modelled the YF1 light sensing protein as described by Möglich et al in the stages of Yll (light) Ydl/ld (transition) and Ydd (dark stage). We used the same mathematical formulas used in Wageningn 2016 iGEM team in describing the different stages of the light sensing protein however we set our parameter in terms of working from a rich light environment to no light. The model suggests that:
1.     The light sensing protein is not strict; all three stages of the YF1 light sensing protein can exist at the same time if some light is introduced. In fact, the light-sensing protein readily converts Ydd and Ydl/ld into Yll in the presence of any light.
2. Given long enough time in a dark environment (over the course of hours) Ydd expression will increase and all the other two stages will convert to Ydd.
3.      A second level inhibitor is needed to account for the early possible exposure of light in the lab environment.
Figure 1 is the calculated model of   and Figure 2 is how we designed our system in the Simbiology toolbox.
Figure 3 refers to the same design in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the difference in LacZ expression with the incorporated LacI repressor. The Y-axis measures level of LacZ with inhibitor binding to its promoter and the X-axis is time in hours. In theory the LacI repressor work at a constant rate over time but experimental results have demonstrated that the LacI  repressor may not be the best choice as a repressor since the LacI repressor seems to break down over time and some expression of the target gene still occurs.

Figure 12.Change in pH catalyzed by TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) using benzylpenicillin. Bromothymol blue was used to keep track of this colour change. Absorbance readings were taken at 616 nm every 30 seconds. Different amounts of TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) were tested. Commercial β-lactamase was used as a positive control. Negative controls included were bovine serum albumin, β-lactamase without the substrate and the substrate by itself.
Conclusion
We have been able to demonstrate the function our final system capable of capturing DNA with an immobilized TALE, exposing a second TALE with a reporter molecule, and detection of that reporter molecule. In our project we have utilized modelling at every step of the way to inform the course of our experiments, as well as to feed our data back into our models to generate better predictions, utilizing the full design cycle for our system. Through our characterization of parts from previous teams and the ones we have submitted ourselves we have created a collection of well documented parts that can be easily used and modified by any future team for a wide variety of applications. Finally, we are bringing our system into the final prototype stages through our work with nitrocellulose, such that our work can move beyond the proof of principle stages and make an impact in the world to reduce the risk of EHEC harming people in the future.

Self-enhancement
As scientific researchers, we must have a scientific basis for all our work, and repeatedly verify the arisen, upcoming and potential problems. Therefore, we need experts from different fields to help answer our questions in various fields. To learn about the latest research trends and enrich our project, we came to the 4th Seminar on Synthetic Biology Young Scholars.
Safety
Although Yarrowia lipolytica has undergone many tests and is a relatively mature engineered strain, but if we still have to ensure that they are always within safe limits through good laboratory practices and careful awareness. In addition, we understand environmental and personal protective measures and strictly comply with the requirements in the laboratory to prevent leakage or contamination risks.
Education
Although more and more people are paying attention to synthetic biology and molecular biology, there are still many people who have misunderstandings about biology or fear of biological tools such as transgenic technology and gene editing technology. To let more people learn about biology, we went to elementary school and brought the latest biological knowledge to the children there.
Public engagement
While conducting our experimental projects, we also actively organized or participated in communications with other iGEM teams. Through learning exchange activities again and again, we continued to draw on one of the parties and eventually improved our project.

In Science, it is all about collaborating. Working together makes better science and is fun! Throughout our iGEM summer, we have been in contact with several teams and successfully collaborated with 3 teams from 3 different continents! As part of our Biosensor project , we collaborated with the Calgary team, Canada , and built a biosensor iGEM database – sensiGEM . With the BGU Israel team, we collaborated in an experimental aspect. They sent us parts of them to clone and in return they did a western blot for us, which supports the work of the Infiltrate subproject . The Braunschweig Team from Germany was supported from us with literature they needed to continue working on their project. Below you can find a description as well as the outcome of our collaborations! As we have collaborated successfully with our partners we further provide some tips for how we think iGEM Teams can successfully collaborate.
Collaboration with the Calgary iGEM Team from Canada
   The Paris-Bettencourt-Calgary iGEM collaboration started last June when a few members from each team met at the SB6.0 synbio conference in London. After a few beers and lab stories, we learned that despite coming from the opposite sides of the globe, we were using synthetic biology to build biosensors to sense DNA. While our systems were targeted solve different problems, we were struck by a number of commonalities between these projects (Figure 1). As we shared our projects, we recalled how there was a lack of DNA biosensor parts in the Parts Registry. Moreover, we complained about the lack of organization of biosensors in the registry.

Background  
Our project is specifically aimed at terpenoid production in  E.coli. These compounds particularly in plants give off scents when produced and we hope to improve on the yield that is obtained during current chemical production techniques.
Terpenoids are characteristic molecules that derive from the condensation of 5-carbon isoprene units. They play major roles in plants such as growth regulation, signalling, and defense mechanisms.  Additionally terpenoids have a characteristic aroma.
There are two metabolic pathways used to synthesize terpenoids: the mevalonate pathway in plants and the non mevalonate pathway in E.colil (fig1). Both pathways ultimately lead to compounds: Isopentanyl pyrophosphate and dimethyl Isoprenyl pyrophosphate which are further converted into geranyl pyrophosphate farnesyl pyrophosphate to synthesize terpenes.

Due to these molecules possessing fragrance qualities, they are used in industry for the production of perfumes, cosmetics, household products, etc.
Our project focuses on the synthesis of selected terpene fragrant compounds: zingiberene, R-linalool and limonene, by expressing each enzyme in E.coli.
Limonene synthase:
Limonene is a scented cyclic terpene, from the hydrocarbon family. The major fragrance it is associated with is lemons, citrus fruits have large amounts of the compound and it is known to give off the scent associated with the fruits. Usually limonene is harvested from fruits using steam distillation or centrifugal separation, steam distillation yields around 1%, this is far greater than other distillation techniques which can yield as low as 0.1%.
Limonene is a very common ingredient in cosmetic products, often found in shampoos, lotions, perfumes and other everyday items. The demand for it is huge; as the yield is so small farming products is very wasteful.
Zingiberene Synthase:
Zingiberene synthase is an enzyme found in ginger rhizomes (Zingiber officinale). It converts farnesyl diphosphate into zingiberene and diphosphate in a single enzymatic reaction. Zingiberene ("

We then transformed a non-modified strain without our integrated cassete with the pFHC2938 plasmid. At the same time, the integrative plasmid was transformed into another E. coli strain (STBL). None of the transformations yielded any colonies, meaning that the problem came from the plasmid and not from the strain.

Outlook
More than just operons
The system we invented, as presented here, works primarily when the whole vitamin pathway fits in one operon. It was notably the case for our pathway for vitamin A, where all the required enzymes are tied together in one big polycistron.
It is still possible to implement this differentiation system for a pathway that needs several promoters to function. For this, we can put the different operons under promoters that are activated by another factor, and this factor is put in the differentiation system.
Two related technologies, CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation (Bikard 2013), appear as an ideal way to do this. It relies on a mutant of Cas9 defective for nuclease activity (dCas9), that can be targeted at about any place in the genome. This can lead to either repression of transcription, or activation by fusing a transcription activation factor to dCas9. It works on both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Perez-Pinera 2013), and is extremely versatile and programmable. As seen in our phytase project, inactivation of a gene is sometimes useful for nutrient production.
By expressing dCas9 and replacing the fluorescent proteins in our construct with CRISPR arrays, it could be possible to widely change the expression profile of the micro-organism while keeping the advantages of differentiation.

Surveys taken at Loudoun STEM Day on October 1, 2016 by the Broad Run iGEM Team
We designed a survey of 11 questions and distributed it at the event. We used the 2013 LMU-TUM Munich iGEM team’s survey as a model and created our own survey questions. We had 120 responses. The data from the survey are summarized below.
We confirmed our suspicions that people are more unfamiliar with the term synthetic biology than genetic engineering, perhaps attributable to familiarity with GMOs. Approval for genetic engineering in food had the lowest rate in comparison to medical, military, and industrial applications. More than half perceived risk with GMOs. A majority found the survey to be informative. While the preferred method for learning about genetic engineering favored reading articles, about a quarter liked to talk to scientists and another quarter liked listening to talks such as TED talks.
Farmwell Station Middle School
At the middle school, we are working with science teachers who will incorporate Building with Biology activities to supplement the 7th grade biology curriculum. The expected outcomes are; to enhance inquiry into the topic of synthetic biology while learning about its basics, to further explore this topic through conversations about its applications from the perspectives of societal and environmental benefits, safety, etc., and to encourage students to think about problems they see in the world and to consider solutions that may include genetic engineering. Please read more in our Sustainability section of the wiki page.
Summary
Collaborating with the 2016 Building with Biology project proved useful in getting the public talking about what they know of synthetic biology, what they think of it, and made us aware that we need to be more proactive in increasing these dialogs. The seemingly simple, but excellently prepared kits did just what we wanted; got students thinking and learning while doing a fun activity, and got parents, students, and adults talking about important synthetic biology technology application benefits, risks, and public safety."
Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," wedge pushes the hammer out of the latch while the spring is compressed at maximum, beginning to release the hammer. Then, the hammer switches from the lock to unlock state, allowing the lower spring to extend and project the hammer towards and onto the piezoelectric crystal, with the upper spring remaining compressed. The relaxation phase then constitutes the user pulling back, extending the upper spring, forcing the hammer downwards into its original state with no effect on the lower spring. Analysis of high-speed videos of the hammer releasing indicate that the hammer is able to reach a maximum velocity of 8 m/s at a peak acceleration of 30,000 m/s2. Further analysis indicates this rapid acceleration produces jerk of up to 300,000,000 m/s3 from this small hammer action, indicating the extreme nature of the design, allowing for the production of a powerful resultant force striking the crystal. In an effort to characterize the correlation between the experimentally obtained voltage outputs using the ElectroPen and the theoretical outputs, a piezoelectric static voltage theoretical model was used. Through this model and the data values established as constants , the theoretical voltage output of the crystal found within the lighter is a maximum of 2699 Volts, with a lower output under normal conditions due to the strain on the crystal from expanding towards its maximum length, as well as the resistance caused by the copper wires and metal conductors in the lighter. As the values from the described lighter are of the same magnitude, it can be declared that the theoretical basis confirms the obtained values from the experimental trials.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.

The condition being screened should be a serious health problem in terms of frequency and/or severity
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.

He also spoke about the many properties mycelium has that makes it an excellent building material--fire resistant, insulating, etc. He has also incorporated the remediating process of fungi in his designs to help clean up waste. Aiolova also noted the material’s excellent building properties--highlighting that it has great acoustics and could also could create an invigorating natural microbiome in interior spaces. She also cautioned, however, that when we design with mycelium we should be conscious of the material constraints—highlighting that multi-story building made solely of mycelium are unlikely and that rather it the creation of composite materials with mycelium that will create successful buildings.
With this information in mind, we began by brainstorming a variety of housing needs. At first we considered adapting the design of the house for refugees--a pressing issues, with the United Nations Human Rights Council estimating that in 2016 65.6 million people were forcibly displaced from their homes, with 22.5 million of those people falling under the category of “refugees” [1]. However after reading reports about the crisis and discussions with designers involved with refugee design we concluded that the development of another “pop up” house would not address the route of the problems--which have much more to do with policy [2].
Next we looked inwards, focusing on the local issues of homelessness in San Francisco. California, as a whole, hosts 12% of the population of the United States, but 22% of the homeless population [3]. Again, however, deeper exploration revealed that while a shortage of affordable housing was a component, it was not addressing the core of the problem.
Turning once again to the drawing board, we decided to revisit what Maurer and Aiolova had said, this time focusing of the idea of sustainability and affordability. Construction is a major contributor to global warming and pollution; the construction of buildings alone is responsible for up to 40% of carbon emissions[4]. And in the US alone there are 50 million tons of demolition produced annually[5]. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, there are a myriad of benefits to reducing the protection of demolition--ranging from cutting down on the number of demolition facilities needed to preventing the construction of more landfills.

Collaboration in Wego Education
As part of the presentation we brought forth to Wego Bilingual High School, we invited National Chang Gung University to collaborate with us. This presentation includes the introduction to synthetic biology, the process of developing, researching, and expanding on a research topic for iGEM in hopes of inspiring them to create their own team in the upcoming year. In addition to presenting our own topic and past projects of NYMU, we also collaborated with NCGU so that, through their presentation, the students would receive further insights in the understanding of how a research team and project come together. Our presenters started the event off with basic components of synthetic biology and iGEM; the NCGU iGEM team then followed up by focusing on the term “entropy” and, after a series of interactive questions with the student body, brought in their project idea of the de-inking paper. We believe that this collaboration was a success in not only the education of high school kids but also such that the two teams were able to learn more from each other.

In March 2017, thanks to the introduction of medical students in our school, we contacted the students from Chung Shan Medical University and National Chung Hsing University. These students are going to establish a joint team called “CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan”, and participate in the iGEM competition this year. They ask our teacher, Prof. Chang, and our team for some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. We communicated through webcam, and we also explained and reminded them some competition rules. During the 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference and the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, there were great opportunities to exchange both team projects and gave practical suggestions for improvement. We highly look forward to their project and results in Giant Jamboree in November, and are honored to participate in the growth of a new team.
Strengthening long-standing partnership with Taipei America School, we troubleshoot each project mutually by assisting TAS with teaching cloning and constructing primer. In return, they conduct an experiment to ensure our suicide mechanism. As usual, we continue our relationship with TAS. Two members of our team Catherine and Leona are from TAS.

              (20%)  and homogenized.
Step2. Covered all the test tubes with aluminium foil and were kept at 45℃ in
            water bath for 2hrs.
Step3. Centrifuged and filtered the supernatant through whatman filter paper
            (No.1).
Step4. The absorbance of filtrate were measured spectrophotometrically at many
           wavelengths (310, 320, 330, 332, 334 and 260).
E. coli cells may be even easier to extract, because cyanobacteria tend to have a stronger cell wall

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2012,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Project#project2.2_-_-_TEXT.html,"zed by a series of nine enzymes and the final release of free fatty acids is catalyzed by a thioesterase via hydrolysis of acyl-ACP species. We are the first group in iGEM competition to recruit this biosynthetic pathway. Membrane Accelerator Device is expected to facilitate the biosynthesis of fatty acid in E.coli.
Furthermore, we tried to upgrade fatty-acid-producing Membrane Accelerator by introducing additional two enzymes that convert fatty acids into alkane. Thus, alkane would be efficiently synthesized in E.coli directly.
Biosynthetic Pathway
Fatty acid biosynthetic pathway
Carbon chain elongation of fatty acid in E.coli is carried out by a nine-component enzyme system , FabA, FabB, FabD, FabF, FabG, FabH, FabI, FabZ, and ACP. They orderly cooperate to convert one equivalent of acetyl-CoA and 6-8 equivalents of malonyl-CoA into C14-C18 acyl-ACP species. The cytoplasmic mutant of the periplasmic thioesterase is capable of releasing free fatty acids preventing the fatty acyl yields from being directly harnessed for phospholipid biosynthesis.
Fig.1 shows fatty acid biosynthesis pathways in E.coli, stressing the role of FabG, FabZ, FabI and TesA.
Catalytic cycle of the E. coli fatty acid synthesis is initiated when holo-ACP, NADPH and NADH, acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA undergo condensation and subsequent reduction to form butyryl-ACP. These reactions are catalyzed by the malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase FabD, the ketosynthase FabH, the NADPH-dependent ketoreductase FabG, either the dual-function dehydratase/isomerase FabA or the monofunctional dehydratase FabZ, and the NADH-dependent enoyl reductase FabI. Then the butyryl-ACP is extended via 5-7 rounds of analogous reactions to produce a C14 to C18-ACP either fully saturated or monounsaturated. These extension cycles are catalyzed by either the ketosynthase FabB or FabF in collaboration with FabD, FabG, FabZ, and FabI. Finally, the full-length fatty acid is released from the corresponding fatty acyl-ACP via hydrolysis by C16-specific thioesterase,TesA.

2. Transcription level
To test the transcription level of our desired genes, we did a series of RT PCR. Besides, as birA is an endogenous gene of E.coli BL21(DE3), we didn’t test it.  From figure 5 we could draw a conclusion that accA, pccB and sfp were transcripted as expected.
Figure 5: Transcription level of accA、pccB and sfp, with 16S rRNA2 as the reference gene. ACC: accA; PCC: pccB; SFP: sfp.
3. SDS-PAGE
We detected target protein of the metabolically engineered strain of E. coli BL21(DE3) by SDS-PAGE.
Figure 6: Analysis of the cell disruption product, from which we can see accA、birA and sfp were produced. PccB was not found, but the result of mass spectrometry analysis shows that the expected product triketide lactone was produced, meaning that pccB was translated successfully in our engineered E.coli, too.
Conclusion
We constructed the chassis during August and detected whether it works as expected in the early September. From result 1 and result 2, we can safely draw a conclusion that our chassis was successfully constructed. The later MS analysis shows that it works as expected. As the first desired product triketide lactone was detected and proved our chassis does work, we will see whether it works with other polyketide synthase we transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3).

Education In our Lab
During the course of the summer, our lab hosted a high school student, Justin Park, in our lab. He shadowed lab members and learned about the different procedures associated with synthetic biology. While we were sad to see him leave at the end of the summer, we really enjoyed being able to teach him so much about something that he didn't know much about. He was also one of our guests on our youtube channel. Click here to learn more about Justin's summer experience! During the semester, Daniel also shadowed our team. He is a fellow Duke student who was looking for greater exposure to wetlab. Witnessing his drive to learn evolve into an appreciation for synthetic biology has been a pleasure. He also starred on our YouTube Channel.

Engagement with our Community
Marbles Kids Museum
In addition to teaching Justin over the summer, our team also went into the local community to educate about synthetic biology. One of our programs centered around elementary students and getting them excited about DNA and biology. Our team made visits to the Marbles Kids Museum in Raleigh where team members were Guest Star Scientists and taught kids how to make oragami DNA, candy DNA, and necklaces with DNA from wheat germ! Both the kids and our team had a truly DNAtastic time! For more information on our visits to the Marbles Kids Museum, click here
Mosquito Forum
Another of our programs centered on using the adapted curriculum we created during our collaboration with Gaston Day School, and East Chapel Hill High School (click here for more information on the collaboration) and used the curriculum on our college campus as well as in the local community. Our team had a really great time not only educating our peers and local community on synthetic biology but also discussing the ethical issues surrounding it.

But given that the samples ran quite different on the gel compared to the boiled samples, no definite conclusion can be drawn from this gel.
Based on these findings it can be concluded that PtNTT2 is located in the inner membrane of E. coli and that isolation of the entire protein remains challenging. Since it could be shown that the tags are present in the inner membrane fraction, it is very likely that the entire construct PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP could simply not be solubilized enough. In all western blots, the tag of PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP with a TAT signal peptide was far weaker compared to the other samples, indicating that PtNTT2 with a TAT signal peptide is weakly integrated into the membrane. This would also concur with our previous results and would explain the lacking function of this construct.

So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter and create an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Killer gene is replaced by RFP under control of in-promoter.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Fig.4 Arabinose induced expression cassette of three kinds of inhibitors.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
Fig.5 In-promoter controlled expression cassette of RFP. RFP is used to replace killer gene.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
Fig.6 Assembly of inhibitor and ""in-promoter"". They can be used to test the minimum arabinose concentration which can totally repress the expression of RFP.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased and it contradicted with the expected results. Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
The circuits are shown in the Fig.7.
So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
Fig.7 Optimized circuits after changing the direction of promoter PBAD adding another terminator B0015.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in Table.3. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the circuits mentioned above with no arabinose added.
Table.3 The concentrations of arabinose added in the experiment.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the cI-Pr circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram describing the relationship between the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
Fig.8 RFP intensity measured under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％"

Collaborations
Collaborations were an exciting aspect of the iGEM experience: there seemed to exist a certain community through the iGEM networks, of students who were engaging in lab work just as we were - succeeding and failing, and of course, learning. We maintained correspondence with a few different teams, meeting with a representative of Tec de Monterrey for instance. But the more impactful communications we made to the mutual benefits of two teams came from our participation in the NEGEM meet up that was hosted by the Boston University iGEM Team.
This was one of our first experiences presenting our project, and the feedback we received on our work was very helpful on what aspects we needed to clarify and expand on more for future presentations. Beyond having the first time exposure, talking about our project brought us into contact with local teams who offered us aid from the discoveries they made from their own research.
Harvard iGEM Magazine
With a project that relies on the use of live bacteria, we know that our project would raise a few heads for anyone who was not familiar with the use of synthetic biology. The stigma against gene editing and different methods of meddling with the very codes that make up a human, is something that is heavily controversial as the field continues to expand and grow. In order to highlight the positive potential that could come out of harnessing synthetic biology, our team reached out to our peers around the world to send in their abstracts in order to #FightTheStigma!
Our formal collaboration request: ""Calling all iGEM teams! This year, Team Harvard wants to work with you all to end the stigma against synthetic biology. We’ve noticed that human contact with bacteria is frequently associated with negative consequences and as such, it is regarded as dangerous by the general public. As iGEM teams, we understand that genetically engineering bacteria is a largely untapped resource for positive change. Help us show the world the true potential of harnessing bacteria for use in therapeutics, diagnostics, the environment and more!""
Thank you to all the teams who participated!

I15010 & B0015 w/ Xba & Pst in buffer 3
‘1’ (I13453) w/ ‘2&3’ is successfully ligated; this means that Part A is done!
‘2 & 4’ was ligated to ‘7’ (B0015), but has colonies on the vector controls.  Thus, a  PCR screen is performed.  We then found 4 colonies that were good and made glycerol stocks of them.
‘5’ (J23119) was ligated to ‘2&4&7’, but also had colonies on the vector controls.  Thus, a PCR screen is performed.  4 good colonies were cultured and had glycerol stocks.
Part C is complete as well!
Meanwhile, we still have to crack down on the issue of not being to cut some of our parts out:
We have spec’d the miniprep, and the miniprep concentrations are relatively high.  So we did not start out with low concentrations.
After running a diagnostic gel, however, results showed that digestion failed, we have 2 options:
1) Cut parts in buffer 3 + BSA @ 37C
2) Get high fidelity Pst and cut in buffer 4
Testing enzymes:
Have 3 samples:
1) Cut miniprep: 5 uL template, 1 uL BSA, 1 uL Buffer X, 0.8 uL Enzyme, 1.2 uL H20
2) Same as 1, but with other enzyme

Week18 (Jul 13 -Jul 19)
We constructed a new part P-atp2+B0034+K907000(Bxb1 gp35)+K907001(Bxb1 gp47) by OE-PCR and transformed it into BMTOP10. And we started to selected the positive bacteria from our transformant.
We did the fourth cell culture to increase the experimental data and analyzed the common features among the four experiments. However, we didn’t get the expected results again. But we have learned some lessons.
Week19 (Jul 20 -Jul 26)
This week, most members of our two groups attended the iGEM conference held by National Chiao Tung University. So the plenty of members selected others bacteria together.
We added a terminator downstream the gene glsA. Through 3A assembly, we have successfully constructed the complete standard part. Through the result of sequence measuring, it turns out to be completely right.
Week20 (Jul 27 -Aug 2)
We artificially synthesized attP and attB, the recognized sites of Bxb1, by Genwiz, so that we should wait for them. And we totally selected 1082 positive bacteria. We used LacZ alpha as a report gene and started the verification of them.
We have improved our experiment methods and carried out the fifth cell culture. Considering the pH might change after cell culture, we added buffer to control the pH. Moreover, we tried to realize the the synchronous culture by choosing the single bacteria on the plate. Unluckily, the results didn’t meet our requirements.
Week21 (Aug 3 -Aug 9)
This week, we got a measure that we helped Beijing Normal University(BNU) to finish their gene circuit. So we transformed the gene I15008(ho1) and I15009(PcyA) from iGEM kit plates into BMTOP10. And we still did the verification of our mutants.
We measured the intensity of proteins again. It showed that the expression of glsA is critically low. So, we planned to change a strong promoter T7.
Week22 (Aug 10 -Aug 16)
We got the BNU's part (J23100+B0034+PcyA+B0034+ho1+B0015), and constructed it to the pSB1C3. We still verified the mutants this week.
Referring to the paper we read, we did a small experiment to measure the proportion of living cells under extreme pH 3.0, both the testing group and the comparison group didn’t grow"

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#Transforming_-_-_TEXT.html," by PEG 8000.
Electroporation- research suggests limited success with gram positive cells
Protoplast and Electroporation- a combination of two techniques, use of lysozymes to digest cell wall and electroporation to create entrances for DNA
Because of S. pasteurii’s thick cell wall, the protoplast transformation seemed the most logical to succeed.
Transformation
S. pasteurii cells were obtained via ATCC 11859 stock.  The transforming DNA was obtained from Dr. Yun-Peng Chao, Professor of Chemical Engineering at  Feng Chia University in Taiwan. Plasmid pUB110 (not to be confused with pBU11 , was a shuttle vector between E. coli and B. subtilis, containing an Ampicillin cassette for selection of the former, and a Kanamycin cassette for the latter.
pUB110 was selected following the protocols suggested by Alicia’s notes, reasoning along the lines that the homology between the two bacteria (S. pasteurii was previously known as Bacillus pasteurii before a recategorization) would be sufficient to allow expression of the Kanamycin resistance cassette inside S. pasteurii.
Newcastle iGEM’s 2009 Sporulation Part BBa_K174011 was also received via request to the Registry of Standardized Parts.
Protocols for the transformation can be found here .
Lysozyme from chicken egg white (L3790 - 10 mg/mL) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Troubleshooting
Many attempts at protoplast transformation were carried out, but the results were unsuccessful: there was either no growth on the Kanamycin resistance plates, or there was excessive growth, with distinctly different colony features and tested negative on urea-phenol red test plates. This suggested that there was contamination due to 1) improperly prepared kanamycin plates or 2) kanamyci1n resistant strains colonizing the extremely rich recovery plates.
Troubleshooting suggested that the capacity of the protoplasts to regenerate their cell wall was a potential limiting factor. Viewing of the lysozyme digestion showed nearly complete digestion of the cell membranes (before and after). Procedures for collecting the protoplasts involved several centrifugation step at an unspecified “maximum speed” according to the protocol, though there was difficulty in collecting cell pellets at speeds below 8000 g, especially after the addition of viscous PEG 8000.
We speculated that repeated centrifuge at high speeds was too traumatic for the digested protoplast cells, and the survival rate following the transformation was"

Detailed protocol
Validation of our detection toolbox
Once we developed the device, we took it to a farm to see if it was, indeed, simple to use. We visited Paul Oosthoek, who confirmed that the steps in the protocol can be followed easily. He also affirmed that the test can be implemented within current regulations on his farm. Furthermore, he said that our do it yourself toolbox has potential as farmers are willing to invest time in detecting resistance genes themselves.
Feedback from farmer Paul
Furthermore, we received feedback on how we can improve our device. Paul stated that it would be better if the test really showed which specific antibiotic should be used for treatment, instead of knowing which antibiotics should NOT be used. We completely agree with this statement; finding out which antibiotic is appropriate to use is more effective in helping to solve the worldwide antibiotic resistance problem. Moreover, he advised us to use larger test tubes for the detection. Currently, we use 0.5 and even 0.2mL eppendorfs in which the detection is done. Paul recommended to perform the detection in larger tubes to"

Advisors
This section we want to dedicate to our advisors. As most of our team members are still bachelor students and had no or only minor knowledge about actually working in a lab before getting in touch with iGEM, our advisors played an important role in starting our project. They guided us in the long process of shaping our abstract ideas into real, scientific strategies and are the reason why we can now proudly announce that we are able to organize and execute our own experiments. Here, we want to present how each of them supported our project.

Alongside with our advisors we also owe special thanks to our supervisors. In 2016, RWTH Aachen University has had its third iGEM team and this would have never been possible without reliable faculty members who promote the iGEM spirit. They enabled us to work on our idea by providing us with their expertise as well as resources and lab-space. We are very grateful for their support and look forward to another successful synergy between our experienced supervisors and a new iGEM team that is bubbling over with ideas in"

Mathematical modeling page
In this section we explain two dynamic models that can be used to describe the gene networks in our project. After a brief overview about the motivation of a mathematical model, we will illustrate the general formulas we used, we will show the complete ODE models for Mux and Demux gene networks, and then we will report results of some simulations performed with Matlab and Simulink.
Why writing a mathematical model?
The purposes of writing mathematical models for gene networks can be:
Prediction: a good and well identificated model can be used in simulations to predict real system behavior. In particular we could be interested in system output in response to never seen inputs. In this way, the system can be tested 'in silico', without performing real experiments 'in vitro' or 'in vivo'.
Parameter identification: we already wrote that it is very important to estimate all the parameters involved in the model, in order to perform realistic simulations. Another goal that can be reached with parameter identification is 'network summarization', in fact estimated parameters can be used as 'behavior indexes' for the network (or a part of it). These indexes can be very useful for synthetic biologists to choose and compare BioBrick standard parts for genetic circuits design, just like electronic engineers choose, for example, a Zener diode, knowing its Zener voltage.
Equations for gene networks
In this paragraph, mathematical modeling for gene and protein interactions will be described.

Tel-Hai,2017,Team:Tel-Hai#Team#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," manifest spanning the world of ethics, covering subjects from the history of ethics to modern day implications. We read this text with guidance from Dr. Meshi Ori   and were inspired to write our own ethical guidelines. The insight we gained by reading their ethical standpoint inspired us to view our research in a different light, emphasizing ethics as a major component of our project.
Then came the time for our teams to meet and discuss in person. The session began with each team introducing its members and project and this is where we discovered that our projects share an important characteristic - their modular nature. This refers to the respective projects’ design, as a basic concept that may be applicable in other various contexts. Dr.Meshi began the meeting with walking us through the multi-faceted world of ethics, from the very arcane to the mundane. By doing so, we created a common language with which to discuss the ethical perspectives of our corresponding projects. Dr. Meshi enlightened the Technion team that, with the great depth their booklet goes into, it lacks a practical approach. Talking about ethics is a venerable pursuit, but in order to make our world a better place, we need to implement ethics in our daily reality.
Our benefit from this collaboration was the inspiration we gleaned from their book, which allowed us to draft our own take on ethics in general and how it pertains to our project. Thinking about our project with this newfound perspective, we reevaluated our role in the education for responsible alcohol consumption.
Dr.Ayelet Shavit then led a dialogue meant to challenge our perception of lab work, urging us to question all that we take for granted in terms of what we do every single day in the lab. The subject of this dialogue was the connection between science and morals, a cornerstone of this connection being objectivity - how can we assess the morality of what we do if don’t view it without preconceived notions? What is the role played by politics and money, within the scientific community and how does it affect the nature of the scientific work?
Rami, our Muslim team member, had a worthwhile perspecive to add to the discussion. As a practicing and devout Muslim he isn’t allowed to drink wine, nor does he wish to, seeing as how it’s not a part of his culture whatsoever. But when the time came to choose an idea for the iGEM project, he was the first to vote for our current idea. He realized that as a scientist he is duty bound to always ask questions regarding the nature and ramifications of his work, especially from an ethical standpoint.
Thanks to these various collaborations, our project grew in"

The combination of the Cas9 system with DNA repair sequences enables not only knockouts of peroxisomal proteins, but also allows redirecting protein localization by changing protein targeting signals or integration of linear DNA into yeast chromosomes. Genome engineering facilitates yeast strain development for customized peroxisomes.
Figure 3: Design of repair DNA sequences for homologous recombination after inducing double strand break by Cas9
Repair DNA sequences can be used to increase the efficiency for Cas9 guided knocking out of specific genes, but would also allow genomic integration of targeting signals or complete genes.  Adapted from ( Lee et al. 2015 )
The peroxisomal proteome of yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae)
The peroxisomal proteome is studied extensively for saccharomyces cerevisiae and contains exactly 67 proteins ( Kohlwein et al. 2013 ). The function is characterized for the most of those proteins and it is known, that yeast peroxisomes are expendable under optimal growth conditions. Nevertheless, some knockouts are lethal under oleate or stress conditions.

We've abandoned the web application for now (although I think we're coming back to it eventually) because it would be way too involved and too time-intensive considering the amount of time and man-power we have this summer. So the Eugenie team is now working on getting some kind of drag and drop functionality to work on the Microsoft PixelSense, using XAML for the front-end and C# for the back end. So far, it's not going great...
Fri, July 5: There's not much to report...we're struggling to get our drag-and-drop functionality to work on the PixelSense. I assume we'll have to come in over the weekend and work until we bully our code into working for us.

iGEM Hamburg: Would you like to sum up your research?
Dr. Hammond: I work on a technology called “gene drive” and it got a lot of attention, but we developed the first one that was shown to work in a very cool way in 2016. So we developed this genetic element that can spread to a population and transform it, so you can engineer modifications. Usually if you release this in a population, you won’t have a huge effect with a few mosquitoes. After a few years, you will still have only a few genetically engineered mosquitoes or less. What a gene drive could do is, that it can spread this modification in theory in the entire population, potentially cross whole sub-Saharian Africa. In 2016, we showed, that you can get the technology working. It worked very well with Anopheles gambiae, which is the main vector of malaria in Africa. Anopheles gambiae together with a couple of other closely related species which are responsible for about 95% of malaria transmission in the region. So in 2016 we showed, that we could spread this element through the population and as it spreads all the females of the population get unable to reproduce. In theory, you could crash the whole population. Unfortunately the mosquitoes adapt, and they develop mutations, that make the gene drive unable to spread. That makes sense, because the mosquitoes don’t want to be eliminated. We sort of predicted, that this would happen and we had a good idea of how it would happen. A year later we published another paper, showing how this happens and how the mutations are generated and propagated through the population. This is not good for gene drive, but it’s good to know, that we know this. Our latest publication is quite interesting too, because we found a way to overcome it, which was unexpected. There were several ways that have been proposed to overcome it. One strategy is rather than targeting the gene drive to one part of the genome you can target it to several. Resistance arises, because one part of the genome will adapt, create a mutation and make the gene drive unable to recognise it. This recognition is essential to make it work. So if you program your gene drive to target several places, than in theory you need resistance in all of these different places to the gene drive to fail. That is a cool way of doing it, but we didn’t even do this."

Integrated Human Practices
The first phase of our project was to grow lactic acid bacteria and yeast together. We knew that a multi-organism system could have a variety of possible advantages in synthetic biology. We wondered if there were any possible applications for this system in the brewing industry. This brought on a set of questions that we tried to answer over the summer:
Would brewers be comfortable brewing with this co-culture of LAB and yeast?
How do you get approval, nationally and internationally, for a genetically modified organism?
Is it possible to release a genetically modified organism into the wild?
Are each of these applications feasible and important?
We talked to brewers about their experience brewing with multiple species of yeast and if they would sell it. A brewer, Matt Riggs, stated that consumers will be wary of GM product, so he wouldn't sell that right now, but he personally would try it. He suggested targeting industrial applications in the short-term and the brewing field in the future. Taking his comments and suggestions we geared our project/co-culture toward industrial applications, like using our system to create valuable products such as lactic acid.
This is a brief summary of our interview with one of the brewers we talked to, Matt Riggs.
Q1: Do you have any experience brewing with multiple species of yeast or non-yeast organisms?
A1: When I was studying brewing in Germany, we sometimes used to use lactobacillus to make sour beers, but this was not a direct co-culture like what you are doing in your lab. We would create a separate culture of  lactobacillus and add it to the fermenter in the last 15 minutes of the  fermentation, immediately followed by pasterization. The amount of alcohol in the fermentation culture at that point was too high for the lactobacillus to survive, but the lactic acid they already produced was sufficient to give the beer the sour flavour we were looking for.
Q2: What is your opinion on brewing with GMO's?
A2: I should be careful about how I say this. I have heard of people doing some interesting things with GM brews, but I would never mess with that. I  would lose most of my business. The fact of the matter is, people don't trust GM products to that extent. If I tried to sell that, I would lose almost all  of"

We were fortunate enough to be invited to present a talk about concepts in molecular biology and our project during the second instalment in this series. A huge thanks to Matt from the 2015 Sydney iGEM team for arranging this opportunity!
The talks were aimed at high school students, and our audience comprised of students between 13 and 17 years of age. Members of both the 2015 and 2016 UNSW iGEM teams also joined us at this event, and it was the perfect way to share the foundations of our projects with each other and start a relationship for collaboration purposes later down the track.
Rotary talk
Building upon our relationship with Ku-Ring-Gai Rotary club, we were invited to speak to the Rotary members at their weekly Monday evening meeting.
This was a unique opportunity as our audience was comprised of a different demographic to what we were used to, primarily seniors. It still required a stripped back version of our presentation, with enough background information in molecular biology weaved in to ensure they understood the basis of our project.
Our speech was very well received, and there were a lot of questions asked that challenged us to think about our project from a different perspective. A huge thanks to the Rotary for having us, and again a special thanks to Matt from the USYD iGEM 2015 team for organising this!
Open Day
We had a booth at the University of Sydney Open Day, which was held at the beginning of semester 2. We were able to speak to incoming students about microbiology, synthetic biology, research, and the iGEM competition, which drew interest from future science students who were excited about potentially being in an iGEM team in the coming years. We also had various activities and exhibits at the booth to further generate excitement.

Oz Harvest is a non-for-profit organisation that specialise in food recovery and education.
Oz Harvest volunteers collect leftover food and unsold produce from restaurants, cafes, and grocers all across the country, and use it to make meals for the homeless. Their work has two strengths – firstly, they aim to reduce food wastage; and secondly, they aim to help members of society who would otherwise go hungry. Our project has a major parallel with their work, in that the biotechnology we produce would significantly reduce the wastage of fresh produce.

Taken together, we all learned a lot this year. Besides the work, we had a lot of fun, grew together as a team and also got to know many other iGEMers. We worked in the lab every day in the week, had some exhausting nights before wiki freeze and spent good times together. The iGEM year will be completed with our team visiting the Giant Jamboree, presenting our project and getting to know more young researchers-We are really looking forward to the Jamboree, see you there!

Making the Mtd Biobrick
To create this biobrick, we utilized a combination of splicing overlap extension PCR and Gibson Assembly to extract a sequence from the BPP-1 phage's genomic DNA that would be free of the standard biobrick restriction enzyme sites. The protocols for those methods are listed below:
PCR to generate fragments of mtd
In this step, four separate fragments of the mtd gene are created via PCR. This step is necessary to eliminate illegal internal biobrick sites (EcoRI, PstI, NotI) and to add necessary biobrick sites to the 5' and 3' ends.

“Economics places a key role in all aspects of life and is an important subject worth knowing more about” 
 
This year we participated in the following activities:
・Poster Session at the University of Tokyo
・Interview with the Science Magazine ""Newton""
・MUSE TALK
・Visit to Elementary School
・Annual Meeting of the Genetics Society of Japan
We aimed at letting a broad range of people know synthetic biology. The people involved in our activities include elementary students to elderly, as well as people without any scientific background to people who majored in Computer Science. During these activities, we did a poster session and presentation using interactive visuals and understandable texts. We explained our projects, what genetic manipulation is, and what benefits synthetic biology can bring to us. The audience gave us many feedbacks about our projects, and opinions about how they think about synthetic biology. We appreciate all the people involved in our activities.
Fig. 6-1-1. Phase of our Policy and Practice activity
 
First, we took part in a poster session held at the school festival of the University of Tokyo. After communicating with the students who majored in business, we realized that we do not know much about economics.
iGEMers know a lot about synthetic biology, but what about economics? Can we apply our ideas commercially? How can a student who has never studied economics before start to learn?
From these questions, we thought of making an educational tool of economics by using E. coli, which is familiar to iGEMers.
> Jump to Poster Session at the University of Tokyo
 
Next, we introduced our Bank E. coli project to businessmen, executives, and technicians engaged in IT company for some professional opinions at MUSE TALK.
They pointed out that economic wave should be introduced into our system for more reality. According to their advice, we improved our system to show more authenticity.
Also, many people asked questions related to safety. It was because the safety problem must be cleared in order to commercialize our ideas. They all thought it would be a big business chance, if genetically engineered E. coli can be released safely in human and nature.
We encountered two questions here: reality and safety.
> Jump to MUST TALK
 
Finally, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo Institute of Technology to confirm whether our project would help the understanding of economic system. Most of them said that they almost understood the mechanism"

Application
With our pulse generator protein expression system, the proteins are only produced in short pulses, reducing the burden on the cells, and preventing toxic accumulation and giving time for the cells to recuperate from stress. These engineered cells can thus be resilient in a bioreactor setting, making them ideal for large-scale protein production applications.
The pulse generator can also serve as a useful signaling component to incorporate into more complex biological devices.

Background:
Swedish student, studying the second year at Uppsala University. Adopted from Peru, with regular trips back to learn more about the culture and country.
Why I chose to participate in iGEM:
For as long as I can remember I have been interested in biology and especially synthetic biology. iGEM has therefore given me a great opportunity to put all the theory in practice and actually create something from scratch. The whole experience of participating in a project and working together towards a common goal and with similar interests, is one of the best.

Advisors
Daniel Camsund
Daniel Camsund is a doctoral student in the Microbial chemistry group of Prof. Peter Lindblad at the Department of Photochemistry and Molecular Science (Fotomol), Uppsala University, Sweden. After receiving his M.Sc. in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at UU in 2007, he worked one year as a research assistant at Fotomol before continuing with his doctoral studies, with Prof. Alfonso Jaramillo (institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology, France) and Dr. Thorsten Heidorn (Fotomol) as co-supervisors. His research interests include the development of molecular tools for transcriptional control and introduction of genetic circuits relevant for bioproduction in bacteria, especially cyanobacteria, as they enable renewable biotechnology powered by photosynthesis. Further, he is interested in the dissemination of synthetic biology and co-organized/supervised the first two iGEM-teams of Uppsala University. To date, he has published three refereed articles and a book chapter.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," realizing the error with the synthesis we realize that the problem with the miniprep is just that the bacteria do not contain the plasmid.  However, as seen in the picture below there does seem to be more DNA than in the samples prepared using the filter columns in the kit.
Considerations for future experiments: At the moment it is hard to tell whether the poor results are due to the protocol or because of unsuccessful creation of the KerUS biobrick.  Therefore in the future, a miniprep will be conducted using an RFP culture to verify the effectiveness of the miniprep.  However, compared to not seeing any DNA with samples prepared with the non-modified miniprep this already seems more promising.  The steps used to create the biobrick version of KerUS will also be repeated.
Future Plans:
Future plans include characterizing the properly created the new biobrick parts.  AS well as re-creating the KerUS biobrick and conducting the different experiments with more replicates.  If discovered to be truly toxic to E.coli, cell free protein synthesis could be another avenue for the team to explore, but at the moment proves to be too expensive and potentially unecessary.

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," chloramphenicol at 37°C overnight. Because overnight cultured LB medium has a background level of fluorescence, the bacterial GFP was measured in the PBS buffer ( Enzyme Microb Technol. 2001 ). As Figure 1 showed, the GFP expression was extremely high in E. coli. LO-GFP fusion protein expression was observed at low but significant level compared to wild-type E. coli or E. coli expressing LO outer membrane proteins.
Figure 1: Gene expression analysis. GFP gene expression was read at Ex/Em = 488/528 nm in BioTek Microplate Spectrophotometer. Lane 1: wild-type E. coli as a mock control; Lane 2: GFP expression in E. coli [ BBa_K1694035 ]; Lane 3: LO outer membrane protein expression [ BBa_K1991007 ] in E. coli; Lane 4: LO-GFP fusion protein expression [ BBa_K1991010 ] in E. coli.
Alcohol oxidase (AOX) was applied in biosensors which catalyzes the oxidation of alcohol followed by hydrogen peroxide production. There are two AOX genes present in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. The gene codon was optimized for expression in E. coli. The DNA sequences were synthesized by IDT and cloned onto pSB1C3 [ BBa_K1991000 , BBa_K1991001 ]. In addition, Lpp-OmpA outer membrane proteins, which can direct a fusion protein to display on the bacterial cell surface [ BBa_K1991004 , BBa_K1991007 ], were fused with AOX [ BBa_K1991005 , BBa_K1991006 ]. In our experimental results, the data showed the enzyme displayed on E. coli can react dose-dependently with various concentration of alcohol in the H2O2 production assay and modeling at the electrochemical analyzer [ BBa_K1991002 , BBa_K1991003 , BBa_K1991008 , BBa_K1991009 , BBa_K1991010 ]
