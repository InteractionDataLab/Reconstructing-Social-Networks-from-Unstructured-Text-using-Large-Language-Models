Ratiometrica
James Brown from the Haseloff Lab, Cambridge has offered us invaluable advice in collecting and analysing data from our ratiometric fluorescent construct.
PJ Steiner from the Haseloff Lab has provided the original E. coli and B. subtilis shuttle vector pJS130 on which we worked.
Paul Mallaband, Emmy Tsang and Thomas Whittaker from the team designed and assembled the final ratiometric fluorescent construct using PCR and Gibson assembly. The component biobricks (other than the backbone) came from the Registry's Spring Distribution Kit. We designed the original primers for Gibson and ligation, optimised the PCR, gel and PCR extraction, and Gibson assembly protocols, and tested the construct.
Fernan Federici from the Haseloff Lab provided the original mOrange DNA template, while the fischeri LuxBrick (K325909) is from the Parts Registry. Tom and Emmy from the team have assembled the construct using Gibson assembly and PCR.
Tom from the team has designed the harveii Lux-mOrange2 construct, which was then synthesised and codon optimised by DNA 2.0.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," model more accurate, especially for the lower miRNA concentrations we decreased kopen to 105, the lowest possible value in our range.
Another way to improve the lower miRNA concentrations was increasing the decay rate of just the miRNA. We had assumed it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in our system. Increasing just the miRNA decay rate had similar effect to decreasing kopen.
With our initial parameters our model was a poor representation of our system. Once we updated our parameters, it was able to represent our results relatively well.
Stochastic model
The Oxford iGEM team kindly ran stochastic simulations of system for us. They ran both intrinsic and extrinsic simulations and provided us with the final uncertainties.
Intrinsic Simulation
Intrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty caused by the changes in reaction rate due to the fact reactants collide randomly. This is more accurate than mass action kinetics for low reactant concentrations.
For our stochastic simulation, each time step a reaction rate was determined randomly using the Poisson distribution. As this is random, multiple stochastic simulations have to be run for a large enough sample size. A time step of 0.01 seconds was used.
The intrinsic simulations gave an uncertainty of only 0.0096%. This validated our use of mass action kinetics to model our system. As the intrinsic uncertainty is negligible we could assume rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of the reactants, i.e. the law of mass action.
While we later updated the parameters with our experimental data, the concentration of reactants did not decrease to invalidate this result.
Extrinsic Simulation
Extrinsic stochastic models find the uncertainty cause by the uncertainty of our parameters. The extrinsic uncertainty is by far the more significant of the two uncertainties in our model.
The extrinsic simulation assumes our parameters were normally distributed and runs multiple simulations randomly choosing parameter values.
The specific conclusions of our extrinsic simulations, such as the test being complete in 37 minutes in 90% of cases, are unfortunately no longer useful after our experimental results showed some of our starting parameters were significantly off. However, the extrinsic simulation demonstrated that biggest weakness with our model was our parameter's uncertainties.
Cost model
There's two parts to our cost modeling; the cost analysis which works out the cost of the test, and the much more impressive screening cost-effectiveness model that works out the value of rolling out a screening programme.
Our screening programme's cost per quality year of life gained would be just be £8300 at the current lowest threshold for lung cancer screening, and taking into account cancer recurrence. Treatments under £20,000 per quality year"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," regulatory network allows an adequate response to situations of nitrogen limitation.
In the Bacillus subtilis, ammonium assimilation occurs via the glutamine synthetase - glutamate synthase pathway. Bacillus subtilis faces nitrogen- limiting conditions when it consumes glutamate as a prior nitrogen source,   while glutamine is the secondly preferred nitrogen source [3].
Two transcription factors, TnrA and GlnR, and one enzyme, the Glutamine Synthase, are the major players in the B. Subtilis nitrogen regulatory network [3]. We use TnrA transcription factor in our system.
Under nitrogen-limited conditions, TnrA works as an activator and a repressor both. TnrA represses expression of glnRA (Glutamine Synthase) [4], gltAB (Glutamate Synthase) [5] and other genes. Also the form of Glutamine Synthase which is feedback inhibited by excess glutamine, directly interacts with and unbinds from TnrA, thus blocks its DNA-binding activity [6]. Based on all this information, if the amount of NH3 is not sufficient, glutamine synthase will not work properly, glutamine will be produced in a low amount, TnrA will bind to promoter and Toehold production will be repressed. But if there is a sufficient amount of NH3, glutamine will be produced in a high level, TnrA will not repress the promoter as previous and Toehold – Tev Protease will be produced in a high amount.
Figure 3: If there is a sufficient amount of NH3, Toehold and TEV protease will be produced. If there isn’t a sufficient amount of NH3, Toehold and TEV Protease will not be produced.
Seventeen TnrA targets were detected by a combination of DNA microarray hybridization, a genome-wide search for TnrA boxes, and gel retardation assays [7]. The TnrA box consensus delimited in this study to a 17- bp interrupted, inverted repeat sequence, TGTNANAWWWTNTNACA.

Most of the models about the repressilator retain some assumptions made by Elowitz and Leibler (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000), including \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \beta_{1(i)}&=\beta_{1}, K_{tl(i)}=K_{tl},\\ K_{R(i)}&=K_{R}, K_{P(i)}=K_{P}. \end{aligned} \end{equation} However the three genes are not identical. Our characterization of the promoters showed that the promoter strengths for these three genes were different. For this reason, we treated them differently by using $i=1$ to index gene cI, $i=2$ to index gene tetR, $i=3$ to index gene lacI. The promoter strength of placI that drives cI was represented by $\beta_{1(1)}$; the promoter strength of pcI that drives tetR in repressilator and drives lacI in toggle switch was represented by $\beta_{1(2)}$; the promoter strength of ptet was represented by $\beta_{1(3)}$.
Figure 2. Dynamics and phase diagrams of repressilator model in two cases. The common parameters we used were $\beta_0=0.03, K_{tl}=6.93, K_{R}=0.347, K_{P}=0.0173$. We emphasized the differences by simulating for a very long time. (A) Dynamics of repressilator model with  $\beta_1=(30,30,30)$; (B) Dynamics of repressilator model with  $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$; (C) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,30,30)$. The  trajectory forms a limit cycle. (D) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$. The  trajectory converges to a fixed point. (E) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,30,30)$ and different initial protein numbers. The behaviours are robust. (F) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$ and different initial protein numbers. The behaviours are sensitive to initial numbers.
It is obvious that such a difference can influence the attractor of this system when we plotted"

Origin
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed"

INTRODUCTION
Centromere-specific retrotransposons (CRs) are a class of transposable element belonging to the Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy superfamilies of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons found predominantly in the centromeres of eukaryotic genomes. CRs are characterized by the chromodomain (CHD) within the C-termini of the integrase; this motif is believed to influence the selectivity of CR insertion at the centromere. Ty3 Gag and Pol genes are arranged in the same order as  retroviruses: (1) Gag (2) protease, (3) reverse transcriptase and (4) integrase. On the other hand, Ty1 Gag and Pol genes are ordered: (1) Gag, (2) protease (3) integrase, and (4) reverse transcriptase.
Gag, which forms the structural unit of retroviral and retroviral-like elements, can be further divided into the matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid domains. The make-up and function of Gag domains varies widely between retroviral and retroviral-like elements. Generally, the matrix facilitates nuclear localization, nucleic acid binding, membrane targeting, and protein-protein interactions [1] the capsid"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," LacI repressor in the TAL Effector system                             in order to achieve on-the-fly inducibility. Our concern was that                             there would be steric hindrance between the TAL Effector and the                             LacI repressor. For that reason, the system would not properly                             function. He confirmed our concerns and advised us on the use of                             another type of expression control. So, we opted for the use of                                 a riboswitch instead.
For our CRISPRi stabilisation system:
We shared with him our idea to use another type of                                     repressor instead of the TAL                                     Effectors, to achieve promoter stabilization. We exhibited                                     our idea to use CRISPRi                                     and displayed our three                                         Topology designs , regarding the positioning(expression site) of dCas9. He                                     told us that this system could possibly work if dCas9 was                                     not expressed from the same plasmid as the sgRNA. We followed his advice and, in order not to disturb the noncooperative repression, we chose to use Topology                                             C.
He, also, mentioned that we should take into consideration                                     the toxicity that dCas9 could pose for the cell. That is why we investigated this issue and used pTet, an                                         inducible promoter, to control dCas9 expression. In order to choose a level of expression adequate for our                                     system’s function that does not significantly affect                                     growth, we conducted a dCas9 toxicity measurement,                                     monitoring the growth of E. coli in different Doxycycline                                     concentrations at a given time point.
For Fluorescence Measurements: As we had not decided on whether we would measure fluorescence                             using a plate reader or a flow cytometer, we asked Thomas H. Segall                             Shapiro his opinion on that matter. He guided us towards the use of                             flow cytometry, as this method could provide us more accurate and                             detailed results, and recommended us a protocol he had worked on before.
Our survey result showed that there was not a clear preference                     between on the fly inducibility or tuning of stabilised promoters in order to achieve the required expression level.                     Both designs have their own uses and advantages.
So, we decided to include both of these options into our toolbox. For the tuning (of TAL effector) stabilised promoters, we included different promoter-RBS combinations.                     To achieve on the fly inducibility of the TAL Effector system we decided on                     the use of a riboswitch Therefore, in our contact with Prof Howard M.

What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project.
Considerations for replicating the experiments.
Describe what your results mean
Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.

About iGEM
International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is an annual world-wide synthetic biology competition aimed at university students. Each year, participating teams from all over the world are challenged to bring their innovative ideas to life by applying engineering methodology in life sciences to ultimately produce “Biobricks” which are modular biological circuit parts that can be utilized to solve global issues.
About us
We are a combination of dedicated graduate students and research assistants from both UCL Cancer Institute and UCL Engineering .
About our idea
Improvising activation of the circuit with light, evolve luminescent proteins. Allow preclinical genetic imaging to study endogenous and disease processes in vivo and to image the genetic behaviour of life.

We decided on utilizing the gBlocks to construct the Aspergillus Niger phytase gene rather than have the entire gene synthesized
Tuesday
Yuan worked on designing the website. A final design layout was decided on utilizing an easy layout
Grant researched modeling. Specifically, he looked over the past winning iGEM modeling projects to get a feel for what a good modeling project should have.
Lajja, Tae and Sarah made overnight stocks to be used for miniprepping the following morning.
Wednesday
Lajja, Tae and Sarah mini-prepped RFP colonies (refer to the miniprepping protocol in the protocol notebook)
Jen discussed how to use the NanoDrop to correctly measure whether the miniprep was done correctly. As shown in the figure below, the concentration of DNA is relatively high [concentration] and the ratio of DNA to protein is [1.82], meaning that the miniprep was done properly and the DNA obtained is likely good for use.
Lajja, Tae, and Sarah plan on retransforming the DNA obtained from the miniprep back into bacteria to make sure the DNA obtained still has the RFP plasmid in it.
Grant continued researching modeling projects and is contacting Adam from Jewett’s lab in order to possibly get help with modeling. Grant also found a webpage that helps with writing and solving biochemistry differential equations. Specifically, the differences between the different orders of kinetics reactions and how that affects the writing of the ODEs.
We decided to take our miniprepped DNA and prepare it for gel electrophoresis:

Upholding the principle of cooperation and sharing, we have collaborated with several iGEM teams this year. Mutual help from each other are listed in the following.
1.How we help others
Sincere assistance to the software of HFUT-China 2016
Experimental help to the high school team CIEI-BJ
Collaboration on human practice surveys with Munich United 2016
Participation in newsletter of XMU-China 2016

Scientific measurement from JNFLS 2016
Useful suggestions from Peking 2016
Mutual help makes us begin to scratch the surface of the collaboration’s potential and we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with more teams into the future!
1. HOW WE HELP OTHERS
Sincere assistance to the software of HFUT-China 2016
This year, HFUT-China designed a software named BioDesigner Coral, the purpose of which is to recommend biobricks to those exhausted by the countless literature. It is convenient to acquire the relationship between genes or parts and related diseases through visualization. Their project excited the attention of us and we had a close collaboration with them in various ways.
Once after their preliminary design, we were the initial users to test how the software worked, using our sequences and some detailed data on probation. Based on the results, we firstly concluded a meticulous report to feedback not only for parameter choice but also the literature analysis. Then we also suggested expanding the databases to a wealth of non-standard parts and collecting experimental data of more parts for more optimal protocols. Receiving our feedback, they debugged the system again, which has perfected their software to a broad use.
What's more, for better user interface design, we offered sincere opinions about the software we had employed in daily researches, such as Primer Premier 5, SnapGene, MEGA6, etc. Our feedback advanced their optimization about user design and therefore the software became more user-friendly.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"
METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," music performance of students from Mavi Çizgi music school. After the music, Tuğba İnanç ,our PI,                  talked about her experiences in iGEM with previous teams and officially initiated presentation session. Her presentation was followed by                  Dr. Ceyhun Kayıhan's speech in which he talked about the history of Synthetic Biology and its impact on the society.
Then, team presentations started and followed the order as Saint Joseph iGEM, Bilkent UNAMBG, METU_HS_Ankara, and finally Acıbadem İstanbul.                  We all have asked questions to each other, gave advice and shared our memories from the summer we left behind. It was refreshing to see new                  interpretations and ways of doing things. Also it was motivating to see that we were not the only ones to face problems and spend efforts to                  overcome them.
After the scientific presentations session, to have some fun and build stronger bonds as iGEMmers, together with Saint Joseph team, we followed                  the route to a tour in METU campus, which is known to be green, refreshing  and fun. Along the way, we shared our hilarious memories and struggles                  throughout our journey of iGEM.
We all think that this meetup was productive, and we wish all the teams the best of luck.
Modeling with Bielefeld
As a highschool team, we were short on knowledge such as programming and modelling. Another setback was working through the summer, when many                  people were on vacation, but the iGEM teams.
During the meetup presentations, one of the teams mentioned getting help and support from the iGEM Bielefeld CeBiTec 2018 team. They also                  mentioned being glad with how their project turned out. So we reached out to them.
Through our chats on Instagram, they acknowledged using multiple modeling approaches; they modeled toxicity kinetics of different metal ions and promoters which they can use for metal uptake related parts and a filter system for water purification. Moreover, they also had a software                  tool for siRNA, which can be used for modeling. Unfortunately none of these modelling approaches suited our project in any aspect. However,                  they wanted to help us improve our project, thus, they found us several programs that we could use to make a 3D model of an enzyme.
They sent us a list of tutorials and steps necessary to have a proper model. Additionally they taught us how to calculate the binding energy                  between two proteins and then to load the proteins into the software tool; Chimera. Here we could modify them by removing helixes and"

We also knew that we could control the expression of the genes in both of our plasmids. We were ready to put our abilities to extract rubber through the non-soxhlet method and detect it using H1 NMR to the test. In other words, we were ready to find the rubber present in our strain!

During the first test of our CPS bacteria (MG1655 transformed with both plasmids - see Design ), bacteria were grown to late exponential phase at 37ºC, then induced with 1mM IPTG, 0.2% Ara, and 1mM MgCl2. It was then transfered to room temperature for another 4 hours of growth. Non-soxhlet extraction was used to purify any rubber present in the sample, which was then compared to a positive control (WT mixed with polyisopren - also undergone non-soxhlet extraction) and a standard isoprene solution.
Figure 3 illustrates the peaks given by pure polyisoprene are found at 5.12 (A), 2.04(B) and 1.68(C)in the ratio 1(A):4(B):3(C). Additionally, a peak is visible at 1.56 indicating water (the standard was not dried in a vacuum oven ON like the rubber extraction was). The peak at 0.00 ppm is the defining peak of the ppm axis and represents TMSTMSTetramethylsilane which is a calibrating standard.
Our rubber extraction of WT + polyisoprene (Fig. 4) gives the same peak placement as the pure polyisoprene ((A), (B) and (C)). However, the integration of the 3 peaks shows a relationship of approximately 1:5:4. The discrepancy can be explained by the impurities in the area between 0-2.5 ppm. Such impurities might add additional integration value to the peaks assigned to the polyisoprene peaks (B) and (C) - hereby causing a disruption of the true relationship. Some peaks from the solvents used to purify the rubber (Acetone, Ethanol, and Hexane), as well as a"

Week Sixteen   14/9 - 19/9
The final week was a tiring, stressed out trial, but we managed it. We spent late nights writing up and proofreading wiki content, entire days in the lab frantically trying to squeeze as many results out of our toeholds as possible, and many many hours filming and editing our video footage. Bielefeld kindly provided information on their home-made cell-free kit for our costings section, making our test significantly cheaper.
As well as all this, university began with Freshers week, meaning campus was rammed and workspace was limited. It also meant some mornings were met with hungover team members! Still, the outreach team managed to visit two sixth form colleges to speak about synthetic biology and our project. On Friday we presented our project to the physics department. Finally it its wiki freeze night! Much coffee and music to get us through the night!

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," Trends in Ecology & Evolution 15, 56-61). World governments are prescribing policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by curbing fossil fuel consumption. Unfortunately, without an alternative energy source such policies would cripple most industrialized nations.
Biofuels as Fossil Fuel Alternatives
The production of electricity from wind, solar, geothermal and nuclear sources will contribute greatly to replacing fossil fuels for residential and industrial energy needs. However, because we lack portable, high capacity means of storing electricity, it is currently not feasible to utilize electricity on a large enough scale to support long distance transportation systems. These systems include highly mobile forms of transport such as aircraft, automobiles, and trucks. Due to their high fuel density, liquid hydrocarbon based fuels remain the best option for these applications.   Biofuels have several properties that make them ideal direct replacements to petroleum based transportation fuels. First, due to the high degree of synthetic diversity present in biology, naturally occurring or genetically engineered organisms are available that can produce chemically equivalent, or even superior compounds, as compared to current petroleum based fuels. Second, biofuels are ultimately photosynthetically derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide. As such the combustion of biofuels does not contribute to net increases in greenhouse gas levels.
Food vs. Fuel Controversy
Current first generation biofuels include biodiesel (vegetable oil) and bioethanol (fermented plant derived sugars). These fuel sources depend on available crop species which are primarily used as food sources for humans and livestock (Naylor et al. (2007)Environment 49, 30-43). For instance, corn, sugar cane and cassava, are the primary source of sugar for the fermentative production of ethanol. Biodiesel, on the other hand, is produced from edible oilseed crops including canola, soybean and palm. Using food crops as feedstocks for biofuel production is controversial because it can lead to an unbalanced situation in which the continuity of food distribution is disrupted. Early signs of such problems were seen in 2009 when ethanol subsidies by the U.S. government prompted biofuel producers to increase corn purchases (Gura (2009) Cell 138, 9-12), which lead to subsequent increases in corn prices.  Corn represents a major component of livestock feed and as such a large spike in meat and dairy prices occurred (Hill et al.(2006) PNAS 103, 11206-11210; Pimentel et al. (2008) Energies 1, 41-78). The production of biofuels and biofuel fermentation feed"

5.  $K_{deg\_lys}$:lysine protein degredation
6.  $n_2$:hill coefficient
Result
The result shows that once the concentration of comE offset the threshold terminator, it would trigger the downstream circuits and finally generate lysine protein to help phage kill S. mutans.
The result indicates that there is lag phase before lysine protein accumulating to a higher amount. The lag phase is approximately 30 minutes. In our Stephen curve model, it only takes about 10 minutes for the pH to drop to its minimum level. This model is not for short time S. mutans eliminating, it is for normal prevention in case that phage might not be able to control S. mutans for certain reasons.

This experiment was analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). It worked for the recombinant protein as well as for the transgenic plant giving the proof of principle for Physcomitrella patens as a bioremediation organism .
BioAccumulation
Beside the enzymatic degradation of pollutants we found different methods to bind them on our moss filter. We called this system BioAccumulation . The most obvious idea was to use binding proteins which were developed for human therapy, such as antibodies, for example. To investigate this idea we used an alternative binding protein, the Anticalin, which was engineered to bind fluorescein as it has a very high affinity, a small size and a robust fold [ Vopel et al., 2005 ]. Beside this engineered binding protein, we also recognized the idea of Dundee iGEM 2013 which sounded quite interesting. This team used a protein which is found in the toxicity mechanism of microcysteins. Dundee wanted to use it as a binding partner to absorb the pollutant from the water. Thus we contacted Dundee iGEM, discussed our idea for a collaboration with them, got their BioBrick, converted it to RFC[25], assembled it into our modular receptor and finally transformed and selected stable transfected moss lines which we finally characterized. Basically the limitation of BioAccumulation applications is that binding proteins are only able to bind one pollutant per binding protein. Due to that fact an extremely high number of binding  proteins is required to achieve a recognizable reduction of environmental pollutants. We transformed and selected transgenic moss lines with all three effector proteins and checked the cellular localization of these proteins using fluorescence microscopy. We were able to confirm the activity of Moss lines, containing receptor bound Anticalins, which are able to bind fluorescein, whereas moss lines with a receptor, carrying the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) from our collaboration partner Dundee showed the localization of our Gene-construct in cytosolic vesicles and not on the membrane, as expected. This observation is in good agreement with the results presented by Dundee, that the SEC-pathway secretion is not working for this BioBrick. This observation may be explained due to surface exposed cystein residues which tend to aggregate in the oxidizing milieu. Therefore it would be necessary to perform protein engineering to"
Emory,2016,Team:Emory#test_-_-_TEXT.html," shuttlevectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.
Design, Protocol, and Experiments
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttlevectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).

Berlin_diagnostX,2017,Team:Berlin diagnostX#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," conversation fell on wound care and  healing the Team Berlin reinforced its willingness to share knowledge gained in medical school and to consult experts to answer the special questions the team TU Darmstadt had.
In the following weeks an active email exchange took place in which the team TU Darmstadt shared the questions they had and the areas they were most interested in. The following Skype webinar was based on those questions and covered many different areas regarding wound healing. The topic that were discussed involved different types of wounds ranging from stab wounds to burn wounds, wound microenvironments and of course the application and clinical role of wound hydrogels.
During an initial Skype meeting both realised that they were working on replicating the same algorithm to score possible sensor candidates and rank them by likelyhood of success prior to the in vitro screening. In the following email exchange both teams provided each other insight into their understanding of the methods described in the extended methods of this (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.002) paper. In addition the team EPFL iGEM shared the information they gathered from a meeting with one of the authors of the aforementioned paper. Those efforts combined led to the development of the toehold designer software in each team.
Since both teams also worked with cell free expression they exchanged protocols with insights gathered from previous experiments. The team EPFL iGEM shared their protocol of how to produce an own cell lysate. The team diagnostX on the other hand shared protocols for freeze-drying cell free expression systems and rehydrating them.
Due to the close proximity of Berlin and Potsdam collaboration between team Potsdam and team Berlin diagnostX was a breeze. The first contact happened in June and both teams soon exchanged information regarding the projects and the challenges of being a first time contender in the iGEM competition. The electronic contact was soon followed by a personal meeting playing a couple of rounds of volleyball in the heart of Berlin. Some members of team Potsdam also participated in a workshop organised by team diagnostX and the Boston Consulting Group to learn how to acquire new sponsors and advisors. On the other hand team Potsdam provided the vector pSB1C3 when team diagnostX had difficulties with their vector."

Making molecular biology easier
We imagine that iGEM should be about fast assembly of BioBricks, leaving more time for the actual project. It should be easy to combine any thinkable part, device or existing BioBrick. Unfortunately, classical cloning techniques can cause problems and even PCR can be cumbersome, if you have little or no laboratory experience.
Therefore, we introduce a simple and fast way of building new devices and vectors with ready to use PCR products. All that is needed is to select the favorite BioBricks and one of the ready to use backbone vectors, and mix it with USER enzyme. The assembled vector is ready for chemical transformation into competent E. coli cells only 70 minutes later.The 8-9 nucleotide overhangs (linkers) flanking the parts, can hybridize to complementary overhangs without the use of DNA-ligases.
No need to worry whether the destination vector has been fully linearized, no need to perform site-directed mutagenesis to remove unwished restriction recognition sites - just simple, fast, and easy.
It is possible to successfully assemble six biological parts in one reaction, reducing the plasmid construction time significantly. The upper limit of fragments that efficiently can be assembled has not yet been delineated (1).
In 2009 the first team from DTU participated in iGEM and introduced the USER fusion Assembly standard [BBF RFC 39] . This year we introduce a standardized version allowing easier use of the system. The Plug 'n' Play assembly standard can be found here (BBF RFC 80).

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html,". The lengths of the microtubules were mostly within $200$ ~ $400 \ \text{nm}$, which is in accordance with our simulation result.
Conclusion
Using the stochastic chemical reaction model we constructed, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to analyze microtubule polymerization dynamics. The simulation results are in accordance with existing experimental observations, which confirms the validity of the model.
We showed that the performance of the system (measured by how many tubulin dimers are polymerized onto the yeast surface) stops improving after the initial concentration ratio of dimers on the yeast surface and in the solution reaches 0.4, which helps our teammates at wet lab determine their experimental conditions.
We also illustrated that when the GTP hydrolysis rate constant $k_h$ is smaller than 1, reducing $k_h$ can boost microtubule assembly on the yeast surface dramatically. Since some microtubule-stabilizing agents such as Taxol® inhibit depolymerization by curbing GTP hydrolysis, this result proves that the agents’ stabilizing effects will still be significant in the context of our design, which confirms that our plan to use the microtubules displayed on the yeast surface to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents will be very effective.
Finally, our simulation results proved to be consistent with the experiment conducted in wet lab, which confirmed the effectiveness of our model and gave more credence to its predictions.

Sue's Tech Kitchen
Sue’s Tech Kitchen, the creation of Randi Zuckerberg, is a nationwide event dedicated to getting people excited about science through food. It’s known for its’ 3D printed smores and miracle berries, but it also serves as an opportunity for local groups to share their projects and visions with the community. We held a booth at the event in Tacoma, and had a blast telling our community all about our project. We created a mockup of our project with pH strips to represent the sensor, and solutions of a known acidity to represent water samples from around Puget Sound. Kids loved the idea of putting what looked like paper, into what looked like water, and seeing the paper change colors before their eyes. Adults were more excited about the idea of getting to test their own water and get accurate results that were easy to read. On a whiteboard, we set up a magnetic puzzle of our plasmid parts. Guests got to put together the puzzle as fast as they could, and the best time of each day won a cool water bottle. We met some incredible people, including a woman who helped create the map of arsenic contamination caused by the smelter. We had many people ask to buy test strips, but since the sensor isn’t complete, they settled for signing up for the email list. The event gave us great insight on what matters to the community, and we even got ideas on how to expand the sensor in the future!
Interview with Greg Tanbara
To continue familiarizing ourselves with problems caused by arsenic contamination in the environment, we turned to our local health department. We were able to get an interview with Mr. Greg Tanbara, a Health Promotion Coordinator for the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department. Mr. Tanbara analyzes the environmental damage caused by the Asarco Plant destruction and connects with members of the community that have been affected. He told us that the state has allocated 180 million dollars to revitalizing the soil in"

As a team we acknowledge the importance of high moral accountability and commitment to safety and security.  Additionally, in an effort to foster the sharing of information in our community, upon completion of the jamboree we will submit an article to be released in our school newspaper and in our College of Engineering website.  This winter we are also hosting a lecture by Drew Endy addressing synthetic biology which will be open to the public.  We hope to act as ambassadors to foster support and excitement in our own community.
Finally, our biosafety committee on campus has approved our project and considered possible safety risks to our team members and the environment.  It has been determined, that in our stage of research, basic laboratory precautions are sufficient to address our team safety including; wearing gloves, wearing eyeware, using a safety hood, and properly disposing of biowastes.  The biobrick components we have made this year are pose no known harm to human or animal safety.  Potentially, a secretion pathway could be used to secrete toxic proteins.  The secretion products that we have been intererested in are not known to be harmful.

This sunny and smart boy seems to have nothing to worry about at this time, except for one thing--his body weight. He really wants to put on some weight. Now, maybe he is savoring snacks somewhere, who knows?
Fan Cheng
Fan Cheng, a year 4 student majoring in biology, just like an undifferentiated stem cell, now hesitates about which direction to differentiate to satisfy her inner interest. However, one thing that she is 100 percent sure is that being both a good scholar and a good educator is her permanent goal. Because in eyes of her, those two are true romantic careers considering the current society which worships wealth and fame.
First drawn to iGEM by the dream of a respected graduate, and the wish to help one determined classmate to make his idea come true, now she found that the best part of the whole thing turns out to be the sense of the identity in the process. In this project , Fan Cheng is responsible for the construction of the system of the designed probiotic bacteria which can metabolite the fatty acids much faster and related methodological work about detecting fatty acids. Beyond biology, Cheng loves literature, especially those classical Chinese poems. If not being a biologist, she thinks that being a writer for example, a column writer to make science more accessible to the public, is a good option.

After a depressing gelelectrophoresis we now know that last week's plasmid preparations that we have sent in for sequencing did not work out. Nevertheless, we did a colony-PCR, plasmid preparation and control restriction digest of rox1-pTUM100 and Panb1-pTUM100. A gelextraction of Tadh1 was successful and further refining of the gelextraction commenced. A transformation of Padh1 and Psuc2 in pTUM had no colonies and plasmid preparations of last week's transformations (Padh1-pTUM100 and Psuc2-pTUM100) had negative gels after a control restriction digest.We prepared restrictions of pTUM100, mig1, mPR Dr, and mPR Xl and attempted a ligation + transformation of mig1, mPR Dr, and mPR Xl, in pTUM100 and in pSB1C3.
Week 9
A new batch of chemo-competent cells had promising results. Our test- Transformation was a success, finally no colonies on the negative plate. However, PCR purification of Tadh1 did not work out very well due to its small size - Tadh1 might just flow through the columns without adsorbing. Restriction digests of pTUM103 and pTUM104 and pSB1C3 plasmid preparations seemed to work well thus we were able to ligate Padh1 and rox1 into pSB1C3 this week! Plasmid preparations of luc, Psuc2 and Padh1 had good results and were sent in for sequencing. A colony-PCR of Psuc2 and normal PCR of Tadh1 was successful thus further steps could be initiated. The restriction and transformation of Psuc2 and Padh1 in pTUM100 were unsuccessful. Still, luc, Psuc2, and Padh1 were sequenced.  A transformation of rox1-pTUM100 and Panb1-pTUM100 yielded only few colonies - can't have everything"

When it had hardened, we spot tested 5 uL of the following samples on the plates: 11T4, T4Do(s), 12T4r, 40T4r, 40T4 into 6 sectors of a plate.  T4Do came from Dr. Casjens at the University of Utah. We incubated these plates at 37 degrees Celsius. We plated a control of just bacteria. Also, we infected .5 mL of BL21 with 1 uL of the T4Do sample for 20 mins, and then plated it. We started two liquid cultures, each containing 1 mL of BL21.  One received 1 uL of T4Do, the other received 10 uL. These were incubated on a shaker at 37C.

We performed a phage titer spot test on two bacteria.  We used the BL21 and W3110 strains of E. coli.  We first put 100 microL of broth into epindorf tubes.  We then took 10 microL of 1L, 10L, 40T4, T4DOS, and T4 infected phage and placed it in separate tubes labeled -1.  We performed a dilution series taking out 10 microL each time.  The last tube we did not remove 10 microL so the total volume was 110 microL.  Next we added 4.5 mL of 1x top agar to .5mL of bacteria for both strains and plated it on LB plates.  We had previously divided the plates into six sections with the labels 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, and -5.  We took the phage from each concentration and spotted it on the plates.  We allowed the plates to sit and let the phage soak in.  We then placed the plates in the 37 C overnight.

They want all the teams to use letters or emails to show interesting things happening inside and outside the team. So we participated in this cooperation. This is an interesting collaboration, as it may be boring during the experiment, but the stories that happen in the experiment make the experiment fun. And by organizing these stories, we learn more about our experiments.

4. Our Meeting
Background: Each team's project in IGEM is not perfect at the start.In order to make project  perfect and make the team members cooperate with each other  more and more smoothly,each team holds the team meeting to discuss again and again. So it is important for us to hold meetings to make some discussions.The members of the IGEM in our college held a conference every week to discuss how to solve our current problems and how to do next.
The text: Our members of iGEM keep the habit of discussing at meetings once a week since March 10.
On March 10, the conference included that:
    ①Division of labor at that time.
    ②Members of the experimental group introduced the carbon dioxide capture project
    ③We made a plan for the next step.
    Through the discussion at this meeting, our division of labor has become more rational and the efficiency of work among members has been fully improved,and at the same time, our team members got a preliminary understanding of the project that we are going to carry out.
  
Fig.5 Our Meeting
On March 17, the conference included that:
    ①The most common type of CO2 fixation technology in the current stage.
    ②The expression and the Catalytic reaction mechanism of carbonic anhydrase in human, animal and plant;
    ③The living environment of carbonic anhydrase and how to maintain catalytic activity of carbon anhydrase.
Through the discussion at this meeting, we learned that traditional CO2 fixation technologies include chemical/physical solvent absorption, membrane absorption, deep-sea fixation, etc.
However, these methods have been proved to be extremely expensive in practice, and they further prove that the use of carbonic anhydrase as a potential biocatalyst is a promising fixation method.
On March 24, the conference included that :
    ①The basic knowledge of biological brick.
    ②The main function of carbonic anhydrase in our project;

Acetaldehyde Sensor
Where it comes from...
Figure 1: Structures of the AlcR(1-60)-DNA complex [13]
In Aspergillus nidulans, the alcR gene encodes a regulatory protein which activates the expression of the ethanol utilization (alc) pathway if the co-inducer acetaldehyde is present. Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by the alcohol dehydrogenase and further metabolized to acetate by the aldehyde dehydrogenase. Both genes alcA and aldA are regulated by AlcR. AlcR also regulates its own expression by autoactivation [1] . The AlcR DNA binding domain contains a zinc bi-nuclear cluster, which can bind either to symmetric and asymmetric sites with same affinity. In contrast to other members of the Zn2Cys6, the DNA binding domain is stretch of 16 amino acid residues between the third and fourth cysteine. AlcR binds as a monomer, but 2 proteins can bind to inverted repeats in a noncooperative manner. Additional DNA sequences upstream of the zinc cluster were identified to be responsible for high-affinity binding, [4] .
How we used it
Because fungal activators normally do not work in E. coli, the system was modified to work as a bacterial repressor. The mechanism of how AlcR activates transcription is not completely known, which makes the process of redesigning it very challenging. A second challenge is the different codon usage in Apergillus nidulans and E. coli. The codon adaptation index (CAI) of Aspergillus nidulans AlcR is 0.7 in E. coli, especially at the beginning of the gene a few very rare codons are present. To get a fully E. coli-optimized gene, we ordered the gene codon-optimized. To get a partly codon-optimized version, we exchanged the rare codons at the beginning of the Aspergillus nidulans protein with PCR.
Figure 2: Design of the promoter for the AlcR-system in SmoColi, the operon sequence is designed between the -10 and the -35 region (blue) of a strong promoter with inverted and direct repeats.
For a redesigned bacterial PAlc promoter, natural operator sites of AlcR from Aspergillus nidulans were placed between the -10 and -35 region of a constit"

7/9/2015: Day 28
Today we gave our presentation at the student talks-- it overall went very well!  People were definitely very interested in actually getting to know what projects we are working on in the lab and it was exciting on our end to be able to share how the project has changed over various iterations of brainstorming, designing, and redesigning.  Preparing for this presentation has also been a great opportunity to put into words the process and ideas and concepts that we’ve been using this summer, which will come in handy for our actual iGEM presentation and for writing future articles and such.

Today we continued to incorporate Casey’s artwork into our project-- the beautifully designed pieces add so much to our program experience!  We also worked on our project description, looked into more iGEM requirements, and discussed possibly meeting with Wellesley’s science center machinist, Larry, to work with the laser cutter to create our tangibles!
7/14/2015: Day 31
We’re still working on the functionality -- today we specifically looked at the tracking of coordinates and math to tell the flasks when they’re “on Mars”.  We determined the background image’s points, at what coordinates Mars began, ended, and the length of its radius.  We then checked the points of the flasks, and calculated the distance of the flask from Mars’ “midpoint”-- if its distance was less than the length of Mars’ radius, we programmed the animation to display deploying the bacteria to Mars.   This ended up being trickier than expected because the Widgets displaying the petri dishes on the two sides are rotated, and thus their X and Y values are flipped.  Furthermore, each Widget is a child Widget of a larger Widget, and their coordinates are relative to their Parent Widget.  Figuring"

In order to confirm that T1R2, T1R3 can be located on the membrane of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, we fused antigen tags MYC and 6xHIS at the N-terminals of T1R2, T1R3 respectively. The gene circuits for displaying the location of human receptors were constructed as Fig.11.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," it is possible to determine the ""spatial"" transfer function h2(z). To do this, it suffices to calculate the inverse Fourier transform of Hω2, which is done numerically as it can not be practiced analytically [4]. The behavior of these two views of the transfer function is shown in Figure 8 for two reference distances ρ0 between the observation point M and the axon.
Figure 8: Spatial transfer function h2(z) and space-frequency H2(k) of the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic medium for two distances ρ0 = 200 and 500 μm between the observation point and the axon (depth of the axon in the nerve).[4]
It is of course possible to go from the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model to the homogeneous isotropic model by considering in the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model that the conductivities of the media are equal to each other and that the perineurium is infinite. It is clear that the nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model is more realistic but the two models give relatively close medium transfer function variation trends.
We have described the two models in order to calculate the potential extracellular created by the presence of nodal currents generated at Ranvier nodes. This extracellular potential at a point M and at a time t can be expressed as the convolution product in the spatial domain between the nodal current i(z, t) and the transfer function of the medium h(z)[4]:
v(M,t) = h(z)∗i(z,t)
We consider the typical case of a 8.7 μm diameter axon near myelin gains (length lmy=1000 μm) and diameter 2.8 μm near the Ranvier’s nodes.
The objective of this part is to study the spatial and spatio-frequency properties of the extracellular potential created by such an axon.
Two reference distances (ρ'=200 μm and ρ'=500 μm) are considered between the observation point and the axon. The action potential at the surface and along the nerve is represented figure 9 for the two previous models. Whatever the model used, the low-frequency component - space current envelope (see Figure 9) - is found on the action potential generated. It can be concluded that the action potential has the same wavelength as the nodal currents at Ranvier's node. The nonhomogeneous and anisotropic model, closer to reality, gives a greater amplitude than the homogeneous isotropic model. This phenomenon - due partly to the insulating effect of the extr"

Human Practice Strategy
Dissemination of knowledge to future researchers
Our human practices strategy is defined by our team’s desire to inspire high school students to pursue a study line in synthetic biology. The aim is to push the boundaries of traditional high school education by increasing awareness and integrating students in the scientific process of the iGEM competition.
 
Outline of our visions - What did we want to accomplish?
Our goal was to interact with bright high school students focusing on a future career in scientific research, university students who could become the next iGEM participants, and in general to extend the exposure of iGEM to the general public. To that end, we intended to invite three high school students onto our team as contributing members with the purpose of creating a “ripple effect” of learning and teaching. This did happen and we taught them how to work in the lab and then asked them to present their mini-project to their classmates to inspire them. We also participated in campus events to engage the university students and invite them to join our team. Public outreach was achieved through social media, conferences, and articles in the university paper.
 
Considerations in strategy design
The primary focus of the Human Practice strategy was involvement, education and safety (see Figure 1).
Involvement is an essential step towards getting people interested in the world of synthetic biology. We wanted to address critical questions about genetic modification in biological organisms, and involve peers in related discussions. This was a vital element as discussions bring new thoughts, encourage the exchange of ideas and raise the level of learning. Advanced knowledge about particular topics in synthetic biology could contribute a solid foundation to young students along with promoting innovative futuristic ideas and perspectives to the iGEM community.
Figure 1. Visual representation of the three core elements in the human practice strategy.
Education was our second agenda and we sought to inspire high school students to explore and utilize synthetic biology tools. Familiarizing the next generation with synthetic biology techniques has the potential to inform and inspire young scientists to work towards a bio-sustainable environment in-line with the iGEM philosophy. We believe that education is key to generate new hypotheses and experiment with the creation of new concepts in synthetic biology. Ethics, a"

Integrated Human Practice
Introduction
Human practice has been a cornerstone in our iGEM project right from the start. We have spent a great deal of time educating others about our project. We have been able to use the feedback to improve our presentation and get ideas for new future perspectives, as well as avoiding any potential pitfalls. We have also been reaching out to companies and experts in different fields to get a more qualified view on our work. The information they gave, helped and gave us new goals and expanded our knowledge of the different sub elements. By interviewing experts and companies, we have gained insight into today's market and we can observe that there is a demand for new solutions to old problems, of which our sub elements have great potential.
Projects
Evaluation from KOLD College
We finished our visit at KOLD College with an evaluation in order to get a better idea of our performance and project. We received constructive feedback on Bacto-Aid. The students showed awareness about the problems of antimicrobial resistance. It was rewarding to see, that we are trying to solve an issue that the society worries about. We reflected on the comments and have integrated the feedback into our future presentation. Some examples of feedback were: ""There is a lot of potential in these areas"". The future potential for the different parts of the project tended to give a positive response. Therefore, we added a slideshow exclusively for the potentials of the sub projects. ""It lacks focus on problematics”. We took this comment into consideration and decided to start the presentation with an explanation of why this area still needs a solution. The feedback helped us especially with finding a fixed focal point throughout the presentation.
Interviewing Laura Jakobsen
We interviewed the nurse Laura Jakobsen who is working at the plastic surgery department at the University Hospital of Odense (OUH). In Denmark, burn patients are mainly sent to OUH and Rigshospitalet. She helped us understand what kind of issues the hospitals are facing when treating burn wounds, and the requirements needed for a functional Bacto-Aid. At OUH, they have encountered resistant bacterial infections, which required special care and extra awareness. This confirms the problem of resistance"

Results from the transformation with glycerol stocks
We used two different glycerol stocks, one from 07/08 and one from 13/08. We also had 2 different protocols (cf 18/08 page).
We tested our stocks on blank plates, cells are alive, the problem is to know if they are still competent or not.
Protocol 1 (with incubation time before adding DNA)
- Stock from 07/08 : nothing on the control and nothing on the transformation plate.
- Stock from 13/08 : nothing on the control and nothing on the transformation plate.
Protocol 2 (without incubation time before adding DNA)
- Stock from 07/08 : nothing on the control and nothing on the transformation plate.
- Stock from 13/08 : nothing on the control, and 1 colony on the transformed plate. We checked the fluorescence of bacteria into this colony (vector ECE166 with promoter and GFP). We have fluorescence, so our transformation is ok.
The result of this confirm that our stock of competent cells in glycerol is still competnet since we managed to transform one colony. The problem is certainly not the storage, but our protocol when we use frozen competent cells> We need to improve the efficiency of this protocol.
Test our Erythromycin stock
- We put some colonies on a Ery 0.5 plate. They grow, but in a very small amount, so our antibiotic seems to be fine.
- Cells in LB with antibiotic : no growth!
So our antibiotic is ok, either we did not transform our cells and that is why everything grew on Ery plates, either there is a problem in our protocol for Ery test.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," transformations via electroporation led to any colonies. For troubleshooting, we conducted a control experiment with another plasmid bearing an ampicillin resistance gene and got colonies on our plates. Our explanation for these results is that different ampicillin resistance genes have different substrate specificities and the gene from the matriptase plasmid probably is specific for ampicillin but not for carbenicillin. Therefore, we propose to clone the matriptase gene into another backbone, for instance with kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance and then repeat the experiment to investigate V. natriegens for potential enhanced protein yield.
Industry - Investigation on Up-Scalability for Vibrigens
To take a closer look at the industrial promises V. natriegens might pose we contacted individuals heavily involved or representing with one industrial branch. We reached out to biotechnologist, Robert Giessmann, from the research group of Prof Dr. Peter Neubauer who possess a long-standing expertise in making laboratory procedures applicable to the needs of industrial production. They pose the valuable interface to enable scale-up of academic successes.
As a first step to tinker V. natriegens to that purpose, he suggested tracking how the conditions in the media changes during V. natriegens growth. Especially important are the differences in dissolved oxygen and pH levels over time. He mentioned that these factors heavily impact growth, OD as well as organism and product behavior. Furthermore, he wanted us to consider that the choice of media, and a controlled distribution and can facilitate how well V. natriegens performs in a bioreactor. We received his generous offer to conduct suitable experiments for his advice in their specialized laboratory in Berlin since our home University does not offer the same technical equipment.
Figure 1: Sensor-equipped shaking flask.
Shaking flasks with imbedded chemosensors.
Cultures were prepared in a small sensor-equipped shaking flask. Their two imbedded chemosensors on the surface react to the shifts of pH and oxygen. Results are interpreted by a connected software and deliver time-resolved changes in media condition. The interaction is wireless via Bluetooth ensuring that the cultures are constantly shaking with 250 rpm in an incubator at 37°C. This technical set-up avoids interruption of the growth process and provides us with more accurate and detailed data.
Firstly, we took a detailed look at the normal growth media for V. natriegens, LB supplemented with v2 salts, in various combinations with a baffled and unbaffled flask. Secondly, we underwent various steps towards the utilization of different"

The RhlI device can then synthesise the C4-AHL, which passes through into the extracellular space. The reporter cell encodes and expresses the transcription factor RhlR. When enough C4-AHL has been produced by the processor cells, the AHL will pass through the membrane into cells in the community. The C4-AHL which passes into the reporter cells will bind to the RhlR, and activate transcription from the Prhl promoter, which is upstream from a reporter coding sequence (e.g. superfolder GFP). This process is shown diagrammatically in Figure 3.

Society
Our team have made a lot of vivid and detailed introductions which involved in some interesting knowledge about syenthetic biology to the freshman. During the period of  publicity ,they showed great enthusiasm and asked questions actively, we answered each of the various questions about IGEM with patience. At the same time,our team members have also given several presentations to let them experience the atmosphere of final competition.
New Power
Time: 2015.9.10-2015.9.12
Location: A high school in  Maanshan City  Anhui Province, China
In order to expand the influence of IGEM, we have gone to high school to explain the knowledge about synthetic biology and our project for students who were in military training. They were all interested in IGEM and we have also made several biological experiments with them, which expressed them a lot about synthetic biology and IGEM.
Questionnaire
Percentage Calculation Method of Multiple Choice Questions. Percentage=Times of Chosen\Marks of Effective Answer Sheet.It means the proportion of people who chose one answer in number of those who filled in the questionnaire. So the percentage addition of multiple choice questions may beyond one hundred percent.
Ⅰ. Questionnaire survey, about 36.08% of people think that biotechnology effects on human life has a positive effect, 58.08% of people believe that at the same time has a positive and the negative side, only 2.4% of people hold a negative attitude. In life science research should focus on what aspects of the issue, the answer is most of the medical and health and environmental protection. And about synthetic biology or igem, only very few people have a deep understanding to them (6.29%), the vast majority of people say never concern (78.74%) or have been focused on (14.97%). This suggests that people support the development of biotechnology, but understanding of synthetic biology is not too much.
At the same time, related health problems, according to the results of the survey about 87.72% of people have the consciousness of prevention of disease, but don't know much about the knowledge of all kinds of diseases and health. In choosing drugs, 85.33% natural medicine, more trust that natural medicine has the side effect is small, cure the disease and low relative to the synthetic drug price advantages. When"

BBa_K2082106: Error-prone Polymerase I
For higher the variety of our Evobody library, mutation is a necessary step. One big problem in case of mutation systems is the arbitrarily mutation rate of the mutation proteins on the whole DNA. It is not able to control where mutation can happen. This error-prone polymerase I, a mutated E. coli DNA-Polymerase I, shows very rare mutations in the genomic DNA and spared the mutation of important proteins for the cell. With this part we want to create a possibilty for increased usage of an in vivo mutagenesis system implemented in the iGEM parts registry and usable by all coming iGEM teams. For further informations visit our Best Basic Part site.

In the project of iGEM UoA , they transferred antifreeze protein gene to crops and combined the ability to regulate gene expression. They are aiming for the gene to only be expressed at high levels when the plant is at a cold enough temperature. We thought that our temperature sensing system would be ideal for them to set up the initial temperature database. Because the data would be collected immediately and accurately, they could derive continuous data from different areas and decide whether it is necessary to plant antifreeze crops in every farmland or valley. So far we have provided our design detail including hardware and software to iGEM UoA. We hope it would show a better value for both of us.

Bien que nous n’ayons pu en apporter la preuve par nos propres moyens, de nombreuses études montrent qu’amener une version wild-type d’un gène suppresseur de tumeur au sein d’une cellule tumorale mutée pour ce gène permet le déclenchement de l’apoptose. Des études in vivo chez l’homme dans le cadre du cancer de la prostate, de l’ovaire et du poumon ont d’ores et déjà été menées et présentent des résultats probants.
La mise en place de cette étude était faite, à l’origine, pour déterminer si l’application du DVS dans la lutte anti-cancer du poumon à non petites cellules était viable ou pas. N’ayant pu conclure selon nos propres résultats, c’est l’analyse de diverses publications qui nous a permis de valider la mise en application. Selon ces publications, non seulement la mise en application est confirmée dans le cadre de notre pathologie mais peut désormais être étendue à d’autres cancers comme les carcinomes hépatocellulaires, sur lesquels le fait d’amener un gène suppresseur de tumeur"

Meeting with Mr. Guillermo Rodríguez
Viana and Ana Laura had the opportunity to travel to Cuauhtémoc, a city specialized in fruit growing; production and exportation of apples, peaches, strawberries, walnuts, among many others.1 Thanks to Viana, who is native from this city, we were able to get to contact this beekeeper. Mr. Rodríguez is the president of the association of beekeepers in the city and we saw an enormous opportunity in talking to him. This was our very first direct approach with the beekeeper’s community!  We  were  very  excited  to  start  getting  to know   them.  What   would  they   think  about  our  ideas?  Would   they   be
interested in our project? How many things would they have to tell us? Our project was about to begin its transformation path.
This enriching talk lasted approximately 1 hour 15 minutes and different topics were discussed. We learned many general characteristics of bees' lives thanks to the great experience of the beekeeper: The different varieties of bees that exist, specific tasks of each type of bee and the joint work bees and beekeepers do to ensure pollination.
Regarding the existing methods against Foulbrood, Mr. Rodríguez mentioned how SAGARPA (National Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing, and Food) does not allow the usage of chemical contaminants in beehives because wastes may end up in honey flows. Mr. Rodríguez mentioned how beekeepers sometimes use extracts of rosemary or oregano against Foulbrood, but it is always difficult for them to know what dose to"

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," for providing and upholding essential services for its citizens, this is especially poignant for the provision of food and protection of farmland.
Newcastle City Council has recently declared their bold plans to convert Newcastle into a ‘Smart City,’ claiming ‘the North East is setting a new standard for digitally enabled urban sustainability' [4]. To present a vision of what Newcastle could be like as a ‘Smart City’ the Newcastle Helix Project has produced a series of scenarios, these include: smart energy network , local energy supply , integrated transport and green flood management.
We saw an opportunity to contribute to these scenarios by producing a sustainable agriculture scenario, we felt this area of urban development has been neglected by the plans thus far. As a result, we decided to take on the challenge of designing a ‘smart agriculture’ solution for Newcastle, demonstrating how the city can shift towards a sustainable agricultural model – setting an example for other cities across the globe – in turn, beginning to tackle some of the global issues our iGEM project set out to solve.
To begin, we researched into areas of the city where we feel space is being under-utilised, and in which a sustainable food source would have the most impact. After studying the urban agriculture industry, communicating with stakeholders (see our timeline ), and speaking with local academics we were informed of a space that gives access to locations across the city. Newcastle’s Victoria Tunnel; a disused tunnel that was once used to transport coal from the mines down to the river for shipment - as well as serving as a bunker during WWII. It runs beneath a variety of urban hubs that would benefit from fresh produce including: Newcastle University, Northumbria University, Royal Victoria Hospital, Student villages, and Business centres (see map ).
As part of our Human Practices we have conceptualised an architectural design project within the Victoria Tunnel that transforms it into an urban farm. This design exercise integrates / was informed by all elements of our project – stakeholder engagement, wetware, hardware, and safety.
Below is the journey we took to design the Victoria Tunnel Urban Farm:

Step 1: Initial Project Considerations
(Legislation/Safety)
Once we had decided upon the initial project idea, we knew that we would be working with plants; this led us to look for applications for our product within the agriculture industry. As a result, our project - if successful - would potentially involve releasing our genetically modified bacteria into soil microbial communities – but we were aware this may also have undesirable and unforeseen impacts on the rhizosphere.
To further our understanding of this topic, we began to look at existing legislation"

Science Festival
On October the 12th, on the occasion of the French Science Festival , laboratories of the Paris-Sud University arranged visits and events for general public. Because it is sometimes difficult to talk about science to children, we tried to didactically approach this with experiments and simple visual presentations to illustrate synthetic biology and our project.
Meeting with high school students
One of the objectives of the iGEM competition is to promote synthetic biology and raise awareness about the future challenges that it will represent. Thus, we decided to introduce synthetic biology to students from a high school in order to present what synthetic biology exactly is and to collect their feelings about this new science. We were greeted at the high school: “Lycée Jacques Prévert” in the city of Longjumeau near Paris.
We first described briefly what a gene is and how it is expressed to clear their heads up. Fortunately, they knew perfectly this subject.  We wanted to know what were their first thoughts when we talked about synthetic biology without describing it. They usually answered by explaining the meaning of each words: built something with biological organisms.  They were surprised to learn that a bacteria can be used as a machine to produce so many things. Then they realized that maybe we could do whatever we want and it could be dangerous.
The question of GMOs was raised at this point. They said that GMOs were only profitable for company who made them. They underlined the fact that GMOs were used for a short period and maybe we do not know yet all the effects and it might occur some side effects too. Underlying the fact that GMOs can also produce some medicine, they finally believed that it must be a good tool for high and effective production.
At the end of the day, they had all the arguments to make their own project when we asked them to write on a paper what they wanted to do with synthetic biology. We collected the paper and realized that they understood what we presented to them. Here are some of their projects:
Feed poor countries with specifically transformed plants (drought-resistant).
Transform humans to have wings
Create paper-producing bacteria
Rainbow human: decrease racism with humans genetically modified to change their skin colour all along the day
This experience was very helpful to really understand what young students think about this new science. We did not expect them to be so open-minded and it made us confident about the future of synthetic biology.
Collaborations
Throughout the project, we exchanged and collaborated with many iGEM teams.

lox66 is a site specific recombination cassette. It belongs to the loxP family frequently used in genetics, particularily in mouse genetics. lox site recombination is catalysed by a Site specific recombinase, Cre. lox sequences are composed of an 8 bp Core sequence surrounded by two Arms. The particularity of lox66 is that it has an altered sequence at the end of it's left arm compared to loxP. This sequence variation reduces affinity of the Cre recombinase for the arm. As a consequence, after a recombination between a lox66 and a lox71 (altered right arm sequence), one of the two resulting generated lox sites has very low recombination potential as it inherited both mutated arms. Use of lox66 & lox71 sites is potentially interresting when the recombination reaction must be ""irreversible"".

We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.
