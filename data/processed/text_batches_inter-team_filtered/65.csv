Major Collaboration- wet lab with  NTU Singapore
Bidirectional Collaboration With NTU Singapore
For the third consequtive year, Macquarie University has collaborated with the NTU Singapore iGEM team . After a number of discussions, we were able to organise ways so that we could both assist each other.
Following our success last year in the purification and in vitro assays of their dCas9 constructs, they requested that we repeat said process with their new mutant variants this year.
To assist us, we required them to perform a quantitative PCR on two of our composite Chlorophyll biosynthesis parts. BBa_K2664007 which adds a tail to protochlorophyllide, turning it into chlorophyll a (Figure 4) and BBa_K2664006 which adds a magnesium ion to protoporphyrin IX (Figure 5). As we have changed the promoters from lac to trc on a number of parts, we wished to quantify protein expression after induction with IPTG in our parts.
What We Did For Them:
The in vitro assay that we performed was on four truncated dCas9 mutants: 3ple, 3ple 4QHP, Rec2_HNH, and Rec2_HNH 4QHP.  This project used the dCas9 enzyme to form a Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with gRNA, and subsequently bind to the target sequence in our PCR product (similar to what we did for the last two years). The results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) show that the dCas9 enzymes (3ple, 3ple 4QHP, Rec2_HNH, and Rec2_HNH 4QHP) no longer retain their nuclease activity (see Figures 2,3). This is evident from the gel shift present, the shift of the target sequence protein, indicating the mutant dCas9 has bound the target sequence of DNA from its slower migration through the gel (see Figure 2,3).

Transformation of P86, P87, P97
We transformed each of the UTAustin plasmids (individually) and a new strong RBS into TOP 10 cells. The RBS has been miniprepped. The UTA plasmid transformants formed a lawn, so were restreaked first. Liquid cultures have been grown up. P87 requires mutagenesis to remove a PstI site ~100 bp into the coding region of the Cph/EnvZ fusion. We miniprepped P86A, P86B, P87A, P87B (all in E2) from liquid cultures. The amp and cm negative controls did not have any growth.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today the project overview will be discussed during our general meeting with Dr. Kosuri.  Fasih will then help us take our glycerol stock from Dr. Yeates and plate them to select for making a starter culture tomorrow.
Meetng notes:  site direct mutagenesis with whole plasmid.  Need DpnI
Try Gibson assembly:  Need Gibson and PCR enzymes, DpnI (cuts methylated GATC to remove old plasmid)
Conclusions:  Upon retrieving the clones, it was realized that they were in the -20 degree fridge instead of the -80 degree fridge.  The entirety of the tube was used to plate the cells on an agar plate with ampicillin, with the help of Tristan.  He did not work over a flame. Conclusions:  If colonies grow, we will make a starter culture tomorrow, and the large culture Friday.  Hopefully something grows on our plates :(
Intro: researched protocols for glycerol stock replating. Lab-wide meeting with Sri. Watched Tristan plate our glycerol stock (-80 is in 7718, -20 is in 7736). Further reading of Yeates' methods. Looked at dynamic light scattering and native page for size analyses of cage with and without thrombin cleavage. I think we could get away with doing a normal sds-page to see if thrombin cleaves the cage. However, we will first need to verify proper cage structure with another method (dls?).
Glycerol Protocols: Addgene looks like a good place for protocols. Streaking pattern is good to know. https://www.addgene.org/plasmid-protocols/create-glycerol-stock/
Lab Meeting Pertinent Notes: Sri said normal site directed mutagenesis could work and is worth a shot (primer anneals both 20 bp regions flanking insert nucleotides). We would need DpnI.

pET29b(+)-phaCJ and pET29b(+)-phaC
Because the gel confirmations for the isolation of the digested pET29b backbone did not work last week, we ran the pET29b-RFP digested vectors from August 10th on a 1% LMP gel to confirm the success of the digestion. We ran the remaining digested vector samples stored in the freezer from last week loading dye; 10uL of sample 1 and 4.5 uL of sample 2. The bands were observed this time. There was one band at 5.2kb and another blurry band around the hundred bp location for the RFP insert digested out of the vector. The gel was excised to isolate the backbone at 5.2 kb.
We successfully isolated the pET29b backbone needed for ligations to our inserts. An in-gel ligation was performed with the isolated pET29b vectors and the digested A beta-oxidation and PhaC inserts. Competent DH5α cells were transformed with the ligated vectors containing phaCJ and phaC.  The transformation for pETE29b(+)-phaCJ and pET29b(+)-phaC did not work. We spun down the transformed cells in the plain LB stored in the fridge from the previous day and resuspended them in 50uL LB Kan and plated the cells. However, the plates were not placed in the incubator after plating when we checked on them the next day. There were no colonies seen on the plates. Therefore, we placed the plates in the incubator for another day. Bacterial colonies were observed on the plate when we observed them the next day. We made a master plate of the 8 of the transformed colonies for both pET29b(+)-phaCJ and pET29b(+)-phaC and made overnight cultures for restriction digest confirmation the next day. We screened 8 A beta-oxidation colonies the following day by performing miniprep on overnight cultures.

Uppsala-Sweden,2011,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"0034-pcyA that we sent looked fine. B0034-ho1 also looked good. The only clone sent of ccaR looked good. ccaS from Tabor’s plasmid was correctly amplified.
Summary so far
Things are going as planned but we have encountered some problem. We have successfully performed the first BioBrick assembly on the chromophore, extracted ccaR, ccaS and PcpcG2 from pJT122, mutagenized amilGFP_EcoRI and amilGFP_EcoRI and prepared a frozen stock of all the constructs generated so far. The sequencing data confirmed that everything was in order. However, we are still working on cph8 and have to incorporate new inverters in the system. We are happy with what we have accomplished so far and excited to tackle the challenges ahead.
2011-07-15
Erik L cloned tetR inverter into pSB1K3 and later transformed it. Lidaw and Johanna continued with the transformation of B0034-pcyA-B1001, Laura and Sibel transformed PLlacO-B0034-ho1 and pSB4K5. We did plasmid preparation of pSB1K3-B0032, o/n of pSB1C3-CcaS_EcoRI, pGEM-amilCP_PstI and pBS4A5.
mCherry is an alternative red output module that we found in the BioBrick registry. We decided to try it out since its red output is stronger than RFP. Thus we transformed the mCherry (J06702, with RBS and double terminator) from the kit.
2011-07-16
Started by doing plasmid preparation and freezing PSB4A5 stock. We also did plasmid preparation of pSB1A2-B0034. Then we proceeded to screen of PcpcG2 and pGEM-amilCP_PstI.
Made glycerol stock and & mutagenesis/BB10 PCR of pSB1C3-CcaS_EcoRI (-->ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI), pGEM-amilCP_PstI and pBS4A5 (amilGFP_Pst1_BB10). Only amilGFP_Pst1_BB10 showed a band on the gel. Re-streak of the transformations from yesterday and o/n of pcpcG2 and amilCP.

pCopA sfGFP with divergent CueR
Our biosensor design. We unfortunately never managed to submit this part
This promoter system was based upon this part in the registry from Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec in 2015.
The team assembled a copper biosensor from two subparts which they then joined together:
The first part is a pCopA-RBS-sfGFP and the second part is the regulator CueR expressed from a constitutive promoter. The part is deposited in the registry and labelled to suggest the CueR is expressed divergent from the sfGFP (on the opposite strand and transcribed in the opposite direction):
How BBa_K1758324 is labelled in the registry
However if you look at the sequence level this is clearly not the case. The constitutive promoter and the CueR start codon are at the 5’ end of the sfGFP coding strand and the CueR stop codon just upstream of pCopA. The part in fact has the constitutive promoter on the same strand as pCopA and sfGFP facing in the same direction and would be better represented like this:
How BBa_K1758324 should be labelled in the registry based on its underlying sequence
As the two coding regions are not separated by a transcription terminator, there would be read through from the constitutive promoter to the sfGFP and sfGFP would be expressed even in the absence of copper. As no negative control is included in the plate reader graph they provide and no settings provided for their BioLector experiments in their protocols it is unclear just how high the expression level at 0mM copper was for this part compared to a negative control strain.
The CueR subpart ( BBa_K1758320 ) making up BBa_K1758324 is also incorrectly labelled.
When we designed this part we flipped the CueR and the constitutive promoter to face the opposite direction on the opposite strand i.e. so they were divergent. We also had to remove the 5'UTR, which Bielefeld found to increase expression, because it was too AT rich to be synthesised.
Unfortunately, every attempt to amplify this part from the synthesised sequence we received from IDT resulted in the same two point mutations in the sfGFP region of this part making it non-functional. To compare this promoter system to the others"
DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Notebook#Lab notes_-_-_TEXT.html," manufactures protocol for purification of DNA from TAE and TBE agarose gels, see protocol section for more information.
Despite several attempts we have not been able to obtain BioBrick pyrG and pyrG-DR. Therefore we made a test with well-known primers without USER-tails (sometimes these USER-tails can be tricky). This was done to verify if something was wrong with the DNA template. The gel electrophoresis did not show any bands, and thereby it revealed that the DNA template was the source of error. Problem solved!
We also started cultivation of the mammalian cell line, U2OS, which is derived from a patient with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). They were defrosted and cultivated in DMEM medium containing serum, penicillin and streptomycin. The cell line was then transferred to a 25 cm2 culture flask, see protocol section.

Given the vast number of cofactors in the e-coli we needed a method to select the molecular structures closest to azo dye waste products. To solve this problem we developed a computer program that would do just that: Many different azodyes exist – each of which gives different products after being broken down by cleaving enzymes. But how are these products related? Do they all look very similar? Or are they all very different? We're interested because we would like to take the products of one or more of the azodyes and use it to chemically synthesise a xenobiological compound that our engineered bacteria would absolutely need to continue to survive.
The image above is not a map of stars or galaxies, but a map of the chemical similarity space of the products of azodye breakdown. We call it the 'Azodye Night Sky'. Here the colour denotes the colour of the original azodye (except black = white), and distance is a rough measure of the similarity of two compounds.
This image was included in our exhibition as part of our Uncolour Me Curious event.
How was the Azodye Night Sky generated?
There exist computational chemistry tools that can analyse the similarity between two molecules. These work by first encoding each molecule of interest as a bit string ""10010001100101…"" where each bit represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of some substructure within the molecule. These bit strings are known as fingerprints.
We can then compare molecules by taking the bitwise AND operation on the two fingerprints. This is a function that is only 1 if both molecules are 1. For example:
A = 0110101...       B = 0011111... A AND B = 0010101…
Then we can get the similarity between the two molecules by the fraction: (Number of 1s in A AND B) / (Total number of bits)   But if we want to visualise this we don't actually want the similarity but instead the dissimilarity (the distance between two molecules in similarity space): dissimilarity = 1 - similarity   Now imagine we have N molecules. Then the NxN dissimilarity matrix gives us the dissimilarity between any two of those molecules. But because similarity space is so complex, if we wanted to draw  the map of these distances we would need to use (in general) N-1 dimensions!   Because"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM"

MycoSIR E. coli depend on our synthetic pathway for growth. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was deleted for cysI and transformed with the three genes of the mycoSIR pathway expressed from IPTG-inducible T7 promoters (red). Wild-type (blue), uninduced (purple) and pathway-minus (gold) strains were used as controls. Both time course growth curves (A) and final ODs (B) reveal that the complete, induced pathway is required for growth
Infiltrate
Background
Latent tuberculosis persists inside macrophages of the lungs, where it is partially protected from both the host immune system and conventional antibiotics.
Aims
To create an E. coli strain capable of entering the macrophage cytosol and delivering a lytic enzyme to kill mycobacteria.
Results
We expressed the enzyme Trehalose Dimycolate Hydrolase (TDMH) in E.coli and showed that it is highly toxic to mycobacteria in culture.
We expressed the lysteriolyin O (LLO) gene in E. coli and showed that it is capable of entering the macrophage cytosol.
We co-infected macrophages with both mycobacteria and our engineered E. coli to characterize the resulting phagocytosis and killing.
FTDMH expression kills mycobacteria in culture. We mixed E. coli and WT M.smegmatis in LB media. Plating assays were used to count specifically M. smegmatis after the indicated times. When TDMH-expression was fully induced, more than 98% of mycobacteria were killed after 6 hours (red line). Populations of mycobacteria alone (black line) and mycobacteria mixed with uninduced E. coli (blue line) were stable.
Sabotage
Background
One of the main concern about tuberculosis today is the emergence of antibiotic resistant strain
Aims
Our objective is to make an antibiotic-resistant bacterial population sensitive again to those same antibiotics.
Results
Construction and characterization of phagemids coding for small RNA targeting antibiotic resistance proteins
successful conversion of antibiotic resistant population of E. coli to a sensitive state
Our synthetic phage conveys antibiotic-sensitivity to an antbiotic-resistant population. WT and chloramphenicol resitant strains (1 mL at OD 0.7) were infected with 10 ul of collected phage. Cells were plated at various antibiotic concentrations to measure sensitivity. (A) The anti-Cm phage system"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

We speculated that repeated centrifuge at high speeds was too traumatic for the digested protoplast cells, and the survival rate following the transformation was too low to produce colony forming units.
Additional difficulties also arose in the recovery phase of the protoplast transformation, as the lack of antibiotic selection sometimes compromised portions of our rich recovery plates. (The recovery plates contained over 340 g of sucrose/mL).

Conclusions
In retrospect, we were a little too ambitious in choosing the scale of our projects. The elucidation of successful transformation protocols required more time than we had available, and at the time of this wikifreeze, we are still trying different concentrations of PEG, and lysozyme digestion on S. pasteurii.
Our plan to characterize the function of 2010 Newcastle’s sporulation part is also currently unrealized, due to the difficulties in transforming S. pasteurii. Nevertheless, we believe that though it has not been realized for the cut-off date of this jamboree, sophisticated investigation of S. pasteurii as a genetic chassis is still a worthwhile endeavor. Particularly as the industrial commercialization of biocementation reaches fruition, the understanding and ability to regulate the genetic activity of urease in S. pasteurii will be an essential breakthrough optimizing and fine-tuning the biostructures we create.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"
ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," be supressed even in the presene of lactate, which would result in a reduced sensitivity of our system. If the promoter KM value is too low, already basal levels of lactate will be able to trigger gene expression from the regulated ORF, resulting in an increased number of false positives. To decide the optimal architecture of our regulatory system, we designed nine promoters suposedly regulated by LldR and lactate. We based our design on the natural version of the LldR-operon promoter which was already published as a Biobrick (BBa_K822000) .
Design of synthetic LldR-promoters
In the design of our synthetic promoters, we wanted to keep several things in mind. According to literature [Aguilera, 2008] the repression of gene expression via LldR is based on DNA looping between O1 and O2. We therefrore tried to keep the distance between the two operators constant in respect to the natural version (BBa_K822000) . We designed the first class of promotes by replacing the natural lldR promoter by three biobrick Anderson promoters of different strenghts ( J23100 , J23117 , and J23118 ), leaving the general architecture constant. In addition to that, we removed the ArcA binding site to avoid a regulation by other molecules.
Since the actual mechanism of action of lldR is not described in too much detail in the literature yet, we wanted to test how important the arrangement of operators and promoter is. We therefore designed a second and a third group of promoters where the promoter itself is not flanked by the operator, but is positioned upstream of the operators. DNA looping might in that case still allow to block transcription simply by blocking progression of the RNA Polymerase. In the second set of promoters we kept the disctance between the operators O1 and O2 at the same lenght as they are in the natural verison. To this end we introduced the spacer R2oDNA , which we optimized for lack of restriction or interaction sites.
In the third and last group of promoters we removed the spacer between the two operators, having them next to eachother without and space in between them. With this setup we wanted to investigate wether or not the mechanism of repression by lldR is really based on DNA looping or just of binding to the operators [Aguilera, 2008] . There is evidence that two molecules of lldR bind to the two operators, but the model for DNA looping was developped in analogy to other operators of the same family [Agu"

Am 7. September um 16 Uhr füllte sich der Hörsaal des zentralen Hörsaalgebäudes der Universität Göttingen mit interessierten Besuchern. Diese kamen, um sich die Vorträge über Synthetische Biologie im Rahmen der Informationsveranstaltung „Legoland für Naturwissenschaftler“ anzuhören.
Einige Wochen zuvor waren wir sehr mit der Planung dieses Events beschäftigt. Die erste Idee war es, die Umfrage auszuwerten. Aber um das geplante Event weiter auszuschmücken, entschieden wir uns dafür einige Experten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Politik, Ethik, Wirtschaft, Journalismus und Wissenschaft einzuladen, um mit diesen die Umfrage Ergebnisse zu diskutieren. Diese Experten für unsere Veranstaltung zu gewinnen, erwies sich als schwieriger als erwartet. Einerseits waren in Deutschland gerade Sommerferien und die meisten eingeladenen Personen waren im Urlaub. Desweiteren wollten wir das Event selbständig komplett ohne die Hilfe unserer Betreuer organisieren. Da wir aber noch nicht sehr bekannt sind,"

BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," Thus, the design rule was updated to be more relaxed and accurate for the Makerfluidics workflow.
Primitive locations can be set in the X and/or Y direction. When designing a chip using Fluigi’s place and route system, primitives are defined by the user but the location and connections of these elements of these primitives are determined by Fluigi’s place and route system. However, for some designs the location of primitives must be in specific locations. Fluigi contains a function that allows primitives to be locked in place, the set function, however this function requires both an X and Y coordinate. For some designs, only one of these coordinates is known or required. To accommodate this, Fluigi’s pre-existing “set” design rules was updated to allow the user to set a primitive’s X coordinate, Y coordinate, or both. This updated design rule made the “set” function more practical to use.
Subtle routing changes were added to make designs more practical and functional. Fluigi’s place and route system is effective at connecting primitives with channels, however, it did not always make these connections in the most practical or functional ways. For example, random bends or “kinks” would sometimes be added to channels during the routing process. While a chip with random bends is still a valid design, it may not necessarily be practical as these bends may affect fluid flow. Fluigi’s design rules regarding bend tolerance have been progressively increase over time, thus limiting the amount of unnecessary bends that can be added to a design.
The impact of these improved design rules can be seen in the two Fluigi-routed chips below. On the left is an output design for eColiBasic5. This chip was designed and routed prior to many of these improvements being implemented. While this chip represents a valid design, it is not optimized or practical due to bends and port location issues. On the right is an output design for eColiBasic6 following the implementation of the previously identified improvements. The MINT code for these two microfluidic chips is nearly identical, but the outputs are entirely different. eColiBasic6 is a cleaner, more practical and functional design that can be manufactured and tested.
eColiBasic5
This chip was designed and routed in an earlier version of Fluigi in which the design rules had not been updated.
This output is not ideal as it has many unnecessary bends make the design impractical for real life usage. Fluigi's design rule limitations also made it so that elements of the final design could not be included, such as properly connected ports in the middle of the device.

This march Niedersachsen’s red-green government has abolished genetic engineering lab lessons in some high-schools in Hannover (Leppin, 2013). However, these alarming news are only the tip of the iceberg. There has been a strong anti-genetic engineering front in Europe and in Germany for quite some time now (see for example Whitty et al., 2013). Last year, the opposition led to BASF withdrawing all its biotechnology projects and research from Europe because BASF had to realize that Europe will not offer any markets for GM-crops anytime soon (Freytag, 2012).
Most discussions about genetic engineering are led rather emotionally and many arguments (pro and contra) are based on smattering or even gut feelings. One big problem in biotechnology debates is that red and green genetic engineering are regularly confused due to insufficient knowledge about the various applications of biotechnology. Unfortunately, their blind fear of GM-crops makes people oppose genetic engineering in general.
In order to counter this anti-biotechnology movement we decided to visit two biology lessons of a final year high-school class in the Königin-Olga-Stift Gymnasium in Stuttgart. We planned to tell the students about our iGEM project and to perform a simple DNA extraction experiment in order to demonstrate one of our daily lab-routines.
At 8:00 am on a beautiful Thursday morning just a few schooldays before summer break we started our lesson with a short recapitulation of some very basic concepts of biology. What is DNA? Why extract DNA? How to find coding regions on DNA? What is the definition of a gene? How to find out the function of a gene? What is genetic engineering? Then we introduced the students to laboratory methods like restriction digest and to biotechnological tools like restriction endonucleases and their applications in our everyday lab-routine.
Many students were fascinated to know how working in a laboratory actually looks like. In school you"

Hello! Today was a decisive day! We started the bioremediation cell growth test (DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3) in LM medium with the following Hg concentrations of 20µg/ml, 10µg/ml, 5µg/ml, 2.5µg/ml, 1 µg/ml and 0µg/ml. We used the spectrophotometer at absorbance of 600nm, and as we explained previously, we will use the construction for bio detection as control. Because this doesn’t contain resistance gene to Hg, MerA. This test objective is to evidence the difference regarding to cell growth of Escherichia coli non-modified for bioremediation in comparison to the ones modified for bioremediation having the bio brick (BBa_K1355000)! Let’s go! We made inoculum of control cells and Mercury Bacter for bioremediation in falcon tubes of 50ml with 10ml of medium LM on the Hg concentrations mentioned above. Today we measured the samples from periods of time of 2:30, 4:30, and 6:30 hours after the start of the experiment. Tomorrow we will measure after 17 and 24 hours of cell growth!

Making Molecular Biology Easier
We have designed a novel standardized assembly system, called “Plug 'n' Play with DNA” where ready to use biological parts can be gathered without the use of restriction enzymes and ligase. This will make cloning faster and assembly of expression vectors possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergilli ready to plug 'n' play. You can find more information about how this standard works here .
A Reporter System
As proof of concept we have created a reporter system that can be used for anything from monitoring gene expression to determination of protein localization. We expressed and localized fluorescent proteins in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans and the mammalian cell line U-2 OS with great success.
Flexibility
Standardization entails rigidity. Therefore we have written a guide that allows the researcher to customize the system, so proteins can be assembled seamless, multiple mutations can be introduced in one round of cloning etc. The only limitation to this is your creativity.
Applications
Here you can learn more about the numerous applications of the Plug’n’Play with DNA assembly standard and the research areas, where this system is especially advantageous.
Data Page
You can find an overview of our project on our Data Page . Here you also find our favorite submitted biobricks, and the biobricks we characterized during the summer.
Achievements
Designing a novel assembly standard and creating a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells are our main achievements. You can read more about our accomplishments on this page .

Meet up with UK iGEM teams organised by Westminster - 18th - 19th August
We were able to present our project to the other UK teams and to also see what the other teams were doing such that we could organise a possible relevent collaboration. This meet up was very exciting and fun! Once our presentation was over, we asked the University of Westminster iGEM team to give us some feedback on our project. We received the following input:
We asked "" What do you think of our project?""
You have a lot of sub-projects
When you mentioned that the project is to tackle ageing - it was confusing and not straight to the point
Communicate our project with some facts - how much of an issue is poor dental hygiene with the elderly
Change the wording of the project to make it more clearer (The objective of the project)

Our Advisors
Luna Eresta JAYA, Luna
The Good Teacher.
Luna taught us a lot of useful wet lab skills on our lab training                             tutorial. She often makes sure our team know where we are focusing and will guide us to the right                             direction. Especially for human practices, she always gives amazing advice to modify our plans.
Ka Man TAM, Sabrina
One of our best advisors that we are pleased to have.
She has taught us so many things in the lab and also in theory. She gives us advice from the very beginning of the project                             throughout the whole journey. Her advice on the project design and troubleshooting helps us to                             make our project better.
Tze Wing MAK, Tiffany
Our IT backup.
Tiffany knows well the importance of the wiki page. She gave us                             a lot of useful tips and helped us tackling technical problems. She appears to be very serious,                             but once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. She likes to call the iGEM girls ""Dua                             eng"" (which means ""sweetheart"" in Thai)

Glucose responsive repressor device  
We’ve innovated this year a novel glucose responsive repressor system (Pcar-wRBS-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230012]) by connecting these two system and extend the function of them.
Glucose responsive suppressor suicide circuit  
To achieve our goal, we added the suicide genes of lysis and NucA in the back of GFP (Pcar-PhlF-T-Pr-GFP-Lysis-NucA/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230017]) which are controlled under the same repressible promoter and hope to see the activity of suicide genes could respond against the presence of glucose.
Please go to DEMONSTRATION section below to check the function of this device in our experimental results.
DEMONSTRATION
Experiment
To improve and extend the function of BioBrick devices of glucose responsive promoter and PhlF repressor system. We designed and created the glucose responsive repressor system and tested it in response to various concentration of glucose. GFP intensity was measured at Ex/Em = 488nm/518nm as reporter showing the response of repressible promoter in the presence of glucose.
Further, we also designed and created the glucose responsive suicide circuit and examined it in response to decreasing concentration of glucose. OD600 and cell numbers were calculated to understand the killing efficacy of suicide circuit in the loss of glucose.
The bacteria carrying the indicated vector were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol (Cm) at 37°C overnight. The next day, OD600 was measured and adjusted to 2.5 in M9 minimal media with various concentrations of glucose. The bacteria then were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. GFP or OD600 were indicators of promoter activities as mentioned. For suicide assay, the culture media were further taken out and diluted 106 times following by spreading onto LB Cm agar plate at 37°C overnight. The third day, the numbers of colonies were counted and bacterial viability was calculated.

Conclusions
From the sequencing data alone, it appears that beyond the expected PLlac 0-1 promoter region, the part is otherwise constructed as reported. However, the lack of the PLlac 0-1 promoter region means that lasR will not be expressed and there we anticipate that there will be no response (i.e. fluorescence) to the presence of the autoinducer.  To fix this part, the lasB and vector coding sequences upstream of lasR would need to be cut out and replaced with PLlac 0-1. This is predicted to restore the desired function to the part.

Northwestern,2017,Team:Northwestern#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," FBI agent. After entering the FBI in 2008 and completing training, Mahloch was assigned to Milwaukee Division’s Kenosha Resident Agency, where he worked on a variety of cases. He currently is the Chicago Division’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Coordinator.
Special Agent (SA) Mahloch didn’t have to much to say in relation to antibiotic resistance or the specifics of our project. However, Mahloch did highlight the use of biological threats when it comes to weaponry. He emphasized the importance of being vigilant and aware of ones surroundings while working in a lab and reporting potentially suspicious activity. Mahloch helped us understand that the FBI was not a regulatory agency but is often the eyes to make sure that everything is working smoothly and safely.
Takeaway: There isn't much we can change about our project from Special Agent Mahloch's presentation. However, our team is more aware of the dangers of biology and how it can potentially be used for nefarious acts. If we see something we will definitely say something!
Interview with Dr. Hayden
Dr. Mary Haydenis  a professor of Medicine (Infectious Diseases) and Pathology and Director of Clinical Microbiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL. Her research interests include the epidemiology and control of antibiotic resistant pathogens in healthcare settings. She has been a member of the CDC-sponsored Chicago Prevention and Intervention Epicenter team since 2006.
Dr. Hayden’s journey with working with infectious diseases began in 2009 when a patient with CRE tragically passed away at Rush University while she was on call. Though CRE and MRSA were not prevalent yet, some of the first cases to be seen were in Chicago. Through her work in the field, she realized that these diseases were remaining undiagnosed in many health facilities. She also realized that the control of antibiotics were being conducted ""selfishly” and  facilities would set up protocols to protect their own facilities. One of the main programs at the Epicenter is to aid surrounding facilities in developing protocols that will protect them all from the wide spread of antibiotic resistance.
Dr. Hayden emphasized how there are many different methods to protect the population from antibiotic resistant bacteria diseases that stem from them. From good hygiene practices, to using gene sequencing to track the origins of resistant microorganisms, to antibiotic stewardship, she provided many examples of ways to make a difference.
Dr. Hayden stressed that innovation is the way to go if we are planning on finding a replacement or something to go in conjunction with antibiotics. She mentioned that our research seemed promising but reducing overuse would also be vital.
Takeaway: Dr. Hayden really"

Toehold Switch
Description
We decided to use a toehold switch system as a method to simulate RNA-dependent response in our cells. The image below briefly describes how this system works:
Figure 1 - A toehold-switch system scheme. The system is comprised of two RNA molecules, named Switch and Trigger RNA. The Switch RNA contains a hairpin structure that hides a ribosome binding site and its activated when the so called trigger RNA is present, allowing translation of a protein of interest.
In our system, the Trigger RNA represents an overexpressed messenger RNA which could be, for instance, a bacterial transport system related transcript, only expressed when the cell is under certain stress conditions and aimed to increase the bacterial load.  On the other hand, the Switch RNA represents the part capable of producing the desired effector, which would then be able to eliminate the related pathogen.
Firstly, we’ve carried out some experiments in order to evaluate the possibility to use this system in our work.  For this purpose, two plasmids containing compatible origins of replications and adequate copy number were designed. pETDuet and pRSFDuet plasmids were chosen for the Switch Part:BBa_K1639000 and the Trigger RNA Part:BBa_K1639001 , respectively.
Figure 2 - Two plasmids were chosen for this system. pETDuet was the plasmid containing the switch RNA while pRSFDuet contains the trigger RNA. Since both have compatible origins of replication, they could be cot"

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," it made perfect sense to have our teams meet with the aim to elevate the ambitions of our respective human practices projects by joining forces. We agreed that it would be fun to explore a new side of our natural science-brains and write a report founded in the humanities. We found that this was quite unusual in previous iGEM space projects and therefore we found it relevant to question issues related to space travel in a new way. The University of Exeter had reached out to do a space-related human practices project and together, we decided to do a three-part space-related humanities report, with each university exploring the same overall issue on the basis of different fields. DTU engaged in history, UCopenhagen in rhetoric, and Exeter in ethics.
We knew quite early on that we wanted the report to cover the possibility of colonization on Mars. At DTU, we were intrigued to look retrospectively at the space race that lead to the moon landing and to look into the political situation at the time, in order to draw parallels to what might need to happen now to land a manned mission on Mars. The pressing matter would subsequently be what to do when we do land a mission on Mars by looking at previous colonization and imperialism and look into some of the driving factors of that era.
Brainstorming was a big part of our first Skype meetings, and because of our early start, our discussions managed to shape parts of each others Human Practice projects. We continuously separated to do research and met online to discuss our findings in relation to the further development of the project. This way, we slowly found a common angle for the project which ended up being “why colonize Mars?”. We would structure the report so that it discussed the issues in different ways: explaining, analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating. We sorted the report in a structured manner. Firstly, exploring previous events in history and relating them to Mars colonization, then analyzing rhetorically the most cogent arguments for and against Mars colonization, and finally discussing the ethical implications of Mars colonization. We would do all of this while also determining the current measures set in place to prevent contamination on Mars, and other extraterrestrial environments.
You can read the report here.
All in all, our collaboration has been a huge success, where we have gotten the opportunity to work on our projects in a completely different way, and perhaps more importantly, worked with other incredible universities and people. Thank you Frida, Victoria, and Matt!

All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"

Macquarie_Australia,2018,Team:Macquarie Australia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," survey created by the Macquarie University iGEM team was sent to other iGEM teams to provide us with an insight into the resources used for the human practices component of their project. As seen on the map above, teams from around the world completed our survey and using their feedback, our team was able to incorporate this data for our customer discovery toolkit. Furthermore, we responded to several other teams’ surveys, many of which completed our own survey, in an attempt to aid them with their own projects.
UNSW symposium
We would like to thank the UNSW iGEM team for organising an event that provided the Macquarie University iGEM team with the opportunity to present our project for the first time. Hearing from other teams and scientists that spoke on the panel gave us a better understanding of our project and how we could improve before we present it at the jamboree.
Virtual Conference
iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi ran a virtual conference which enabled 6 iGEM teams (iGEM HKUST, iGEM Rec Chennai, iGEM VIT, iGEM Saint Joseph, iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi and iGEM Macquarie) to virtually meet one another to discuss their projects. The event had an emphasis on questions and discussion of each project. The conference gave us a chance to learn from other teams and discuss any issues that were unclear to help each team throughout their journey.
Additional Collaborations
iGEM Macquarie was contacted by a couple of teams asking to send science related photos to unite the science community from different countries. Two of the main highlights were when iGEM TecMonterrey GDL asked us to take a photo with a sign showing how far away we were from the Jamboree, showing that ‘science is everywhere’ and when iGEM Estonia created a huge mosaic of photos showing fashion and style in the lab.

Making competent Bl21(DE3) cells
The starter culture from 7/11 overgrew to around an OD of 3 (want OD around 0.5) so I am re-picking colonies to make a new starter culture in 7 ml of LB broth.  Put in 37 C incubator t 9:40 AM
Using this protocol.
At 1 pm (3 h 20 m) the OD was up to 0.52, (shooting for between 0.4 and 0.6)
Added 0.5 ml to 50 ml of zymo broth.  Left at RT for an hour and placed into 21 C incubator starting at 2 pm 7/12.
The incubator started at around 27 C at 2 pm and is taking a while to ramp down.
At 5:50 Pm the OD is 0.087, which seems rather high for only 4 hours.  The protocol says 10 to 36 hours.
At 7:50 pm (6 hour incubation time) The OD is 0.45 and I stopped incubating and began the protocol for making cells.
After completion of the protocol, I aliquoted the cells (100 ul) into 50 pcr tubes in the -80C, second row fourth unit from the bottom.
Transformation with pET24a+AmelF3 (Honeybee silk)
Using C2987H cells
Thaw a tube of NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes.
Split into two aliquots of 25uL.
Add 1uL of the 3:1 to one tube, and the 5:1 ligated product to the second aliquot.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 30"

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"icrobial Resistance. These resources have been invaluable in helping us better understand the scope of AMR. After all,  “AMR is a cross-cutting issue with roles and responsibilities shared by the federal, provincial, and territorial governments”.
After we have had a chance to thoroughly analyze all the information we have received, we will be contacting Dr. Chris Archibald the Director of the Surveillance and Epidemiology Division, in the Centre for Communicable Diseases and Infection Control to discuss our project, outreach initiatives and how we can continue to address healthcare issues such as AMR in Canada. With insights from both Dr. Tam and Dr. Archibald, we will be able to continue the development of our outreach initiatives for both students and communities and be able to broaden the scope of our project.
The Future of mGEM Human Practices
mGEM Human Practices is looking to continue discussions with Hamilton Public Health, the city of Hamilton’s Public Health Division. The long-standing objective is to align the topical focus of mGEM’s project with a public health concern in our city. This strategic alignment affords mGEM the opportunity to apply synthetic biology to problems with deep relevance to our broader community. This approach also expands opportunities for critical reflexivity within the basic science research arm, as well as the broader scope of human practices. By engaging critical stakeholders working at various levels of technology development, implementation, and regulation- such insights can enhance processes of technological innovation, towards a form of integrated innovation that conscientiously marries scientific discovery to its worldly implications. After all, the development of technology is not in a vacuum: it has demonstrable interactions within a broader system that deploys technological tools to make decisions with human consequences. This year, our group developed experience and built a cursory understanding of the complex network of actors within clinical technology. In future years, our hope is to expand upon our understanding of complex networks and actors involved in the series of steps translating biomedical technology from bench to bedside.

Mammalian cells
Mammalian cells are the cells of higher eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells can modify proteins post-translationally, and they contain a large number of membrane bound compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. Compared to microbes, mammalian cells are fragile, have a slow doubling time (app. 24h), and need complex and expensive growth media. The cells are moreover easily contaminated with mycoplasma, therefore it is necessary to work as aseptic as possible, when handling mammalian cells (1). So what is the deal with these high maintenance cells? Microbial cells are excellent for production of different compounds like peptides and simple proteins such as insulin and growth hormones. Why work with mammalian cells at all?
Mammalian cell factories
Mammalian cell cultures represent a suitable and stable gene expression system and are often used as cell factories for production of biopharmaceuticals. Heterologous protein expression in a suitable host is central in production of biopharmaceuticals, therefore mammalian cell cultures are  widely used for production of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and cytokines used for a wide array of diseases(4). Heterologous proteins require complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, gamma-carboxylation, and site specific proteolysis, which only mammalian cells are capable of performing. Moreover, mammalian cells have the unique capability to authentically process, fold and modify secreted human proteins (1). The effect of post-translationally modifications are protein stability"

As the negative control of the expression vector built up from standard biobrick parts TRE- CMV and PolyA tail were ligated together into pSB1C3 and pSB1A3.
pSB1A3-TRE-PolyA
Western Blots of Gal-fused proteins
The functionality of the constructs was assesed by Gal4 Western Blot. 293T cells were transfected. Western-blot was carried out using rabbit anti-Gal4 polyclonal primary antibody. High protein expression have been noticed when Gal4-PXR LBD composite construct was cloned into pCDNA3.1 as well as into the expression vector created from pSB1A3 (using standard BioBrick parts). Lower expression was detected in the case of Gal4-EcR LBD in both expression vectors. The Gal4-PXR and EcR-LBD fused proteins appeared at about 40 kDa while the Gal4-C.elegans-LBD (NHR8, NHR31) chimeric proteins which have been intensely expressed, can be seen between 30-35 kDa which corresponds to thier predicted molecular weight.
Transients cotransfection assay /two-hybrid system/
We moved the composite parts generated in pSB1C3 into the expression vectors, then transfered these fused parts into pCDNA and pSB1A3 vectors for further works. pCDNA is designed for high-level expression, purification and detection of recombinant protein in mammalian hosts. In addition we developed a new expression vector pSB1A3 with a CMV-promoter and poly-A tail. Our experiments proceeded on two different lines.
The first one is the presentation of the cloned constructs bearing the ability to get activated by ligand binding. These were the activation experiments.
Furthermore we showed that our constructs had the ability to interact with the previously published heterodimeric partner RXR. To confirm this we used the mammalian two-hybrid system. Binding to RXR confirms the proper folding and ultimately the generation of a well designed LBD, and a functional mammalian expression vector.  The method used to design our parts is described as a proposed standard BBF RFC 64 [1] .
Activation experiments
COS- 1 cells were transfected with the chimeric receptors and reporter constructs. 5-6 hours after transfection we exposed the cells to ligand treatment (at least 10uM of ligands). The CMX-G"

Open Seminar
One of the aims for synthetic biologists is to communicate with the public and try to solve social issues together in the future. In order to accomplish the objective, we tried to provide an opportunity to the public to be familiar with synthetic biology. Although the field is promising as technology develops, awareness is relatively very low and even to the bio-undergraduates. This year we had an open seminar targeting undergraduates in Korea regardless of majors. Throughout the seminar, we looked over from its history to applied cases to help participants deeply understand synthetic biology.
• 1st day
As we began, we firstly dealt with basic concepts of synthetic biology. From Aristotle to nowadays, we explained how the field has been developed. Then, we talked about iGEM to publicize how students around the world are contributing to developing the field.
After ranging from its history and concept, we moved on to used technologies and applications. We looked through technologies of Sanger method and NGS regarding DNA sequencing and Gibson assembly and Ligase independent cloning of genetic synthesis. Lastly, we talked about CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) known as ‘Gene Scissor’.
• 2nd day
As we handled the general idea of synthetic biology a day before, now it was time for bringing it into practical uses. Dealing with diagnostics, therapeutics, environment and computer designing, participants made an approach to daily life synthetic biology.
In diagnostics and therapeutics, we illustrated several methods such as toxicity screening using recombinant luminescent bacteria, cancer detection in urine by programmable probiotics, new medicine development, and cell therapeutics. Participants had a chance to know how synthetic biology technologies could be used to detect and cure diseases and therefore how it can be practiced in our daily lives.
In Environment, bio-fuel using biomass such as C.glutamicum and environmental cleanup in water and heavy metal pollution was discussed. Since the environmental field is fully expected to achieve many outcomes in the future using synthetic microbes, the topic was good enough to draw attention from participants.
Last but not least, the leader suggested future outlook of synthetic biology and awakened everyone growing importance."

Procedure
Prepare the agarose gel by melting it in the microwave
Let the agarose cool down for a while
While the agarose cools down, prepare the plate to run the gel
Get the samples containing the DNA treated with restriction enzymes out of the fridge. The samples are as follows:
First set - treated with EcoRI
Culture 2 (GFP(BBa_I13522)) - Lane 3
Culture 3 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 4
Culture 4 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 5
Culture 5 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 6
Culture 6 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 7
Culture 7 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 8
Second set - treated with EcoRI and PstI
Culture 2 (GFP(BBa_I13522)) - Lane 9
Culture 3 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 10
Culture 4 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 11
Culture 5 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 12
Culture 6 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 13
Culture 7 (RFP(BBa_J04450)) - Lane 14
Plasmid with GFP(BBa_I13522) is resistant to AmpR and KanR and the other one with RFP (BBa_J04450) is resistant to AmpR and TetR. Both contain one restriction site for EcoRI and one for PstI. By just adding EcoRI we expected DNA to be linear whereas in tubes having both restriction enzymes we expected two pieces of DNA.
Add 1ul of loading buffer to each DNA sample to make the DNA heavier and centrifuge for one minute.
In the meantime, poor the agarose gel onto the tray, place the comb on the tray, and let the gel solidify.
After the centrifugation, place the DNA samples on ice
Prepare the lambda HindIII markers
Once the gel is ready, transfer the tray to the gel electrophoresis area
Fill with buffer
Gently get the comb off the gel
Start loading the lamba DNA ladder in Lane 1
Then load Lane 2 to 14
Finally load Lane 15 with the lamba DNA ladder

The program analyzes each codon of the gene and determines what synonymous substitutions can be made and calculates the number of mutagenic sites per possible construction of codons. For overall optimization, sites are assigned scores based on their relative frequency and severity. The scores are also adjusted to account for codon usage biases in the species selected. After experimentally testing multiple iterations, we developed a custom set of heuristics that achieved the best expression levels for optimized sequences.

MARS Repository
Summary
Microfluidic devices are often highly specific, performing entire specialized experiments on a chip. This means that these chips are not useful or relevant to an average member of the synthetic biology community.
With this in mind, we set out to make the MARS repository. This repository would consist of generalized microfluidic chips that could be useful to any synthetic biologist.
To determine what protocols synbiologist would find useful on microfluidic devices, we reached out the the Biological Design Center located at Boston University. This community of synthetic biologists gave us insight as to what procedures are performed every day in the average synbio lab. We were able to identify eight protocols integral to synthetic biology: Cell Lysis, DNA Digestion, Ligation, Transformation, PCR, Fluorescence Testing, Antibiotic Resistance Testing, and Cell Culturing. These eight protocols, as well as Cell Sorting, make up the nine chips currently located in the MARS repository.
Each of the nine chips located in the MARS repository are located within one of three subcategories:
These nine chips, each performing a basic individual protocol, can be combined together to perform more complex synthetic biology experiments.
Each chip is fully documented, providing all the necessary files for replication and usage. These files include:
Design Files
Manufacturing Specifications and Instructions
Usage and Testing protocols
As well as other useful tools and resources to make them as accessible as possible. Full chip documentation can be found on this Wiki and will be available on Github and Metafluidics as well.
These chips are currently in the water testing phase, but they provide a framework that can utilized and built upon by future iGEM teams and the synbio community to allow for biological testing and optimization. A good starting point to explore the repository from are the Cell Lysis, Cell Sorting, and Transformation chips!

Pour slowly to avoid                                     bubbles due to they could damage the                                     gel.
Let it at room temperature for 20-30                                     minutes.
Running Agarose Gel:
When agarose gel is solidified, put it                                     into electrophoresis unit. It has to be                                     covered by 1X TAE buffer.

This procedure is done with the PrΩ kit                         (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System)
Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a                         vehicle to insert the desired devise, it is necessary                         insert it into a leaf of N.benthamiana by a direct                         injection. This method is known as Agroinfiltration.                         The next step is letting infiltrated leafs for two or                         three days depending on how the experiment is                         programmed.
After two days post infiltration, users can get leaf                         disks from N.benthamiana using a hole punch. It is recommended to take the maximum agroinfiltrated area                         avoiding plant nerves. Leaf discs are put in a specific                         plate depending on the light condition requirements.                         Different samples are taken during the next two days                         after discs were made and immediately they are put in                         liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
The steps to follow are:
The Passive lysis buffer 1x is prepared. Each                             disk of leaf needs 200ul. The passive lysis buffer                             is stored at 5X so it must be diluted with                             distilled water.

Synthetic biology knowledge
Advanced research tools
Team work skills
New areas of interest
A rare opportunity to develop a scientific idea
And the list goes on
Building the HS team wasn't an easy process. We knew that in order to organize the young team we would have to find an educational partner with the facilities and funding to help us to implement our vision.
It took us a few months to understand what we needed in order to set a group of motivated young students, a research lab and all the necessary equipment to start a synthetic biology project.
During those months we met with people from the field of education and even with representatives from the Israeli Ministry of Education to get the ball rolling. All of the people whom we met with were extremely excited about the iGEM concept and wanted to help in any way possible.
After a long search we found our partner-The Unit for Science Oriented Youth in the Technion.
The unit has labs equipped for research. Furthermore, the unit has an excellency program which includes students from all over the country.
The next step was to plan synthetic biology training for the young students. In order to start a SynBio project they would have to learn biology basics, synthetic biology principles, modelling, lab techniques etc.
We have built a full training program for the HS team, including lectures and lab work. The program is as follows:
Week 1
Introduction to the iGEM HS Competition
The group will get a full explanation about the process they will go through in iGEM and will learn about the transition from classic molecular biology to synthetic biology.
Week 2
Introduction to Genetic Engineering
The meeting will include a lecture about DNA and the genetic code, and a second lecture about genetic engineering. In order to illustrate the theoretical subjects of the lesson, the group will purify DNA from an onion as the first lab activity.
Week 3
The Principles of Transformation
Aside from learning about competent cells, plating techniques and heat shock, the students will practice performing plasmid transformation in the lab.
Week 4
Bacterial Growth and DNA Purification
The group will learn about the different stages of bacterial growth. In addition they will practice DNA purification using a mini prep kit.
Week 5
Restriction Enzymes and Gel Electrophoresis
The team will first learn about the use of restriction enzymes in molecular biology and then implement the technique in the lab. The restriction reaction will be followed by running the products on agarose gel.
Week 6
PCR Reactions and Primers Design
The lesson will include a lecture about the"

We did not directly collaborated in the lab but we have done something so much bigger. With igem.today , we joined 30 teams on the same platform and helped them communicate their project while sharing their surveys, their funding campaign as well as what they were going through. We had the chance to meet students from very different backgrounds yet all with the same passion for synthetic biology.
We may not have a full lab-collaboration, but we’ve set up a system for the future to come, making it easier for new teams.
iGEM News
After spending some time in the iGEM community, we found that it was really difficult to be aware of the work of the other teams, even the ones that are geographically close to us. Additionally, many teams that we interviewed were searching for collaboration and struggling to find the right team. Notably, we thought that teams can greatly benefit from the experience of other teams: What drives other teams? And why did they decide on that topic? How do other teams solve their issues, be it technical or social? Or simply to discuss projects with other teams.
We set out to find a way to improve this. Therefore we decided to create an online platform on which we hosted short team interviews and project descriptions which are simple and highly personal. Through this process, we created igem.today : an entertaining and educational place where teams around the world can share their project and learn about other team’s projects.
We contacted the teams through social media (Twitter and Facebook) and obtained positive responses from 30 teams in different countries and continents.
The discussions and interviews we had over Skype were really constructive as we learned about each others projects and how they were going. This also allowed us to meet great people from all around the world and see how they dealt with different obstacles like managing to work as a team or founding their project. Additionally, because of this platform, we now already know a couple of teams that we would like to meet and chat more to at the Giant Jamboree in Boston at the end of October. Not only knowing a few teams before meeting them is an advantage, it also can be beneficial during the iGEM experience over the"

Description
As a tool for the implementation of this construct design strategy, a software application was developed to aid in the appropriate consideration and placing of restriction sites in the master molecule, enabling a simultaneous consideration of the multiple factors affecting the efficiency of the final design. Enzyme compatibility, including digestion reaction conditions and cohesive end affinity, as well as their availability and other characteristics, are taken into account as the user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so a future manipulation of the fragment can be carried out with as little enzyme as possible.
To aid in the generation of modular restriction sites in the master molecule. Multiple factors can be considered toward enzyme compatibility, including:
• Digestion reaction conditions
• Cohesive end affinity
• Availability
• Other characteristics
The user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so future manipulation is possible with optimal enzyme use.
The software can be accessed here (opens in a new window).

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"ier, bacteria ""transformer"". The concept is thrilling enough: transformer? It is a very fitting analogy, and it sounds marvellous if it succeeds.
     HHowever, there is also an unaddressed problem: what would this transformer do once come into being? Being the ""Autobots"", or the ""Decepticons""? [5]And what if the rewire somehow goes haywire, and the whole circuit end up being a stupid mess or worse, a malignant mess?
     To answer these questions would be much more difficult than constructing the thing that raised these questions in the first place. Since our project is more a proof of concepts than its next step, real applications, we don't need to worry about the problem as long as we use the parts we are using already which do not contain nefarious or toxic materials. [6] However, just a proof of concept is just a first step towards more real-world applications. The output signals are not yet real functionalities but fluorescence intensity, so the worst that may happen will be some abnormal flashing of the fluorescence.[7] More technical details are discussed in our safety section, and it can be safe to say that, our rewirable circuit is a safe one AT THIS STAGE.
     However, we wouldn't dare to say so if we change the components, especially the output signals, to ones that may likely to have a more concrete effect on its environment; or when the output signal is changed and it is used as some vital part somewhere and suddenly it's not working due to leaky expression.
     And besides. No matter how much we address the issue of safety, we cannot claim we know it all, for claiming so would be hubristic. The right kind of claim would be that ""we claim we know it all to the best of our knowledge"", for in this claim we admit the limitation of knowledge and the fallibility of rationality.
     One thing all synthetic biologists are subconsciously doing is getting closer to perfection. In the definition of synthetic biology given by iGEM (see preface: Beyond Artificial Evolution), it contains the word ""improve"". What is the theoretical end of constant improvement? Of course, it's perfection. Good->better->best. Though it sounds a bit pitiful for those who aspire high but fall low, but perhaps it's better than not aspiring at all. After all what is the ultimate end of the endless bettering and modifying of the already existing organisms? Synthetic biologists, or the bio-engineers, take what they think is better from other organisms and engineer it into the target organism."

Background
With the development of global economy in the latest demands of energy in world, an average Taiwanese person produces around 2.58 metric tons of carbon emission a year. This number far surpasses those of China, Japan and South Korea.       Our project, as a result, works to use biofuel as an alternative to fossil fuel to reduce the current energy crisis.       In our lab, we used microalgae as the source of biofuel since they have the greatest capability of producing large amount of oil.
Our project aims to increase oil accumulation through nitrogen starvation, which was brought up in a research we came upon.       Under nitrogen starvation, de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol from acyl-CoA increases.       Acyl moieties derived from the degradation of membrane lipids then recycle into triacylglycerol, increasing carbon flux towards glycerol-3 -phosphate and acyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis.       As such, the oil accumulation under nitrogen starvation will increase.
There are currently two types of culture systems: open-pond and closed bioreactors.       While open-ponds cost way lower than closed bioreactors, open-pond-cultivated microalgae is with significantly lower oil contents.       Many microalgae farms today cultivate microalgae in closed ponds, where regulations are made to keep the nitrogen level low.       This method, though, consumes lots of energy due to the need to maintain proper temperature, nutrition, light, and other growing factors.       We want to develop a new method that allows microalgae to reach nitrogen starvation in open-pond, and thus reaching the same effectiveness of closed bioreactors with the affordable price.

One member of our team has been at a specialist UTI clinic and will be returning detailed information from experts and patients opinions on our project.

Lastly, we have a survey soliciting the public about their preferred method of containment. This can be viewed here .

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE, FINDING A SOLUTION
Antibiotics represent one of the great medical achievements of the last century; allowing an effective and broad method of treating infections, they revolutionised medical treatments. However, the century to come is likely to be dominated by the need to replace them, their utility severely restricted by antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is not a surprise, but rather a natural consequence of the principles of evolution. The onus on the scientific community is to find a solution; at Oxford iGEM, we believe that a targeted solution is essential. To show this, we have developed a treatment to a specific and serious example of antibiotic resistance: the urinary tract infection . As the world health organisation director general recently stated: ""No action today means no treatment tomorrow"".
Antibiotic resistance is defined as the inability of an antimicrobial agent to treat an infection by a given bacteria that it could once effectively treat. As a result, over time, a given drug is less and less effective at treating an infection. The problem itself is not new and has been observed since the 1950s, around the time antibiotic use reached large scales. While some bacteria have been resistant to a given antibiotic prior to it being used as a medical treatment, the majority of resistance cases are the result of evolutionary selection pressure due to human use.
This can be understood from a simple scenario. If a patient has an infection of a given bacteria and is given an antibiotic under normal conditions, the antibiotic will kill the bacteria and cure the infection. If, however, a mutation occurs in a single bacteria that allows it to survive in the presence of the antibiotic, then it will survive to reproduce the resistant bacteria. Therefore it has an advantage. When the bacteria reproduces, its offspring will now also be resistant, hence the population of bacteria able to survive the antibiotic increases and so the infection persists.
This however, doesn't represent the entirety of the problem; bacteria are able to transfer genetic material between one another. This is termed horizontal gene"

The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis"

We also intended to characterize the spCas9 part from the 2013 Freiburg team using flow cytometry, in part to also have an intact spCas9 control for our own experiments. This part was a bacterial-optimized part; we aimed to add a Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) to the spCas9 protein such that it would function better in our mammalian system, as the protein needs to be in the nucleus to have proper functionality. However, we had difficulties cloning this part, and furthermore, found it difficult to re-BioBrick.

Improving on Neptune
Improving Upon the 2016 BostonU HW Project: Neptune
During the course of our 2017 iGEM Project, the BostonU HW team worked to improve upon the 2016 BostonU HW Project: Neptune . Neptune allow uses to specify, design, and control a microfluidic chip. For more information regarding specific elements within Neptune, please refer to their wiki.  Our team worked to improve the specify and design portion of the Neptune software workflow. This Neptune can be broken down into five basic blocks:
The portion of Neptune’s workflow we contributed to was Fluigi. Fluigi is a place-and-route software that receives a detailed microfluidic description in the form of MINT code, and outputs a fully routed chip design with accompanying SVG and JSON files.  During the process of our iGEM project, 17 distinct microfluidic chip designs were coded in MINT and routed using Fluigi. These chips ranged from designs replicated from various journals to original designs for the MARS Repository.  While designing and routing these chips we were able to identify issues, limitations, and areas for improvement in the Fluigi and Neptune software system. These issues were identified as elements of Fluigi to fix or improve upon. During the course of our 2017 iGEM project, we altered design rules that would be necessary to integrate into the layout algorithms, some of them in particular are:
Ports are no longer automatically pushed to the edges of a design. When manufacturing a chip using photolithography ports must be at the edges of the chip. However, when using the Makerfluidics workflow this is no longer a requirement; ports can be located anywhere on a chip, within reason. In fact, many designs benefit from or rely on ports being placed in nontraditional locations. Therefore, the pre-existing design rule that ports must be pushed to the edges of a chip needed to be updated. Instead of automatically pushing all ports to the edges of a design, Fluigi can now infer whether or not doing so would be beneficial/required. Thus, the design rule was updated to be more relaxed and accurate for the Makerfluidics workflow.

Basic concepts and assumptions
Based on the results of former sections, the expression of proteins in the bottom layer and middle layer are determined by only factor of time, and they would become a constant after the system reached a steady-state. Thus we could set the concentration of these three enzymes to be two constants E_1 and E_2, where Exoglucanase and Endoglucanase are of same concentration C_1 in bottom layer, and concentration of β-glucosidase is C_2 in layer 2. Team Edinburgh has already built a matlab based model in their igem 2011 project for free floating enzyme approach in simulating conversion of celluloses. Their method could be applied in our model. Assumptions of their models are listed below.
1 Underlying assumption: cellulose, cellobiose, and glucose concentrations change continuously with time.
2 Rate equations assume enzyme adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm model.
3 Glucose and cellobiose, which are the products of cellulose hydrolysis, are assumed to ""competitively inhibit enzyme hydrolysis"".
4 All reactions are assumed to follow the same temperature dependency Arrhenius relationship (shown below). However, in reality it should be different for every enzyme component, ""because of their varying degrees of thermostability, with β-glucocidase being the most thermostable. Hence the assumption is a simplification of reality"".
5 Conversion of cellobiose to glucose follows the Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic model.
6 Concentration of xylose is assumed to be zero all the time for simplify.
7 Diffusion is assumed to be linear. That is, the concentration of cellobiose in layer 2 is assumed to be a constant times c (assumed to be 0.6) its concentration in layer 1.
8 The temperature of the system is a constant. (30℃)
9 Concentration of celluloses in middle layer is assumed to be zero (no diffusion).
Equations
Cellulose to cellobiose reaction with competitive glucose and cellobiose inhibition in bottom layer.
Cellulose to glucose reaction with competitive glucose and cellobiose inhibition in bottom layer.

Approaching the public
From the offset we wanted to tackle a problem raised to us by the public. We sent out an initial questionnaire to the public to ask what big problems they wanted solving and to hear about what they thought about synthetic biology. We took the questionnaire to schools, to the streets and to our friends. Examples of their suggestions for the applications of synthetic biology included bacteria which:
Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Target and kill cancerous cells
Help treat Alzheimer's disease
Produce energy
Sew up holes in clothes
Produce teeth glue
Indicate how long someone has been dead
Combat antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic resistance
Of the responses to our initial survey, 40 of the 86 were related to Medicine and Health. Inspired by a talk given by Professor Dame Sally Davies: “A ticking time bomb: the infectious threat of antibiotic resistance” and the public responses, antibiotic resistance stood out to us as an issue we could tackle with synthetic biology. To confirm that we were on the right track, we approached the public again with the question: To what extent do you feel that antibiotic resistance is a problem that needs addressing in society today? This graph clearly shows that, according to the general public, antibiotic resistance is an important problem that needs solving.
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
It was our team member George Driscoll’s work at the Hornsey UTI clinic in London which helped us to select UTIs as a specific cause to focus on. Due to the unaesthetic nature of the infection, it often receives less attention with regard to research. Having worked in the clinic, George knew first-hand that UTIs are a problem for a significant proportion of the population, and that resistance to the antibiotics used to treat UTIs is growing. In fact the clinic’s primary treatment method is long, high-dose courses of multiple antibiotics to overcome long-lasting infections despite the clinic’s awareness that their treatment choice may lead to further resistance.
UTIs are the most common healthcare-acquired infection. Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75% are associated with a urinary catheter. 2
Interaction with nurses
To learn more about catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs), we visited the Churchill Hospital in Oxford. Our first visit to the hospital was to the outpatient clinic during which we spoke with Jan Harris, one of the nurses on the ward. Jan explained to us the current treatment of UTIs. The protocol for treatment is to first take a urine sample"

The introduction of GMOs, however, varies between countries in terms of regulation and stringency. In order to explore the                             situation of GMOs and their products in Hong Kong, we had contacted and interviewed with Dr.                             Terence Lau, a biosafety expert from the Hong Kong government. Dr. Lau shared with us about the                             current regulation and control of GMOs. To our surprise, there is yet no measure in preventing                             or mitigating the risks of GMOs being accidentally released in Hong Kong. The government only                             emphasizes on the control of genetically modified organism in some products such as vaccine and                             GM crops where the Centre for food safety had provided guidelines on voluntary labelling of Genetically                             Modified (GM) Food. In addition, industries will take risk to benefit ratios into account before                             considering GMOs as their profit-based business. Throughout this interview, the issue raised                             has inspired us to pursue deeper into the application of Genetic Containment Strategy.

WHAT IS GENETIC CONTAINMENT STRATEGY? HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM BIO-CONTAINMENT?
Genetic (Biological) Containment Strategy is a measure to safeguard recombinant DNA in microorganism such that it can only                             be used in lab experiment but not outside. If accidental release happens, growth of modified                             microbes and rDNA replication should be immediately inhibited.
On the other hand, biocontainment is a prevention of risk of genetically engineered microorganism (GEM) release by using                             physical containment.
Hong Kong laboratories mainly relies on biocontainment. But due to the demand for scaling up GEM,                             biocontainment may not be sufficient to contain large scale of GEM. Thus, we propose the use                             of genetic containment strategy as genetic safeguards can potentially prevent the escape of microbes                             from proliferating. 1

THE SENSOR'S POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP
Dr. Lau not only shared with us some knowledge regarding biosafety. He also raised questions concerning how we can achieve                             the purpose of knocking out in large population of cells.
We decided on using feedback loop to amplify signals such that sufficient receiver cells can be knocked out at time bound.                             The propagation of AHL signals can be simulated by modeling the rate of diffusion from the senders                             to the receivers and the rate of AHL being amplified again to affect peripheral cells. The positive feedback loop we found involves in the use of luxR cassette in E.coli"

Figure 1: The Elder Futhark. Source:http://www.sunnyway.com/runes/meanings.html
Runic language was employed by the ancient Nordic people to write scripts of law, rules, epitaphs, and things of great significance and weight.[7] Though the symbol system was invented by them and given meaning to by them in the first place, they nonetheless believed that using it would bestow new meaning back upon the words they are writing. I found this act interesting, and experimented it on various other places, starting from iGEM, initials of the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, curious as to what new meaning it possibly speaks of it that I hadn't realized.
2. Method
The method is fairly simple, just find the four letters equivalent of I, G, E, M in the Elder Futhark, which are Isa, Gebo, Ehwaz, Mannaz. I find these four letters describe the properties of iGEM competition perfectly.
Starting from Isa. Isa means ice, winter, immobility, isolation, but also the same ice that have the possibilities of life hidden under it. Gebo in shape makes one think of the X chromosome, and in meaning it roughly means exchange, a gift given and harmony, sometimes between different genders. Ehwaz stands for horse and loyalty, in the sense a horse is loyal and bonded to his master. Also movement, vehicle, dual advancement. Mannaz stands for mankind, humanity, community, and all their indications. These are the basic meanings of these four runes. For more information on the whole set of meanings of each rune, see reference[8].
We find that the four letters perfectly describes the development process of iGEM. If read from left to right as is done by us, we obtain the following sets of interpretation:
2.1 iGEM History
The four letters tell the history of iGEM, and reveals its goal.
i, Isa At the beginning there is ice, under which the tiny spark of synthetic biology dwelled. It symbolised for the general starting environment of iGEM, and implied the would-be continued frozen state or slow development should synthetic biologists insist on working isolated and alone.
G,Gebo Then exchange happened. Biobricks were shared, and Registry was built, teams were formed and were exchanging biobricks. Gebo stands for the iGEM philosophy, standard"

It was an event that few people could attend, due to the conditions explained above, but from which the attendees took much advantage. Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it.

Week 22
This week I focused on making the general planning…I think it sometimes is rather difficult to plan everything, especially with everybody still having exams etc. Beside this Esmee and I discussed the collaboration with the science centre, what are the possibilities, what would we like to do? A lot is possible and we really like to collaborate with the science centre, also for human practice. Just before the weekend, Carsten and I made a plan for modelling, which we will discuss next week with our supervisor Alessandro, the king of modelling.
Week 21
This week we gave a lecture to all the professors about our project to gain usefull input. I was only present on Monday, since from Tuesday till Saturday I was allowed to do the business course of Heineken.
Week 20
This weekend was lots more busy then we thought. Everybody worked very hard for the OSLI sponsor application, put a lot of effort in it and just in time we were finished! I was very proud of the team, so on Monday we had a bubble wine to celebrate. For me this week was full with meetings with lots of people again. For example; Han de Winde, the head of the department of biotechnology, some professors, Hans Fraaije from University Leiden, Peter Post from TNO…I discussed a lot of different angles of incidence which all will contribute to our project!
Week 19
By doing a lot research, little meetings with experts (professors, companies, other universities etc) and a lot of discussions we finally decided the main parts of our project. A fundamental part, a optimization part and an application part. This was also chosen after we had a meeting with team about what we really expected during this project. It became clear that almost everybody expected something else from the project. Luckily there was a lot of overlap, and in the end we have a plan where everybody will satisfied and happy.  On Friday the team had a meeting in Amsterdam with all the iGEM teams of Holland, initiated by team Amsterdam. Everybody gave a little presentations, updated each other and of course there were some beers involved.  Unfortunately I could not be there, but I think it was a very good initiative!
