Safety Assessment
Our iGEM project requires only the handling of the non-pathogenic, non-adherent Escherichia coli K12 and B strains and the well-established filamentous phage. Both, the bacteria and the phage are commonly used chassis in laboratories and pose no risk when handled according to the mandatory rules. As all of us are well briefed about laboratory safety and biohazard regulations we follow these at all times. In Germany, work with genetically modified organisms is regulated by the ‘Law on Gene Technology’ (Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik, GenTG). According to these rules, the responsible governmental authorities of the state of Brandenburg have been notified about our work. Following these rules, there should not be a significant danger neither to the environment nor to team members.
The most important issues we discussed are the consequences of the error-prone PCR we use to modify our parts. We tried to estimate the chances of generating highly toxic proteins. Surveying the literature, we found several reports about natural variants of microviridins and one rational mutational study, but no reports on toxic effects. As cyanobacteria can also produce toxic compounds (non-ribosomal peptides named microcystins) toxicity testing is well established in the cyanobacteria research community, and obviously, testing did not identify toxic effects. Therefore, we assume that our mutations will not have any hazardous effects. Additionally, the obtained, constructed, and planned plasmids contain only previously described parts without any known risk potential. Therefore, as far as we can foresee, our constructed BioBricks will not have or trigger any toxic effects or be critical in any way for the environment. This means that only a negligible risk arises from our used methods and constructs to the environment, the public and the team members. Last"

Having explained the importance of synthetic biology and its potential problems, we next introduced the students to iGEM. We went through the aims of the foundation, the different levels of competition, and what our particular team is working on. We paid special attention to explaining BioBricks and the potential they serve in the biological community.
Future Outreach
As previously mentioned, Janet Standeven is forming a high school iGEM team at Lambert High School. We expect to work closely with Mrs. Standeven in the future to establish her team and their project.
Potential activities include bringing them to the Georgia Institute of Technology to see the iGEM lab space and discuss both general and specific scientific practice for the students. It is expected that we will keep close contact with Janet and Lambert High School in the future to further the benefit to both of our groups of students.   Our workshop at Lambert High School was also featured in the Forsyth County News, a local newspaper. See the article here: http://www.forsythnews.com/m/section/3/article/14721/ .

That’s all about the board and the rules. We designed this game originally for recreation at the Science Fair. However, we think that its value is far more than that. Synthetic biology has long been too fancy a science that the public know little about it. A chess game of synthetic biology may be a good approach to educate the public, especially the children, more facts about synthetic biology.
Thus, we decide to put the game online or on mobile phones so as to get more people involved. The implement has not yetbeen finished, but we hope to get it done before Regional Jamboree. We really hope you pay close attention to our game and enjoy it!

After repression, the system needs to be activated when taRNA is expressed. After the addition of arabinose, taRNA is expressed. Out of the three cognate riboregulator pairs that  were repressed, only two showed significant increase after arabinose induction. Lock 1- Key 1 cognate pair showed around 13-fold increase for both 1% and 2.5% (%w/v) arabinose  induction. Lock 3- Key 3 cognate pair showed around 1.5 and 3 fold increase for 1% and 2.5% of arabinose induction respectively. Lock 1-Key 1 and Lock 3- Key 3 behaved differently  for different concentrations of arabinose induction. Full induction was observed at 1% arabinose for Lock 1- Key 1 cognate pairs while full induction for Lock 3- Key 3 was observed at  2.5% arabinose. Statistically, no significant fold increase could be observed for Lock m- Key m cognate pair.
Discussion
The fold increase for Lock 1- Key 1 is lower than that of riboregulator pair mentioned in the Isaacs et al.’s paper.
iGEM 2005_Berkely, when they first introduced the riboregulator system to the iGEM community, they  mentioned in the Part Registry page that Lock 1 and Key 1 are “Biobricked  version of Isaacs’ riboregulator” crR12 and taR12 respectively. We can therefore expect the Lock 1 and Key 1 fold increase after induction to be similar to what Isaacs et al. have  observed and mentioned in the paper. Isaacs et al. mention that for crR12 and taR12 cognate pair, they have observed 19-fold increase (Isaacs et al., 2004), our results showed only  showed around 13 fold increase. One possibility for the deviation could be because the Lock 1 and Key 1 sequences are not 100% match with crR12 and taR12. Because scars are  introduced in 5’ and 3’ end of a Biobricked parts, iGEM 2005_Berekeley had to shorten the original 5’ and 3’ end"

=Overall Project=
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as"

We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

2. Gel extraction for purifying gBlock 1, 3 and 5 was failed due to human error.
3. Since gBlock 2 failed every time, the original fragment was tested by running gel. Yet no bands could be seen in the gel photo. 2-step PCR was performed for gBlock 2 and 4.
4. 1-hour arabinose induction was performed for GFP expression by BBa_K577881.

1. The PCR products were confirmed after running the gel that gBlock 2 still showed wrong band size while gBlock 4 was invisible in gel photo.
2. PCR was performed for gBlock 1, 2, 3 and 4, but this time with DMSO added to eliminate any possible secondary structures that may account for gBlock amplification failure. The products were confirmed from the gel that only gBlock 2 showed wrong band size.
3. Gel extraction was performed to purify gBlock 1, 3, and 4. The concentration was measured by Nanodrop 2000,
gBlock 1
19.5 ng/uL
gBlock 3
23.8 ng/uL
gBlock 4
8.7 ng/uL
→ Result: no GFP signals
4. gBlock 2 original fragment was tested by running agarose gel to see if it is defective but there was a very thin band of the correct band size.
5. The GFP test performed on 1 Sep was on-going overnight and the GFP was measured by using PerkinElmer Multimode Plate Reader. It showed that RFU generally increased with arabinose concentration and time. Also, the expression of BBa_K577881 was better in DH10B than in BL21(DE3).
04 SEP 2015
1. PCR was performed for gBlock 2 with DMSO added. This time we had tried 2 Ta for the 30-second annealing step. However the 1kb+ ladder and gBlock bands were unclear due to syBRsafe lost during gel piece handling.
2. All gBlock original fragments were tested by running agarose gel. Only gBlock 1, gBlock 3 and gBlock 5 showed expected bands while gBlock 2 still came up with a band of 600 bp and gBlock 4 went invisible.

On-the-spot investigation
        In order to acquaint the needs of the target users, we visited an electroplating factory and asked the responsible person what problems they would encounter in the practical testing.
        The head of the factory first led us to visit the electroplating process to find out how the polluted water produce. She said “a great number of heavy metals in inorganic form are used in the electroplating and they are usually excessive. So the wastewater contains a lot of heavy metal ions. And wastewater will be treated before discharge and checked the content of heavy metals before and after treatment.”
        Then we introduced our testing paper  method to her for some suggestions.” The accuracy of indicator papers is not high enough for factories. Besides, judging the heavy metal concentration according to the  color depth by workers  is prone to deviation. But cheaper testing method is really appealing to the users.” she said.
Solution:
        We finally used application in phone to scan the sample so that the concentration of the heavy meatal can be presented in digital form and the cost of indicator paper can be saved.
Interview
We then interviewed three professors and got lots of advice to improve our protocol.
Junjiu Huang
        Associate professor, school of life science, Sun Yat-sen University; Nature’s ten people who mattered this year (2015)
        Prof. Huang said, “for better application in actual environment, you should put the modified E. coli not only in the samples only containing heavy metal ions but also in the samples from the actual environment. You can collect and detect the water samples with heavy metal pollution and then compare the results with those of physical or chemical methods.”
Result:
Figure 1. We took the sample in the pool near Jiahewanggang subway station in Guangzhou City, and put some mercury in it to simulate the heavy metal pollution in actual environment. We had strongly proved that our product can be actually used in the reality world.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project Software_-_-_TEXT.html," database focusing mainly on DNA coding sequences, domain types and substrate specificities. Additional information needed for the customization of the final construct (regulative promoters, restriction sites etc.) can be included directly via an interface with the registry of standard biological parts.
To maintain a high curation standard we implemented a semi-automated domain recognition algorithm for the NRPSDesigner framework based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Again, we chose to adapt already existing approaches in agreement with our own experimental results (see section). Accordingly, we added a HMM specific for Adenylation/Oxidation/Adenylation domains making our tool the only available that can detect this combined domain commonly found in Indigoidine synthetases. Another HMM exclusively distinguishing between epimerisation domains that follow on thiolation domains further extends the predictive power of the NRPSDesigner.
Despite the advantages of automated domain recognition we strongly emphasize the importance of manual curation with the help of peer-reviewed sources. In this way the user is allowed to change database entries based on experimental evidence.
Scoring Function
Initially the internal algorithm calculating the optimal sequence of NRPS domains was based on the simple assumption that phylogenetically close modules also work best if assembled together. This principal was translated into a scoring function that assigned linear weights to the edges between neighboring domains proportional to their phylogenetic distance taken from taxonomic data. The shortest path over all domains is calculated by a Dijkstra’s algorithm. As it turns out the underlying scoring function can be further improved incorporating specific experimental evidence. For example, [24] has shown that the success of domain shuffling depends tremendously on the linker between the new neighboring domains. In particular it was suggested that the C-A linker should be kept intact. Likewise domains that are already originating from the same organism get an additional preference in the scoring function, thus, reducing the number of fragments that have to be amplified by PCR and assembled subsequently. Although already showing convenient results this scoring function will be improved in the next update of the NRPSDesigner. For example, the distance between two domains can be further specified using homology information or the differences in the tertiary structure of both domains.
Interaction with the Wet Lab
One of the core aspects of synthetic biology is its interaction with systems biology [25] and computational modeling in general, which in turn intensively depend on the thorough knowledge exchange with experimentalists. Consequently this was also one of the main goals throughout the development of the NRPSDesigner.
Experimental evidence had a variety of implication in the design of our software. For one, experiments showed at an early stage that the assumptions of modularity that"
Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," 4 ] support the combination of transcriptional and post-trascriptional repression as a boost in circuit performance. However, we wanted to proceed to a more detailed analysis regarding the selection of an appropriate repressor. You can check the results of this analysis here .
Integrated Design Output
Thanks to this combined analysis, we have designed the Biobricks to use in the experiments/simulations and made a strong case for the case-by-case use of a transcriptional or post-trascriptional repressor according to the miRNA dataset.
B. MODULAR CIRCUIT ASSEMBLY & OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
Wet Lab Input
We envisage pANDORRA as a cloning toolkit with standard parts (designed in the previous step) that can be easily applicable to the construction of a wide range of transcriptional/post-transcriptional synthetic circuits. In this endeavor, we focused on two aspects, interoperability and modularity, by integrating extensive technical feedback from experts in the field.
According to Benenson et al., 2012 [ 9 ], an effective molecular switch or gate is characterized by:
The existence of a robust digital regime (that is, input levels that produce either a very low or a very high (saturated) output).
Gate scalability, which is the capacity to receive an increasing number of inputs without dramatic design alterations.
Composability, which is the capacity to operate together with other gates in parallel and/or in cascades in a predictable manner.
In order to add the aforementioned features to our toolkit and to aid in the cloning process, we created various Composite Parts, that can be used to create multi-layered classifiers. At first glance, the constructs have the following general structure:
Promoter + Protein Coding Region + BBa_K515105 + polyA signal & terminator
Analytically, BBa_K515105 consists of superfolder GFP (sfGFP), a very brightly fluorescent protein under the control of the bacterial constitutive promoter J23100 and is used as a reporter to simplify the validation process during cloning.
BBa_K515105 is flanked by two recognition sites for BbsI, a type IIS restriction enzyme and two annealing sites for a universal M13 forward & reverse primer. As type IIS restriction enzymes recognize asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave outside of their recognition sequence, they are central to our approach for fusing miRNA target sequences into the 3’-untranslated region, as described in the next section. Examples of these constructs include:
Notably, the output module can include either a coding region for a fluorescent protein, DsRed or"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#VeronicaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," me with a cake, lots of fruit, and ice cream at lunch...probably the best study break ever. After researching in the morning, we met with Orit and Consuelo in the afternoon. They gave us several helpful suggestions - they encouraged us to research more about how semantic search and semantic zoom can be implemented in a multitouch environment, and how it is relevant in human-computer interaction. They also asked us to check out specific API's to determine the feasibility of semantic search in our application. In addition, they gave us more direction with the research, suggesting that we look up abstracts on ACM's (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library.
Jun 8: Even more research
After exploring some of Orit and Consuelo's suggestions in the morning, we met with Eni, another computer science professor at Wellesley who is more familiar with the semantic web. She gave us many tips and ideas to explore. She explained RDF and OWL, and suggested an article from the American Scientific Journal about the origins of the word ""semantic."" She also encouraged us to check out Google's Knowledge Graph, which is essentially the same thing as a semantic search engine. Eni referred us to the International Conference on the Semantic Web, and then gave us short summaries of Apache Jena and Apache Lucene to help us with possibilities of implementing semantic search and semantic zoom. Overall, it was a very helpful meeting - we spent the remainder of the afternoon researching her suggestions.
Jun 11: Presenting the research
Starting the brainstorming process
More brainstorming
Watching the opening ceremony of the Women in Public Service Institute at Wellesley
Today we wrapped up the research on semantic search. We spent half of the morning putting our presentation together, and we spent the other half watching Madeline Albright and Hillary Clinton speak at the Women in Public Service Institute opening ceremony. We began our presentations right after lunch. Each group presented their topic for about 15-30 minutes, and then the entire lab group discussed the topic and brainstormed potential challenges, features and methods of implementation. After each group finished, our lab team split into two groups, each of which came up with 5 different project ideas. My group had a variety of ideas - one was a ""bubble-themed"" way of organizing the menu and data on a tabletop surface. Another was using the paper-lens feature to display different characteristics of a gene through a projection. The day enabled me to learn about other topics in Human Computer Interaction and to brainstorm ambitiously about potential projects.

USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#ConceptualFramework#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," with 1+[Χ], because since is a division, when the repressor is 0, this term must go to 1. There’s also, like the protein, a term of degradation, product of degradation parameter, μmR, and the amount of mRNA itself.
Like the protein, there can be some new term depending on your biological system, just an increase in the number of repressors and inducers or something like a new parameter representing some post-transcriptional alteration, like splicing.
The same model can be used to describe the behaviour of some circuits that act like repressors or inducers, like in our iron-lactate model. Yet our toehold-switch model has something different, a complex of two RNAs that allows the mRNA to be translated, as you can see here .
Population in time:
The third basic equation is the populational dynamics of the pathogen. This is exactly the same equation we used in our models.
The population dynamics here are basically described by the the classic logistic model, where the growth is a product of the intrinsic growth rate, r, which is a balance of natality and death rates, the population itself and the carrying capacity, K. This is a classical model which has been worked with since the XIX century.
Considering that we hope that using a specific anti-pathogen protein could lead the population to extinction, we also add a mortality rate, which is the product of the protein toxicity, λ, and the encounter of N and P.
This model can also be useful if you don’t want to consider the population of your chassis a constant, like we suggested in the protein equation.
Now, with the basic modeling tools, we hope that it will be easier to develop a model for the integration of Paratransgenesis, SynBio and mathematical modeling to eradicate vector-borne diseases.

Social and Economic Effects
Water conflict
Water has a long history as a source of conflict and neighboring nations have often been at odds over disputed supplies. As far back as the 3rd millennium BCE, King Lagash, significantly reduced the water flow in the neighboring Umma (modern day Iraq) by building boundary canals around his territory.
There are many types of conflict including but not limited to:
Disputes over control and development of water resources: water resources, lakes, rivers and aquifers are valuable, interconnected and do not respect state boundaries.
Military tools and targets. In the first case, water resources or systems are used as a tool or weapon for military action for example diverting supplies to cause flood or provide defence. In the second case, water resources are targets of military actions, deliberately polluting or destroying enemy supplies.
Use as a political tool. Water resources or systems are controlled by state or non-state actors as a means to achieve political goals.
Target for Terrorism. Water resources or systems are targeted or threatened and by non-state actors as means of violence and coercion.
Notable current sources of water conflicts are demonstrated below: (Pacific Institute)(Gleick 1994)(Gleick 1998)
In The News
Middle East
Recent developments in the Middle East highlight the importance of water in conflict. Islamic State militants are using water as a weapon against villages that resist their advance by cutting off the supplies. Currently, IS control major parts of Tigris and Euphrates, on which all of Iraq and a large part of Syria rely for food, water and industry (Cunningham 2014) (Vidal 2014). Matthew Machowski, a Middle East security researcher for the UK Parliament and Queen Mary University notes that “It is already being used as an instrument of war by all sides. It can be claimed that controlling water resources in Iraq is strategically more important than controlling oil refineries… cut it off and you create great sanitation and health crises” (Vidal 2014).
Iraqi men move a boat that was stuck on the banks of the Euphrates River after supplies were blocked by anti-government fighters who control a dam further upstream(guardian.com)

iGEM Duesseldorf - Promoter Optimisation Tool
To read more about our promoter optimisation tool, please click here .
We received three inducible promoter sequences from the University of Düsseldorf iGEM team. We ran each sequence through an online algorithm ( see here ) to determine the likely -10 and -35 sites in each promoter. This was done in order to accurately compare the Düsseldorf sequences to the promoters in our database. Our tool works by assigning activities to each individual nucleotide at a particular position, so aligning the sequences this way was important). As the sequences we used for our project (obtained from Jensen and Hammer, 1998) were each only 60 nucleotides long, and Düsseldorf’s promoters were longer, we unfortunately could only optimize a small section of each promoter that contained the -35 and -10 sites. We have highlighted the parts of the promoters we were able to optimize in yellow.
We began designing the promoters to increase their relative activity. However, we realised that as Düsseldorf were using inducible promoters, they likely wanted to keep readthrough expression levels low. Therefore, we also determined the most optimal sequences for keeping readthrough expression levels low, with the results shown below.
The sequences that have been optimized for increased activity are highlighted in green and the ones that have been optimized for decreased activity are highlighted in red.
The estimated activity change for each new sequence can be found just below the sequence itself, labelled as either ""relative increase"" or ""relative decrease"".
We hope that these promoters will be useful for iGEM Du"

Secretion
Overview
After E. coli BL21(DE3) engineered by the Synthesis team produces poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), it is stored as intracellular granules that range in size from 60-80 nm. This creates a challenging problem: efficient extraction of the desired PHB from inside the cell. During the early stages of our project, we explored many possible PHB extraction methods. Before deciding on using a PHB-secretion system, we evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of each system in terms of our space application:
Secretion
Secretion of PHB via the Type I hemolysin secretion pathway, which is endogenous to E. coli (Rahman et al., 2013)
Advantages:
No chemicals are required
PHB can be removed from media without killing cells
Secretion is automatic
Easier separation of PHB from media because there are minimal amounts of cellular debris
Continuous production process
Disadvantages:
Lower recorded yield than other methods
Less characterized in literature than lysis mechanisms
Chemical Lysis
Traditionally uses solvent extraction employing chemicals such as chloroform and sodium hypochlorite (Hahn et al., 1994).
Advantages:
Efficient yields
Simple
Disadvantages:
High cost of the transport of chemicals to and from Mars
Requires manual input of chemicals, using precious time in an astronaut's schedule
Lysis results in dead cells, and our system would need to be reinoculated consistently
Cellular debris from lysis makes separation of PHB more difficult
Heat-Induced Lysis
T4 lysis genes (holins and endolysins) under the control of the pR Lambda promoter with thermosensitive repressor proteins cI587. When heated, lysis genes become activated (George et al., 1987).
Advantages:
No chemicals required
Lysis is automatic
Disadvantages:

Inoculation of transformed strains
28.05.18
4 mL LB medium were supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and inoculated with the transformed strains (25.05.18). The cultures were incubated over night with agitation at 37°C.
Preparation of the plasmids for further work
29.05.18
The isolation of the plasmids was performed with the NucleoSpin® kit from Macherey and Nagel.
The Material
Liquid LB medium
NucleoSpin® plasmid kit
The Procedure
Use single colonies from your transformation plates to inoculate 4 mL (15–20 mL for low-copy plasmids) liquid LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and grow the culture overnight at 37°C with agitation.
Collect the cells from 1.5 mL (15 mL for low-copy plasmids) of the overnight cultures by centrifugation (1 min, 13,000 rpm). Re-suspend the pellet in 250 mL of buffer A1, add 250 mL of buffer A2, mix gently 6–8 times and incubate the suspension for 5 min at room temperature. For the isolation of low-copy plasmids add 500 mL of buffers A1 and A2 to the cells.
Add 300 mL (0.6 mL for low-copy plasmids) of buffer A3, mix gently 6–8 times and centrifuge the lysate for 5–10 min at 13,000 rpm.
Transfer the supernatant into NucleoSpin® plasmid column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
OPTIONAL: For sequencing of low-copy plasmid DNA add 500 mL buffer AW to the column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13000 rpm and discard the flow-through.
Add 600 mL of buffer A4, centrifuge (1 min, 13,000 rpm) and discard the flow-through.
To dry the silica membrane, centrifuge again for 2 min at 13,000 rpm.
Add 50 mL of sterile and deionized water on top of the silica membrane of the column incubate the column for 1–5 min at room temperature and elute the DNA by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour24_-_-_TEXT.html," flow into the system and sinks are the flow out of the system. The sources in our case are the Citric acid cycle (TCA) and Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which we assume to be constant. The sink is the production of OneProt from amino acids. The production of OneProt has been modeled so that it depends on the concentration of each amino acid and the ratio required of the amino acid.
Figure 3: Example of modelling database. Click the picture for the full page. The model was evaluated by observing if there was a flow through the system. As shown in figure 2, when TCA increases so does the OneProt production.
Though when the TCA is increased beyond a certain point the OneProt production decreases. This trend is a result of the complexity of the system. The availability of the amino acids where analyzed by looking at the flow through the system separately for each amino acid. Thus it was discovered that the limiting amino acid is threonine. By examining the reaction rates towards and away from threonine, it was found that threonine is depleted for the production of isoleucine just as fast as it is produced. The system could potentially be optimized, by increasing the concentration or efficiency of Homoserine kinase.
Modelling database
Figure 4: Example of choosing between models. Click the picture for the full page. Collaborating and helping other teams is a very big part of the iGEM competition. Every year new and better projects are created because it is possible to use what the previous teams have created and use this to make more complex projects – using a collection of bricks to build a new construction. In our opinion this should not only be the case for the wet-lab part of iGEM but also be true for the modelling aspect of iGEM. This is why we suggest making a modelling part registry section on the iGEM page, containing modelling “bricks” created by the iGEM teams all over the world.
To be more specific we want to make it easier to go from pathway to differential equations. This could be achieved by translating the enzymes of the pathways into differential equations only needing the E.C number of the enzyme. As an example we made a proof of concept database on our wiki which is available when using this link . On the iGEM modelling parts registry it should then be possible to search the enzymes using the E.C number of the enzyme, the pathway(s) that the enzyme is a part of, the name of the enzyme or even the most used enzymes (just like the normal parts registry).

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," these photons hits another excited molecule, this molecule releases an exact copy of the incident photon, therefore ‘amplifying’ the light.
In this project, we will use synthetic biology to modify E. coli in such a way that the bacterium will be able to emit laser-like light. In order to do this, we have to translate two of the main components of a laser, the gain medium and the mirrors, to biological alternatives that E. coli is able to produce. For the gain medium this is easy. We can transform E. coli with fluorescent proteins that will form the fluorescent gain medium. The biological alternative for mirrors is slightly less obvious. However, we believe to have found the solution in the enzyme silicatein. This enzyme is able to synthesize polysilicate, a biological glass (Müller et al., 2008; Müller et al. 2003) . By transforming E. coli with the gene for this enzyme, we can let the cells coat itself in a layer of glass that will reflect the photons emitted by the fluorescent proteins. As an excitation source we can simply use a laser to excite the proteins. A figure of our synthetic biology approach to create a biological laser can be seen in figure 4. This biolaser will be able to emit a higher number of photons compared to a cell that is merely fluorescent. Therefore, this cell will be useful in fluorescence microscopy, since its intracellular processes will be more easily detected. Therefore, this cell could be clearly imaged. Our parts, experiments and results can be found in the Experiments section
Figure 4: designing a laser using synthetic biology. The lasers gain                                         medium can be substituted by fluorescent proteins, a layer of biologically synthesized                                         polysilicate acts as the mirror around the gain medium. The fluorophores are excited by a laser.
Synthetic biology to produce biological lenses
The second approach to capture more light in fluorescence microscopy is by focusing the photons onto the detector of the microscope. We will do this with lenses, since they have the ability to focus light onto an object, such as the detector of a microscope, which is schematically shown in figure 5.
Figure 5: When shining a beam of light onto a detector, not all light might hit. Placing a lens in front of the detector the beam of light is focused towards it so all the photons are measured.
In a microscope, applying this technique would mean that e.g. each photovoltaic cell of the detector gets a lens placed on it that will direct all light into each cell of the detector. This means we need a"

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#BioBricks#Submitted_-_-_TEXT.html," are transformed to and screened in E. coli EC100D because plasmids with R6K ori are only replicated in pir+ or pir116 E. coli strains. Once a receptor with high sensitivity for a screened substance is found, the plasmids are isolated and transformed to e.g. E. coli TOP10. Because the R6K ori does not work in this strain because it is not a pir+ / pir116 strain, it is easy to separate the mutated virA BioBrick from the screening plasmid.
You can find this BioBrick here: <partinfo>K389011</partinfo>
Reporter constructs
The reporter constructs are similar to the virA screening construct (compare fig. 2) but instead of the antibiotic resistance they carry a reporter gene. The amount of produced reporter shows the activity of the VirA receptor and the vir promoter, respectively. If the original vir promoter is too weak, we will use Cambridge's sensitivity tuners to increase the output signal of our biosensor ( Cambridge, 2007 ).
You can find this BioBrick with luciferase readout here: <partinfo>K389012</partinfo>

You can find this BioBrick with amplified luciferase readout No. 3 here: <partinfo>K389413</partinfo>
Characterization constructs
Fig. 3: Animation of the function of a complete characterization construct with sensitivity tuner (click to enlarge). In the system without sensitivity tuner the reporter gene is directly under the control of the vir promoter.
The characterization constructs are like the reporter constructs but a virA gene under the control of a constitutive promoter is assembled before them. These constructs are used to characterize the natural, unmutated VirA/G signaling system and the vir promoter, respectively. The natural system is induced with acetosyringone and the readout is measured to determine the behaviour of the VirA/G signaling system.

Korea_U_Seoul,2015,Team:Korea U Seoul#Project#Biological Background_-_-_TEXT.html," hard for researchers to apply this values directly to their experiments since they are not experimentally proved. Thus, additional attention is needed to utilize the second version of data.
3) Four path-scoring criteria
① NADH and NADPH
Like an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which serves as a convenient and versatile storage in cells, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) serve as activated carriers specialized in carrying high-energy electrons and hydrogen atoms.
The NAD + and NADH molecules are indistinguishable in structure to NADP + and NADPH, respectively, except the fact that the phosphate group is absent from the former. However, this small difference is crucial for their distinctive roles. Although the extra phosphate group on NADPH is located far away from the region involved in electron transfer (see Figure 1-b), it gives the molecule a slight difference in its shape from that of NADH, so NADPH and NADH bind to different sets of enzymes as substrates. Thus, the two types of carriers are used to transfer electrons (or hydride ions) between different sets of molecules. This role separation is crucial for organisms to regulate two sets of electron-transfer reactions independently. An NADPH operates mainly with enzymes that catalyze anabolic reactions, providing the high-energy electrons needed to synthesize energy-rich biological molecules. In contrast, an NADH has a special role as an intermediate in the catabolic system of reactions that generate ATP through the oxidation of compounds (Alberts B., et al. 2002).
Then, why should we focus on the larger amount of NADH and NADPH as products?
First, in the case of NADPH, it is the key for determining the efficiency of certain biosynthetic pathways. The oxidation during a pentose phosphorylation produces most NADPH which is needed in the biosynthesis of certain metabolites. Therefore, the carbon flow of the pentose phosphorylation path is considered to be the targets of metabolic engineering. For example, microorganisms found in the Corynebacterium genus, having enhanced L-ornithine production, not only activate pentose phosphate pathway but also increase the specific activities of G6PDH and 6PGD, which are enzymes related to the pentose phosphate pathway, by reducing or inactivating intrinsic GDH (glucose dehydrogenase). Consequently, the improved NADPH production makes L-ornithine yield to"

Description | Design | Construction | Characterisation | Modelling | Conclusions
Modelling
As our detection module is so closely tied up with our degradation and aggregation modules, our cell model for this module examines the hypothetical expression of GFP on detection of POPs.  This allows us to assess the efficacy of detection as a stand-alone module before we look at its performance when incorporated into our degradation system.
Our cell model for detection was created in SimBiology.  This MathWorks software is a MATLAB extension that allows specification of the species, reactions, and compartments that make up a system - in our case, the cell and the external environment - and to run simulations on the specified system.  For this module, we are interested in detection response, which we represent here as GFP production.  The model is composed of two 'compartments', which in SimBiology represent separate reaction systems:
1. 'External': in this compartment we see the association, adherence, and dissociation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from polyethylene (PE) (R1).  We rely on the POPs to induce our degradation system, increasing (105 to 106 the specificity to our system.)
2. 'Cell': NahR is a constitutively produced mRNA product (R7). When POP diffuses into the cell (R2), it forms a complex with NahR (R3) which then binds to the pSal promoter (R4) to induce production of GFP (R5, R6).  GFP is expressed in the cell or degrades (R9).

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," new, but we are learning more and more of the importance of a healthy gut microbiome. Interestingly, the North American Porcupine eats mostly bark and wood from trees found in Nova Scotia. Since the Porcupine’s own cells cannot digest plant matter, this woodland creature, then, must contain gut bacteria that aid in digestion of all the cellulose it consumes. Thus, the gut microbiome of the North American porcupine seems like a logical starting point for our search of a microbiome to mine.
Our project is designed in three stages. First: we hope to isolate and characterize the microbiomes of many animals found at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park. Second: we hope to isolate and characterize particular cellulose-degrading bacteria using a cellulose agar medium. Third: we aim to construct a metagenomic library of the microbial DNA found in the porcupine microbiome as a way to isolate and characterize genes for useful cellulose degrading enzymes that can be expressed in E. coli. Each of these experimental stages are broken down into smaller pieces below. We invite you to check out our entire process and walk with us as we explore the vast possibilities of cellulose degraders, microbiomes and biofuel production.
Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Microbiome Survey
The function of this microbiome survey is to get a handle on what kinds of organisms are present in mammal microbiomes to see if the use of microbiomes as a ""mine"" for biological engineering purposes is feasible. This part of our project is designed to determine if a metagenomic library constructed from the DNA extracted from gut microbiomes is indeed useful for biological engineering: in our investigation, we are specifically seeking genes that encode enzymes capable of degrading softwood lumber waste and turning it into useful compounds like bio-plastics and bio-fuels. Through the use of 16S taxonomy data and through PICRUSt analysis we intend to show that these microbiomes are a gold mine for biological engineering.
Shubenacadie Wildlife Park:
The Shubenacadie Wildlife Park is home to 29 mammals and 35 birds on a 40 hectare piece of land. These animals were rescued as injured or sick from the wild, and were rehabilitated. Some animals will be unable to return to the wild and live out the rest of their lives at the Park. These animals live in enclosures that simulate environments that are comfortable to them. For example, the rescued otters have a large pool in which they can swim. More about the Wildlife Park can be found here.

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#PowerCell#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," is a measure of how transparent the atmosphere is. τ = 0 represents perfect transparency
Excluding the effect of regional storms, which interfere with sunlight in a temporary but unpredictable way, there are other dust dynamics we can consider as more constant.
Using ground measurements taken by NASA rovers over time, we know that the visible optical depth of the Martian atmosphere is τ  = 0.9 [5] Put another way, this means that typically around 10^(-0.9) or 13%, of incoming sunlight is not scattered or absorbed before it hits the Martian surface.
Recent data gathered from satellites such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have begun to shed more light on the distribution and layering of dust. In particular, the MRO is able to take vertical profiles in addition to top-down images, offering a three-dimensional view 6 .

Temperature
Global daytime temperatures on Mars 7
The temperature on Mars is an obvious factor in considering the viability of microorganisms brought to the planet surface. Thermal emission spectrometry readings have been very thorough in generating a global map of temperatures. Temperature varies greatly between geographical location, altitude, and day/night, although as a whole the planet is significantly colder than Earth. Nonetheless, there are broad regions (especially in the intermediate latitudes) which experience temperatures comfortable for Earth life.
Global nighttime temperatures on Mars 7
Although any humans will obviously require extensive environmental protection due to temperature and a whole host of other factors, it seems that temperature does not necessarily preclude microbes from surviving on Mars.
H2O Content
As photosynthesis is a water-dependent process, the distribution of water on Mars is of interest. Enormous quantities of H2O are contained in the polar ice caps; the southern ice cap would submerge the entire planet in 11 meters of water if melted.
Geographical features on the Martian surface suggest water erosion in quantities far greater than can be accounted for by ice in the polar regions. 8 For this reason, scientists hypothesize large amounts"
Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#market overview_-_-_TEXT.html,". Producing publications allows researchers to continue funding new projects.
In order to produce reliable experimental results, researchers must have a multitude of test subjects or animals to which BEAR will be applied. For example, for every animal used in a neurological behaviour test, one BEAR apparatus will be needed to monitor hormonal changes in each individual animal if they are to be tested at the same time. Situations arise where natural circumstances control when a test must be performed (for example, when a lab rat becomes pregnant) at a time different from other test subject. BEAR is a more efficient means of doing individual tests. The majority of a monoclonal antibody test kit would be wasted as these kits are designed to perform many tests at once. In special situations like these, scientists often cannot store a sample for later use to run more tests at once because the hormones are at risk of breaking down. A new hormone-detecting disposable unit will be needed for each test performed. Each researcher using animal test subjects will need multiple BEAR devices and will need to continue to purchase the disposable cartridges to continue their research, ensuring an ongoing market for Synbiologica.
The biotechnology market consists of the development, manufacturing and marketing of products based on advanced biotechnology research. This market is predicted to grow steadily over the next few years with a growth rate between 6-7%. In 2016, the Canadian biotechnology market is forecast to have a value of $4.6 billion, an increase of 39.4% since 2011 (Figure 2). 9 67.4% of the biotechnology market is dedicated to medical device and health care and 23.8% of the market focuses on food and agriculture.
Figure 1: Canada biotechnology market value forecast: $ billion, 2011-2016
In 2008, the Canadian biomedical device market had been valued at $6.4 billion annually. The performance of the market is forecast to accelerate, with an anticipated CAGR of 5.3% for the five-year period 2011 - 2016, which is expected to drive the market to a value of $13.2 billion by the end of 2016. 10
Though BEAR was initially designed to be a research and diagnostic tool, we see future application in the Livestock agriculture industry as a hormone and health monitoring system. In 2011, of the 12,457,000 head of cattle produced, 45% were exported to other countries. Alberta produces 39.3% of beef cattle in Canada. Beef Production contributed $25"

Jilin_China,2017,Team:Jilin China#Geneguard_-_-_TEXT.html," level of CbtA. Therefore, the difference among various concentrations of L-Arabinose in TA group maybe because of the metabolism of L-arabinose. With the consuming of L-Arabinose, the concentration becomes lower. The expression of CbtA decreases gradually, so the bacteria can recover from the toxicity of CbtA automatically. Also the concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% are too low for TA group to be poisoned by CbtA after the 6th hour. (3) Comparing the growth trends of two groups of bacteria, we conclude that toxicity of cbtA induced by L-Arabinose can make bacteria stop reproducing. (We think that Western Blot can better prove it but the time is limited and we add this experiment into our future work).
Figure 4. Toxication curve. Different concentrations of L-Arabinose were added into vector (A) or TA group (B). The growth curve was drawn to detect the effect of L-Arabinose towards bacteria at indicated time.
Figure 5. Turbidities of TA group after culture for 14 hrs. Different visible views for A&B.
2. CbeA function validation
Result: We measured the Abs600 values of TA and vector group from 0 to 16 hours and the Abs600- time curve was drawn.(Figure 6.) The Abs600 values with different concentrations of IPTG in TA-pET28a group were higher than pET28a group. Without the induction of IPTG, the growth curves were almost the same.
DIscussion: (1) The growth of vector group after adding IPTG will be stagnated compared with that without IPTG addition. This is because IPTG shows toxicity towards bacteria. (2) Comparing the Abs600 values between TA group and vector group, the growth condition of TA group is better than that of vector group. It is because that CbeA induced by IPTG promotes the assembly reactions of MerB and FtsZ[2]. Therefore, we speculate that CbeA can promote the reproduction of bacteria. (3) Comparing TA group with IPTG addition to that without addition, we can tell that the growth rate is also decreased. We think that it is because the effect of CbeA cannot offset the toxicity of IPTG.

Furthermore, to avoid adding a new species into the oil sands environment we plan on using the DNA digestion part created by Berkley in 2007 to render our Escherichia coli cells unable to reproduce or able to horizontally transfer its genes.
Finally, we will be continuing to explore the novel method of the mass production of uniform iron nanoparticles , which is more efficient and cost effective than current methods (Prozorov et al., 2007).  To optimize the production of nanoparticles we are attaching signal peptide sequences to export the protein to different areas of the cell.  By attaching these signal peptides and having the protein directed to certain areas of the cell we hope to find which area is most productive to produce nanoparticles.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Source Code OverView
We use C++ as our programming language, cmake to manage our project, git to reversion control , yacc and lex to build our model file input assistant tool, Qt4 to build the GUI, Oracle dbxml as our Database manager system. Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Inspiration
Our early ideas were reviewed after attending the Danish Science Festival, where we met several young minds with creative and inspiring ideas. The children came to our workshop with their parents to learn about bacteria, the history of GMO, ethics, and iGEM. They attended our “Draw-a-Bacteria”-competition, where they designed their own bacteria, some even with detailed stories. From this the children taught us a thing or two about the endless possibilities of GMO.

Our Solution
“Well, if it can be thought, it can be done, a problem can be overcome”
E.A. Bucchianeri, Brushstrokes of a Gadfly
The vision for our bacterial solar battery is to combine two aspects, energy storage and energy conversion, by which we will produce a new and improved type of solar battery. We have named this vision The PowerLeaf. The PowerLeaf consist of two chambers that will be referred to as the outer chamber or energy storing unit and the inner chamber or energy converting unit.
The energy storing unit comprises genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli), which  uses solar energy for ATP production to fixate carbon dioxide into the chemically stable polymer cellulose. The cellulose works as the battery in the PowerLeaf, storing the chemical energy. A light sensing system activates dormancy during nighttime, leading to a reduced loss of energy through metabolism.
The energy converting unit uses genetically engineered E. coli to consume the stored cellulose by using an inducible switch. Retrieved electrons are transferred by extracellular electron carriers to an anode, resulting in an electrical current.
The complete system will be combined into a single device containing a compartment for each of the two units. Details about the construction and device will be discussed in the Integrated Practices section .
The device was originally designed to resemble a plant leaf aimed to provide a nature-in-city ambience. This hypothetical implementation of the PowerLeaf in an urban environment was developed through careful consideration, public engagement, and collaborations. We worked with local city planners from our hometown Odense, along with a plastic specialist from SP Moulding, the purpose of which was to advance our pre-established design, as well as attaining other changeable designs.
Our vision was clear and ambitions were high. As it turned out though, we had aimed too high, considering the limited timeframe, so at an early stage, we decided to focus on the following features:

We planned to include a print of the diybio codes, 'New Word, Old Profession' - a portrait gallery of unrecognised citizen scientists (Isaac Newton, etc.). We also included the DIY incubator and shaker that was built in the London Hackspace during our collaboration with the biohackers. Another item we would have liked to include would have been a DIY Personal Genome station where audience members had the opportunity to pipette and load their own sample into a gel. With time restraints and safety considerations, this was not possible but we feel an interactive exhibit would be an improvement for future events.
On the other side of the room, the sections around Synthetic Biology, including iGEM and Parts Registry exhibited one of the MIT synthetic biology comic created by Drew Endy and his colleagues, a video including the London biohackers and iGEM students on the collaboration, and a PCR machine.

Biobricks
1. Constructed BioBricks
Our project required the construction of fusion proteins that are displayed on the surface of the spores of B. subtilis. Anchoring an epitope-specific nanobody and glutathione S-transferase to coat proteins enables the spores to attach to surfaces and activate prodrugs on site.  In addition to targeted drug delivery, site specific enzymatic activities play a crucial role in other scientific field and many further applications are imaginable ranging from the production of metabolites to bioremediation. Therefore, we would like to share our achievements with the iGEM community in the hope to support and facilitate future projects.  Our supervisors Dr. Maximilian Ulbrich and Dr. Nicole Gensch provided us plasmids encoding the anti-GFP nanobody and the glutathione S-transferase that were inevitable for our project. The Integration vectors used to insert our constructs into the genome of B. subtilis were provided by Julia Bartels from the Mascher lab at the TU Dresden.   Below you will find a table summarizing the submitted biobricks and a link guiding you to the entries in the registry.

Another method in use to detect land mines is the application of mechanical systems that detect and detonate land mines. These machines are usually armored vehicles driving through a SHA/CHA, triggering the mines. These vehicles can be controlled manually or be under remote control. This method is found to be not accurate enough and is therefore only used in combination with manual detection methods. Next to that, this method is extremely expensive and is not suitable for all terrain types [16].
Other, less widely used methods for technical survey include Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR), Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), X-ray backscatter techniques, infrared/hyperspectral systems, acoustic/seismic methods, chemical methods to detect land mine compounds, Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR). Also, bacterial methods based on fluorescence have been developed. These methods are dependent on introducing GMOs into the environment and are therefore met with lots of resistance [17].
Once a suspicious object is discovered, the ground around the object is carefully excavated and, if it appears to be a mine, it is either blown up in situ or defused and destroyed at the end of day [18].

What are your interesting features of sweetness?
Through these two questions our questionary got the information about the market demand. We knew that people might be more acceptable to natural sweeteners, and comparing with aftertaste, coolness and mellowness, sweetness is more important.
Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd
As soon as we completed the initial plan, we visited the Sdic Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co.,Ltd, the most outstanding company in the area of producing concentrated fruit juice in China. We regarded the chance of discussing with the the chief engineer Mr. Wang as an honor and he was so friendly and warm-hearted to answer all questions asked by us and introduced the plight and prospect of sweeteners. For instance, saccharin is extremely sweet and low calories, but it has some certain potential risks to human beings, while the international standard of food health was never ignored by anyone. Thus our project has a really great future of the application through the two aspects including market prospect and policies.
COFCO
When several constructions of genes had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food supplier in China became our next interviewee. Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs. Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr. Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr. Liu. We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty. Therefore, an innovative bio-system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society. Finally, we accepted the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana，liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.

When we had run the experiments for several months and attained a certain achievements, we decided to visit COFCO again to show what we had done and what we expected to do in the future, which thoroughly pleased almost all of managers shown up and made them create the idea to cooperate"

A new attempt to get linear xylanase in pSXB1K3 was successful
The Golden Gate assemblies for linear Xylanase controls with his6 tag (functional control) and his6 tag + exteins (control for gel) were successful.
As the constructs are all finished by now, the bacteria were induced and the different Xylanase were expressed. A first Coomassi Gel was run to check for a shift of the Xylanase band due to the faster traveling of the circular proteins. This was succesful for the constructs without His-Tag, but there was some problem with the sample of the circular xylanase with His-Tag.
The first heat shock assays were prepared. Coomassie Gels were run to ensure that the same amounts enzyme. The best estimation for the ratio between linear and circular concentration is 1:8. As a next step the Xylanase activity assay was tested. To ensure optimal measurements the gain of the plate reader, in which the assay was conducted, had to calibrated.
The heat shock assays to find out how our modifications influenced the enzyme were conducted. First the assays with the purified linear and circular Xylanases with His-Tag were conducted. But because of problems in equalizing the protein activity and amounts at 37 °C, later the week the assays were repeated with the non-purified linear and circular Xylanases.

SDSZ-China,2017,Team:SDSZ-China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical                         ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.
……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their                         body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our                         country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply                         restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to                         UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution.
Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we                         need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects                         need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial                         production.
Q: Thank you for your suggestions.
Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?
A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs                         to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require                         three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or                         substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during                         the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of                         production overweights its potential profits.

With many questions regarding to complex bioprocessing and enzyme catalysis, we write to Prof.                         Xu, a very famous professor in China and also expert to get further instructions and                         professional help. At the beginning of our experiment, we decided to employ a two enzyme in one                         pot catalyzed reaction(see figure.1). However, after our initial attempt, we found out that the                         reverse reaction was more prevalent than the forward reaction. Thus because of this, the product                         was actually CDCA, the initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this"

Synth. Bio. High School Classes
During the January-May semester, we prepared a 1-hour introductory course to Synthetic Biology aimed to high school students. We made two versions: one for regular students with only a cursory knowledge of biology and chemistry, and another to senior students who were taking an elective class in Biotechnology.
The classes were tested in the Eugenio Garza Sada High School (PEGS), one of our university’s five high school campuses (and the one who participated in this year’s iGEM HS). All of the students were attentive and proactively asking questions. We talked about the current and future trends in synthetic biology as well about the iGEM competition and our current project.
We were invited to return for the next semester. During those classes we will also promote the iGEM High School 2013 competition and answer questions about it.

Our Story
From its very inception, Edinburgh iGEM 2015 has been steeped in controversy. What makes our team truly unique, however, is the way in which we have not shied away from its presence, but rather embodied it as the cornerstone of the work we strive to build.
Scroll down to read more
Foreword
With controversy comes important questions. Some have asked whether our test would implicitly condone drug use, and this has allowed for a fascinating exploration into the moral implications of harm reduction. Consequently, we have become facilitators of a debate regarding the nature of responsible drug policy, which we believe is paramount to a city so stricken by drug use as the one we have come to know, love, and call home.
Internally, this debate is at once restraining and liberating: it constantly forces us to stop and reevaluate what should be the next step forward, as we attempt to balance seemingly disparate beliefs within our own group. Yet, by doing so, we come to learn so much about ourselves, as we uncover ingrained prejudices we never knew existed.
There are endless ways in which our narrative could unfold. Indeed, with each new chapter there will be an  audience who stands and applauds with approval, and one which remains seated and scorns with discontent. Who will belong to which audience is difficult to say; however, one thing is certain: we are the authors, and it is our story to tell.
Interactive Timeline
From The White Board To The Wet Lab
In order to determine the focus of iGEM 2015, we participated in a week long sandpit where we brainstormed ideas.
A Chat With Policy Experts
We sat down with Susan Deacon, former Scottish MSP and member of the RSA Commission on Illegal Drugs, Communities and Public Policy, and Doctorial Researcher Anna Ross for interviews regarding the current climate of UK drug policy. See how their input changed our project.

Our Team
Sierra Tackett
I am a senior Biochemistry major with the hopes of going to medical school. I coordinated all of the projects that our team accomplished apart from lab. This included coordinating the summer camp, policy & practices work, and performing background research. Over my three years in iGEM, I have developed a passion for coordinating the Bioengineering Summer Camp, and I will miss doing this greatly. I was responsible for organizing the outside of lab curriculum and activities, as well as making sure the marketing was accomplished and that everybody had food to eat! I also mapped out the wiki page, organized content, and delegated who was responsible for what. I further ensured that leadership would transition well by creating an instruction manual with all of the details pertinent to running an iGEM team at WLC. It’s so hard to pick my favorite iGEM moment! This is my third year on the team, and presenting in Boston would have to be my favorite “moment”. I loved the city, being around my team members, and speaking with all of the iGEM teams across the world!
Aside from iGEM, I work as a medical scribe and love learning in the fast paced environment of the emergency departments that I work in. I have interned at the Medical Examiner's Office, and hope to become a pathologist some day. My favorite money drain is my growing collection of stationary and office supplies and spend more time than I should ""jammin on my planner"".
Matthew Mortensen
I am currently a senior Biochemistry major attending WLC. My primary role on this year’s team was acting as the lab manager. This involved deciding which experiments needed to be performed, delegating the lab workload, designing primers, troubleshooting problems, and most often just performing the protocols that needed to be done all while training the next generation of WLC iGEMers in lab. Outside of the lab, my main contribution to the team was the design and implementation of our wiki page (shout out w3cschools). I was the programmer behind our modeling program. I also rewrote the lab curriculum in our summer-camp binder. My favorite responsibility was being the primary lab instructor for our synthetic biology summer camp for high-school students. As a lab instructor I did prep work for labs, went through (sometimes) short lectures on the theoretical basis of the experiments we were"

The university's DNA sequencing facility recommends that the concentration must be at least size (kb)/10 = [ug/ul]
3.35kb / 10 = 0.335ug/ul → 335ng/ul
The concentrations of the kerA-pSB1A3 above are too low.
Instead we sent the 3:1 ligation plate (see 8/22/13) for colony picking and sequencing of 5 samples.

Naturally occurring biological systems cannot efficiently metabolize lactose and ferment it to ethanol: many bacteria (like Escherichia coli) can efficiently metabolize lactose to lactic acid without a significant ethanol production, while many yeasts (like Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and some bacteria (like Zymomonas mobilis) can efficiently produce ethanol from fermentation, but cannot cleave the lactose in the medium. A limited number of organisms (like some species of Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces, as well as some fungi) can perform both tasks and are used in industrial plants, like the New Zealand one. Anyway, genetically engineered organisms can be implemented to try to reach a higher yield of lactose-ethanol conversion than in wild type strains.

During this summer, all of us gained knowledge in synthetic biology and learned lab skills, but that wasn't all.  From the beginning of our brainstorming sessions, safety questions came up in our discussions. Our mutual interest in this topic lead us to center our project on safeguard systems and human practices related to public awareness and risk assesssment. This meant that we had to work hard not only on our wet lab project, but also on human practices. To our delight, this effort resulted not only in community outreach, but also changed our own opinion on biosafety in the context of synthetic biology. We feel that our Human Practice project changed each and every one of us. Here are our personal perceptions.
When we first began our project, I was really skeptical about the long term goals of releasing bacteria into the environment. However, during the debate we held some members of the ""government"", arguing in favor of the release of genetically modified bacteria, reminded the audience that there was a time when some held the opinion that airplanes were infernal machines that would only end in doom. We were questioned by judges in Amsterdam, who said that bacterial containment is impossible. I was inspired by the debaters. We have two options, we can either accept that biological containment is impossible, or we can try to study this problem and develop containment devices. In the end we may come to the conclusion that the risks are too great to ever release GE bacteria into the environment, but if we do not try to explore this problem we will do a great disservice to all the beautiful and brilliant iGEM projects dedicated to bioremediation.
Human practices definitely brought a new dimension to our project. The question of biosafety is too broad to be tackled from the ""narrow"" point of view of a pure synthetic biologist, and we realized how important the contact and the discussion with the population is when dealing with such a sensitive topic. In our case, both the"

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where"

Introduction

Modelling
Introduction
There have been well-established fundamental concepts in the physical sciences that have seen the day of light in the biological world. However, the integration between concepts in biological circuitry (e.g. gene circuits) and fundamental concepts in the field of electronics (e.g. electric circuitry) are very much at a nascent stage. Enter in the concept of logic gates, an idealized tool to model and represent logical Boolean operations in integrated circuits and programmable devices, to model and represent genetic circuits!
Given the complexities of modelling complex genetic circuits involving multiple variables and parameters ever-changing, use of a well-established technique used in electrical engineering may provide further insight into biological modelling. It is with this hope that Dry Lab pursues the technique of logic gate based modelling to simulate our biological hypothesis. By the end of the project, modelling will allow for understanding the modularization of gene circuit components done by logic gates, while also providing valuable insight from simulations for biological system design implementing our biological hypothesis.
Project Plan
For our project, a 4-step plan was conceived and implemented:
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system model for predictive parameters
A NOR gate program parameter design based on #1
Implementation of singular NOR gate design for simulation
Combination of NOR gate simulation results
Modelling
Systems of ODEs allows for modelling of key dynamic parameters that change with respect to a certain variable (typically time) and in relation to one another. For our modelling, systems of ODEs will be required to model ligand-receptor binding of sgRNA/dCas9/ribozymes to gene sequences via Hill’s equation. Later on, mathematical models will be derived from these previous equations and experimental results in order to decipher mathematical models for repression and activation cascade in the biological NOR gate setting. The advantage to using math models here is that it allows for regulatory parameters to be set and modelled with dynamic mathematical equations that can be numerically solved, but also retooled as necessary to accommodate for modifications from experimental data. Furthermore, assumptions (both mathematical and biological) can be made in order to simplify the mathematical model; the most common one being the steady-state assumption.
Having understood that binding of a sgRNA-dCas9 complex to various gene sequences will not be constant throughout, an ODE system can be devised to model the temporal responses of sgRNA, dCas9, and the resulting sgRNA-dCas9 complex to the gene"

μ1 and μ2 are the average ability of generating 30C6HSL and 3012CHSL, and normal distribution-- N(0,σ)--describes the fluctuations of AHL generating rate in individual cell. We then expanded our equations from 2 cells to a population of cells. Each cell share a mutual environment in which we assume that AHL in environment is proportionally distributed.
The figures indicate that our system can oscillate synchronically being able to tolerate differences at certain range among a population of cells.
We also tested whether the oscillation is dependent on initial distribution of AHL by changing the initial amount drastically by letting them follow uniform distribution. That is:
Initial(i)= U(0,20);
Based on this distribution restraining the initial AHL concentration in each cell, we simulated out a figure as follows.
The results demonstratively give evidence proving that our system can start to oscillate synchronically given variant initial starting status.

Outreach/ Ethics
Stefan, Fahd and I met to talk about Ethics this morning to make a plan of what needs to be done for the Erhics conference.  We're planning the conference for some time in late September/ early October, but we want to start inviting people now.  So today we made a list of possible speakers as well as people that we will invite just to come and listen.
We decided that the first step would be to familiarize ourselves with Second Life.  So, this afternoon I made an account on SecondLife and explored a little.  I walked through the boards with instructions on them to learn how to talk, move, ect.  Mandy then gave me access to our Island, so I got a chance to walk around and look at some of the stuff that our team has been looking on.    Tomorrow I'm going to explore an ethics area that Mandy knows about as well as try to find some conferences to sit in on to get a better idea of how they are run.  Fahd and I need to get planning our Ethics conference so I think it's a really good idea to become familiar with what we can do in Second Life so that we can decide where we want to have it, what we need to build for it, how we're going to advertise it within Second Life, etc.

Today I sent out July letters to the Following comapnies:
1)Nexen Inc.
2)New England Biolabs
3)Alberta Ingenuity Fund
4)Boheringer Ingleheim Canada
5)Apotex Canada
My Ethics teammates and I today discussed some ways to conduct the Ethics conference on synthetic biology in the online virtual world called Second Life.
I also had a meeting with our education and outreach team. We discussed ways to promote iGEM in high schools and universities.

Rutgers,2011,Team:Rutgers#EAS1_-_-_TEXT.html," useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification. For example, researchers creating biosensors may find our work very helpful.
 
General Overview
Our project can be broken down into three parts: light input, signal amplification, and color output. We used LovTAP to receive the light input; we designed a switch based on Peking 2007’s Bi-stable switch to amplify the signal; and, finally, (after dabbling with some of Cambridge 2009’s E. Chromi colors) we decided to use mRFP1 as a color output.
 
 
 
LovTAP
Introduction
In order to draw on a bacterial lawn with a laser pointer, we need bacteria to be able to respond to light. Previous iGEM teams have worked on many different ways to do this each with different advantages and disadvantages. We were struck by the simplicity and beauty of LovTAP. In particular, it functions by itself as a single protein; it is a brilliant example of genetic engineering; and, finally, it does not require any exotic supplements or specific strains of bacteria to function.
LovTAP Parts
As mentioned previously, LovTAP is a fusion protein. It consists of a light-response domain and a DNA binding domain, each of which are parts of other natural proteins.
Light Response
The light-response domain is LOV2, the photoactive domain (i.e. the light responsive part) of AsLOV2 (Avena sativa phototropin 1). AsLOV2 is a protein which allows Avena sativa to respond to 470 nm light. It does this by undergoing a major conformational change upon being struck by a photon with a wavelength near 470 nm. The absorption of the photon leads to the formation of a covalent bond between a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and a conserved cysteine residue.
This new bond distorts the conformation of the protein, causing the detachment and unfolding of the Ja-helix (see figure 1). In natural AsLOV2, the unfolding of the Ja-helix results in further downstream signalling. However, we will be most interested in the fact that the Ja-helix detaches when LOV2 is hit by blue light.

DNA Binding
The DNA binding domain of LovTAP is the well-known bacterial transcription factor trpR. In the presence of tryptophan, the trpR protein will repress transcription of the E. coli trp operon by binding the operator region in the"
Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," homologous regions between each piece that we want to combine. The Gibson Assembly master mix includes the enzymes exonuclease, DNA polymerase and ligase. The method functions so that the exonuclease starts degrading the parts 5’ ends and reveals the homologous regions as single stranded DNA. The exonuclease then inactivates because of the reaction temperature, and homologous pairing takes place. After this DNA polymerase will fill in any gaps that were produced by the exonuclease, and ligase ligates the pieces together. Figure 6 below describes the system when one insert is combined with a backbone. With Gibson, you can simultaneously combine up to at least 6 fragments. Our Propane Plasmid 1 and Cellulose Plasmid needed a four fragment assembly and Propane Plasmid 2 a five fragment assembly. The principle is the same regardless of how many pieces you wish to combine.
Figure 6. Gibson Assembly Method             
Our backup plans for Gibson Assembly were ELIC and OE-PCR . Of these, ELIC is a method that’s only been published in March 2015 and is thus poorly understood. Basically linear pieces of DNA, which contain homology to one another are transformed into a cell, and the cell’s endogenous homologous recombination system assembles these into a plasmid. OE-PCR also takes advantage of the homologous regions, but uses these as primers. The PCR program follows the regular guidelines, but  the annealing temperature is based on the homologous region. As the strands of DNA detach from each other, the homologous area functions as a primer that allows the polymerization of  the whole construct.
Backbones
Figure 7. gBlock Assembly taking advantage
of homologous regions between the blocks
As we ordered our constructs as gBlocks, they needed to be divided into up to 2000 bp pieces. We added 30 bp overlaps to each of our piece to enable the Gibson Assembly for our pieces. Due to a design mistake though, we didn’t design a 30 bp overlap between our Brick and the backbone: we thought we would be able to construct the bricks as linear DNA and ligate them into the backbone with the help of restriction enzymes. We did however have the prefix on all of our first brick-to-be pieces and had added the suffix with PCR. We hoped that the homologous area created by the prefix and suffix (about 15 bp) would be enough to attach our construct to the BioBrick backbone pSB1C3 . See"
