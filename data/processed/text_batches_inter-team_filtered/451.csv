Uppsala,2013,Team:Uppsala#killswitches_-_-_TEXT.html,"ansfere from another bacteria, or a massive amount of mutations and recombinations. While to loose a function, like producing the toxin, could happen with a single mutation or recombination. Our second conclusion is that the problem with iGEM teams approch to killswitches today is that they do not confirm the effectiveness of the killswitches. How well does the bacteria survive outside the lab? This can easily be tested with an competition test as seen in our project. A killswitch should not simple be inserted as a way to automaticly acheive biosafety criterias without being tested. We hope that future iGEM teams will focus on a low chance of survival outside of the lab, with or without killswitches.
We became curious on what other teams thought about killswitches, and decided to convey a survey. With this survey we also wanted to start a debate about killswitches. Can we really trust killswitches completely? What other options are there? Will we ever become 100% safe from spread in nature?
The results where really fascinating. About a third of the iGEM teams that answered used killswitches, but only half of them belive killswitches will become 100% safe. When asked if we will ever become 100% sure that the bacteria  released into nature will be of no danger only one sixth of the teams agreed. The other teams said that you have to weigh the risk versus the benefits. Though there is still not much of a discussion about risks and benefits in iGEM today.
Our conclusions were that:
The main focus of biosafety should be to measure the survivabilty of the bacteria in the wild and reducing them if needed.
The best killswitch is one that eliminate the bacteria when a substrate no longer is added.
There is a need for a wider discussion about risks and benefits about synthetic biology within iGEM.

The three biobricks were cloned into the standard iGEM backbone plasmid, which contains a chloramphenicol resistance for selection.
We decided to engineer a fusion protein between Ice nucleation protein (INP) and Streptavidin. Because such fusion proteins have been successfully used for cell surface display of enzymes, single-chain antibodies and antigens. So we assumed it would work for streptavidin as well. Especially because Jung et al ( 1 ) even succeeded to express a functional surface enzyme, that was much bigger than streptavidin.
Ice nucleation protein is a glycosyl-phosphatidyliositol anchored outer membrane protein, this motif is quite unique in prokaryotes. When it is expressed in E.coli over 90% of INP is found in the outer membrane, Wolber et al ( 2 ).
Streptavidin
Streptavidin originates from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii ( NCBI ). It is a tetrameric protein, and each of the four subunits can bind biotin with a very high affinity.
We cloned three Biobricks that contain different versions of streptavidin.
BBa_K1111012
Encodes a fusion protein between INP and a monovalent streptavidin provided by the laboratory of Mark Howarth at Oxford university Department of Biochemistry ( 3 )
BBa_K1111013
Encodes a fusion protein between INP and a dead version of streptavidin. It was designed to serve as a negative control for the microscopy functional assays, because its affinity to biotin is much lower.
BBa_K1111014
Encodes a fusion protein between INP and streptavidin we received in the Biobrick BBa_K283010 ( BBa_K283012, Main Page ).
INP-YFP Characterization
There is a Biobrick that contains INP in the iGEM registry (BBa_K523013). It was designed by the Edinburgh 2011 iGEM team . This Biobrick encodes a fusion protein of a truncated and codon optimized INP and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under control of the Lac promoter. The INP is truncated, it only contains the first 211 and last 97 amino acids that are normally encoded by the inaK gene. This is enough to target it to the outer membrane.
We improved the Biobrick BBa_523013 by extensively characterizing it.
We used confocal microscopy"

Our future plan
1.
We should reproduce all of the experiments that we have done this summer to make sure the results are credible.
2.
We will optimize the whole strategy to enhance the adsorption efficiency by changing pH, temperature, reaction time of crosslinking and clearance. (The efficiency is only about 60% without further optimization)
3.
According to the results for the adsorption of 13nM uranyl, the polymer network exhibited a good ability in a simulated seawater environment. We could thus also look into other usage scenarios of Uranium Reaper, such as bio-mining and uranium enrichment.
4.
Exchange of the SUP module for other functional proteins. For example, we could integrate proteins which could bind other heavy metals such as mercury so that the polymer network could be used to treat other kinds of pollution as well.
5.
We could assemble enzyme systems behind the SpyTag backbone to create a production plant in vitro. In the protein polymeric network, the concentration of enzymes could be increased and the efficiency of biocatalysis may consequently also be enhanced.
6.
If we optimize the number of SpyTag or SpyCatcher modules per protein monomer, as well as the working concentrations of proteins, we may make protein-3D printing using the Spy Crosslinking Network come true.

An example of the bacteriocin K2018010 /Laterosporulin plated in the MIC wells is shown in Figure 3. To validate growth or inhibition we used the absorbance measured in wells with no visual growth. A mean of absorbance measured in the wells without growth, was calculated for each MIC plate. The mean value was used as a reference value for the estimation of growth or inhibition. In Figure 3 a visual inhibition of growth of the listed strains by Laterosporulin is shown.

Introduction Solution Our Design
Description
Introduction
Granite and volcanic rocks are extremely high in fluoride due to large amounts of fluoride-rich minerals including biotite, fluorite, amphibole, and apatite. These high-fluoride rock deposits rise through faults and hot springs into groundwater. Prolonged exposure to high levels of fluoride correlates to diseases such as dental and skeletal fluorosis. These diseases can severely impact young children, whose enamel is still developing. Please see our interview with Maiko Suzuki to learn specifically how fluorosis manifests in the teeth.
Unfortunately, mitigating fluoride problems has proven to be very expensive and challenging. One of the issues we are attempting to address with our project is diligently tracking fluoride concentrations after treatment attempts. In rural communities, even once there has been treatment to high-fluoride water, it is difficult to monitor fluoride concentrations after the treatment.
We hope that the operon we have developed may assist the monitoring of fluoride concentrations in small, low-technology villages after treatment of the water has been administered.
Solution
The previously developed Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Operon (CHOP) by the 2017 East Chapel Hill iGem team was our first attempt in creating an accessible device that may serve as a visual indicator of fluoride in water. This year, we tested a series of promoters and riboswitch constructs to determine which are conducive to an operon with highest binding ability to fluoride. We were successful in being able to alter the previous CHOP operon so that it could detect concentrations of fluoride as low as 100uM.
About the Riboswitch
A riboswitch is a segment of messenger RNA that is able to control gene expression by selectively binding to certain ligands. Riboswitches have 2 main domains: the aptamer and expression. The aptamer primarily serves as a receptor for specific ligands to bind to. Meanwhile, the expression may switch between 2 secondary structures, controlling gene expression.
Riboswitches may be translational or transcriptional. A transcriptional riboswitch has a “switching sequence” in the aptamer that directs the formation of a transcriptional terminator, which signals to RNA polymerase to stop transcription. One may think of this process as an “on” or “off” switch, with “on” allowing for transcription of a gene."

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," another, more complex, challenge. The complexity of the challenge in the antibiotic field made it hard to find the niche in which we could apply and validate our detection method. By meeting with experts and stakeholders, we were able to shape our design to fit everyone's wishes as best possible, and make our design relevant and responsible. The timeline of our integrated human practices process is illustrated to give an impression on how our project evolved over time due to interviews with stakeholders, and those we collaborated with.
For example, we collaborated with farmer Paul Oosthoek and did experiments on his cow’s milk samples. Additionally, we performed experiments with the isolates gained from the experts Dik Mevius and Fimme van der Wal. Also, veterinarians gave us insights in their documents to gain more knowledge about the treatment procedures. Futhermore, multiple stakeholders participated in our project How can iGEM teams best include Relevance and Responsibility in their Design?
In the last section, we summarise the most crucial insights and how stakeholders interactions lead to impressive changes in our experiments and design.

Summary
One of the industries that greatly contributes to the antibiotic resistance problem is the fish farming industry. To achieve high yields and profits, many farmers are now applying intensive farming methods which involves the misuse of antibiotic usage. Our first idea was to solve this problem by engineering a bacterium that can sense the pathogen and swim towards it. After arriving there, a neutralizing agent will either be released or produced and excreted on the spot. Antibiotic resistance shield The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Protocol_-_-_TEXT.html," training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb for which we do know that monstrous harmful bioproducts will be made someday in the future, and indeed, it will be a significant threat to the current biosafety basis. Recall our memory to iGEM2009, Peking surveyed DIY bio, almost ten years later, we conducted a similar DIY bio-survey. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, and the result was quite shocking that we can buy almost everything for the molecular experiment, from the internet. Then, we went through relevant laws and regulations throughout the world, in which we found no laws related to credit certification and the address certification about the people who book the biology reagent. Most of the laws are about the quality certification and how they would serve the user after they bought this. We interviewed the Director of a center for disease control and prevention. He said that in his experiment with the disease caused by the bacteria leak, vast impacts such as environmental pollution had been observed. and our country has been making great effort towards elimenating such leakage accidents and incidents. He said it is not easy to solve the problem with hard work, rather it needs the cooperation between all the countries. He made an example of 731 army during the second world war two, in which the outbreak of pathogens caused significant physical and social harm. We are still on our way to win the battle, and the effort still needs to be put in.
Community and Future
Also, we hosted two major meeting in Beijing. In a biosafety forum in October, we invited a team leader who runs his high school lab, lab teachers from a university lab, and a former team member from Peking iGEM2009, who participated in their DIY bio investigation ten years ago.
We concluded that the development of DIY bio should be taken seriously, and the permanent way to solve its safety and security concerns is through implanting biosafety awareness into our academic culture. Also, as iGEMers, we should strive to be the considerate and responsible leaders in our community, to ensure the biosafety issue has been taken properly. Another meeting was with biology Olympians all over China, in which we discussed the future of biology community during the meeting, especially with more and more high school iGEM teams coming up in China contrasted with the lack of relevant instruction and education to the students. We came up with the idea of setting up a collaboration between schools to share and overcome difficulties hand in hand. This kind of meeting will be continued after iGEM2018, since the community usually grows"

With the genetic information of the samples finally deciphered, it is time to match it to known genes in the E.coli genome and quantify the amount of genes that was expressed way back before step one of this pipeline. This allows us to see the possible difference in gene expression between the E.coli worm samples and the E.coli control samples.

Training
Briefly describe the topics that you learned about in your safety training.
Our safety training covered hazardous material storage and usage, biohazard usage practices, protective personal equipment, engineering and human safety controls, and in-depth properties of select hazards, such as peroxides and flammable compounds. The laboratory safety training requirements at UCLA can be found here
In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
In the USA, biosafety regulations are provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA), and National Institute of Health (NIH)
Project Risks
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
E. coli K12 strain does not pose a major safety risk to humans. Nephila clavipes silk, which is the expressed protein product in our project, does not pose a safety risk either. Nevertheless, skin contact and potential ingestion should be eliminated or minimized.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public, particularly if any biological materials escaped from your lab:
Spider silk does not pose any safety or health risk to the environment if released. E. coli may have unpredictable impacts on the local ecosystem if released, but this is unlikely.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks?
We chose a very safe chassis organism to use, K12 E.coli. We are also wearing proper Personal Protective Equipment, such as lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses when handling biological materials. Additionally, any surfaces that have been potentially contaminated by bacterial species are thoroughly cleaned using ethanol and/or bleach.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
No safety risks would arise from the availability of our product or the knowledge of how to generate our product. There may be some impact to materials industries if the generation of genetically altered recombinant silk became commercially viable. For example, the natural silk industry may"

Safety
Before we began working in the labs, we were given a safety induction by the lab manager. The induction covered topics such as the correct use of PPE (wearing lab coats & safety glasses at all times whilst in the lab and also wearing gloves when required), what to do in the event of an emergency (such as a fire), and the correct disposal of waste (what went in each of the different bins).
Whilst working in the labs we were to wash our hands when entering and leaving. When using the equipment, we had to ensure that we were following the correct procedure so that we didn’t damage the machine, as well as to minimise the risk to us and others in the vicinity.
For our project, in all experiments we are using laboratory strains of E. coli and Serratia marcescens, neither of which pose a substantial risk to a healthy individual. S. marcesens is a category 2 organism, so in respect to this all the appropriate health and safety procedures/precautions were followed.
None of our synthetic parts or BioBricks contain toxic genes or elements directly harmful to the environment. Additionally, we maintained containment of all genetically modified organisms and genetic elements to our lab by following all health and safety precautions relevant to the category 2 standard lab we were working in.
In terms of environmental safety, we thought of adding our bacteria to a water bottle that contains a filter. The filter would prevent our bacteria from being ingested by whomever drinks from the bottle, but it would allow our small RNA to pass through (meaning that only the sRNA would be ingested). The bottle would also have to be designed so that our bacteria could not accidentally be released into the environment (a possibility is to add a kill switch into our bacteria so that it would become harmless if released). In practical terms, transport of our bacteria would be carried out in dehydrated containers where the bacteria could be recovered upon addition of water with killswitches should they escape in to the environment. These containers would be easy to handle and dispose of, if and when necessary."
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterium which was engineered by students of the Technical University of Darmstadt for the iGEM contest 2012, after the contest used in industrial facilities, fulfills the most expectations of the politicians. They decide to modulate the organisms so that it could be also used in sea water. After a few positive tests in sea water tanks, the new organisms is set free to nature and starts degrading PET and modulates the subparts into amino acids. These amino acids can now be used by marine bacteria and algae for nutrition. After a few years all PET in the oceans is eliminated and due to the fact that no new PET is produced, the danger disappears. The strong decision from the international community was free of economic and profit goals. This builds up a new social climate of sustainable development and sanity. Now mankind is able to release itself from environmental pollution with new technologies. But can this problem be solved so easily? Is this kind of utopia realistic? What would Jonas say to this kind of solution?
Conservation or Hans Jonas principle of responsibility
To contrast Bloch´s idea of utopia we are now looking at Hans Jonas´ principle of responsibility which on the first view seems to be a dystopia. Due to its negative outcome dystopia includes the destruction of a belief in progress. But is Jonas´ ethic of the future really a dystopia? This will be examined in the next section.  Hans Jonas book the principle of responsibility was first printed in 1979. It includes answers for new ethical questions arising in the technical civilization. His goal was not to create a closed system of normative ethics or bioethics or even replace earlier ethics; his goal was to complement older ethics in respect of special problems which arise through acting of technological society. Reason for his book had probably been an at this time actual crisis in industrialized countries which leads to political and social problems like fear of an atomic war, exhaustion of global resources and the threat of an ecological collapse. Let´s first have a look at the former ethics which were dominated by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. His ethics was based on evolution of acting in a nearer space and time. This means, that the people whose behavior is to judge are connected in common present. There was not animal or even nature ethics. Jonas stated now that the ethics of Kant is not useful for new challenges. The ethic is only useful for actual consequences but not for consequences emerging for future generations or nun human beings. Therefore Kant´s ethic cannot justify conservation of human existence. Confronting Kant´s category imperative stands Jonas ecological imperative. The basic of this imperative is that you should act in"

Northwestern,2018,Team:Northwestern#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," that we work in cell-free, which offers many advantages over in vivo sensing. One such advantage is that while working in cell-free, we don’t need to worry about keeping cells alive while also trying to sense lead and chromium. Instead, we just need to supply the engineered DNA, along with the reagents necessary for transcription and translation. Another advantage that results from this is that we are able to control the concentration of DNA in the reaction, which will make tuning our biosensor easier as opposed to if it were in vivo.
Overall, our meeting with Dr. Alam proved crucial in defining our project, as well as determining certain aspects of our design that would increase its relevance to citizens."

East Lansing Water Treatment Facility
We visited the plant in hopes of leaving with a better idea on how to tackle the current issue of contaminated water supply.  Bob, the manager of the plant, took us on a full tour displaying everything he could from where the water entered to where the solids and the clean water departed.  Bob spoke told us about how water treatment is expensive and that the plant is barely getting by and using 40 year old equipment and machines.  Late in the tour he told us some stories from when he visited some small villages in Nigeria where the people would drink water that was clearly contaminated as they had no choice and little knowledge of the contamination.  This encouraged us to pursue the idea of creating a cheap water contaminant detector.
Bioreactors as a safe measurement device and educational tool
MSU-iGEM 2017 drew inspiration for our project from the Flint Michigan water crisis. Fresh water contamination continues to impact wildlife and humans throughout the globe with contaminants ranging from oil to heavy metals and pesticides/pharmaceuticals. Contaminants such as lead are regulated by the EPA but pesticides, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals go unregulated. We wanted to emphasize detecting contaminants that are not regulated in hopes of developing a system that can even be incorporated into water treatment facilities. We visited the East Lansing Water Treatment Plant to gather information on how to apply our project. We continued to develop the impact of our project by participating in an even with the Society of Women Engineers. We wanted to show high schoolers the possibilities of synthetic biology and test to see if bioreactors could be used as a teaching tool. Finally, we sent our bioreactors to the Purdue University iGEM team to test reproducibility of our results. We also wanted to test if our system could be used based on a detailed protocol posted on University of Michigan Software’s website ProtoCat.

Human Practices
To address the misinformation and lack of knowledge surrounding the field of synthetic biology, our team sought to focus on where scientific illiteracy begins: with children. We partnered with the Building with Biology program, started from the National Museum of Science in Boston, whose objective is the engage both children and their parents—including the general public—in learning about synthetic biology. This program is designed to be accessible and public-friendly, focusing on the problems people face regarding the field of synthetic biology, such as misrepresentation by the media, challenges in understanding synthetic biology research, and fears regarding genetically modified organisms.
Our team organized a Building with Biology event at a local library, the New Haven Free Public Library (NFHPL), to engage with children and their parents with several activities, including BioBistro, VirEx Delivery, and Super Organisms. A brief description of each activity is given below:
BioBistro: Several cards are presented to the audience, each with a current or future genetically-modified food item, such as Golden Rice, cockroach milk, laboratory-grown meat, and coconut oil produced by algae. We discussed the possibility of the audience wanting to eat the item or not, and why. Such fears or concerns about the health of the food were alleviated, and we sought to decrease the misrepresented fear of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food.
VirEx Delivery: This hands-on activity involved teaching students about viruses and their role in synthetic biology as vectors of genetic information. Descriptions of the mechanisms of viral activity were simplified so that the children could understand the purpose of viruses in this field. We chose this activity also to ease the fear that the public has about viruses, and to educate the public about how they can be used beneficially.
Super Organisms: A colorful and creative activity, Super Organisms consisted of several coloring sheets in the form of super-heroes that children could color and design. During this time, our team would explain the analogy between super heroes and “super organisms,” mainly the organisms that scientists can genetically modify to address problems in our society, such as food security, human health, and materials production. Afterwards, children were asked to design their own “super organism” that would tackle a problem in society, such as the lack of a certain nutrient in a given food item.
Feedback from children and parents indicated that they enjoyed our events very much, learning more about synthetic biology than they had previously known"

Michael is a first year Science student at the University of British Columbia. He is incredibly interested in iGEM and plans to be part of a team (either UBC or UofC) in 2010. He is also a member of the UBC Thunderbirds Swim Team.
Julia Martin (2nd year Science student at Dalhousie University)
Previous to my tour of the iGEM lab at the University of Calgary I was unfamiliar with the project, really only having heard snippets here and there about it from my friend, and UofC iGEMer, Jeremy. I had no idea that there was such a fantastic undergraduate initiative out there for students to engage in! One of a kind, I discovered that iGEM was an international competition utilizing techniques in the up-and-coming field of synthetic biology to engineer and modify basic processes of life. I was intrigued that iGEMers literally got to play around with bacteria and make them do such things as glow green or smell like bananas as if they were LEGO. I find it remarkable that although the actual work involved in producing these results is a great deal more tedious and complex then simple LEGO pieces, the fact that these results can be produced is revolutionary.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," Kind of answer to biosecurity concerns?
Vivagora claim an integration of the principle of precaution in social and institutional devices about biosecurity. “In a report published in 2007 by Michèle Garfinkel from the J. Craig Venter Institute are presented rules of good practices, urgent procedures, enlargement of biosecurity committees, based on the extension of biosecurity frameworks already developed for recombinant DNA(Garfinkel 2007). We can find the proposal of Raymond A. Zilinskas and Jonathan B. Tucker, bio terrorism specialists, to take into account the principle of precaution. “It could be necessary to banish the use of every artificial micro organisms until the solid evaluation of risks” estimate both author of the article The Promise and Perils of Synthetic Biology.”(Tucker and Zilinskas 2006)
The main issue of that proposal, through their institutional forms, is to call for control of the states seen as the one that can legislate about these concerns. Church's paper also goes in that direction, proposing the creation of agencies, procedures and international agreement about biosecurity issues. Thus, the Garfinkel report “suggest that the American Congress legislate in order to force every synthetic genomes manufacturers to check the absence of pathogenic sequences in ordered DNAs. “Such regulation need to be international to be efficient” emphasizing them”
Auto regulation?
Industrial labs are not forgotten in this debate, as Vivagora shows.
“On its own site, the Industrial Association of Synthetic Biology (IASB) has presented its regulation strains through an editorial of Nature of September the 25th...Thus, and in a voluntarist way, the American Gene Foundries Blue Heron Biotechnology don't honour the dangerous orders when the screening software detects sequences from agent classified as “bioterrorist”. No more than one third of companies practices that vigilance today.”
Thus, that “good will” is claimed, forecasting different kinds of positioning and strategies from these labs. As Sunder Rajan reminds us, bioethicists are now mostly coming from biotech and genomic companies. In his analysis of the biotech company Repository X (Rep X), bioethics is now included in the business models of such companies :
“So clearly, bioethics is a key area in which Rep X takes an interest, which is not unusual for a biotech company these days. Indeed, Rep X has its own in-house bioethicist, a bioethicist being an emergent form of expert mediator in the ethical debates that surround new biotechnologies. In fact, the CEO of Rep"

Interestingly, the papers showed that the two AimR molecules differed strongly in both the structural details of how they regulated gene expression and the infection dynamics controlled by them [2, 3]. These results suggest it is imperative that we understand (i) how the AimR homologs regulate gene expression and (ii) which AimR homologs can be repurposed into synthetic biology tools in order fully utilize the potential of this discovery.
Here we present an integrated approach to predict the 3D structure of any AimR homolog, use these structures to gain insights into how the AimR protein regulates downstream gene expression in the natural context and then use this knowledge to repurpose the AimR protein as a synthetic communication system in silico and in vivo inside a new context. This modeling approach will prove extremely valuable in helping to decide which of the >100 AimR homologs have interesting properties for synthetic biology and how to fully exploit their potential.
GENERATING STRUCTURAL MODELS FOR AimR
The first step in generating deep insights into the structure of the AimR homologs is to predict the 3D structure of the homologs. To this end, a wide variety of prediction softwares were used to predict the structure of phAimR and compared with the experimentally determined structure of phAimR. The results are shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Protein structure prediction. comparing different in silico protein structure prediction tools including SWISSMODEL [4], CPHmodels [5], I-TASSER [6], Phyre2 [7]. Protein structures visualized by “UCSF Chimera” software [8].
Server
Prediction
Evaluation
SWISS-MODEL: fully automated protein structure homology-modeling server
CPHmodels: a protein homology-modeling server
I-TASSER: provides a hierarchical approach to protein structure and function prediction
Phyre2: a protein homology recognition server
From these results, we have concluded that I-Tasser seemed to give the prediction that was the closest to the real AimR structure. However, the prediction quality of I-Tasser using its own quality measure (C-score) indicated that this model was still only describing the global topology of the protein. Since I-Tasser is known to not function optimally on multidomain proteins [9], we decided to split AimR into its two domains (N-terminal DNA binding and C-terminal peptide binding domain) and rerun the split domains using I-Tasser. The domain boundaries were predicted using the ThreaDomEx"

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the two proteins, but we also want E.D. Frosti to die when we release it into the environment. Therefore, we created a suicide mechanism that is regulated by an AND-gate system. First, E.D. Frosti needs to respond to one of the stimuli, so that the pLac-Lux or the pLux-CI promoter is activated resulting in transcriptional activation.
The second part of the cell death mechanism works via a ribokey-ribolock system. The ribokey is under the control of the HybB cold-sensitive promoter ( BBa_J45503 ), which will only be switched on when E.D. Frosti senses a dramatic drop of the temperature. So when the ribokey isn’t transcribed, the ribolock mRNA will form a hairpin structure, so that the ribosomes cannot access double stranded mRNA, and there will be no translation of the CeaB gene.
Hence, to activate the cell death mechanism, E.D. Frosti needs to undergo a cold-shock treatment. E.D. Frosti will ‘sense’ the change in temperature and the ribokey will be transcribed. This ribokey will bind to the ribolock, followed by the opening of the double-stranded mRNA hairpin loop. Under these conditions, ribosomes can bind and translate the CeaB gene. CeaB is a DNase, which can be found in the Colicin E2 operon ( BBa_K131009 ). CeaB cuts all DNA in E.D. Frosti in small pieces, which results in cell death. We chose to only insert the CeaB gene instead of the whole Colicin E2 operon, since this also contains the CelB gene and the CeiB gene. CelB will induce cell lysis and under these conditions, E.D. Frosti would undergo complete degradation and this is something we want to avoid. We want E.D. Frosti to die, but it needs to retain its form, so that the proteins that are expressed on its cell membrane can retain their activity, even when the DNAse is active. The CeiB gene is an immunity gene, that results in DNase inhibition for the organism that is transcribing the CeiB gene.
So in summary, our cell death mechanism functions via an AND-gate system, in which both a stimulus and a cold-shock are needed to relieve the transcriptional and translational block, resulting in the death of E.D. Frosti.  If you want to know more about bacteriocins or colicins"

1.Introduction
Because our Trogene Horse use phages as  vector, it is very important to know how to make the best of these phages. This  means we need to get a condition under which these phages can work most  efficiently.
In our experiment, the phage display can be  descripted as:
Prepare E.coli JM101 with phagemid→ Add M13KO7 to infect JM101 → Add kanamycin for selection → Incubate for  phagemid-carrying phage releasing → Use phagemid-carrying phage infect blank JM101.
Thus, we chose two events as characters of  phage’s efficiency:
1. The release amount of phage after helper phage infection.
2. The infection  rate of our phagemid-carrying phage
So we collected some experimental data for modeling. And here comes the result.
We wolud like to give our appreciation to NCTU-Formosa, they taught us how to make this modeling.

MATLAB
MATLAB(MATrix LABoratory) is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. Using MATLAB, you can analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. The language, tools, and built-in math functions enable you to explore multiple approaches and reach a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java™.
ANFIS
The architecture and learning procedure underlying ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) is presented, which is a fuzzy inference system implemented in the framework of adaptive networks. By using a hybrid learning procedure, the proposed ANFIS can construct an input-output mapping based on both human knowledge (in the form of fuzzy if-then rules) and stipulated input-output data pairs. In the simulation, the ANFIS architecture is employed to model nonlinear functions, identify nonlinear components on-line in a control system, and predict a chaotic time series, all yielding remarkable results. Comparisons with artificial neural networks and earlier work on fuzzy modeling are listed"

Trademarking Internationally
In order to get a trademark worldwide, you must apply for an international trademark from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). In order to qualify for an international trademark (if you are based in the UK), you must:
1. Have an application or a registration in the UK on which to base your application
2. The International application must be for the same mark as the UK application or earlier registration
3. The goods or services in your International application must be covered by your UK application/registration
4. The proprietors details must be the same
The total cost for an international trademark can be as high as $20,000 as it covers 90 countries, each with their own trademark offices.
Intellectual property
The three components of Darwin Toobox cannot currently be patented as there is no “inventive step” in making these pre-existing technologies smaller/portable. Thus, Darwin Toolbox cannot be patented as it does not meet the required criteria under the European Patent Convention . However, in order to protect any future intellectual property that might arise, it may be prudent to require any parties spoken to by the Darwin Toolbox team to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements in order to prevent others building on work carried out in the development of Darwin Toolbox.
Intellectual property crash course: USA vs Europe
There are several differences between the patent system in the USA and in Europe, below is a quick guide of the major issues.
1. First to File vs First to Invent
Until March 2013, the USA operated under a “first to invent” system when granting patents. This meant that whoever came up with the invention first was given the patent when two parties tried to patent the same thing. However, since March, the USA mirrors Europe’s “first to file” standing, where the first party to file the patent is granted it, regardless of time of invention.
2. Grace Period
In Europe, if an invention is made publicly available in any way (lecture, presentation to investors, iGEM presentation) before the patent is filed, it is automatically rejected. In the USA, there is a one year grace period where the inventor can still obtain a patent. However, this grace period is lost if the individual who revealed the invention is a third party, as this negates the novelty of the invention.
3. Best Practice Requirement

Abstract
Cancer is one of the three major killers that threatened mankind since the 21st century. The reason is that it is not taken seriously at the beginning of cancer until it is detected in the middle and late stages, resulting in a very low cure rate. Therefore, early detection becomes a decisive factor to improve the cure rate of cancer. In this project, we use alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)as an example, using the factor that AFP can specifically bind to the aptamer, to achieve a signal conversion that using a small molecule (lysine) to replace AFP content in serum, just like equivalent substitutions in mathematics, to achieve the early detection of liver cancer. This system can be extended to all of the disease detection, which use protein as biomarkers.
Introduction
Technical significance：
AFP is a major fetal plasma protein. Serum AFP is always low expressed in healthy adults, but often high expressed in nearly 75% HCC patients with more than 500 ng/ml.AFP is a liver cancer associated protein and has long been utilized as a serum tumor biomarker of disease progression.
Figure 1 ：The Structure Model of AFP
Clinical significance：
Monitoring the level of molecular markers of disease contributes to the early diagnosis of disease, the monitoring of treatment and the prognosis of the disease, which is also a great significance for clinic. However, the molecular markers concentration in our body is very low, making it difficult to analysis and detect directly.
The conventional method is ELISA and other antibody-based techniques to enrich low-abundance molecular markers. ELISA which is based on ""antigen-antibody reaction"" of the detection method is a little bit expensive. Time and temperature are having a greater impact for its detection.
The purpose of this project is to establish a detection platform suitable for most molecular markers. The platform is low cost, simple to operate and has strong anti - interference ability.

This project uses the AP273 with the highest binding to AFP and the complementary chain paired with the aptamer. Aptamer is an oligonucleotide sequence or short polypeptide obtained by in vitro screening. Aptamer, as an alternative to the antibody, can bind to the corresponding ligand with high affinity and strong specificity. Its low price, easy to screen synthesis, the nature of stability and other advantages are widely"

Most of the methods we used were iGEM protocols,                  however, when necessary, we also used protocols that were more compatible with our bacteria. None of these protocols/methods included any                  chemicals that could be harmful to us/living tissues when inhaled or contacted.
Moreover, the disposal of the Petri dishes and liquid/solid wastes was checked constantly and done properly; with firstly being                  autoclaved and then placed in the biological waste bin.
Before and after each experiment, the working place and equipments such as pipettes, racks etc. were cleaned with alcohol and sterilized.
Safe Project
This low-risk level was consistent for all of our experiments as we used the Biosafety Level 1 E. coli ethanologenic strain KO11 and                  DH5⍺ (Ingram et al., 1998; U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines, 2009).
Our choice of parts were also non-pathogenic and harmless. The gene GSH is an antioxidant found in living tissues of humans and is                  an essential element in detoxification. (Pizzorno, 2014). Moreover, it is found in surprisingly high levels; the same concentration                  as glucose, potassium, and cholesterol (Pizzorno, 2014). Similarly, the FucO gene plays a role in detoxification by acting upon                  furfural and 5-HMF, turning them into non-toxic chemicals (Wang et al., 2011). In brief, we only used the non-pathogenic and harmless                  genes having the role on detoxification of toxic and threatening substances, posing no threat to human health.
In order to analyze our PCR products, we added loading dye with glycerol to our samples and ran them on the gel. However, in this                  protocol, we also had to use Ethidium Bromide. Ethidium Bromide is an intercalating tag, a nucleic acid stainer, but it must                  additionally be handled carefully and decontaminated prior to disposal. Its biggest drawback is that it is a potent mutagen. As we                  were aware of this information during our experiments, we made sure to wear a lab coat, mask, gloves which we discarded after working                  with"

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," is ethical(1). Though this is in direct conflict with the oath to “Do No Harm” it is an accepted practice in the medical community. There are misinterpretations though, I believe that this situation can be a misinterpretation of that practice. The Doctrine of Double Effect stands in cases such as: a military sniper killing a terror bomber or a catholic doctor performing an abortion in a case where pregnancy would kill the mother. What these have in common is that they are last ditch efforts to save lives. The purpose of this project is for the topical application not to be a last ditch effort, but for it to be a go-to in the case of an emergency. In this case, because the possible chance of harm may outweigh the possible good, it may not be considered ethical.  Development of procedures to minimize risk will be essential to make the solution ethical in this sense.
4. ""First do no Harm"" as it relates to a potentially harmful biological product (Talia) The saying “first do no harm” is one which is heavily related to bioethics and medicine. It refers to the way that both in the medical and scientific community we are meant to make choices. This was developed as a basic way to evaluate all choices as sometimes they can be fairly tricky and need to be made quickly. The basis of this viewpoint is to do what you think is right first in high stress situations, but also to maintain respect. This means that though you know your treatment or project could be helpful if the people most directly affected does not agree with what you are doing you are not free to do so, and to do so would be wrong. (1) The do no harm viewpoint also emphasizes that one should not place people in a historical order meaning that when considering the effects of one's project you should not place on viewpoint or person in preference but rather all as equal. (2)This applies to the project because when considering the effects of the project one must consider the true effects it could have on those directly affected or the patient's. First of all let's look at application. With the current implementation method there is still a possibility, though limited that a patient could experience sepsis or another effect from the biological system or that the snake venom could cause the blood in the patient to clot somewhere other than the  womb sight. Applying the first do no harm principle in a high stress situation if this could save the patient's life then they should do so. However if the patient is able to consent they must provide this consent. The second issue is surrounding that of the use of a GMO on a person. Many people"
William_and_Mary,2016,Team:William and Mary#Binding Array_-_-_TEXT.html," While the data is noisy, it is clear that the inflection point of the circuit with the binding array has shifted to the left as expected. Additionally, both circuits experienced a decrease in fluorescence at higher aTC concentrations, which was thought to be a result of ATC causing toxicity at high levels. However, during the course of our modeling we found that in fact this is the expected result of a repressor system.
While the 85x array will undoubtedly be useful to many teams in the future, one of the strengths of decoy binding arrays is their modularity. Since the magnitude of the shift is determined by the number of binding sites, it is possible to vary the magnitude of the shift by using the same binding array on different copy number plasmids. While this allows for more possible numbers of total binding sites, it is inherently limited by the fact that there are only a limited number of plasmid origins. To get around this problem we decided to submit to the registry a suite of Iterative Capped Assembly (ICA) parts that can be used to assemble a TetO or LacO binding array of any size. These parts were designed based upon the ICA method of assembling repeat sequences from Briggs, et al. 2012 (“Iterative capped assembly: rapid and scalable synthesis of repeat-module DNA such as TAL effectors from individual monomers”).
Additionally, for the tetO ICA parts we submitted 3 different versions, with either 8,16 or 64 base pair spacers between the tetO monomers, this is because it has been suggested by Amit et al. 2012 (“Building Enhancers from the Ground Up: A Synthetic Biology Approach” that anticooperativity plays a role in the effectivity of DNA protein binding. Anticoopritivity means that if two repressor binding sites are very close to each other, a repressor binding to one can spatially hinder, or even completely prevent a repressor from binding to the other. We thought that enabling another level of tuning to allow for even finer levels of shift magnitude by altering the level of anticooperativity would be a useful tool to include within the binding array section of the toolbox. Finally, to help future teams get started, we created a mathematical model to determine the strength of titration needed to shift their transfer function, as well as the number of repeats required to achieve that titration for a given tetO or LacO array.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," regulatory sequences, we would have different amounts of catalytic biomolecule depending on the regulatory sequence in each droplet. Moreover, the amount of product nucleotide produced would also be connected to the protein amount in the droplet. Finally, if we would have a stronger regulatory sequence that allows greater catalytic biomolecule expression, we would see that by an increased amount of Product Nucleotide.
Therefore, the regulatory sequence strength can be indirectly, but precisely assessed using CAT-seq.
Regulatory part cross-interaction measurement
Finally, CAT-Seq can be used to assess the cross-interactions of different regulatory sequence combinations.
Let’s take Toehold Switches as an example. They consist of two parts - the Toehold Switch and activating RNA. The Toehold Switch forms an RNA loop on the RBS of the controlled coding sequence and in turn inhibits the translation. The expressed activating RNA can bind to the Toehold Switch RNA sequence and open RBS to the translation machinery. Testing a big number of combinations toehold switch pair combination while searching for orthogonal switches is an extremely time and resource consuming task. That is because each combination must be assessed separately.
Using CAT-Seq, the cross-interactions of large libraries of Toehold Switches and RNA activators can be recorded in a single experiment. In this example, two libraries would have to be prepared - the toehold switch and RNA activator. Then, both of these libraries are ligated next to the same catalytic biomolecule. What we then have is a new library that consists of fragments which have random toehold switch and RNA activator combinations and the same esterase.
Depending on how activating RNA affects toehold switch in each droplet, the Product Nucleotide amount will vary. After the amplification and sequencing in each fragment, we would see three main things - the specific toehold switch sequence, the specific activating RNA sequence and their performance or activity score in the form of Product Nucleotides.
Validating the measurement accuracy
While ultra high-throughput is extremely important, the precision and accuracy of the system is just as critical. In order to assess if our system is measuring activities properly in high-throughput, we have first made low-throughput measurements using standard and well-established methods. Then, we have compared them with the results acquired using CAT-Seq.
Esterase mutant activity determination
In silico designed mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio) was extracted and sequenced with"

Occurrence
Copper is an essential trace element for humans, animals and plants. The human body contains concentrations of 1.4 to 2.1 mg/kg body mass. Copper is ingested through the gut and transferred to most tissues through the liver. It is used in coating alloys and used to make pipes, valves and fittings. Moreover coppersulfate pentahydrate is used in algae control by adding it to surface water. Therefore copper concentrations in drinking water vary widely and range from 0,005 mg/L to 30 mg/L. After the guidelines for drinking water the maximal concentration of copper is 2 mg/L (Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, Fourth Edition ).
Health effects
Copper is essential for human health, but in to high doses it can cause anemia, kidney and liver damage as well as stomach and intestinal irritation and immunotoxicity (ATSDR). A with copper associated disease is Wilsons disease which manifests in a misfunction, so that copper can not be excreted by the liver into bile. If not treated this can lead to brain and liver damage (US EPA ORD NCEA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) 2014). Some studies associate high copper levels with aging diseases"

Overview
This year our team focused on yeast prion SUP35, trying to make it a useful tool. So after we primarily determined what we would do, we cousulted Dr. Dong Men from Wuhan Insititue of Virology for advice. In the middle of this summer, we attended the conference held in NCKU, Taiwan. There we introduced our project design and potential applications. During our project, we also did a survey about public opinions on yeast prion being applied. We also communicated with Team HFUT. We learned about each other's project, giving and gaining suggestions.
Consulting Dr. Dong Men
When getting trouble in scientic research, seeking help from other researchers or institutions is always a good way and so did we. We contacted Dr. Dong Men and got the SUP35NM gene which was vital to our experiments as well as some practical suggestions.
This year, our project involves yeast prion Sup35. Although we had got the genomic sequence of it before we started our experiment, we failed to acquire this sequence for lack of saccharomyces cerevisiae containing it. So we searched on the web for any institutions which were possibly doing researches with Sup35. Then we got to know that Dr. Dong Men, Associate Professor of Analytical Biotechnology in Wuhan Institute of Virology of Chinese Academy of Sciences was who we were desiring to contact.
We first emailed him on July seventh, delivering our respect, explaining what we were going to do and making it clear that we needed gene model of Sup35 or specific saccharomyces cerevisiae containing it as well as some professional advice on our project. Before long, we got reply, knowing that Dr. Men Dong was dealing with nano material of auto-assembling protein useful for sensing with Sup35 and willing to offer the"

Microfluidics
Microfluidics Main | How-To Part I | How-To Part II | Tamagotchip
To characterise our transcription factors, we used a lot of microfluidics, a tool underused by the iGEM community. We were lucky to have experts at hand to help us get started, so in turn here is our effort to promote microfluidics within the iGEM community, and help future teams use it.
Microfluidics in Synthetic Biology
Microfluidics is a powerful tool for biological research, having a wide range of applications. Essentially any molecular biology technique can be adapted, including:
On-chip gene synthesis: protein expression from coding DNA
On-chip chemostat chambers: can be used to trace the fate of a single bacterium or to grow bacteria/yeast
Protein-protein interaction screening
Protein-DNA/RNA interactions: to determine the binding affinity of a transcription factor or to discover new regulatory proteins
A single picture gives us the binding affinity of 756 protein-DNA pairs
These techniques all share the same advantages when ported on-chip: reagent volumes are reduced, therefore minimising cost, and the tiny size of each reaction chamber allows massive parallelisation of the experiment, enabling high-throughput screening. More specifically, in vitro gene synthesis becomes affordable at this scale. Our MITOMI chip contains 768 wells, all visible in one frame, which allowed us to quantify the affinity of hundreds of protein-DNA combinations in a single experiment. The small channels also allow fine control over reaction conditions. Most soluble reagents can be used, including DNA, proteins, molecule libraries, and so on - allowing much creativity in experimental design.
Few iGEM teams used this technology for their projects. We believe that promoting the use of microfluidics can help iGEM and improve the Parts Registry, specifically by providing more thorough biobrick part characterisation. To this end, we wrote a guide to get started with"
NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Project#Wet Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," superfolded green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) or Alanine Racemase (ALR) under the control of a lactate sensitive promoter (Figure 1). ALR is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of D-alanine, an essential amino acid required for bacterial survival (Walsh, 1989).
Figure 1. Working mechanism of RIOT sensor.
(A) In the absence of lactate, lldR binds to two operators in the promoter region and inhibit the expression of a superfolded green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). (B) In the presence of lactate, lactate binds lldR, preventing its binding to the operators. Consequently, sfGFP is expressed and the level of sfGFP can be quantified using fluorescence microscopy.
RIOT sensors using Alanine Racemase (ALR) as a reporter gene  have similar working mechanism. In the presence of lactate, lldR is inhibited and ALR is expressed to catalyze the synthesis of D-Alanine which helps D-Alanine auxotrophic mutant bacteria to survive.
CAMr = Chloramphenicol resistant.
Since one of our goals is to detect the presence of L-lactate produced by cancer cells, the designed sensors have to be extremely sensitive to small changes in lactate concentration. Various studies have shown that normal physiologic range of lactate concentration in the blood is approximately at 0.5 – 2 x 10-3 M in healthy, resting individuals without exertions (Gollnick et al., 1986; McGee et al., 1992; Kennedy et al., 2013). Tissues that were completely exhausted like skeletal muscles when exercising contained higher lactate concentrations of up to 2.5 x 10-3 M (Mainwood & Renaud, 1985; Goodwin et al., 2007). Once the body stops exercising, the lactate concentrations would drop after 3 to 8 minutes post-exercise (Goodwin et al., 2007). This differs from the pathophysiologic lactate concentrations in tumors which range from normal lactate levels to concentrations as high as 4 x 10-2 M (Kennedy et al., 2013). Also, the elevated lactate levels in tumors were over a longer period of time as compared the concentrations of lactate in normal skeletal tissues when exercising. Therefore, our engineered sensor should have little or no basal expression and significant increase in reporter output (either by GFP or ALR) in the presence of lactate. Our strategy allows strict amount of reporter"

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html,", the overhang PCR seemed to have been unsuccessful with PCR products that were either unspecific (at 52 °C annealing temperature) or simply not present (57 °C). The failure could due to low compatibility of the new primer or the conditions for overhang PCR not being optimal. For the next trial, various component in the setup were optimised.

PCR adding BamHI Overhang, Second to Fourth Attempt [❌]
In the following three attempts, we switched to Taq polymerase, increased amount of DNA templates and primers to optimise the PCR. However, the modifications to the protocol were unsuccessful. The bands were either faint or unspecific. We examined all the reagents and found out that we had mixed up the reverse primer.
PCR adding BamHI overhang, Fifth Attempt [✔️]
In the new trial with correct primers, clear bands were observed at correct size in the gel. As shown in the picture, the well 2, 3 and 4 were EB with 1, 10 and 20 ng of DNA template. The bands occurred at a size slightly bigger than 1000 bp, which was corresponding to EB with 1021 bp. After performing this successful overhang PCR, we were able to continue with digestion and ligation of the product.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Alphabrick_-_-_TEXT.html," June of 2017. As our current business model centres on a subscription model for premium features, we envisage that later stage product development will come from the income generated from subscription sales for our premium features in the region of £32.99 which is the current market standard for our type of software tool.
We project that sales will initially be small in number as early adopters start to use our platform. Following a successful fundraising round for seed investment, Alphabrick will roll out a marketing campaign to drive sales and begin generation of revenue so that the company can break even and start to make a profit. Assuming a further, £40,000 is raised in the seed-fund round and that two more full time staff are added to the team, we will only have to make an average of 157 client subscription sales to break even by the end of 2018.
Exit Strategy
We would only consider exiting this start-up after achieving a worthy market valuation. In the meantime, we intend to continue to establish and run the business until a suitable and sizable offer is made. At a later stage we anticipate that offers are likely to come from automated laboratory businesses such as Transcriptic. Automated laboratories are seeking to transform the labour-intensive scientific process. As part of their growth model these businesses are likely to want to acquire a platform with a strong user-base that makes their technology more accessible.
In the event that the proposed plan is not successful, we will endeavour to adjust our plan accordingly. If this also fails, we will implement measures to exit the business with minimal damage to all stake-holders. Tangible assets will be liquidated to cover any outstanding debts. Definitions of ""successful"" and time limits for achieving milestones are included in AlphaBrick's Co-founder's Agreement.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Future#More applications_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria comes more and more into the picture. Initiatives like ‘the bacteria grown bricks from BioMason’ and ‘the sand solidifying Sporosarcina pasteurii bacillus from Dupe’ have shown that the idea of using bacteria for construction materials is not too futuristic, it could be useful. Some biomaterials can also offer excellent features like flame-resistance, eco-friendliness and sometimes even great insulation properties. The generation of patterns in a controlled way will allow the production of novel biomaterials. After forming a pattern, the cells can be engineered to precipitate or deposit networked biominerals, opening up exciting new avenues for the production of microstructured biocomposite materials. In order to do this, we should try to start working on 3D modeling of the patterns in parallel with the development of 3D biological patterns. Another way to face the 3D challenge, could be to work together with the TU Delft. They invented an advanced 3D printer that in the future could be used for the production of biomaterials. However issues about scaling up the production could make this application less interesting. More information about this future collaboration can be found on the following link: Future collaboration with TU Delft .
Solidification of sand
Dredging and reclamation projects such as beach replenishment and dredging sand banks are facing the problems of stability. Especially erosion shortens the life span of sand banks dramatically. Therefore, research into sticking together grains of sand as a result of bacterial activity is becoming more popular. The project contributes also in this field. The bacteria can be triggered by an increase of salt concentration to precipitate particles in a specific pattern so that they can hold the sand together. In that way, it is possible to make the sand more solid.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 4_-_-_TEXT.html," was very little light- so we added more arabinose. Cells are still not giving out any visible amount of light after 5 hours, and we now suspect that we might have killed the cells with too much sugar.
We're also having some problems deciding what approach to take with the input side of things. Our system should be very flexible, so it would be good to use many different biobricks from the registry. However, very few have been characterized in bacillus. Ideally we would want to find some way of transferring existing biobricks from e.coli so that they were reliable in bacillus, but we may find getting the right sensory proteins into bacillus complex. The idea was floated that we might want to approach the problem as a business problem, and do some market research into what the hypothetical end consumers of our product might want to sense. This would mean pitching to a specific group, potentially obscuring the main point of the project (the breadth and flexibility of the lux based system and its quantitative measurement of concentrations). For example, if we decided to create an agricultural kit as our prototype kit, we would want to create nitrate sensors, iron sensors, osmolarity sensors, fluride sensors etc. However, this would mean leaving out some very interesting additional sensory components. See what we eventually went with on our human practices page .

HUMAN PRACTICES & OUTREACH
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," reporter gene, and the gRNA expression vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.
Phase 2 Results
With our parts of our project well characterized, we began experimenting with achieving a variety of consistent expression levels with our dCAS9-VPR activator. Our first strategy was to attempt multimerizing the target operators, placing two and then three operators up stream of the gene of interest using two of our operators. During this experiment, we also tested the effect of spacing the target operators with a different number of intervening base pairs. We tested with 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 intervening base pairs. The results of these experiments yielded a predictable, linear correlation between the number of operators and the expression level and the number of base pairs in the intervening sequences. The results can be found below:
There were some anomalies within this data set. The target operators with 0 and 12 base pair spacing had lower expression than expected. One explanation is that when the operators are at 0 and 12 base pairs apart, they are on the same side of the DNA helix and crowd each other out. Once we eliminated these results, were able to create a smooth progression in expression level across several levels of expression, as seen below.
Finally, we realized that while we could achieve a wide range of high expression levels, it is sometimes favorable to lower expression levels below the standard single operator expression level. In order to accomplish this, we mutated our operators, replacing a base pair at a time. We tested 20 versions of 2 of our operator plasmids. Each version had one of the twenty base pairs in the twenty base pair operator mutated, so that there was a single mismatch between the operator and the guide RNA attached to the dCAS9-VPR complex. By changing the location of the single mismatch, we were able to create another smooth curve of changing expression levels, this time lowering expression levels. The expression levels can be found in the graph below.
Phase 3 Results
Now that we could achieve a variety of expression levels, we began integrating our system into recombination based circuitry. The circuit we used could express a different gRNA for every combination of drugs introduced. Before integrating our multimerized plasmids, we first tested the circuit by making each gRNA correspond to a different fluorescent reporter. The"

Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," David took us to a restaurant where we met a few more members of the Bordeaux team. We got to know each other and discuss our projects more informally over a pleasant meal followed by a small digestive.
The next day, after a light lunch, we started working on our collaboration in earnest. Saturday we would work on the chemistry part. Jacques gave a presentation on his findings concerning the extraction and characterization of FDCA from the cellular mixture. Together with Hemant Kumar (University of Groningen) he had evaluated the Bordeaux protocol and came up with a number of improvements and recommendations for safe practice. A separate protocol for HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) was also suggested.
Following this, a presentation about HPLC was given. It started with the basic chemical principles that govern this type of measurement, as the Bordeaux team is mostly biologists with no chemical expertise. Then the layout of the machine was explained. Finally, the interpretation of the measurements and troubleshooting were explained via the fundamental parameters of HPLC; resolution, selectivity, retention and efficiency. By the end of the presentation, the Bordeaux team felt confident about their eventual use of the HPLC. A question and answer session followed the presentations.
The following day, in the same chamber from chateau d’Eck, we discussed the ethics part of our collaboration. This was started with presentation by Anais, David and Inez about the progress their team had made towards understanding the ethical implications of their project. This involved brief summaries of the conferences they organized and the experts they went to visit.
Next we had a general discussion about the ethics of GMO use, contrasting the differing societal and governmental attitudes between France and the Netherlands. The French team also presented the results of a survey they had conducted to investigate public opinion on GMO use. Matthijs and Jan-Marten then proceeded to ask a list of questions the Dutch team had prepared. Once answered, we tried to summarize the main insights of the interview and presentations via a discussion that was filmed.
To celebrate a successful collaboration we had some wine from the castle’s vineyard and then went to downtown Bordeaux, where we sat by the Garonne and socialized over a picnic dinner. On Monday, we slept in and then went on a day trip to the countryside with the Bordeaux team. We first visited the lake of Biscarrosse. While the bulk of the group relaxed by the beach; Jacques, Jan Marten and Vincent went on a “geocache hunt” (a type of scavenger hunt) in the surrounding countryside.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," scientists from ATU performed plasmid purification and gel electrophoresis. The team had a marvelous day as it was wonderful to see so many young individuals being engaged in science.
Week 38
We had a human practises meeting with Rikke Falgreen Mortensen about integrating our project in MyBolbro.  Furthermore, we held a presentation about GMO and our project for the local public school, Odense Friskole.
We were surprised to discover that a transposon hotspot had formed between the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and the GFP reporter.
Week 39
We held a presentation at the local high school, Mulernes Gymnasium, where synthetic biology was the main focus.
The lab workers discovered that a region containing the strong constitutive promoter and the BioBrick prefix had vanished from the photocontrol device plasmid. Furthermore, it was decided to keep the cellulose biosynthesis subproject theoretical henceforth.
Week 40
Materials for our prototype were set after a talk with the plastic expert Flemming Christiansen.
Second part of the course in innovation and patents with Ann Zhale Andersen was completed.
The last two part of the safety form part were completed and submitted. Additionally, it was decided to keep the carbon fixation subproject theoretical henceforth.
Week 41
The final promoter for the RelB expression, pBAD, was chosen and cloned.
We ceased trying to perform the recombination in Geobacter after several difficulties.
Week 42
We got together with the old iGEM teams from SDU-Denmark at the Old-iGEM Meetup. Both the project in general and our wiki were presented to them, and we got a lot of useful feedback to improve our project, presentation, and wiki. We shared a lovely meal and had a great night.
We managed to create our secretion system part after several tries and problems.
Week 43
Parts were sent to HQ and the Judging form was filled out.
In the lab, we obtained promising results, as the features of the pBAD and OmpR-regulated promoters were studied in the fluorescence microscope and flow cytometer.
Besides working in the lab to get the last results ready for the wiki freeze, the team spend the weekend going through all of the text.
Week 44
With the wiki freeze around the corner, we worked day and night, caffeine concentrations in our blood running high. We shall make it!

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," sequestering the second messenger c-di-GMP. When expressed constitutively under a T7 promoter in K12 E. coli, the merRNA increased biofilm formation. This is thought to be the result of the merRNA binding to and sequestering c-di-GMP molecules. This causes an increase in motility and flagella expression. The additional flagella adhere to surfaces and other cells, thereby forming a robust biofilm. Teams can insert this part directly downstream of a promoter sequence to cause stronger biofilm formation.
BBa_K1427001
This part contains BBa_K1427001 under the transcriptional control of a constitutive T7 promoter. Additionally, terminators developed by the Voigt Lab flank the merRNA sequence. There is an upstream ECK120033737 terminator which stops read-through by other genes. Downstream of the merRNA sequence, bidirectional termination is ensured with ECK120029600 and ECK120033736. It is likely these are redundant, as the poly-U tail of the merRNA suggests that is contains an intrinsic terminator.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Microfluidics How-To Part II: Building Your Setup
Microfluidics Main | How-To Part I | How-To Part II | Tamagotchip
A basic computer-controlled microfluidics setup. Note the compressed air input split into two sides, both fed through a pressure regulator. The left side is the low-pressure manifold for the flow layer. The right side is the high-pressure solenoid array for the control layer.
Microfludic chips are nothing but a piece of moulded rubber. To actually get something out of them, an external setup of tubing, compressed air, and valves is needed to flow in fluids and actuate the on-chip valves. To see what's happening, you'll also need some form of microscope. No matter the application of the chip, whether it is designed to study fluid mechanics, to characterise protein-DNA interaction, or even cultivate bacteria and nematodes, the external setup remains essentially the same.

A basic microfluidics control setup
Building the setup is relatively straightforward, once you have determined which components are needed and their purpose, and once you have collected the parts. Connecting the components is basic plumbing: just remember to wrap plumber's tape around all metallic screw threads, and then connect the pressure regulators in the correct orientation. With this in mind, we'll go through the parts of a microfluidics setup one by one, and from there you should be able to build your own.

Melanin Pigment
Background Design Characterisation
Background
Melanin Production
The MelA gene codes for a tyrosinase. Tyrosinases catalyze two reactions, as described in the figure below. Melanin is a macromolecular compound produced by the polymerization of the quinone product of the second reaction, and has a characteristic brown colour.
From H. Claus and H. Decker, Bacterial tyrosinases, Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 29 (2006), pp. 3–14. [1]
MelA
Our MelA gene is from Rhizobium etli. Further, it is a mutant; it has a C to T substitution at the 1,000th nucleotide, which creates a Proline to Serine mutation that reduces the amount of time before melanin production is visible. (Santos, C. N., and G. Stephanopoulos. 2008. Melanin-based high-throughput screen for L-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 74:1190-1197 [2] ) The plasmid was provided by Christine Sanntos from the lab of G. Stephanopoulos to Duncan Rowe under the materials transfers agreement.
Action plan of our team
Our action plan is as follows:
1. Test for melanin production
2. Isolate MelA gene in biobrick form
3. Integrate Mel biobrick into system (e.g amplification of logic gate system)
Design
Constructing the BioBrick
Biobrick
Our aim is to make the MelA gene into a biobrick as follows:
In order to do so, we had to remove forbidden restriction sites within the gene using primers and the in-fusion PCR technique"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," is is usable when the KU70 gene is knocked out.
Our project required auxotrophic markers for selective screening of our transformants, so we looked for a ura3 and leu2 auxotroph. A paper by Verbeke et. al in 2013 described the JMY2394 strain, which satisfied our parameters, but was unavailable to us. We searched for a similar strain and settled on FKP393 by recommendation of Erin Bredeweg of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. FKP393 is a NHEJ mutant derived by transformation of Po1g with the specifications matA; leu2-270; ura3; xpr2-332; axp-2; ku70::hph+. We received FKP393 as a gift from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center at the Kansas State University. This strain includes all of our specifications but lacks sufficient annotation. We were informed by Cory Schwartz of UC Riverside that this was not an issue because the parent strain is the well-studied W29, which we can use for genome analysis.
PROGESTERONE METABOLIC PATHWAY
Figure 1: Simplified version of the reference pathway for progesterone biosynthesis in mammals, from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [10] .
Due to our extensive research on world issues, we chose to create a contraceptive in yeast: progesterone. Progesterone is a hormone produced by all mammals (men and women) naturally, and aids in many functions regulating fertility, menstruation/ovulation, pregnancy, and normal body function. ""Progesterone prepares the endometrium for the potential of pregnancy after ovulation. It triggers the lining to thicken to accept a fertilized egg. It also prohibits the muscle contractions in the uterus that would cause the body to reject an egg. While the body is producing high levels of progesterone, the body will not ovulate"" [7] . Progestins are routinely used in contraceptive pills, vaginal rings, and IUDs. Progestins are a chemically formulated version of progesterone that acts on progesterone receptors to increase cervical mucus and suppress ovulation to prevent pregnancy [8] . They are not naturally made by the human body and therefore have additional side effects on the women who take them [9] . Progesterone is a molecule naturally made by the body which can perform the same function as progestins: preventing pregnancy. Progesterone can do so without the harmful effects that progestins cause [9]"

UCAS-China validated the SA-emrR system in controlling expression under our guidance. Their protocol is the same as HBUT-China’s except for the concentration of salicylic acid(SA). In addition, UCAS-China also provided us with flow cytometry, which allowed us to obtain more accurate experimental data in the start-stop codon overlap verification experiment and glucose dehydrogenase anti-degeneration experiment. More details about the result of experiment can be assesses here: Results-Module 4:Stop-Star Codon “TGATG”
5.OUC-China & BNU-China
How to promote synthetic biology knowledge for the public has always been an important proposition of human practice of the iGEM team. Popular science comics is undoubtedly a very popular carrier to promote synthetic biology. The science comics created by OUC-China are vivid and interesting. Our team just needs an attractive carrier to carry out the next promotion and publicize synthetic biology. So our two teams have cooperated here, OUC-China has provided us with a full set of popular science comics, and we are responsible for promoting comics, we have done the following work:
(1)Use popular science comics to popularize the propaganda;
(2)Use science comics to attract everyone's attention when holding outfields;
(3) Promote comics on the official Weibo of Beijing Normal University.
In the end, OUC-China's popular science comics were well received by everyone, and the official Weibo was read by more than 20,000 people. We believe that this approach greatly enhances the public's awareness of synthetic biology. Their corresponding page can be accessed here"" Team:OUC-China/Collaborations

This year, UESTC-China is committed to converting cellulose to butanol for the purpose of recycling waste paper. However, during the experiment, it was found that the metabolic pathway of butanol and the ethanol metabolic pathway of E. coli antagonized each other, resulting in low yield of butanol. Therefore, it is necessary to knock out the adhE producing ethanol to increase the yield of butanol. Our team happens to have a set of gene knockout crisper cas9 system.

Human Practices
As a team, we strongly believe in the importance of giving back to our local community as a thanks for all that we have received. Here are some ways we have done so:
Foldscope
Completed Foldscopes
In the folding process
Blood cells viewed through the completed Foldscope
Microscopes are near-ubiquitous in science, especially in the field of synthetic biology. Unfortunately, microscopes are very costly and often inaccessible to labs with limited funding. Many labs, especially high school labs, are often greatly hindered in their pursuit of scientific knowledge by lack of this crucial instrument. Enter the Foldscope: an origami based microscope that can be mass produced at very low costs. These microscopes are capable to work as fluorescent, brightfield, and darkfield microscopes. The origami along with the brilliant optical design by Dr. Manu Prakash of Stanford University enables high volume fabrication of microscopes from a few lenses and a sheet of paper. The origami design creates flexure mechanisms that allows the final product to have a flat, compact design. Additionally, the preassembled Foldscope fits neatly on a standard sheet of paper so it can be easily handled. The Foldscope can survive harsh field conditions and still provide various imaging capabilities. This instrument has many applications for a low-cost, portable microscope. Lambert iGEM has incorporated the Foldscope into this year's project by engineering additional capabilities for the current Beta models.  We designed filters to turn the Foldscope into a Fluorescent microscope.  The ability to visualize GFP or other fluorescent proteins would incredibly helpful to other scientists who work in impoverished labs.  To transform the standard Foldscope into a fluorescent microscope, we layered Roscolux filters over a halogen lamp. Although the current magnification or the lens makes visualizing bacteria problematic, we feel this is an interesting to avenue to keep exploring

Genetically modified bacteria which increase soil quality or the nutrient uptake of animals when ingested are just two examples of how synthetic biology could benefit farms, but the prior necessity of antibiotics prohibited their acceptance at places like Grand View. However, we knew that without antibiotics, plasmids could not be maintained within the cell for very long, leading to a highly variable level of expression. We thus made sure to ensure that our Hok-Sok system could not only maintain plasmids, but also ensure a consistent expression level.
Montgomery County Fair
In mid-August, some members visited the Montgomery County (MoCo) Agricultural Fair in order to survey members of the local community. The MoCo Fair is an annual meeting of farmers, artists, and craftsmen. This celebration included carnival rides, pie cooking contests, and many fascinating demonstrations. As part of our human practices effort, we interviewed the various farmers, students, county executives, etc. about their opinions and concerns about using GMOs. In response to our conversation with Grand View Farm, we wanted to better understand the common misconceptions and ethical limitations that our local community associates with bioengineered consumables. Along with our interviews, we also asked people to fill out a survey concerning their opinions on genetic engineering.

2015 East Coast Regional Meetup
This June we hosted a meetup of several iGEM teams from around the Mid-Atlantic region in order to meet other teams in our area. Our plan was to facilitate interlab connections and collaboration, learn from each others' successes and struggles, and gain valuable insights on synthetic biology.
We were grateful to have representatives from the College of William and Mary, the University of Virginia, Duke University, and Rock Ridge High School come and meet us!

Eye Opening Interviews
We visited the Wilmer Eye Institute, a part of Johns Hopkins University, in order to learn about the current conditions of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), its symptoms, and its treatments.
Baltimore, Maryland
We met with a researcher who studies the causes of AMD, Dr. Noriko Esumi. She currently studies the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and how it relates to AMD. After giving her an explanation of what iGEM is and why we were choosing to study lutein production, she told us that, while her experience with lutein itself was limited, she was well informed about retinal health"
KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," to negate the effect of intercellular interactions.    To understand this, we first discretize the Brownian motion term    in the agent’s equation of motion (17).
$$     \sqrt{2 \cdot \mu}\cdot d\vec{W} \rightarrow     \sqrt{2 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t}\cdot \vec{N}(0;1)     \;\;\; \text{(17)}     $$
The details of this discretization scheme goes beyond the scope of this    text and will not be given here.    It can be proven that    this term follows a distribution as (18).
$$     \sqrt{2 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t}\cdot \vec{N}(0;1) \sim     \vec{N}(0;2 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t)     \;\;\; \text{(18)}     $$
Now assume that there    are two A type cells who are exactly $2 \cdot r_0$ apart.    If the timestep    is too large, they might “jump” out of each other’s influence    at the next iteration. This situation is highly unrealistic    because the cells actually should feel each other’s pull while    they randomly drift away from each other. If the timestep is    too large, there’s a high probability that the cells detach    without experiencing the potential at all and therefore the    probability of detachment is artificially inflated.     Of course, we can never completely eliminate the possibility    of a sudden detachment because the random is sampled by a    normal distribution, but we can define a desired probability    of sudden detachment $P^-$. Then, for a given $r_0$,    $r_{cutoff}$ and $\mu$,    we can determine how small the timestep has to be for the    sudden detachment to happen only with probability $P^-$. First,    we assume two A type cells with coordinates $(x_1,y_1)$ and    $(x_2,y_2)$ that are at a distance $2 \cdot r_0 = R_0$    from each other.    We then define the coordinates at the next timestep as    stochastic variables $X_1$, $Y_1$, $X_2$ and $Y_2$, which are distributed    as (19).
$$     X_1 \sim x_1 + \sqrt{2 \cdot \mu \cdot \Delta t}\cdot {N}(0;1) \sim     {N}(x_1;2 \cdot \"

Charity associations
We consulted several local charity associations about the activities they organize for hearing-impaired population. We also expressed our interests and we hope to further our Human Practices after the Jamboree.
We also cooperate with Southern University of Science and Technology Volunteer (SUV), a charity group organized by students in SUSTech. They are now planning to helping with hearing-impaired people.

2. Social Scientific Research
We designed a questionnaire on the internet (link: sojump ) and investigated whether people know about iGEM and their experiences related to hearing-impaired people. We collected about 500 answers. Results showed that most people actually do not have the experiences communicating with hearing-impaired people. However, people were willing to communicate and help with people with hearing loss, which promoted the organization of more activities.
DEATILS
3. Handouts
As we found that most people lack the knowledge about hearing loss and treatment from the results of our questionnaire, we designed, printed and spreaded a handout contains science popularization information about hearing and treatment. This handout introduced how we sense sound, the classification of hearing loss, current treatment, and how to prevent hearing loss.

4. Commonweal organizations cooperation
We contacted some charity organizations which regularly provide lectures and information for the public. We recommended SUV to collaborate with them and create more opportunities for SUSTecher to help people with hearing loss.
In the future, we plan to join these organizations and call for more people to participate. Also, due to the considerable people who showed their interests to learn sign language during our investigation, we will propagandize these charities on our social media constantly.

The problem with gel verification of B and J is the length of B and J which is 12 bp and 35 bp respectively. They are too short to appear on the gel, and it is therefore impossible to whether or not the samples contain the correct sequence of DNA. However, because these are BioBricks, it is assumed the transformed E. coli DH5α cells contain correct plasmids.
The ligation procedure was performed as June 23rd with a few exceptions: (1) increased the volume of ligation mixture, and hence the amount of ligase. This was because it was assumed that the residual activity of PstI-HF could be counteracted by increasing Taq ligase concentration; and (2) created a short time series for ligation, one sample at 42 °C for 20 minutes and another one for one hour. Both ligation times resulted in growth on LB plates with chloramphenicol.

Press on the patch slightly to see if there’s still any leaks, if yes, dry the droplet of water with paper towel and re-iron the corner until there’s no more leaks.
Now the patch is done, trim the sealed sides with scissors to approximately half of the original side dimensions. Round off the sharp corners
Cut a bandage in half, horizontally, then cut it vertically to create 2 small rectangles, with the sides approximately to be twice of the sealed sides of the patch
To put the patch on a finger, remove the liner, put it on and press all edges lightly but firmly until all edges stay down
To reinforce the patch, put the 2 bandage pieces on both sides that go down to the sides of the finger
*Note: A patch with “YES” written on it is on the iron board. It should show you the size of the patch, how clear the seals get, and how I seal the hole. You can ask Tiffany about the process of applying since she had 5 on her fingers today.
*Note 2: This is a pretty reliable method. The seal works great most of the time. Poking more than 1 hole in the patch happens once in awhile. The patch stays on well most of the time. The water will leak when you put on if the seal is not good enough, or if there’s another hole you accidentally poked.

Although the modules have conserved sequences, polymorphisms are found in residues 12 and 13, the “repeat-variable di-residue” (RVD). RVDs are specific for a single nucleotide; therefore, 19.5 repeat units target a specific 20-nucleotide sequence in the DNA (Mussolino & Cathomen, 2012).

When in contact with the DNA, the TALE aligns the N-terminal to C-terminal with the DNA 5’ to 3’ direction. Each repeat has a RVD loop, which is a two alpha helices structure connected by three residues, two of them being RVDs. Although both amino acids 12 and 13 are responsible for base specificity, the TALE-DNA interaction happens through intermolecular bonds between residue 13 and the target base in the major groove. Residue 12 plays a role in stabilizing the RVD loop (Meckler et al., 2013).
Over 20 different RVDs have been identified in TAL effectors. However, four of them appear in 75% of the repeats: HD, NG, NI and NN (Bogdanove et al., 2010). Quantitative analysis of DNA-TALE interactions by Meckler et al.. (2013) revealed that the binding affinity is affected by the RVDs in the following order: NG > HD ~ NN >> NI > NK. NG, specific to thymine, and HD, specific to cytosine, are strong RVDs. NN binds both guanine and adenine, but it prefers guanine. NK also interacts with guanine, but with 103-fold lower affinity. NI is specific for adenine, but it has low affinity when compared to strong RVDs such as NG and HD (Meckler et al., 2013). Although less common, another naturally occurring RVD, NH, was described to bind strongly to guanine (Cong et al., 2013). NS binds to any of the four bases and it is present in naturally occurring TALEs such as AvrBs3 from Xanthomonas campestris (Boch et al., 2009).
In addition to RVDs, the DNA binding affinity is also subject to polarity effects"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the"

A small team comprised of David, Todd, and Rachel worked on the wiki design and implementation. This included coding, scripting, and styling the wiki, as well as designing layouts, templates, and making the carousel on the main page. In particular, Todd scripted the sliding logo in the navigation menu.
Joe, Yemi, and Amy handled the outreach side of the project - a monumental task. Their duties included meeting with various farmers, vets, and any other people involved with bovine TB in our local area and beyond. Their research informed our project and experimental design and proved invaluable to prototype design. In addition, Joe was in charge of creating a video to raise awareness of bovine TB in the local area,  and Yemi was responsible for organizing public events, such as school presentations, to introduce the local community to the potential of synthetic biology.
A lab team composed of Bradley, Emilia, Jasmine, Georgina and Joe tackled the interlab study we volunteered to take part in. This included procedures such as miniprep, ligation, transformation, preparing overnight cultures, digestion, and sequencing.
Joe, Amy, Dan, and Bradley were all very involved in graphic design and produced some high-grade work including the TB infographic (by Amy), the carousel slides (various contributors), and an article (by Joe). Rachel and David contributed to layout design of wiki templates, presentations, and other such documents. Dan made some intricate graphics for the presentation. Georgina and Jasmine designed our Exeter stash for Boston - hoodies and t-shirts.
The presentation material was worked on as a team with some long nights involved! The main design was thought up as a group, building on the work Amy had done in her infographic. The implementation of this design was undertaken by Todd using the Affinity software kindly provided. This included making standard designs for the banner, poster and presentation. Todd and Dan put some hard work into writing our official abstract and title.
Our project involved much collaboration, and various members of our team were in contact with other iGEM teams. Emilia was communicating with the Bielefeld iGEM team by coordinating Skype calls and email exchanges. Dan and Rachel contacted Oxford iGEM to discuss modelling and collaboration. We all attended the UK iGEM meetup hosted by iGEM Westminster , where Bradley, Todd, Dan, and Yemi presented. Joe managed the Exeter iGEM twitter account , (as well as other social media)  which resulted in a group skype of several teams, including iGEM Warwick , iG"

In addition, there is controversy over whether to use drugs on patients with hyperuricemia but without gout symptoms. On the one hand, the clinical endocrine guidelines are very strict and long-term hyperuricemia is bound to damage the body, so medication should be used; But on the other hand, if there is no symptom, it is very difficult for the patient to insist on taking medicine, and the drug is bound to cause certain damage to the body, so it is very difficult to solve this controversy. All of it give us with a very full clinical background, and we found out our project can provide a better solution to the above problems, which gives us great confidence. Because the colonization time of the bacteria is up to two weeks theoretically, it will reduce the number of taking medicine and improve the compliance of patients; Intestinal colonization can also reduce the degree of patient's dietary control, thereby reducing patient’s pain and improving their compliance; In addition, the intestinal colonization of engineering bacteria is different from the medication, it can solve the clinical controversy over whether to use drugs on patients with hyperuricemia but without gout symptoms.
We also inquired into the clinical treatment of refractory gout. Doctors said that there were indeed some clinically refractory gout patients with bad symptoms and even requiring dialysis, which allowed us to find the application objects for dialysis part project.
After that, we briefly introduced two parts of our project - the intestinal part and the dialysis part, and asked the doctors for their advices and suggestions. As for the intestinal part, the doctors agreed that our ideas were novel and feasible. Because the intestinal tract has always been a clinically neglected way to excrete uric acid, and if it is fully utilized, it must be a good method to reduce blood uric acid concentration. As for the dialysis part, there were differences among the teachers' opinions. Some doctors thought that this idea was radical, the effect was unknown, and there may be immune safety problems. The scope of clinical use was too small, it was better to concentrate on the intestinal part of the subject and make it better. There were also some doctors who believed that this was a new therapeutic strategy that was worth trying. It may be a ray of dawn for those patients in serious condition who currently had no treatment methods, but the problems of the safety and effectiveness must be paid attention to. In response to the doctor's feedback, we did a careful job of sorting out and absorbed the valuable suggestions.
Furthermore, some other advice"
