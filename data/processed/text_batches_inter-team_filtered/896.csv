A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.

We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and"

Instrumentation(Biologger)
Having come across the OFP-luciferase fusion, the emission spectra of which appeared sufficiently distinct from that of the normal bacterial luciferase (a fairly distinctive blue), it became clear to the team that this would be a great opportunity for developing our own hardware and software which could be used as part of our kit. The difference in emission spectra could be identified by simple photo-resistors (70kΩ/200kΩ) and coloured theatrical filter gels. The emission spectra of the OFP/luciferase fusion is shown below:
The expected output spectrum of our MOrange/luciferase fusion - Dachuan Ke and Shiao-Chun Tu (2011) DOI:10.1111/j.1751-1097.2011.01001.x
The first experiment to be done was the measurement of the absorbance (actually the inverse of it) of different theatrical filter gels. The target was to differentiate the 560 nm peak to the 490 nm peak. This was accomplished, as it can be seen below, by one blue and one orange filter gel.
The spectral properties of our filters. The different colours represent the different colours of filter.
The second experiment to be done was the testing of the sensor with luciferase-producing E.coli with lux genes, taken from the 2010 Cambridge team. The experiment was conducted by moving the tube containing these bacteria towards and away from our sensor (shown on the right). We also tried to use multiple darkness reference readings at different distances from the tube containing the E.coli sto account for a decrease in darkness value over time (probably as the circuit heated up). It should be noted that the orange and blue filters were swapped for this experiment, as compared to our final design. However, this was acceptable at the time as what we wanted to test was whether our sensor could detect bioluminescence. Therefore, light which consisted primarily of blue frequencies caused a rise instead of drop. For all the other experiments the blue and orange filters were placed in the final order. The results were very encouraging, showing that the sensor was certainly reacting to even that minute amount of light.

Two main differences stand out: the atmosphere of Mars is overwhelmingly composed of CO2, and is much thinner than Earth's (0.6%)
Studies of lichen in Mars conditions suggest, however, that these differences may not be so bad. 3 Photosynthetic activity is not diminished by a reduction to Mars atmospheric pressure (at least within the time frame of days). Furthermore, while Marslike levels of CO2 reduce photosynthetic activity by 60% (while keeping all other conditions within Earth ranges), the reduction to Mars pressure actually improves activity back to levels seen in wholly Earth conditions.
This would suggest that the atmospheric composition and density of Mars, although inhospitable to human survival, are not incompatible to photosynthesis.
Solar irradiance
Mars solar cycle 3_2
A crucial factor to consider is the amount of solar energy available on Mars. Irradiance is a measure  of how much solar radiation reaches a planet from the Sun, and is calculated from the length of the day-night cycle, distance from the Sun, position of orbit, etc. 3_1
Based on this method, solar irradiance at the mean distance between Mars and the Sun reaches a theoretical maximum of 590W/m2 (assuming no distorting effects from the Martian atmosphere).
As a point of comparison, solar irradiance for Earth (measured from satellite instrumentation above the atmosphere) is approximately 1360W/m2 4 . This means that Mars, which is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, receives 43% as much solar radiation per m2.
To achieve a more meaningful measure of irradiance for photosynthesis, however, we have to account for filtering in the atmosphere before solar rays reach the Martian surface.
Particulates in the Martian atmosphere
Dust is a huge part of the Martian environment on a local and global scale! Particulate matter in the atmosphere can have a dramatic impact on the amount of sunlight reaching the Martian surface.  For a vivid example, look at the decreasing visibility in this surface view from the NASA Opportunity rover amidst a brewing dust storm. Were this kind of disruption sustained for too long, any settlement or machine wholly dependent on solar energy would fail.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Microbiology_-_-_TEXT.html," overnight culture is over, we inoculate 100ul of it directly in a 5ml M9 1g/L Quercetin falcon tube in triplicate.
We also make two glycerol stocks: One at -80°C and the other at -20°C (to be reused more easily).
For the assay on quercitin liquid media, we are quantifying Quercetin degradation.
To see if there was a degradation, we need to use a negative and a positive control.
The negative control is just M9 + Quercetin. The positive control is M9 + Quercetin + Pseudomonas Putida.
Indeed, some article show that Pseudomonas is a good candidate for Quercetin degradation. The iGEM Evry team gave us this strain to use it for our assay.
We made an experiment to check how long does pseudomonas needs to degrade Quercetin.
We found that 4 days are enough to see a significant decrease in Quercetin absorbance. But to give a chance to every strains we will assay, we decided to make a 6 days experiment.
Week 12th-18th September
We designed the experiment with a Quercetin quantification at Time 0 and at Time 6 to see the evolution of Quercetin concentration.
We used Pseudomonas Putida K2440 given from Evry as a positive control.
We made two quantifications:
At T0 to make sure that each tube had the same amount of Quercetin.
And at T6 because it’s enough to see a significant decrease in Quercetin concentration if there is a strain able to use it as a carbon source.
All culture were made in triplicate.
To present data, we made a ratio of the absorbance at T6 over the absorbance at T0 for every culture. Then we average the three values. And we are able to calculate the standard deviation.
The values in y axis are a percentage of remaining Quercetin.
Here you can see the T6 sample. We took 100µl from the 5ml culture after vortexing it and we put it in a eppendorf tube. Then we add 900µl of NaOH 0.5mM solution at pH=12.
You can see the difference on each tube depending of the % of Quercetin remaining.
As you can see, none of the strains are able to degrade Quercetin except our positive control.
The issue is that these strains were collected"

Collab Seeker
Even though we had quite a few teams we were in touch with during our project, we found right from the beginning that finding meaningful collaborations wasn’t an easy task: it is difficult, time-consuming and too often fruitless to browse through half the internet to get an idea of what teams are working on. To find out whether this was something that only we struggled with, we built a short questionnaire for teams. We asked how they found their collaboration partners and how they kept in touch with them. 22 out of 23 teams that answered wished for a better way to find teams to collaborate with.  We wanted to do something about this problem, and came up with the idea of Collab Seeker . Collab Seeker is a standard web application that can be used on any platform. Teams looking for collaboration partners can fill in information about their project and easily search for other teams to find out about their projects and their contact information.
Interlab study
We participated in the Interlab Measurement Study arranged by iGEM. The goal of the InterLab study is to obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP from iGEM teams around the world. This will help assess the robustness of parts against different protocols and lab techniques. As the devices are the same, there should be no difference in results between different labs.

1.Summary
Recent research proves, NO-cGMP pathway has important significance to angiocardiopathy's treatment. Target related to the pathway has recently been widely discussed in drug research and development. As members of Modeling team of iGEM in South China University of Technology, we hope to explore NO-cGMP pathway on the aspects of mathematical theory and model.
We analysed the pathway's primary link's situation,including using ODE to analyse the process of NO activating sGC and Michealis Equation to analyse cGMP's synthesis and degradation.
According to the differential equation derived from the theory, we got the relationship between the yield of sGC in different states,the yield of cGMP,  the production and degradation rate of cGMP and time,and the relationship between the yield of bioactive sGC, cGMP and NO by using Matlab programing. In addition, we studied the effect of different feedback inhibition levels of cGMP on the amount of the above, and the relationship was used as the feasible criteria for the study of this pathway.
Due to the limitations of our students' own level, the process of producing PKG in the cGMP can only be based on the experience of the usual mathematical modeling, using the normalized method and Hill Equation for a little analysis.
In order to study the relationship between the amount of cGMP and sGC, we also use Matlab to draw the image of the relationship by using the fitting function, so as to have a more intuitive understanding of the process.
Although scientists are not thorough enough about the study of Lentivirus, the iGEM modeling group still wants to use the existing model to establish a mathematical model to describe the process of gene transfection and combination in cells.
2.Theory
2.1 NO activates sGC
NO activates sGC from substrate state D1 to activated state D2. sGC is a kind of heterodimer whose center is composed of two subunits, which are called the α and β subunits of ferroheme. NO stimulates sGC by combining sGC’s ferroheme(300-700 times). Recent research shows the combining mechanism is involved with two steps: During the first step, NO combines substrate sGC to"

So the equations for the promoters are these:
Figure 7: Promoters' equations
Inducers
With the same method based on law of mass action and binding/unbinding kinetic, we obtain the inducers' equations.
Inducer Equation
Figure 8: Inducers' equations
Repressors
Now, for the repressors, the method is quite similar as before. However, we have to take into account that the proteins have a degradation rate (δ) depending on their nature and the environment. The quantity of protein produced at each time depends on the promoter under control (α).
LacI Equation
We obtain XylR's equation exactly as LacI's.
Figure 9: Repressors' equations
Parameters of the model
For this model, we need at least 12 parameters that characterize the variables and their relationship between each other.  The available values have been measure mainly in an E. coli strain.

Dear iGEM members,
As was discussed in the last meeting, we are going to prepare an article for the newspaper ('Medicus Lap'), and to progress with the Wiki webpage.
For this, it is essential to take an image of all the group together and some images separately, (if one has own image he/she would like to submit it is possible).

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," that while the pathway does not currently exist in the organism, it is possible to convert ergosterol to progesterone. We searched through research articles and found the work of Duport et al.(CITATION??!!) who outlined the possible pathway to convert ergosterol to progesterone using five genes. The first gene is for the enzyme ∆7-sterol reductase (∆7Red), isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, which reduces ergosterol to ergosta-5-enol and ergosta-5,22-dienol (Waterham and Wan- ders, 2000). The next gene encodes for bovine side-chain cleavage cytochrome (P450scc), which converts ergosta-5-enol and ergosta-5,22-dienol to pregnenolone. P450scc requires the assistance of bovine ferredoxin-1 (FDX1) as an electron carrier (Grinberg et al., 2000), and adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) to reduce FDX1. The final gene is type II human 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) that converts pregnenolone to progesterone (Koritz, 1964). See the complete pathway to progesterone biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica below in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Progesterone biosynthesis pathway optimized for use in yeast. Design idea came directly from Duport et al., and genes for enzymes and electron carriers were codon optimized for use in Y. lipolytica.
We found the sequences for each gene from either KEGG or UniProt and codon optimized them for Y. lipolytica using the DNA works system from the High-Performance Computing at the NIH website.
PROMOTER & TERMINATOR
Once we had constructed the pathway we wanted to use, we needed to chose a promoter and terminator. A favorable promoter or terminator is short with high levels of expression. We designed the genes in the biosynthesis pathway to function monocistronically, where each gene possesses its own promoter and terminator.
Promoter
Initially, we considered a galactose-inducible promoter, GAL10, to control the expression of the progesterone gene cassette. However, the presence of glucose represses GAL10 via the MIG1 binding site, and we wanted our yeast strain to be able to produce progesterone when grown on a variety of substrates, including glucose. To use this promoter, we"
Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," use of targeted questions that identified connections between the scientific project and how it could have had an impact on the rest of the world.
What was most interesting about the conversation with Dr Everest is that we realised that we were, almost unknowingly, already implementing the STIR protocol. Clearly the conversation with Dr Everest helped us refine the implementation and ask more structured questions, however we have been trying to create a bond between social and natural world since the very beginning of our project. Our team included members from a social science background as well as natural scientists, and this diversity has helped us to create a multi-dimensional approach that has benefitted the purpose of the project.
In order to implement the STIR protocol in its full potential, we have also reviewed previous implementations of the protocol from previous iGEM teams and noticed how its implementations was mainly tied to the creation of the project idea. Teams in the past have engaged in the approach proposed by the protocol and used it to come up with an idea that complied with the STIR structure and was well-thought in terms of social aspects of the project. However, once a project idea was conceived, several teams have abandoned the STIR protocol structured approach to focus on a closer analysis of the socio-ethical aspects of the project.
This, also according to Dr Everest, might cause the STIR protocol to lose its focus, since it is specifically characterised by a defined structure that should ideally be followed at every stage of the process. For this reason, not only did we implement the STIR protocol when choosing our project idea; but we also continued to adopt the same approach throughout the entire duration of the project, by devolving particular attention to how the ethical and political realm might affect or be affected by our decisions. In this way, we tried to make choices that reflected what could have been realistically feasible and sustainable from a legal, social, and economic point of view.
We believe that the protocol, alongside other social analyses and reflections throughout our project, have helped us to achieve a project that has taken into full consideration several social, political, and economic aspects that will have an impact on our work, and also changed the way our project was conceived since its very inception. We considered the three main variables of the STIR protocol for both creating a project idea, but more importantly, for developing it.
The variables we considered for integration were
Learning and exploring societal dimensions of laboratory technical work
Capacity to anticipate societal dimensions
Bringing in alternative perspectives such as social and public values; ethical concerns; and stakeholder considerations.
For additional information on how we have implemented each of the mentioned variables please have a look at"

Meet-Ups
In this summer, our team attended several meetings organized by other iGEM teams. We have learned a lot from these meetings by interacting with other teams. We are also benefited from exchanging ideas and initiating collaborations during these meetings.  On the other hand, our idea about the synthetic biology platform also synergized with other team’s project.
July 30, 2017：The fifth Asian iGEM Conference
The fifth Asian IGEM Conference was held in National Ciao Tong University in Taiwan in early August this year. Around 15 Mainland teams including our team, together with 20 Taiwan teams, 1 Japan team and 1 US team shared ideas and thoughts with each other, and enjoyed wonderful and unforgettable days in NCTU campus.
This conference held by team NCTU_Formosa was originally an internal meeting between teams in Taiwan, and now it has become an important activity for pan-Pacific iGEM teams. Our team members enrolled in this conference to communicate with other teams with different culture background about our project’s idea and philosophy.
We received several valuable feedbacks about the poster and presentation of our project from other team members and instructors. Those great suggestions turned out to be essential for our later work, mostly for human practice and hardware design. During the conference, we also reached a cooperative intention with team USTC, and we finally made an effective collaboration.
Thoughts were spread, and friendship were made in this 4-day-conference, we also enjoyed fantastic city tours in Hsinchu and Taipei. We would like to extend sincere gratitude to the host, team NCTU, and all the participator of this unforgettable midsummer voyage.

Printemps des sciences
Education engagement: printemps des sciences
March 25th 2018
Alex and Marine, members of both 2017 and 2018 iGEM UCLouvain teams took part in Printemps de Sciences (literally Science Spring). Printemps the Science is a yearly event organized by Sciences.Be ( http://www.sciences.be ).
The aim of this event? Talk about Science and Research to a general public of any age, interested in science but not working or studying in the field!
Ever since the beginning, we focused on making our ideas and project understandable for anybody and this event has been a great rehearsal in preparation for our European Event!
During the event our colleagues talked about BactaSun, last year’s project, and explained to the public what iGEM is and how it can improve the world!
We also briefly talked about our new project, BactWars, that we were already developing and conceiving!

November 2018
Following the Giant Jamboree we will organize some workshops for High School pupils of Lycée Martin V, a public high school based near our campus.
Our colleagues are in contact with Mrs Anne-Catherine Burteau, science teacher, that will take her pupils to our lab where they will be able to try some basic techniques and learn about safety rules!
We are very excited for this upcoming event, that will also allow us to raise awareness about our project among these young students

The Open Hardware Revolution
In choosing the novel Hardware Track, this years’ Cambridge-JIC iGEM team has come across unexpected challenges. Unsurprisingly perhaps, these have often required us to look into fields of work that we have had little or no previous experience in. This has been particularly true when navigating the world of intellectual property law, including hardware licensing and design copyright. In developing Open Source Hardware (OSH) as part of the competition, we recognised the need for an easily-digestible, comprehensive and hardware-specific guide to ensuring the OSH is accessible to the community.
As part of our human practices effort, we have developed an online tool to guide future iGEM teams through the thought process required when deciding on a license for their own hardware project. We have covered the major license types, and provided information about their key features.
If you’re having trouble understanding the legal or technical jargon, check out the Glossary of Terms . An offline version of this page is also available in PDF form for you to download.
Want to find out more about OSH licensing? Answer the questions below to find out what would be most appropriate for your project.
Please note that this page is not intended as a legal guide, and the authors are not IP-law experts. For legal advice, seek a trained professional. In addition, this page does not cover all licensing options available and is merely a summary of the key elements.

Open Source Hardware
The Cambridge-JIC team is looking to make our product as accessible as possible. This means making our microscope open-source. According to the Open-Source Hardware Association (OSHWA), this means it “is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design” [1]. This not only requires well-documented procedures but also clear and simple designs that can be modified by non"

Collaboration with the Freiburg_Bioware team
Since our university has two teams participating at iGEM this year
our collaboration partner was quickly found. The Bioware team asked us to help them make a sponsoring Website to collect funds for our two projects. Over the time we got to know the members of the Bioware team, because we were working in the same place: While the Bioware team worked in a lab we were sitting in the associated kitchen and common room working on our code.
We got to be friends and hang out together in the evenings. Free time activities were e.g. the canoeing tour on the river Rhine or the BBQ on the top of the biology building.
Since the Bioware team took care about the sponsoring and organized the journey to iGME for both of our teams, they spared our small team a lot of work and we could concentrate better on our work.
When the complexity of the project became bigger, we needed help from potential users. The Bioware team answered all our questions and gave us proposals to improve the program outputs.
The primer designer program
In the summer the Bioware theam asked us to create a program for primer design. Until then they were using a spread-sheet calculation program to find primers for their PCRs, although the process can be automated. The primerdesign program made this task much easier for them. Furthermore a primer designer robot seemed like the perfect candidate for our growing set of add-on robots and so both our teams profited from this collaboration. Read their part of the story on their wiki !

Combining modeling and experimentation in iGEM
Introduction
Mathematical modeling is a key component of synthetic biology, serving as a crucial link between the idea and realization of an engineered biological system. In our project, modeling played a central role in 1) helping us focus our bioengineering efforts on the rate-limiting steps of our synthetic metabolic propane pathway and 2) giving us useful predictions on whether our concepts could work.
As is often the case with interdisciplinary work, cooperation between modelers and biologists is not always easy, a problem that has also been identified by other iGEM teams such as Grenoble 2011 . We faced this challenge in our project, too. If we had understood the potential pitfalls and known good practices of this cooperation, we would have saved a lot of time and been able to achieve more in our project. It has even been said that the development of synthetic biology depends on sociology, reflecting the necessity of creating an environment where scientists with different expertises can effectively work as a team.
Whereas interdisciplinary cooperation has previously been studied in professional research environments, iGEM offers a unique possibility to study how students perceive and approach the challenges of interdisciplinary work. To specifically study the relationship of mathematical modeling and laboratory work in iGEM teams"

ZJU-China
In the NCTU Conference, we found that our idea is somehow similar to ZJU-China. Both of us are making use of some toxin, yet we designed our projects in a different way. Therefore, two teams went through a heated discussion during the conference. They suggested us to add the regulating mechanism to the process of synthesizing attractant and toxin, and they helped us with modeling as well. As for us, we proposed a way of improving their efficiency by adding attractant. After the conference, we still kept touch online, and we maintained partnership as to equipment and experiments. They even offered us the original biobrick and the data of toxin to expand our database. Anyway, we really appreciate everything they did to help us with building our bi-directional transcription system.

Voluntary & Scientific Publicity
WeChat public platform
In order to inform the public of latest state of our project at first time and help them learn our program much more conveniently, we set up a public platform of BNU-iGEM.
WeChat is a very popular social app in China. You can apply for a public account in the name of group and publish some of the contents on the platform regularly. Users of the weChat just need to follow our account to accept our RSS. This app is widely used in diverse age groups. So we took advantage of popularity of weChat in China, and to satisfy our needs of the external publicity of our project with this app. Finally we presented our public platform of weChat. From this platform, we published the presentations of iGEM, the progress of our projects, the processing of our human practice project, the public science popularization scientific article and many other content regularly.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," offers bee products for health and beauty purposes, his company also provides apitherapy treatments, complementing them with Bach flowers, Schuessler salts and homeopathy.
As we were speaking with him about our project, he mentioned the importance of the Varroa mite, a parasite that sucks the hemolymph of bees, the equivalent to blood in this arthropods, weakening their immune system and making them susceptible to other diseases. He ensured that enhancing the natural defenses of bees would have a positive response since healthy bees are a lot less susceptible to diseases.
He mentioned the Varroa mite as part of the named “colony collapse disorder”, baptized by this name in the US, and described it to be a phenomenon where bees leave their beehives. Perhaps he announced foulbrood are not a current problem in his state, Varroa is, so he recommends us to expand our horizons to consider our product as a product that can also be applied when there is the presence of Varroa.
“If the bees are strong they can’t get sick, but how will they be strong if there are not enough flowers?” He mentioned urbanization is a problem bees are facing directly, and they are dying because of it. As flowering and bee population lower, he went from collecting a bucket of honey per box to a bucket every 40 boxes.
He said the actual treatments for American foulbrood are formic acid, oxalic acid, thymol (thyme),  among  others  treatments  
that don’t pollute the environment. Previously, fluvalinates were used to treat this diseases, however, they stopped using them since they are carcinogenic and pollute the environment. The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Spanish: SAGARPA) is the governmental institution responsible of inspecting their hives, it allows under certain requirements the use of antibiotics for treating foulbrood but has to avoid products that pollute the environment and honey. He also shared with us the treatment he uses to fight Varroa which consists in an essential oils mix and stressed it is important not to use the same treatment for a long time since the pathogen can develop a resistance towards it.
We asked him if he could share with us certain regulations or standards that had to be followed to ensure the honey’s quality,  he mentioned the ""Good livestock practices"".Discussing other issues affecting beekeeping in his state, another serious problem in Queretaro is bee theft, as beekeepers visit their bees every 8 or "

As predicted, a lower exponent value requires more summation terms. At 0, the lowest possible value, n was significant (as defined by us) up to 317. This value was used in all of our codes .
Experiment
Our td was discovered experimentally with the help of team UAlberta. They timed the hours it takes for a bee to get rid of said peptide.
The limitation that calculating D provides is clear. This coefficient is an interaction between the drug and its polymer coating, along with the solvent. To overcome this, we have to experimentally evaluate the drug’s release mechanism and pick the best-fit line.
We must do this under two conditions: one simulating hemolymph and another for jelly. For this, we have to prepare two buffer solution at these pH ranges, and kept them at the desired temperature, as established below.

Our friends at Tec-Monterrey kindly wrote a protocol for encapsulating our peptides in PLGA 50:50 (51 kDa) coated with Chitosan (which you can find along with our protocols ). We could periodically test the amount released over a period of time in the buffer solutions.
The best fit line for each case lets us figure out the diffusion coefficient for these conditions (a code for this purpose is presented at the bottom of this page ).
Once we have the diffusion coefficients, we substitute them in the equation system we developed. We input them into modeling software to find the behavior of diffusion through both environments (find this code at the bottom of this page ).
Limitations to our approach
There are several challenges regarding this experimental approach. Here we present them in an upfront manner, and explain what is to be done:
Since the initial burst is also determined by drug concentration, once we find the diffusion"
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Switch_-_-_TEXT.html,"5: Inducing the system
Now that we are able to keep the switch in each state stable, we also need a means to be able to change the state of the switch at will. To do so we introduce two input plasmids illustrated in Figure9. The plasmids contain the anti-terminators and anti-repressors of each state respectively, in front of two different inducible promoters.
Figure 9: Input plasmid containing your favourite inducible promoter, the anti-terminator corresponding to one half switch and the anti- repressor corresponding to the other half switch.
When the plasmid corresponding to state 1 is induced, the switch is forced into state 1. This happens because the state’ s antiterminator and antirepressor are produced. The antirepressor inactivates state 2’ s repressor, resulting in increased transcription through state 1. At the same time, the antiterminator allows transcription to continue past state 1’ s terminator, where the genes for the same anti-repressor and anti-terminator are located. Thus, with a sufficient amount of induction, the switch will have switched states.
Applications
If successfully engineered, this new technological tool could advance methods used in many different fields of biological science, such as environmental engineering, food applications and medico technology. A few suggestions of such advances are listed below.
In manufacturing, it could be applied as a cheap proofreading or control mechanism in production plants. In such a case, the product can be made to change colors when exposed to the right or wrong treatment or even an unwanted biological infection or compound.
In manufacturing or environmental technology, it could be used for error or leakage tracking in process plants or out in the environment. The product can act as biosensor for compounds that are difficult to measure.
In food control, a small piece of tape containing the modified organism could be placed on food packaging to ensure that the food product has not been exposed to undesired conditions such as high temperatures or hazardous compounds. This would allow for easier control of food conditions.
In medical application, an organism containing our switch could be ingested and thereafter be tested to see if the organism experienced a certain drug, or condition on the way through the intestinal track.
In molecular or medical science, it could be used to investigate chemotaxis and biofilm formation. This can be achieved by exposing a biological matrix to different light sources, there will be developed layers in the matrix and movements and development can be tracked, in relation to the two different exposures and the time between them.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

These results clearly show that expression of PtNTT2 leads to a reduced final cell density and slower growth. Furthermore, the different variants of PtNTT2 differ highly, indicating that some variants of PtNTT2 negatively affect the growth rate and final cell density.
Microcultivations of the Different PtNTT2 Variants
Due to the high price of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates, performing experiments such as cultivations in a small volume is desirable. Therefore, we validated whether cultivations in micro well plates can achieved the same results as cultivations performed in shake flasks and optimized the method [LINK]. The optimal conditions for cultivations in a small volume were determined as follows: 12 well plates with a cultivation volume of 1 mL, 37 °C and 600 rpm. To analyze the growth of the differentPtNTT2 variants in a micro cultivation, the shake flask cultivation was repeated in a 12 well plate. All cultures were inoculated with an OD600 of 0.1. Three biological replicates of each strain were tested and three technical replicates were measured at each time point. The results are shown in figure (5).

Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is"

Presentation
The workshop we prepared consists of a presentation, some exercises with 'BioBricks' we designed and an experiment at the end. You can find the presentation in Dutch and in English and our text in Dutch.
We gave a short introduction about DNA and its biochemistry. We designed a 3D-printed bacterial model, to introduce the students to bacteria and which ones we use in the lab. This model was printed by Fablab and consists of 3 layers. Inside, there is a representation of the cytoplasm, the plasmid and the bacterial genome.
After this introduction we came to the main part of our workshop: explaining what synthetic biology and its applications are. As an example, we discussed the development of modified yeast that can produce artemisinin to treat malaria. Subsequently, we presented our project (E. coligy: Plants with BanAphids) by illustrating the mechanisms and properties of our BanAphids. We found it important to discuss with the next-generation scientists the ethical and social implications of synthetic biology in general, as well as in our project.
Exercises
After the presentation, we gave the students two exercises about building new systems with plastic puzzle pieces. We made promotors, genes, regulators and proteins out of plexiglas in different colours.
First they had to make a biosensor system developed by the iGEM team of Groningen in 2009. The biosensor can detect arsenic and the bacteria can absorb this arsenic out of the water. To do this, they used an arsenic inducible promotor, followed by a gene encoding for a protein that helps with the production of hydrogen.
In the second exercise, we used our ED Frosti model circuit (iGEM project of KU Leuven 2011). ED Frosti can defrost ice and freeze water. We made a simplified system of ED Frosti, consisting of two activators, three promotors, four genes and a feedback-loop.
Experiment
The experiment proves that gene expression can be inducible so bacteria can adapt to different circumstances. If there’s lactose in the environment, E. coli will produce β-galactosidase to hydrolyse the lactose. When there’s"

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#fluid medium 1_-_-_TEXT.html," [Fig. 2], we can find C4HSL can specifically bind to RhlR and then the complex bind to Prhl so that TetR can be expressed. Then TetR can bind to Plux/tet and inhibit the expression of LacI.
By this circuit, we can see that even though C4HSL-RhlR can stimulate expression of LacI by binding to Plux/tet directly, its stimulation of TetR at the same time can counteract this effect and so warrior 1 won't response to C4HSL secreted by himself.
III Evaluation of orthogonality by model
Like in the orthogonality test of experiment part, gene circuit of two warriors is orthometric when the AHL molecules secreted by warrior I can just activate the promoter inside warrior II, but cannot activate the promoter inside itself and vice versa. Also, we use RFP intensity to indicate the level of LacI inside cell.
Therefore, we can know the orthogonality by looking at the change of warrior I's intensity as time with or without warrior II. (Because warrior II can just respond to C4HSL according to the experiment results, so it is accord with the orthogonality requirement and we do not consider response of warrior II)
IV ODE, parameters and its resource
V Original Parameter set of the model
TsinghuaA-Orthogonality_ODE.pdf
VI Results of model
1. Results under original parameter sets:
As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the response of the warrior. So from this original parameter set and result, we can see that there is no distinguish between the response of warrior I without with warrior II, so orthogonality is not good. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has high amount of LacI even without warrior II and thus almost no CmR. So it has no resistance to chloramphenicol and will be killed by itself.
But how could this happen? Intuitively, we may hypothesize that TetR actually not inhibit the expression successfully when its expression is activated by C4HSL-RhlR. So we may solve this problem by increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl of TetR in warrior I.

(Calcium influx due to depolarization of cell membrane was induced by different concentration of KCl. Different volume of KCl was added by drops into cell culture wells to reach the different final concentrations of KCl (control, 12.5mM, 50mM, 200mM, respectively) at 40s. Fluorescence intensity over time is shown as signal per pixel (the initial intensity has been subtracteed and normalized). 0 mM control, 12.5 mM, 50 mM, 200 mM.)
There was no distinct fluorescent increase at 12.5mM KCl compared with the control group. Cells under 50mM and 200mM KCl both displayed higher fluorescence. Besides, the fluorescence of cells at 200mM was higher than cell at 50mM along with oscillation. It was proved quantitatively that R-GECO could be excited by KCl-induced calcium influx.

To further validate our cells, we use ionomycin as another positive control for calcium influx. Ionomycin was dropped on one side of the culture well, the direction of fluorescence gradient (shown in the movie) was consistent with the direction of ionomycin diffusion.
3. Piezo1 and TRPC5 Sensitivity Measurement
We designed two experiments to quantitatively examine the sensibility of Piezo1 and TRPC5. Microfluidics and hypoosmolarity were employed to exert shear force and tension on our transgenic CHO-K1 cells’ membrane separately.
Hypoosmolarity
Calcium influx induced by hypoosmolarity was indicated by fluorescence intensity increase of R-GECO. CHO-K1 cells with Piezo1 (Fig.4a) were much more sensitive to hypoosmolarity. The peak values of R-GECO+Piezo1 increased as osmolarity decreased. And there were distinct oscillations of fluorescence when osmolarity was below 70%. However, fluorescence of cells with R-GECO (Fig. 4b) only showed obvious increase and oscillation when the osmolarity was 60%, whose intensity was a lot less than R-GECO+Piezo1 (Fig. 4"

3. Determination of immobilized β2-MG concentration
As a result, the results show that the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell becomes                             gradually bright with the increase of the concentration of fixed β2-MG under                             other conditions unchanged. Therefore, we can determine the change trend of the brightness                             of the liquid crystal. The concentration of β2-MG increases in the same trend.                             The relationship between the luminance of liquid crystal and the concentration of                             β2-MG can be established, and then determine the corresponding concentration of β2-MG                             according to the luminance of liquid crystal, so as to achieve the purpose of quantitative                             detection. Due to the need of the experiment, the maximum immobilized β2-MG                             concentration of 500 ng/mL is selected to be fixed on the substrate surface, which can keep                             the optical imaging background dark.
Determination of the concentration of β2-MG nano antibody
1. Screening criteria for the concentration of β2-MG nano-antibody
The influence of the concentration of the nano-antibody on the optical imaging of the liquid                             crystal cell was further investigated. If we don’t add β2-MG in the sample, there                             will has color spots in the polarizing microscope imaging. When the concentration of the                             nano-antibody in the sample was low, only a few bright spots approached the full black                             background. In the subsequent detection, the substrate immobilized β2-MG will                             compete with the tested sample β2-MG to bind the limited reaction sites on the                             β2-MG nano-antibody. When the concentration of the tested β2-MG                             approaches zero (detection limit is infinitely low), the β2-MG nano-antibody will                             combine with the substrate immobilized β2-MG to disturb the orientation of the                             liquid crystal molecule to the maximum extent, resulting in the optical imaging of the                             liquid crystal cell. With the increase of the concentration of β2-MG, the binding                             of β2-MG nano-antibody to the substrate immobilized β2-MG decreases,                             and the optical imaging becomes dark from, thus completing the detection of β2-MG.

School Project Interview with 6th Graders
Following the Danish Science Festival, we were contacted by two enthusiastic 6th graders, Bastian and Magnus. The two boys wanted to learn more about iGEM and GMO, which they intended to write about in a school project. They were curious to what range GMO could be used, and how we utilised it in our project, the PowerLeaf.
UNF Summer Camp
The UNF Summer Camp is an opportunity for high school students to show extra dedication towards science. We talked to some of the brightest young minds imaginable, all of whom aim to work in different fields of science in the future. At the summer camp, we held a presentation about our project, the iGEM competition, as well as how to handle and work with genes. We taught them how to assemble BioBricks and provided them with BioBricks for DNA assembly experiments, creating a ‘hands-on’ experience for these enthusiastic teenagers.
One of the high school students suggested that the Powerleaf should be able to rotate according to the sun, to ensure maximum exposure and outcome. We took this brilliant advice into consideration and contacted Robot Systems Engineer student, Oliver Klinggaard, who helped us with the potential implementation of a pan/tilt system. He provided us with his recent project report on the subject, as well as a description of the adjustments required for the implementation in our system, which you can find here .
Two students from the UNF Summer Camp thought the PowerLeaf was an interesting approach to sustainable energy, and they wanted to hear even more! So, they contacted us in late October, as they were interested to work on a project about green technology.
The Academy for Talented Youth
We hosted a workshop for the Academy for Talented Youth, an association for some of the most talented high school students in Denmark. During the workshop we invited the students into our laboratories, where they conducted a miniprep and a gel electrophoresis on bacteria containing our BioBricks. Additionally, we held a presentation and discussion about our project, with the dedicated students. We strongly believe in mutual communication and made sure to compile feedback, all of which was positive!
Presentations for the Local Schools
The local high schools, Mulernes Legatskole and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium, invited us to present our project, in addition to starting discussions with the students about GMO.

This allows Clotho to export unstandardized data to files understood by the community, or to simply take in unstandardized data, manipulate it under a standardized frame, and check in the edited information back to the unstandardized database. The figure to the right illustrates this. This allows Clotho to be many things to many different designers. One can use Clotho as a scheme to import data to new or existing repositories thus allowing the rapid distribution of data, or users may create their own lab environments and use Clotho to help maintain a consistent lab database.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#VeronicaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," took a field trip to Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge. The Microsoft building was very interesting - while everything was simple and clean, the colors of the interior made for an environment that was both inspiring and peaceful. After viewing parts of the building, two Microsoft employees sat down with us to chat about Windows 8 and our project. They started with a demo of the new Windows 8 operating system on the new Microsoft tablet. Its first unique feature was the picture password to log in - instead of choosing a numerical password, the user could choose a photo and tap a particular pattern on the photo (i.e. connecting certain faces or going around specific objects) to log in. The next component of the operating system was the main user interface; Windows 8 uses a metro user-interface that displays icons in titled groups. It includes a semantic zoom feature, which allows users to display either the groups, as a big picture, or each group specifically, by pinching the screen. Windows 8 also connects users by enabling users to log in to several social media networks at once and displaying all of the contacts' statuses and photos in one place. Furthermore, the touch-based gestures all follow a different logic - for example, swiping from the right displays a charms menu, swiping from the left switches the application, and swiping down brings up additional menus. I found that the gestures made the tablet fairly difficult to navigate at first, as it took some time and practice to get used to all the various gestures. After watching the Windows 8 demo, we learned about developing metro-style apps through Visual Studio 11 and Blend for Visual Studio. It was similar to Xcode in the way that the developer could drag objects into the view and write code for more detailed functionality. Ultimately, the most important thing I learned was the semantic zoom feature of the Windows 8 OS - since my team is researching semantic search and semantic zoom, it was encouraging to see how easily semantic zoom could be integrated into the apps. Semantic zoom would allow the users to view the provided information at a glance without scrolling through all of the information. Overall, it was a very productive day.

In a contaminated environment, microorganisms such as bacteria are able to use its contaminated inorganic matter for oxi-reduction reaction, metabolizing it. This specific and complex system is part of bacteria survival mechanism that became resistant to contamination. The generated products released by bacterial metabolism are typically less toxic form of the initial pollutant. Through this, bioremediation arose: environmental problems solved by biological organisms.
Mer operon is a unique adaptattie strategy to environments contaminated by heavy metals, characterized by conversion of methylmercury to its volatile and less toxical form, elemental mercury, through a catalytic pathway, orchestrated by diverse enzymes and proteins.
Mer Operon is composed by MerA, MerB, MerP, MerT, MerD, MerF, MerC, and others. Wwe selected five genes to construct a functional and efficient Operon, codifying the proteins schematizated and described below:
(1) MerP and (2) MerT transporter proteins which carry mercury ion from periplasm to inner membrane and, then, to cytoplasm, respectively.
(3) MerA, mercuric ion reductase, responsible for reducing mercury from Hg(II) to Hg(0), its volatile and less toxical form.
(4) MerB, organomercurial lyase, catalyzes the break of binding between organical radicals and mercury, releasing Hg(II).
(5) MerR, regulatory protein. In absence of mercury, it binds at Operon’s promoter (MerO) and blocks RNA polymerase recognition, so there is no transcription of operon genes.
Want to know more about each protein? Click on it and have fun!
MerA
MerA integrates Mer Operon, a molecular mechanism that confers mercury  resistance to bacteria and has potential to become an applicable and efficient  tool to bioremediate mercury polluted environments. MerA codifies the cytosolic  enzyme mercuric ion reductase, and it is the core of mercury resistance  mechanism: this enzyme catalyses the reduction of ionic mercury [Hg(II)] to it’s  volatile, non-toxical and less reactive elemental form (Hg0), which flows  passively through membrane to outer side.

Newcastle,2016,Team:Newcastle#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," sequences used sourced from places other than the iGEM registry?
We answered these for all of our constructs and found the only construct that needed further risk assessment was our controlled OrpF expression device (BBa_K1895005) . This is because that part contains a coding sequence, OrpF, from a risk group 2 organism (Pseudomonas fluorescens). To assess this risk we identified a number of ‘mitigating factors’ that would minimise the risk posed by using this sequence.
The protein we are dealing with is well characterised.
The protein does not play a role in toxicity or virulence.
The protein will only be produced at high levels in growth media containing L-arabinose.
Based on these, we believe that the risk from using this sequence is negligible and so continued with this design. Had we not identified any mitigating factors we would have sought to use an alternative porin from a safer organism. We discuss the further steps we took to minimise the risk when working with this organism in the section on safe lab work.
The other main risk we identified for our project is physical containment failure. In order to assess this risk, we need to know both the consequence and likelihood of the risk occurring. It can then be assigned a risk category using a risk assessment matrix.
Figure 1: The risk matrix we use to assess the risks in our project.
The Paris Bettencourt 2012 iGEM team have shown how the likelihood of a physical containment failure can be estimated . If our physical containment fails then E. coli will be able to enter the environment, from a risk perspective this is a ‘failure’ regardless of the rate or amount of bacteria that leak. Therefore for us, the likelihood of a physical failure is related to the chance of our microfluidics chambers leaking. In our experiments measuring the temperature effects in the chamber we found that 1 in 10 chambers failed in use. This is a high chance of failure which we are working to mitigate using alternative materials in the construction of our chambers (plastic rather than PDMS).
The effect of a physical containment failure is low, the volumes of E. coli (0.1ml) involved are easily contained in the laboratory (which is where we intend our devices to be used) and the cells can be lysed with 70% ethanol. This results in an overall risk of ‘medium/low’ at this time. However, in the future, we hope that our system might be taken out of the lab. For this reason, we further investigated ways in which we could improve the safety of our system.

Methods
After studying the pDusk and pDawn system, we constructed a parameter estimation procedure by picking random parameter sets based on the latin hypercubeLatin hypercube sampling is a statistical method to sample the parameter space equally. It divides the parameter space according to the number of parameters and sample size and picks a random number from each parameter subspace. sampling (LHS) method in Matlab 2015b (used for the whole study). We simulated 10,000 parameter sets and assumed the initial conditions of only yDD and ja being in the on state, i.e. we assigned the value one. All other initial conditions were kept at zero. In addition, we needed to transform those parameters to a more biologically feasible distribution, as LHS generates uniformly distributed parameters. For those parameters where there was no information available, we assumed a lognormal distribution that is representative of measured biological rates 7 . We transformed the two parameters, k2 and k3, for which experimental data was available according to their known distribution. We then loaded the RFP response data ± standard deviation from Ohlendorf et al. 1 for both pDusk and pDawn and transformed the light intensities from

We then simulated both systems according to our ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the same parameter sets, and stored the response at 17 hours for later evaluation in the scoring function. We simulated the system for 17 hours, as this is the duration Ohlendorf et al. 1 used in their study. For the next step, we normalized the computed RFPp response with the measured response at the highest light intensity used by Ohlendorf et al 1 .

Competence is achieved during the exponential growth stage of pneumococcal culture by the secretion of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), which is a 17-     residue long pheromone that is species-specific. Our team aims to adopt the specific CSP sensing mechanism of S. pneumoniae to detect its populations.
The mechanism we adopted is controlled by a two-component regulatory system (TCS), which consists of the histidine kinase (HK) ComD and its      cognate response regulator (RR) ComE ( BBa_K1379051 ).  When CSP binds to it, ComD autophosphorylates to become phospho-ComD, ComD~P; at the expenditure of ATP.      The cytosolic protein ComE is then phosphorylated by ComD~P through transphosphorylation reactions, producing ComE~P. Genes coding for ComD and ComE are constitutively      expressed in our Pneumosensor.
ComE~P binds to repeat sites adjacent to the comCDE and comAB operons (Ween et al., 1999), creating a positive      feedback loop, producing both pre-CSP and its required machinery for maturation and transport. The signal is thus amplified and competence is      coordinated throughout the population.
As part of our detection circuit design, we make use of the inducible promoter from the comCDE operon, PcomCDE. We obtain the sequence by oligos,      and will characterize it using green fluorescence protein (GFP) that we constructed the downstream of the promoter by BioBrick RFC10. Rather than using ComE~P that has to     be phosphorylated by ComD~P, which involves a chain of reactions, we use a phosphorylmimetic ComE mutant, ComED58E, kindly     shared with us by Bernard Martin et al. After characterization of PcomCDE, we hope to put PcomCDE together with the S. pneumoniae σx promoters module, for the ultimate goal of creating a tightly regulated automatic detection of S. pneumoniae.

With Mayor Eisenberger’s help, we arranged a meeting with Dr. Richardson and Mr. Walker with the intention of further integrating McMaster iGEM with the City of Hamilton and its healthcare communities. The preparation for this meeting involved an inter-subteam assessment of the future of McMaster iGEM, and how to commit to projects which will truly benefit our city. We had the opportunity to discuss upcoming initiatives within Hamilton’s Public Health sector, and our interviewees’ own goals in the execution of these projects.
An issue we discussed in depth was the recent spike of Legionnaires’ disease which occurred in Hamilton and the Greater Toronto Area over the past summer. Mr. Walker expressed that the largest obstacle in combating Legionella bacteria was the difficulty researchers face in tracking the source of the infection, since the bacteria exists in warm water sources and airborne mists. The current diagnostic method involves a urine antigen test which, although providing a sufficient diagnosis, does not give any hint to where an individual contracted the disease. Legionnaire’s struck our team as an intricate and pressing issue, with the potential for synthetic biology application in both diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.
Other prevalent issues we discussed within Hamilton’s healthcare system include:
Lyme disease from tick bites
Tobacco consumption and smoking in youth
Sexually transmitted infections and antibiotic delivery for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia
Opioids and safe injection sites
Mental health determinants
We recognise the potential of mGEM’s future projects to connect with the City of Hamilton’s public health sector, and for our Human Practices and Outreach teams to provide support to their own campaigns. This meeting was invaluable for our careful consideration of the future of McMaster iGEM as a community-integrated, education-based research team.

Then, Mr. Lan and Ms. Chen briefly talked about the daily operation of the SECA. Additional to the modulation of the membership industrial companies that resulted in a series of collaborations, socially popularizing and promoting the idea of energy conservation was also one of their core objectives. Through their efforts, they were looking for a gradual improvement of social awareness of the energy issues, especially among the young age group. Annually, a variety of theme activities were held by the SECA to achieve the goal. Every year, there is an Energy Awareness Week took place in Shanghai where the representative industrial delegates were invited to introduce their cutting edge energy technologies to the public, in communities, schools, or exhibitions. Mr. Lan warmly welcomed and invited our team to participate in the next year’s theme week. We were so much sure that this special chance would be an awesome opportunity for our team to not only further socialize and industrialize the project, but also integrate our own efforts into real social needs.
Finally, Mr. Lan. And Ms. Chen again emphasized the creativity and huge potential of our project from an industrial aspect. They encouraged us to modulate in details and step further. They were willing to provide any necessary assistance from the industrial community.

Interview with Professor Qixi Mi
We met Professor Mi (Qixi Mi), assistant professor from the school of physical science and technology at ShanghaiTech University. Prof. Mi earned his B.S. degree from Peking University in applied chemistry in 2003 and his Ph.D. degree from Northwestern University in chemistry in 2009. Later he performed postdoctoral research on new souse energy at California Institute of Technology, taking advantage of a fellowship of the NSF Center for Chemical Innovation (CCI Solar), and then briefly at the Argonne–Northwestern Solar Energy Research (ANSER) Center.
Firstly, team delegation asked about the reasons that guided Pro. Mi to devote himself to the energy research field. As Pro. Mi responded, without any doubt, the energy issue was one of the biggest global challenges we mankind were facing and urgently needed to be solved. The significance of the relevant researches and studies were emphasized in terms of the sustainable development for the whole industry, because the energy source was the very fundamental matters of all sorts of industrial productions. Then, speaking of the possible solutions to the energy issue, Pro. Mi emphasized the importance of the utilization of the solar energy for the sun was the ultimate way that we human beings could get sustainable source of energy. As he further stated,"

Background
The mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak in British Columbia (B.C), Canada, is the largest and most widespread of its kind in North America, and has reached an unprecedented level since 1995. To date, this epidemic has killed millions of acres of lodgepole pine trees, endangering the forest health, which hosts a wide range of ecosystems, and threatening the economic, social, and cultural stability of our beautiful province. Currently, the area of most intensive outbreak is situated in the interior of British Columbia and is predicted to spread outwards to the rest of the province and to the bordering province of Alberta. And by 2013, according to the B.C Ministry of Forests and Range, mortality of all merchantable pine trees is projected to be as high as 80 percent.
This mountain pine beetle, native to B.C, affects pine trees by laying their eggs under the bark of the tree. However, the culprit responsible is not merely the beetle itself, rather the blue stain fungus (Grosmannia clavigera) which lives in symbiosis with the MPB, also plays a key role in the infestation. By laying their eggs, the beetles simultaneously introduce the blue stain fungus into the sapwood, which helps prevent the tree’s natural defences, a resin flow, from repelling and killing attacking beetles. Due to this action, both the beetle and fungus are able to overcome the tree’s defences and colonize the insides of the tree through this dual action. Through this, the fungus cuts off water and nutrient transport within the tree, while beetle larvae feed off the tree. Within a year, the pine tree will die from lack of water and nutrient transport, as its needles will turn red. Mature MPB will leave the dying tree and move on to the next host tree. And in the upcoming years following the attack, the tree will turn gray with very"

The circuitry is fairly simple and easily adjusted to meet the needs of different iGEM teams, simplify repairs or replacement of parts by the user, and expand to greater detection capabilities.
Solar Power
We created a small solar array to charge the 9V battery powering the hardware. This was requested as a more reliable way for farmers to have access to the power needed to operate our hardware. The solar array trickle charges the 9V battery over 8-10 hrs. by producing a maximum voltage of 12V and 13.38 mA. The voltage needs to be larger than 9V to charge the battery and in direct sunlight the solar array easily reaches 11V through a window. The amperage is large enough to charge the battery at between 13-14mA and smaller than 1/10 the battery capacity of 175mAh so not to damage the battery."

We tested our lead sensor with sfGFP as reporter gene to verify the functionality of the system. Subsequently, we tested different lead concentrations. The kinetic of our sensors response to different lead concentrations is shown in figure 3. The first 40 hours show a strong increase in fluorescence. After that the increase in fluorescence reaches a plateau. For better visualization the kinetics of figure 3 are represented as bars in figure 4. A fluorescence level difference for 60 min, 150 min and 650 min is represented.
The results of the lead sensor show no significant differences between the different concentrations (figure 3). This might be due to the pbrAP’s weak promoter strength in E. coli. Further reasons are most likely in the weak repressor binding to its operator.   So, we suggest for the usage of this sensor, it has to be optimized. Moreover we were lacking time for further in vivo characterizations and different experimental setups. Hence, we did not use this sensor in further experiments regarding Cell-free-Protein-synthesis (CFPS). . In the future a characterization in the CFPS systems would be desirable.
To summarize
Our lead sensor was characterized in vivo only. The differences between inductions with various lead concentrations are really slight therefore this sensor needs further optimization which was not possible in this limited time. But as there is a fluorescence response to lead this sensor has the potential work as expected. In the future a characterization in CFPS systems would be interesting.

Mercury
The main sources of mercury exposure are generated through humans. For example mercury contamination can be caused by medical waste (damaged measurement instruments), Fluorescent-lamps, Chloralkali plants and thermal power plants. In the environment, mercury is one of the most toxic elements . Acute effects of a mercury intoxication can range from diseases of the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, to neuromuscular and neurological problems. A chronic intoxication of mercury results in kidney changes, changes in the central nervous system and other effects like cancer. The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 6 µg/L"

Materials and methods: 1: construction of standard plasmid with antigen 43 gene: in order to put antigen 43 gene into standard plasmid, we first cloned it from the genome of K12 strain of E.Coli using nest PCR procedure. Primers were designed using Primer Premier 5 and with standard digest sites, EcoRI,XbaI forward and SpeI, PstI reverse. This gene showed an apparent 3K band when electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel in both two steps of PCR. This gene is then put into standard plasmid by standard digestion.
Figure 2：the gel image of antigen 43. The middle is Trans2K DNA marker. Antigen 43 is about 3k large.
2: construction of the expression plasmid of antigen 43: in order to express antigen 43, we put in downstream the delay and amplify part which are mentioned before, which is constructed by PhiR73 and Po promoter. This PhiR73 is under T7 promoter, so antigen 43 gene is indirectly controlled by T7 promoter. We then put this plasmid into BL21 strains, and test the function of antigen 43 by IPTG induction.
Figure 3: the clone plasmid that can achieve the function of antigen 43. Green circle indicate the ribosome binding sites. Red hexagon indicates the terminator. PhiR73 and Po promoter are used as a delay and amplify module.
3：function analysis of antigen 43: Because antigen 43 can cause auto-aggregation, we adapted a well-established auto-aggregation assay to test the function of antigen 43[4]. This assay is to follow the bacterial settling kinetics over time. BL21 strains were overnight cultured and were diluted 1:100 in 50ml LB and then grown to OD600=0.4-0.6., at which point expression of antigen 43 was induced by the addition 0.001% IPTG. The cultures were grown to a final OD600=1(standardized) and 5000rp for 5min, then use 1% PBS which 0.15mM NaCl was added to re-suspense it. this cultures were vigorously shaken before experiment.

The Future
Synthetic biology is an exciting new area of science, and continues to rapidly develop and change. It has the potential for use in a wide variety of areas, and new technologies. We considered these issues throughout the summer, and took part in workshops which explored the potential for our devices in the future.
The Near Future
Applications of the sensitivity tuner and colour output
We believe that our kits of sensitivity tuners and colour-generating devices can be applied directly to environmental sensing. For proof of concept, we attached our sensitivity tuners to the arabinose sensor. However there are so many different sensors in the registry (and in the natural world!) which could benefit from this device.  The registry already contains promoters for lead, arsenic and other pollutants, and we would like to undertake more work to show that the sensitivity tuners are compatible with these promoters. The use of the sensitivity tuner would confer on these promoters the ability to distinguish more accurately distinct pollutant levels, and the pigment output would allow them to be used without expensive equpient, in places where this may be impractical or too costly. We looked at the potential for this system in helping countries such as Bangladesh, which has severe problems with arsenic pollution, in areas where expensive sensor devices are unavailable.
Expanding our selection of sensitivity tuners and pigment-producing operons
The 2009 Cambridge iGEM team has generated two kits of parts - a kit of Sensitivity Tuners, and a kit of Colour Generators.  Each could be expanded - more phage activators and phage promoters could be added to the Registry, and other pigments of bacterial origin could be made into biobricks.  We hope that we have illustrated a standard method to characterize Sensitivity Tuners and to design and describe new pigments that future iGEM teams can reproduce.

USTC-China,2011,Team:USTC-China#Drylab#riboswitch_-_-_TEXT.html," at low background level of the gene can be achieved by increasing or decreasing the stem and loop structures. However, there are certain constrains laid on the design.
Constrains on the consensus sequence
As we mentioned at the data analysis part, there is the requiments that we must contain the consensus sequences near the loop region, which is regarded as a core part in the binding process.
Constrains on the secondary structure
As extra constrains, we take secondary structure into account. Because, firstly, we want to keep the secondary structure as designed as close as possible to the original aptamer. Besides, we want to simplify the design process and putting the requirements into our design would greatly reduce the solution space.
The previous analysis showed us that changing the stem region would influence gene expression in the absence of the target molecule without losing their function. However, it’s unclear if it can achieve the function when we change the other part. In fact, the more we change, the bigger risk that it lose its function to bind the target molecule.
Loop Region Design
There are basically three original aptamer sequences loop. Since the loop region plays a core role in the binding process, we decided to keep the three sequences in the designed aptamers (Table1)(Fig 1).
TABLE 1. Three original aptamer loop region sequences
Num     Sequences    1    AUACCAAAGC    2    AUACCAGUCAGC    3    AUACCAGCAUC
Hairpin Region Design
Designing different hairpin sequences will form a hairpin structure with a given stability profile. Thus, we can control the leaky background gene expression and the binding process.
In fact, there are varied hairpins in original aptamers and we can iteratively add the loop to further change the free energy (Table 2).
TABLE 2. Three original aptamer hairpin sequences
Sequence FreeEnergy(ΔG,kcal/mol) GC Content   GCAGCUGC    0.4                          0.63   GGCAGGACC    1.2                          0.78   GCAGCCGC    1.2 0.88
Artificial aptamer hairpin Sequence
List all the possible hairpin sequences and see if it meets the requirements as stated above may be the most simple solution. Given the template based on the original hairpin sequences (GG***CC), there are 4 nucleotides which are free to choose. With four options per nucleotide this gives 256. For 6 nucleotides to choose it gives 4096."

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Regulatory sytems_-_-_TEXT.html,"]. The mechanism by which the repressors GogR and GtgR regulate the Gifsy promoters, pR and pRM is analogous to that of cI in the lambda phage with the exception of the mode of lytic induction.
As previously mentioned, GogR and GtgR lack the cI cleavage site and are inactivated by binding of small anti-repressor proteins, called AntO and AntT. The Gifsy genes encoding these proteins are located outside the immunity region and are under the direct control of the LexA protein. This protein is the major regulator of the SOS regulon and this regulon is activated by the cleavage of LexA by RecA. The interesting point is that Gifsy and lambda prophage regulation is an integral part of the SOS response i.e. once the SOS response is triggered, the lytic pathway is also induced [Lemire et al.,2008].

Collaborations
One of the biggest opportunities in iGEM is the contact and collaboration between teams of different backgrounds, which makes it possible to get inputs from various points of views and to establish a network of young scientists with the same interests. We took advantage of this opportunity and established contacts to teams from several continents.
Stockholm
Since the very beginning of our iGEM summer we were in continuous contact with the team from Stockholm. We realized soon that our projects were going into a similar direction, both focusing on cancer detection in samples of bodily fluids with the help of engineered bacteria that will bind to cancer cells. In contrast to our project, Stockholm’s ABBBA is focused on the detection of one specific type of cancer at a time. In several Skype meetings we exchanged our ideas about the best possible setup for single cell analysis and signal integration of the bacteria upon binding to a cancer cell. We provided the team from Stockholm with inputs on microfluidics as a setup for the final analysis and they helped us when we were struggling with the recovery of our gene fragments. The best opportunity for joining forces was the rather extensive experience in mammalian cell culture and bacterial-mammalian coculture our team had gathered in the course of our project.

Problem
Biofilms present one of the largest problems facing healthcare in the United States today. The ability of bacterial pathogens to form biofilms is one of their most important virulence factors, as biofilm formation confers resistance to both antibiotics and natural host defense mechanisms. (1)  These sessile bacterial growths, often of the genus Staphylococcus, form in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients,  in patients suffering from chronic infections, and on implant materials such as catheters.  The CDC estimates that 65% of infections in developed nations are caused by persistent bacterial biofilms. (2)  They are the leading cause of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI’s), of which there are two million instances and 100,000 resulting deaths each year in the United States alone. (3)  The inability to treat biofilms with antibiotics and antimicrobials has lead the Tufts iGEM Team to seek novel methods for disrupting biofilm formation.

Background
Not-so-magic bullets
“Two years into the war the Army issued its first meager supplies of penicillin, instructing physicians to use the precious drug sparingly, in doses of about 5,000 units (less than a third of what would be considered a minimal penicillin dose for minor infections in 1993 ). In those early days before bacteria became resistant to antibiotics, such doses were capable of performing miracles, and the Army doctors were so impressed with the powers of penicillin that they collected the urine of patients who were on the drug and crystallized excreted penicillin for reuse on other GIs.” Laurie Garrett - The Coming Plague
Humanity is locked in a perpetual arms race against its pathogens. For the majority of our existence our species has relied upon its innate immune ability in order to survive disease. This has proven effective at a population level so far: no pathogen has driven us to extinction."

23rd June 2009
Dear Diary, today was a very, very long meeting, where we discussed many different issues (mostly about the project, but also about acquisition of funding, travelling arrangements, meeting with Groningen etc.) We also had a vote about the different features concerning our two candidate projects: the self-destructive plasmid and bi-stability. We gave a grade of 1-5 (1 being worst, 5 being best) as our rating for features such as feasibility of the project, ability to model it, how interesting it would be to other people, how applicable it might be for further research, etc. All the results can be seen on the Ethics section. We realised that we have quite varied opinions about the different features of both ideas, which is quite interesting from an ethical perspective (how each one considers the project, mainly in terms of feasibility and acceptance by the iGEM judges, by the science community and by the general public).

Dear Diary, today was a somewhat disappointing meeting. Two members of our team worked very hard on the literary research, and the rest of us didn't really help them. We promised to ourselves that we will participate more in the research, and that we will do our best to get a finalised plan by the end of June, so we can start doing something.
Yours in unity, TUD iGEM '09
11th June 2009
Dear Diary, it was quite a disappointing day. First of all, we had a small presentation in the morning, but about half an hour before it we had a terrible realization: our idea is fundamentally wrong!!! :-(
How did that happen? Well, when we electroplate selection markers into the plasmids, expressing them will allow the host for the plasmid to pass the selection. Unfortunately, expressing them would express the entire plasmid, including the self-destructing gene, meaning that after selection the plasmid will be destroyed before we even use it. On the other hand, if we give the host a plasmid with a selection marker but don't apply any selection, the plasmid will be ejected from the host, so it will not contain the self-destructing gene.
Luckily, we came up with an alternative idea: Fucking Conjugates (literally). The essential idea is based on bacterial conjugation , where an F plasmid in F+ E.coli is transferred into an F"

Macquarie Team
Track: Energy
Our team researched the use of GM E-coli to produce hydrogen gas as a sustainable, zero-emission fuel source. Our prototype is a station that utilises our technology to enable drivers of hydrogen-powered vehicles to refuel their vehicle at home.
This document was very helpful in developing our business plan as it guided our decisions about consumer perceptions of GMOs, laws that we need to consider and authoritative bodies we need to approach.

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo Team
Track: Food & nutrition
Our team worked on creating nitrogen fixating E.coli, which can help babies under 1000 days suffering from malnutrition. Theoretically, our bacteria could help babies turn nitrogen from air they inhale into proteins.
As our future vision, we thought of commercialising our GMMs by putting nitrogen-fixing GMMs into specific capsules. This document helped us when thinking how we can commercialise our project.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," the disease is more meaningful than individual cases.
A2: Nowadays, treating Inflammatory intestinal diseases is still a difficult problem over the whole world, mainly in terms of poor response to drug therapy for some patients, recurrence after treatment and serious adverse reactions after a long-term drug therapy. Of course, some patients still have to undergo an operation because of the bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, intestinal fistula, hemorrhoea, etc. And some patients die from various complications.
Q: We hope to understand the common methods of treating intestinal diseases, especially the inflammatory intestinal diseases
A: Now the methods of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases mainly include drug therapy (5-aminosalicylic acid, hormone, immunization drug, antibiotics, biologics), operative treatment, stool transplantation, stem cell transplantation and leukocyte elution adsorption treatment.
Q: Now the cure rate of inflammatory intestinal diseases, especially chronic diseases and severe diseases, is still low. We hope to know the disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases, from the perspective of a clinical doctor.
A1: Treatment is mainly based on the drug therapy, because 5-ASA preparation has poor tolerance and glucocorticoid has several side effects (hypertension, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, etc.). Chinese people have a case of a certain proportion of metabolic enzyme deficiency that may cause the bone marrow depression. And biologics has a high risk of infection and may exists the probability of drug resistance.
A2: Disadvantage of current methods and techniques of treating inflammatory intestinal diseases is mainly about: 1. lack of effective drugs for all patients, even if the biological agents which is researched and developed in recent years and whose efficacy is only about 50%. 2. There are concerns about the drug for long term use existing serious adverse reactions. 3. Some drugs have problems with secondary failure. 4. Expenses.
Q: The leading edge of biological sciences is about the direction of the intestinal ecosystem. However, there is a big gap between the theoretical research and practice. So what’s your opinion about this current situation?
A1: Intestinal micro ecosystem (intestinal flora) is a hot topic in recent years. Actually, inflammatory intestinal disease is a pathogenesis with genetic background, which involves environment, immunity and infection.
Maybe it is not because of a certain bacteria, instead, because of the change of the proportion of some bacteria or the change of metabolites. These factors can initiate or accelerate diseases, but they are not the determinants.
For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission. But for"

3.3  Effect of lux pR leakage on Safety Catch plasmid
The leakage of lux pR refers to the extent of transcription driven by lux pR promoters not bound by AHL-luxR complexes. The leakage of lux pR is anticipated to have impact on the system as well.
The lux pR on Safety Catch plasmid serves as a vital “switch” that determines how easily the system can be activated. If it has a higher leakage level, the lacI expression driven by it should be stronger, thus inhibiting the expression gRNA, making the system more sensitive to AHL’s activation effect. On the other hand, lux pR with strictly low leakage level might result in a system difficult to induce. An optimal level of leakage of lux pR might be a key factor to building an optimal system. Herein, we use our model simulation to validate these thoughts.
As shown below, the AHL concentration is set to be 10-8M, which should not be suffient to induce the system. If we increase the leakage level of lux pR on safety catch, the system becomes active under this condition and GFP is produced readily. It seems that the more “leaky” the promoter is, the more easily can the system be induced.

iGEM Lecture Series
As a part of our project we actively contribute to our universitie’s teaching program by organizing a lecture series followed by an open discussion on specialized topics related to our project. Until now, we had talks on Norovirus, Malaria and Primer and Probe Design. Currently we are preparing the next talks for the following semester.
Our first lecture was held by our PI Prof. Dr. Jochen Bodem. As a professor of virology, he delivered interesting insights into the molecular biology of Norovirus. We discussed the mechanisms how the virus is infiltrating the human cells, its replication and the damage caused by an infection leading to the typical symptoms of a gastrointestinal disease.
Prof. Dr. Christian Janzen, an expert on protozoan parasites especially Trypanosoma, gave a fascinating talk on Malaria. He started with some basic facts about the historic background and the worldwide incidences of the disease followed by details about the biochemistry of plasmodium, the different subtypes of the pathogen and the varying characteristics and symptoms of Malaria. Furthermore, we discussed current methods to diagnose and treat Malaria.
For a talk on primer and probe design we invited experts from the company Thermo Scientific to our university. The lecture focused on the design of a probe-based assay for pathogens and how to achieve reliable and accurate results in qPCR experiments. Starting with an introduction to qPCR we also discussed the process of assay validation as well as potential pitfalls regarding primer and probe design.
By initiating our iGEM lecture series, we want to reach out to interested people from Würzburg and students of all faculties, draw attention to the topic of infectious and tropical diseases. Furthermore, we are able to introduce the iGEM competition and our research project to a lager audience, thereby attracting new members for our team. In the future we will further enrich the curriculum for many students by inviting speakers from the field of synthetic biology. We hope to have a conversation about the amazing possibilities but also the practical and ethical limits of biological engineering.
Outlook
Since we are the first team of our university to participate in the iGEM competition,"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," provides the function of monitoring and responding to the concentration of calcium ions. This part provides us with more direct visualisation of neuron activity.
The central part of our project. Part BBa_K2492003 contains GEM-GECO(blue-green emission ratiometric GECO附上全称?). GEM-GECO can emit green fluoresces without Ca2+ but blue fluoresces with Ca2+ [4]. GEM-GECO is used as a calcium ion indicator, so as to visualise neuron activity, such as AWA. In recent advances, calcium is a universal indicator for neuron excitation, because calcium ions are able to influx at action potential. GEM-GECO is capable of monitoring and responding to the concentration change of calcium ions due to the existence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two chromophores inside the functional domain. The reason for GEM-GECO enabling the response of disparate calcium ion concentration is that in the Ca2+-free state, the chromophore of this blue-green emission ratiometric GECO (GEM- GECO) undergoes excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) and emits in the lower-energy (green fluorescent) anionic form. [5], while in the calcium ions bound state, two chromophores are less compact and photon transfer is blocked, resulting in blue fluorescence.
Although we utilise CoCHR in AWA for efficient manipulation, the excited or inhibited state of neuron is not able to be obtained timely. In order to visualise whether the channelrhodopsin-CoCHR is excited or not, we integrated str1::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::GFP in C.elegans. As soon as we activate CoCHR to manipulate the neuron, GEM-GECO indicates it. For example, we use light with wavelength of 405nm to excite GEM-GECO, and receive light with wavelength of 511nm and 462nm. If calcium bound to GEM-GECO, the intensity of wavelength close to 462nm increases, indicating the neuron excitation.
As for further research, if we intended to observe the response of AWA, that is, investigating whether worm prefers or repels to certain substances, the change of fluorescence reveals the condition of AWA.
Moreover, GEM-GECO is also beneficial for the large radiometric change and it decreases the cross talk between channelrodpsin-CoCHR. And the fusion protein mCherry which is a marker for CoCHR position is also able to mark GEM-GECO due to expression"
Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"transformed BW27783 cells exhibit a fluorescence curve highly similar to that of BW27783 containing BBa_I0500, and yet the untransformed cells should not be expressing GFP.
Prior to the measurement assay, BW27783 cells transformed with BBa_I0500 were plated and examined for fluorescence, both with and without the presence of inducer. The uninduced cells were not found to fluoresce, while the induced cells did fluoresce. The fluorescing cultures were used to make the frozen stock of BBa_I0500 which was used in the measurement assay. This indicates that our untransformed BW27783 should not fluoresce without the presence of inducer. Furthermore, the untransformed BW27783 cells used in the measurement assay were at no point prior to the assay exposed to arabinose.
To explain the fluorescence of the untransformed BW27783 in the measurement assay, it is speculated that our strain of BW27783 exhibits a rapid production of GFP in response to even low concentrations of inducer. Experimental error is also a likely source of inaccuracy in the data, although the qualitative features described were consistent across 3 trials of the experiment. Research into these results is still ongoing.
University of Waterloo: iGEM OUTREACH
The purpose of UW iGEM Outreach has always been and will continue to be the connection between our community and us. To help build a better understanding of synthetic biology, how it has affected the world around us and to create a basic, fundamental knowledge of the subject that can be incorporated into the way we see things. That perspective can be positive or negative, but we aim to provide the baseline knowledge required that will allow our community members to form a fact-based opinion.
This year, UW iGEM: Outreach focused on designing and running workshops targeted at schoolchildren. We hoped to share our love and passion for biology with tomorrow's future scientists and engineers. We plan to continue building on what we currently have and to eventually develop a complete syllabus for all grade levels. These workshops will be available for download for other educators and enthusiasts interested in their own outreach.
Workshop Materials
We have submitted two community bricks! One for our Grade 12 workshop and the other for our Engineering Science Quest activity for Grades 3-4. The downloadable material is the same as what you can find here on our wiki page.

We also investigate Taiwanese people’s knowledge on Taiwan regulation on manufacturing Chinese herb medicine and prescription of Chinese herb medicine.  This series of high-quality national surveys provides us correct information on the knowledge and use of Chinese medicine so that we can assess the potential risk of misuse Chinese medicine in our society.
2.Media Analysis. We believe that the most efficient way in advocating the knowledge of synthetic biology is through media.  Thus, we would like to know what and how the media report messages related to GTSB.  We worked with NYMU-Taipei on conducting a large-scale media analysis of GTSB in newspapers, magazines and wiki.  We analyze the sufficiency and readability of the media context in Taiwan’s media.  To our knowledge, our media analysis is the first innovative work that is able to provide organized information on GTSB.  The evidence from our media analysis will be very helpful for future science education in synthetic biology.
Strength of Stakeholders

We reach the most important stakeholders related to the detection of toxin in Chinese herb medicine.  We presented our project to them and received positive feedbacks from them.  Our stakeholders include two types of features
1.Policy and Regulation: we visited NGO, legislators, and two divisions of Ministry of Health and Welfare (Division of Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy; FDA Taiwan).  Visiting these institutions enriches our knowledge and concept about policy development and implementation related to safety of Chinese medicine.
2.Profession in Chinese Medicine: we visited the best Chinese medicine in Taiwan, the best food company, and professors of Chinese medicine at National Yang-Ming University.  These institutions gave us very professional advices on our project of detecting toxins in Chinese Medicine."
