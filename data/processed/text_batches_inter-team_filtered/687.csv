Model To control cell cycle, we designed a genetic circuit to control replication by blocking the replication initiation             site, oriC. But it brings us three questions: A. What would happen if we block the chromosome replication? B. Can we mathematically describe this abnormal process? C. Is this approach effective enough to control cell cycle? After Dry Lab’s analysis, we found that blocking oriC is well enough to control cell cycle, and even better since             the initiation nearly determines the cell cycle. How to observe replication procession in real-time? Limited by experimental apparatus, we couldn’t observe the replication procession in single cell directly. So Dry             Lab have to build a model based on a series of previously published rules to describe the coordination among             chromosome replication, cell growth and division. So here comes three main goals of modeling this year: A. Improving model to mathematical formula. B. Solving the paradox, that a cell can’t grow in exponential rate after blocking replication, emerged during simulation             by defining a new parameter “d” to supply it. C. Inferring the internal replication procession only by volume. In the process of modeling, we encountered many challenges, such as bacteria initiates multi-replication process             during one cycle. According to reference, it is very difficult to be mathematically formulated, but with some             smart trick we can formulate it into a mathematical function.
Figure 1. The different stages of synchronization. Ton: the light triggering the synchronization system is on. And             CRISPER system will block oriC. Tr1: It won’t exert any effect when oriC is not blocked since it can’t initiate             new replication fork. Ts：time of becoming single chromosome.
Figure 2. The different stages of the bacteria returning to normal. Toff: the time it takes from turning off the             light to oriC is unblocked. Tr2: time it takes for the bacteria returning to the normal state since Oric is unblocked. Section A: volume and replication model There’s a lot of attributes for a single bacterium such as volume, weight, concentration of different kinds of proteins             and RNA, the amount of DNA and etc., but the accurate concentration of these things can’t be directly detected             due to limited experimental condition.

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours after innoculation using a Clariostar (?) with the following settings (?). 3 biological replicates (3 colonies from each transformation) were measured, using duplicates for each to allow for technical errors. At 6h, some of the results went out of the range capable by the microplate reader (>260,000) so at the 24 hour timepoint the readings were done at a 1 in 5 dilution (20µl of culture mixed with 80ul LB in the 96 well plate). As the results at 6h had some replicates just below 260,000 we predict that these results that exceeded 260,000 were likely close to this value anyway. Due to this, we have included them in our results, however this must be considered during interpretation of the results.
As the overnight cultures were not visually red, 200µl of a representative colony was spun down and supernatant removed to see whether a visual result can be seen at a higher cell density. The following picture shows these pellets.
The image below shows colony resuspensions dotted onto LB+Cm+Em plates. Each quadrant contains the 5 colonies selected per transformation (a-e refers to the order of lanes in the colony PCR gel). Labelling of quadrants is as follows: the first number is the promoter attached to RFP, s/w corresponds to the strength of the RBS, and the second number is the gRNA plasmid that is present. An example is 1s1 where P1 is attached to the strong RBS RFP in the reporter plasmid, and has been co-transformed with gRNA 1 plasmid. ? on colonies were those whose results were negative or less clear than others on the gel. Circled colonies were those selected to be used for storage of the plasmid at -80oC.
A visual of the gRNA results is shown by the colonies below.
WEEK 16
This week we started to prepare our DNA for submission - we digested all our sRFP-containing plasmids with EcoR1 and PstI, as well as our gRNA plasmids and the pSB1C3 backbone at 37oC overnight. We ran these on the gel shown below and extracted the bands indicated for gel purification.
We also transformed pSB1C3 from kit plate 4 well 4B and set up overnight cultures from colonies for plasmid extraction. We then digested 4ug of this plasm"

1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually, the large organizations are in charge.
On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialized committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.
In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organization, which usually also acts as an information center in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.
The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centers might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.
3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfill in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?
The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia, and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process."

Conduct BCA Assay using the protocol and reagents found here [3] .
It is necessary to pool samples and dialyze samples to remove imidazole for this assay to work.  We will try this assay with the imidazole concentration still intact, using the elution buffer as a blank in the spectrophotometer, but this may not work well.
either way, we will try this before our advisor meeting at 1600 hours.
Logistics
We will attempt to conduct all of this in Boelter, to reduce strain on Boyer.
In Boyer: Image SDS-PAGE, take all fractions, BCA reagent kit, protein concentrators, prepared albumin standards, and dialysis cassettes to Boelter.
In Boelter: Dialyze solution is imidazole. Conduct the BCA Assay.  Record and upload all notes for today underneath in this wiki no later than 1500 hours for the advisor meeting.
Results

Gel image indicates that there is a high degree of purity in the resulting fractionation of the cell lysate using the IMAC batch pull down method.
Gel lanes are in order from left to right: Ladder, Negative Control (laemmli sample buffer), Strip Fraction (400 mM EDTA nickel strip), 250 mM Imidazole elution, 100 mM Imidazole Elution, 50 mM Imidazole Wash, 40 mM Imidazole Wash, Unbound Lysate, Crude Lysate from Enzymatic Lysis, and a positive control (BSA - 750 ug/mL).
Gel indicates increasing purity of a protein sample at approximately 51 kDA as the washes and elutions are conducted, at the expense of critically lowering yield (this is expected using the quicker batch method, where the proteins are not uniformly collected)
Results indicate that fractions 5, 4, and 3 ought to be pooled together for concentration verification using BCA and Pierce Concentrator.
BCA pooling:
6 mL of Fractions 3 (40mM Imidazole) ,4 (100 mM), and 5 (250 mM) each were pooled into a 50mL conical for a final total of 18mL.
Pooled fractions were collected into a Pierce 20 kDA MWCO, and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3,000x g at 22 degrees Celsius. 2mL of concentrated samples remained in the filter, and were resuspended and collected into micro centrifuge tubes.

UANL_Mty-Mexico,2013,Team:UANL Mty-Mexico#Workshop CIDEB_-_-_TEXT.html," In mentioned handbook a series of laboratory practices was included in order to teach the students topics since the use of the Parts Registry of the MIT and the manipulation of plates with BioBricks™, also the manipulation and assembly of them. Each procedure described in the handbook was made during the training workshop. Support material such as some simple bioinformatics tools was used in order to perform mentioned procedures.
The realization of the handbook had the principal purpose of introduce the CIDEB students in the basic, practice and experimental knowledge of the synthetic biology in order to prepare them to the iGEM HSD competition. Inside of the handbook was included a little section where the participants were able to write the obtained results in each practice and themselves could interpret them using the information studied in the workshop, as well as a section of questions that allowed us as instructors to know their weakness and explain the doubts later. We could observe that the use of the handbook with protocols and the experimental practice suring the training workshop were very useful to the participants, because they could develop the ability of working in the molecular biology and genetic engineering and they learn to take important notes to a efficient work in the laboratory. Notes that showed that they were understanding the calculus of the enzymes in cuts and ligations, the gels results, fragments size expected, notes about the bioinfomatics programs, Internet data or books that helped to the participants to obtain a critical mind with their experiments and achieve to formulate their own conclusions.

Digestion of pSB4K5 Plasmid
Gel with yesterday's digestion product suggests that neither of the two restriction enzymes (Xba1 or Spe1) cut our plasmid. This was determined by comparing the band sizes to those obtained by midiporep of the pSB4K5 (whole) plasmid.
Plan of action: We will use smaller reactions to increase the relative concentration of enzymes and we will use slightly more BSA buffer.

The nisin is the inducer of the nisin controlled expression (NICE) system, but it is also an antimicrobial peptide. The NZ9000 strain can not tolerate high levels of nisin concentration. We incorporated the nisin imunity gene nisI and nisin resistance gene nsr into the NICE system, and we found that incorporation of the nsr gene into NZ9000 can make it grow at the nisin concentration of 500 IU/mL, but the NZ9000 strain can not grow at this high level of nisin concentration. We also demonstrated that the β-galactosidase protein fused with the cA domain and the SPusp45 signal peptide can be anchored to the cell wall of L. lactis.

Austin_UTexas,2015,Team:Austin UTexas#Project#Plasmid Study_-_-_TEXT.html,", the plates were retrieved, and a single colony was grown overnight in 5 mL of LB/CAM media. After sequence confirming the plasmid in each culture, we froze a fraction of these cells in glycerol at -80° C for storage.
Fluorescence Readings
Fig. 1: Procedure for moving fluorescent cultures forwards. The cultures were moved forward a maximum of 10 days, which is ~125 generations.  At the end of Day 1, the each culture has had ~35 generations of growth, each day after this adds an additional 10 generations.
After we transformed the plasmids into E. coli, we were almost ready to begin the propagation phase of our stability experiment.
First, we streaked transformed cells for each plasmid onto LB/CAM plates and let them incubate overnight. The next day, we selected a number of independent colonies that were still fluorescing for each plasmid. Then, we placed the colony in 5 mL of LB/CAM media and grew each overnight in the shaker at 37° C and 215 RPM. We refer to these cultures as 'Day 1'. The next day, we began the propagation phase of our experiment.
Moving forward, each day we retrieved the overnight cultures from the shaker. We used 5 μl to start a fresh 5 mL culture with LB/CAM media, which was then grown overnight. Next, we measured fluorescence using a 96 well plate reader by pipetting 200μL from each culture and into a well on a 96-well plate. Finally, the day's cultures were placed in the cold room for storage. This process was repeated until either fluorescence was lost or ten days had past.
After the propagation phase, we sequenced the final cultures and compared this sequence to the original to determine which mutations had dominated the cultures.
Table.1 Summary of observed mutations in plasmid study.  Asterisk indicates one plasmid that had two separate mutations.
Results and Discussion
The plasmids created had a great amount of variance in their stability and longevity over the course of the experiment depending on the fluorescent protein that was used in the plasmid.
Plasmids that bore the SYFP2 gene tended to be unstable. Strains with SYFP2 gene frequently broke down within three days, going from very high fluorescence to no observed fluorescence. Furthermore, some samples of SYFP2 lost functionality after merely a day, showing the SYFP2 gene is very unstable across generations. The SYFP2 plasmids most often accumulated IS (insertion sequence"
Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," 2016). Furthermore, the sensitivity of this receptor can be fine-tuned through methylation. Customizing the methylation states facilitates the ability to measure a broad concentration range (requirement II). Ultimately, the chemotaxis pathway controls the direction of rotation of whip-like proteins on the bacterial surface called flagella. When these flagella turn counterclockwise, they act in synergy causing the bacteria to swim coherently in one direction. But when they turn clockwise, the bacteria tumbles around, pointing it in a new direction.
When no ligand is bound to the chemotaxis receptor, it continuously activates a signal transduction pathway involving several proteins, including CheA, CheY, and CheZ (figure 1). CheA phosphorylates CheY, which subsequently translocates to the cell membrane where it binds the flagellar motor protein, thereby altering its rotational direction to the “running” state. After CheY is bound to the flagellar motor protein, it is subsequently dephosphorylated by CheZ (otherwise CheY would remain active indefinitely). Upon ligand binding, the receptor is inactivated, leading to an inactivated pathway and a rotational direction of the flagellar motor protein in the “tumbling” state. Since the binding of CheY and CheZ is linked to ligand binding of the receptor, measurement of the binding of these proteins using a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay (described below) provides a quick and accurate indication of the concentration of ligand present (requirement I and II).
Chemotaxis pathway modifications to address all considerations
To create a biosensor meeting all five listed requirements, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway was customized using a three step approach. First, we set up an assay to verify the extent to which one of the most important chemotaxis receptors, the Tar receptor, could be customized. This enables accurate detection and the possibility to detect diverse ligands (requirement III). Next, a method establishing the ability to measure the activity of this pathway was implemented, using a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-pair. BRET provides a clear and easily measurable detection signal (requirement II and IV). The last step of the approach facilitates accurate detection at different concentrations, by mimicking receptor methylation. This facilitates detection of different ligand concentrations (requirement I).
Implementation: Creation of the biosensor though modification of the chemotaxis pathway
The implementation phase of our project involved the modification of a bacterial chemotaxis pathway at three points, in order to meet the"

CRC Targeting Module
The CRC targeting module enables bacteria to specifically adhere to CRC lesions in the lumen. To this end, E.coli is designed to display a CRC antigen binding moiety on its surface, through which it can be tethered on the foci of CRC. For surface display vectors, we choose two engineered bacterial outer membrane proteins—OmpA (BBa_K1489002) and ice nucleation protein [1] Reference 1[1]Bao, S., Yu, S., Guo, X., Zhang, F., Sun, Y., & Tan, L., et al. (2015). Construction of a cell-surface display system based on the n-terminal domain of ice nucleation protein and its application in identification of mycoplasma adhesion proteins. Journal of Applied Microbiology, 119(1), 236-244. , which are commonly used as carriers of protein/peptide to the outer surface of gram-negative bacteria.
As for the antigens to be targeted, there exists few choices. Despite the abundance of antigens we could think of regarding CRC, such as CEA and EGFR, the mucus layer in the gut prevents direct contact between cancer cells and microorganism. Therefore, a mucus related CRC antigen--Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF-antigen), is chosen as the target. TF-antigen is an epitope on mucin specifically secreted by most CRC cells, against which various targeting nanoprobes have been developed as optical imaging agents for early-stage CRC to assist colonoscopy [2] Reference 2[2]Kumagai, H., Pham, W., Kataoka, M., Hiwatari, K., Mcbride, J., & Wilson, K"

Overview
This year, we made efforts to include people from different walks of life in shaping synthetic biology in different ways.
The lecturers and brochures for high school students were intended to expand their knowledge from basic life science to synthetic biology, some of whom showed great interest and were willing to be iGEMers in 2019. The speeches at streets inspired people with our innovative tool of protein degradation to cure fatal diseases like cancer and AD, and we got some positive feedbacks according to the survey. The e-game we released was designed to propagate our project in a simpler and more relaxing way. Players interested in it ranged from different ages and we received tips on modification. We also established our Wechat subscription to provide an interactive platform between our team members and essay readers. Through the essays related to iGEM competition and syn-bio knowledge about our project, the number of followers had been increasing and some offered us useful ideas during the conversations.

Lectures in High School & Brochure Distribution
This year, our team walked into high schools to disseminate knowledge of synthetic biology. We delivered two lectures in the First High School of Changsha.
In the first lecture, Chuanyang Liu introduced the background of the birth of synthetic biology, the human genome project and the development history of converging technology, intending to expand students' knowledge from basic life science to synthetic biology and arouse their enthusiasm and interest in the latter one.
Expecting to expand influence of iGEM, Chenxing Sun introduced iGEM competition and gave students useful suggestions on participating as a high school team. He communicated with some of their teachers and students about specific issues such as organizing team members, choosing a project, doing experiment, as well as great harvest through iGEM. We were glad to hear that they were willing to gather their own iGEM team in 2019!

Besides all, in my free time I would like to watch movies, hang out with friends, smoke waterpipe, walking the Istiklal Street. Also, I am a daydreamer and enjoy to dream that I can fly without wings.
Eren Şahin: Eren is a last year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics. This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to carry out his knowledge and imagination into building creative and innovative applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates  seemed truly fascinating as well. All in all, he believes iGEM provides a unique opportunity to develop something that can have a tangible, positive impact on the world of synthetic biology. Lastly, when i am not busy in the labs (like that ever happens), I enjoy being out having great adventures.  Outside of school my favourite activities are “goy goy” and to take pictures. (By the way, the meaning of “goy goy” is to chat with friends:D).
Behide Saltepe (Evil Queen): This is Behide Saltepe from ITU MOBGAM iGEM Team. I am one of the vice presidents at our team. This is my fourth, and last, year at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in Istanbul Technical University. I met with iGEM competition this year, as my friends. Although I am interested mostly in neuroscience, I want to discover the facilities of synthetic biology as a different interest area for me. Also I believe that researching on a project would bring lots of experience us at all aspects. That’s why I am in the team! Out of the lab, I really enjoy dancing, especially Latin dances are my area of interests. During experiments, we are listening music, singing, and dancing, lab is so exciting for us! Most importantly, my favorite hobby is travelling in Istanbul, because I fall in love with Istanbul! It is so fascinating city with all its beauty!

Knowing the impact of our device in the community
The social problem of red tide
Red tide is a natural phenomenon that is correlated to changes in the temperature, salinity, nutrient levels, etc., that produce an explosive microalgae proliferation. In case of red tide, the algal bloom it's caused by a few dinoflagellates that produce toxins. This microalgae are eaten by fish, causing their death, and there are filtered by bivalves. If a human consume a bivalve with toxins, well…it depends of the toxin, but if you encounter a Saxitoxin (paralyzing type) you could die.
Last year, the red tide caused problems to the local people like health, economic and social problems. This is because extraction of marine products is one of the more important economic activities of the zone. Last year there was a huge problem, which was seen in the press (for more details, look our journey log!). In July we went to Chiloé and Puerto Montt, we talked with the people and we asked about this problem last year and its consequence. You can find our journey below!. Note: We study in Santiago. This travel was about twelve hours by car, but, in the end, it was totally worth it!
Our travel journey
In one week, and on Winter Break, we visited municipalities, health centers, labor unions, foundations, schools, government institutions and centers responsible for detecting the red tide, achieving a global and integral view of the problem.
The interview
As we talked with the people through an interview model, we also asked for suggestions about our device as a solution to a better detection of red tide toxins. Coming up next, we have our model to our interview. As you can see, there are four different models of it: To mayors, labor unions, fishermen and business
To mayors and businessmen
A mayor should know about the situation of its people in cases of emergency. That is why our first objective was to talk with municipalities in the affected areas: Quinchao, Cochamó, Ancud, among others. Also, there is an economy that is based in marine resources, which industry is strong. In order to know all the points of view,"
TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 28 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. Interestingly, we were lucky to have dinner with two former iGEMers Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements.
TMMU-China Meet-up:After several attendances of meet-ups, we hold a meeting one month before the opening ceremony. Although small in scale, this meet-up aimed at further promoting projects and better preparing for the whole competition. It is worth mentioning that with only one month from the competition, many teams felt they were under great pressure. Professor Rao Xiancai from TMMU-China shared with us his story. He told us that with the advent of the information age, acquiring knowledge and exchanging information had become much easier than decades ago, with iGEM as a good example of integration of network information and international communication. The whole world is enjoying a golden age of information exchange and multilateral communication. He hoped that given the chance, all the young adults could seize the moment to learn more, not for medals or awards, but to stand on the frontier of the age, and by working together, we would make a difference. Professor Rao’s speech inspired us all and we therefore deepened our understandings of scientific research. At last, the exciting hot pot dinner lighted up the happy atmosphere for every team member to enjoy the meeting and refresh for future challenges.

It is here that we believe our project could be of great use, as in many parts of Asia it is legal to release synthetically modified organisms into the wild.
When manufacturing plants for explosives are developed, many of the surrounding communities are exposed to dangerous levels of explosive pollutant in soils and water. This can have catastrophic social impacts as destructive health effects run rife in the communities – placing strain on the social infrastructure. Not to mention the agricultural impacts soil pollution can have for rural communities reliant on farming.
Our project could present an economical solution to this problem – our construct is easy and cheap to manufacture and transport, and with additional features such as kill switches we can ensure safe release to perform the bioremediation in-situ.
Remediating this land would be of huge social and economic benefit to surrounding communities – allowing them to rebuild and prosper, especially in areas where pollution is due to military activity.

Of bacterial OYE family members, those that are the best characterised are XenA - XenF of P. putida KT24406 XenB from Pseudomonas fluorescens,7 PETN reductase from Enterobacter cloacae PB28, NemA reductase from E. coli9 and YqjM from Bacillus subtilis.10
In 2009 the Edinburgh iGEM team developed the concept of a Nitrate/Nitrite biosensor which could be used to detect TNT. They generated a biobrick ( BBa_K216006 ) for the gene onr (organic nitrate reductase) that encodes pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase to function as a TNT degrader. However, neither were completely characterised.
We sought to find new, mostly uncharacterised, enzymes to function as additional solutions to offer alternative mechanisms which may be more suited to particular problems. Given that the PETN reductase was a member of the Old Yellow Enzyme family, we decided that we would target additional members of the OYE group to help expand the both the range of enzymes that can be utilised to degrade explosives and the range of unexploded ordnance chemicals that could be degraded to those that contain nitroglycerin.
Our initial shortlist contained the following the proteins: XenA, XenB, NemA and YqjM. From these we selected two to examine over the summer. These were XenB and NemA which have been submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as BBa_K1398001 and BBa_K1398002 respectively.
XenB ( BBa_K1398001 )
XenB is an NADH-dependent flavoprotein (Xenobiotic Reductase B) from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. We chose XenB because:
XenB may serve a dual purpose as a Nitroglycerin and TNT degrading enzyme (see below).
The phylogeny of OYE members11 suggests that XenB is similar in sequence to the previously submitted PETN reductase and is comparatively well understood.
Heterologous expression of XenB from P. fluorescens has been previously demonstrated in E. coli DH5α12 enhancing our chances of successful expression.

From these interviews we expect to gain insight into the diversity of complexity. It became even more clear than before that complexity can be found in many different fields.

Week 16 : choosing an AHL pair, improving diffusion
Monday 8th September
We have enough crosstalk results to decide which pair of quorum sensing systems we will use : Las and Lux. See this article for more details.
Diffusion experiment (trying to have a correlation between channel length and time of fluorescence, having cells at the end of a channel and adding pure HSL at the other end of the channel, see this article for more details on the setup) : We tried lower concentrations of pure HSL and the wells start shining at different moments, but we still don't have any correlation between channel length and starting time of fluorescence, because our chip seems to be leaky and some wells dried completely. However, this experiment enables us to check that fluorescence appears after a reasonable time and that channel length probably doesn't influence this time too much.
On the modeling side, we are not able to retrieve diffusion coefficient of HSL from this diffusion experiment but we can use a parameter from literature.

Crosstalk experiments continued
Monday, 6th September
Until now we thought Lux was crosstalking too much with las and tried to improve the pair Las-Rhl. However we realized today that Rhl is difficult to improve and that our induction curves of Las and Lux are good enough, since Las is never responding to lux-HSL and we only have to be in a range of las-HSL concentrations that is below 10 nM to avoid Lux responding to las-HSL.

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"

I still feel the same way, but I've come to realize that how much a technology change people's life is not justified by how cuttingedge it is, but how effective and useful it is in the life.

Hi, I' m Yinchi(Candy) Zhou, a Junior from The Stony Brook School on Long Island. Currently, I am a member of the wet group, which focuses on experiments and results. I spent the whole summer working on our biological project in Shanghai. I found iGEM inspiring me on science. It not only elevated my academic ability but also taught me cooperation skills. Investigating and doing research are challenging for a high school student. We definitely struggled a lot, but we made it eventually. I eventually realize that biology is not a simple subject: it relates to social science, economy, engineer, etc, which have significant impacts on our life. I appreciate this amazing experience.

Hello! I'm Zhiyi(Miranda) Zheng from Shanghai, China. I am currently a sophomore from St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas. I'm the co-manager of Dry Group as well as the co-director for our homepage video. I'm very glad to be a part of our team this year, and I also enjoyed working with different people. In addition to gaining more academic knowledge, iGEM to me is also a fantastic teamwork experience—confronting an issue, struggling with it, and solving it altogether. When I'm not working on anything academic, you may find me dancing, fencing, making film, or hanging out with people!

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#29 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"
The larger fragment in all three wells can be seen to be larger than the 2322bp fragment of the HindIII ladder (and also slightly larger than the fragment caused by the pSB1A2 backbone in the BBa_C0056 samples). The plasmid backbone on which BBa_B1002 is found is pSB1AK3 which is 3189bp in size therefore it can be said that the correct backbone has been transformed.
Meanwhile the BioBrick we are expecting to see is really small (a 6bp stem, 4nt loop) so it won't be detected within the gel. The band which can be seen in lane 4 (i.e. the digest of BBa_B1002 mini-prep from colony 1) is probably the result of a partial digest.
BBa_R0077 Mini-Prep digests
The expected length of the BioBrick BBa_R0077 is 231bp. In the gel it can be seen that there are a row of faint bands that can be seen (in the last three wells of DNA sample) which lie below the 564bp fragment of the HindIII ladder. This has to be the desired BioBrick.
The larger fragment seen in the 3 digested mini-prep samples of BBa_R0077 lies around the region of the 2027bp band of the HindIII ladder. This is to be expected as the plasmid backbone is pSB1A2 which measures 2079bp. This time the pSB1A2 contains no kanamycin resistance (just ampicillin resistance) so the bp size displayed in the Parts Registry is the exact size of this backbone fragment.
Conclusion
The three mini-preps that were transformed in E. coli JM109 cells are correct; when the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI are applied, the correct sized fragments appear.

UCLouvain,2018,Team:UCLouvain#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," donor bacterium by a plasmid containing Cas9 and its RNA anti RFP guide shows 100% suppression of the red phenotype in the transformed bacteria.
As we can see, all of our transformed bacteria appears in red. Our Crispr/Cas9 system seems to have an efficiency of 100%
Biomolecular confirmation of our Crispr/Cas9 system
An enzyme digestion (PstI) was performed on the same strains to check that the recipient plasmid was correctly cut after the transformation of our killer plasmid.
Biomolecular confirmation of the effect of CRISPR/Cas9 on the reporter plasmid: miniprep on colony and linear digestion with PstI.

This plasmid digestion confirms that the reporter plasmid carrying the rfp and TEM-1 genes has been correctly cut by our Crispr/Cas9 system, both by the RNA guide targeting RFP and the one targeting the resistance gene.
Tests of Conjugation
Different test were performed to verify the conjugation and/or Crispr/Cas9 system efficiency.
Conjugation “Cross” test
the purpose of this test is the verify the conjugation and the efficiency of our system by crossing, in a agar plate, a recipient strain (carrying our RFP reporter plasmid) with both our control donor strain (S17-1 with our plasmid without         sgRNA) and our donor strain (S17-1 with our killer plasmid with the sgRNA).

Rationale and Aim
Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations that hamper success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors.
This part can be used within the platform as a processor unit. Real world applications of biosensors are limited by many factors, one of which is that with most biosensors there is not a readout signal showing if the biosensor is working when not in use, i.e that the cells are still alive and have not lost their biosensor phenotypes. This can make them difficult to use, as well as market, since their viability comes into question as well as leading to false negatives/positives.  Biosensors which rely on expression of a reporter signal may also suffer from unobserved activation due to weak or inconstant induction.
For this section of the project, as an improvement on a part by the Tokyo Tech 2015 team ( BBa_K1632013) , we aim to produce a biobrick compatible part which is able to constitutively express a reporter signal prior to activation (to show that it is functioning) and to amplify a weak or inconsistent induction signal by permanently switching from an [OFF] to [ON] state after induction.
Background Information
Expression of the E. coli type 1 fimbriae gene is tightly regulated and phase dependent, i.e expression is either completely [ON] or [OFF] (Klemm, 1986). This change in expression is controlled by the action of two proteins FimB and FimE which independently act upon a 300bp promoter region upstream of the fimbriae gene.  The 300bp promoter region is inverted to either activate or suppress expression (McClain et al., 1991). Typical gene regulation mechanisms rely on up or down regulation of a promoter from a baseline expression, the fimbriae mechanism of ‘ALL’ or ‘NONE’ makes it a useful tool for synthetic biology applications.  While the FimB protein inverts the promoter back and forth between [ON] and [OFF] states the FimE protein permanently inverts the promoter from [ON] to [OFF].  This inversion can be used to amplify weak or inconsistent induction signals.

PLlacO-1-T18-linker-hTrx_scaffold-(3xFlag): The human thioredoxin scaffold fused to the T18 domain of cyaA through a flexible linker. The human thioredoxin scaffold is a scaffold used for presentation of peptide aptamers. When a random nucleotide library is inserted into the scaffold, one can use the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen against specific targets. An affinity 3xFlag-tag is fused to the C-terminal for detection purposes. The part is under control of the hybrid PLlacO-1 promoter.

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#safety#safety in the lab_-_-_TEXT.html," previously described, all precautions are taken to ensure security and safety for all users.
Public safety? As described in the overview, E. calculus is not designed to be used on other environments than the laboratory. Interactions with human body are not envisaged and public should also never be in contact with our modified organism. All the experiments we have performed we made according to the highest standards of safety measures. Each modification we apply to our strains should not be threatening for biodiversity and external organisms beacuse the E. coli strains that are routinely used in the laboratories are mutated in many genes, and should not be able to survive in an external environment.
However, we are conscious that the gates we designed could potentially (and hopfully :-)) used for other biological applications, especially in metabolic engineering. In our view, these potential applications will probably be part of a process in a closed reactors, or in controlled environment, hence the safety regulations in use in the industrial context will apply. We also believe that our system present no evident potential danger, mainly because the used genes or parts were never described as potential threats to human and hopefully will never be an issue for public safety.
Environmental safety? E. calculus should  not be disseminated in the environment of course. Avoiding contaminations and accidental release of the E. coli strain implies good laboratory practise, particularly for elimination of biological waste (see above).
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The only safety issue we can associate with our new Biobricks is researcher exposure to a microorganism when testing the parts. During the iGEM summer work, all safety measures were respected to avoid any problem.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is one biosafety group, leaded by a specialist in safety regulations in our institute. This person is in charge of the evaluation and implementation of the safety measures in the Instititute. Moreover, as INSA Toulouse is a five years engineer school, there are plenty of review boards that we can consult at any time to answer arising questions about biosafety. In addition, biosafety issues are regularly evaluated by the security laboratory officer.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety issues are usually highly specific for each project. Associating DNA parts together will always pose safety risks in case of accidental release of DNA or bacteria occur. European safety rules are pretty strict and are"

Skyping with the University of Lund
TThe first non-dutch iGEM contact we made was with the team from Lund, Sweden. Their university participated for the first time. We arranged a Skype meeting and shared to them our approach on different subjects. They had a lot of questions for us and we brainstormed with them about things like funding and time management. Thanks team Lund!
TU Delft
In our early iGEM days we made contact with the iGEM team from Delft. They helped us out with questions we had about our wiki and in return we helped them out with some questions they had on bioinformatics. We have had a lot of contact with team Delft after this and would like to thank them for the pleasant collaboration.
Meet-up Wageningen
The Wageningen iGEM team organised a Benelux iGEM meet-up, here we had the opportunity to present our project to other teams for the first time. It was a nice initiator to think about how to present our project and to meet the other teams and learn about their projects. Thanks iGEM Wageningen!
Meet-up Delft
The iGEM team from the TUDelft hosted a European iGEM meet-up, in which we participated. During this conference three speakers talked about synthetic biology in their field of work. After that every team presented their posters to all the other teams. We enjoyed the day and learned a lot of the poster presentation, therefore we want to thank the TUDelft iGEM team!
Meet-up Leuven
A month before the Giant Jamboree the team from KU Leuven organized a practice jamboree. During this event we got to practice our presentation and received feedback from the other teams. There were also some very inspiring speakers, that talked about being a scientist and the industrialization of products. It was a very informative afternoon and we are very grateful that the Leuven team set up this meeting!

CPEC (Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning) Protocol – Andrew Ng
Design primers that include overhangs for fragments that you want to assemble by hand or using a program such as Snapgene (these primers can also be used for Gibson assembly)
Using Phusion polymerase, PCR each insert as well as your plasmid backbone and verify on a gel.
IMPORTANT- it is highly recommended that you optimize your PCR protocol (either using temperature gradient or DMSO) so that only one band can be seen in your PCR
Digest PCR product using DpnI (digests methylated DNA)
If PCR was performed using Phusion polymerase from NEB, you can
Add the DpnI enzyme from NEB directly. For this, I add 1 ul of enzyme to 50 ul of PCR product and incubate for 3 hours or more 4. PCR purify your inserts,
NOTE: if you were unable to get a single band in your PCR, you might consider gel purification if you can get enough yield
Using a 2:1 molar ratio of insert to vector (if you did not PCR purify, I would just eyeball concentrations based on length of parts and darkness of band in gel), make your CPEC reaction as follows:

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Model#IntegrationQS_-_-_TEXT.html,"
These modeling results support the strategy of using aiiA to tune the sensitivity of the QS construct and indicate that, in principle, the functionality we want to engineer can be obtained using only the components we are using.
Phase 3: Lab implementation
Inspired by the modeling result, we decided to add aiiA to BBa_K1913005 . The aiiA gene had to be controlled under an inducible and tight promoter. We used the pTet promoter to regulate aiiA, causing aiiA to be produced constitutively. To turn on fluorescence, aiiA production can be halted by introducing the TetR protein, which represses production from the pTet promoter. This construct was submitted as a new BioBrick BBa_K2387070 (Figure 3).
Figure 3: aiiA mechanism controlled under the pBAD promoter. Left) No induction state, aiiA expression is triggered by pTet. Right) Arabinose activates the pBAD promoter leading to the expression of tetR which inhibits pTet, avoiding suppressing the expression of aiiA and leading to the formation of the LuxR-AHL dimer which further binds to pLux, leading to activation of the quorum sensing system and GFP generation.
Production of TetR is regulated by the inducible promoter pBAD. Addition of L-Arabinose should lead to production of TetR. TetR can then bind and repress pTet, halting aiiA production. Lower levels of aiiA in the cells would mean higher levels of AHL, which should then lead to auto-activation and production of GFP. In this way, addition of L-Arabinose should induce a fluorescent signal.                              The fluorescence of this new construct was measured alongside the old construct and the negative controls (Figure 4).
Figure 4: The fluorescence produced by cells containing the Reporter QS ( BBa_K1913005 ), Inducible QS (Reporter QS with repressible aiiA BBa_K2387070 ). L-Arabinose was added to the 'Induced' cells                                  negative control 1 encodes only for GFP, negative control 2 for both GFP and LuxR.
Conclusion
For Mantis to have a high sensitivity, we need a system that can increase fluorescence production specifically in response to detection of antigen. We determined that QS could be a good strategy to achieve this. Our goal was to engineer a construct where QS could be induced, for example by Cpx or by addition of L-Arabinose. We started"

Public Workshop
In order to demonstrate our project to the general public of all ages, we ran a workshop showcasing our efforts. To make the session more interactive we had an AFM model, some pink plates and Congo red plates to show the growth of amyloid fibres due to the redness of the cells.   Kids could play around with the AFM model we built. This was done a way that they could also appreciate the way the equipment worked to show our AFM images.   During this workshop, we got a chance to further discuss safety measures that would be taken when using E.coli and reassure people that with the use of ""kill switches"" in our project would make it safe for everyday use.
Stacey Symposium
In September, the Biosciences department hosted the Stacey Symposium, a public event where we were given the opportunity to present our project to esteemed lecturers, investors, alumni and their families. During the event we were able to present our research to a wide range of audience and explain to them the importance of our work within synthetic biology. After the presentation, we had the chance to socialise with the attendees, and even receive constructive criticism towards our presentation as well as our research.  This criticism was put into good use as we had the Westminster London Meetup the next day. We were able to improve our presentation based on the comments we were given and this prepared us for the questions we were asked after our Westminster presentations.
Survey
Our project focuses on producing conductive nanowires that can be used in everyday products, such as replacing the metals used in conventional circuit boards. So we designed and conducted an online survey to evaluate people’s opinion on renewable energy and our project. We aimed to ask questions which covered the economics aspect of renewable energy, as well as questions about the environment. To receive an unbiased range of answers, we published the survey on our different social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter and on our Reddit account. We were also able to hand out copies of the survey during the Birkbeck London Meetup, the Stacey Symposium and the Public Workshop.
The following are the results from the survey. Although most of our participants were in a bioscience related field, we were also able to collect responses from people in an engineering related field, computer science and art. We split our survey into four categories.
Conductive nanowires
There are two questions relating to our project. The first question is based on applications for our project. From the results, the majority (30%) of the participants said"
UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#LightToColor_-_-_TEXT.html," The R, G, B value could roughly show the expression of red, green and blue fluorescent proteins and their fluorescence intensity, greatly fitted with the literature data that the blue-light sensor was induced best at 470nm, green-light sensor at 532nm, and red-light sensor at 650nm. These curves further proved the function of our system.
Figure 10. The flow cytometry results shows the distribution of the cells in fluorescence intensity. BV421 represented the blue-fluorescence intensity, while the FITC-A represented the green-fluorescence intensity and Pe-TxR-A represented the red-fluorescence intensity. The horizontal axis shew the fluorescence intensity, while the vertical axis shew the number of bacteria cells.
Figure 11. The spectral response of the complete RGB system. “%maximum induction” is calculated as the fold change of response divided by the maximum fold change across the spectrum.
For more precise control and prediction of the colors we could generate, we needed to know how the three light sensors responded to lights with different wavelengths and intensity and how the fluorescence changed with time. We firstly use flow cytometry[6] to measure the spectral response of the RGB system. From the figure 10 we could see the distribution of the cells in fluorescence intensity. BV421 represented the blue-fluorescence intensity, while the FITC-A represented the green-fluorescence intensity and Pe-TxR-A represented the red-fluorescence intensity. The horizontal axis shew the fluorescence intensity, while the vertical axis shew the number of bacteria cells. The figure demonstrated the variation of fluorescence intensity where cells were most concentrated with the wavelengths of light. The red- and blue- light data were consistent with our prediction. However, the green-light data was not so satisfying, which was probably because without NOT gate, the green-light circuit had leakage and produced fluorescent proteins even not induced by light. What’s more, the different culture and light-inducing conditions of bacteria on the plates and 96-well plates might also cause the slight inconsistency.(For more details of our optimization, please see LIGHT TO COLOR
Figure 12. The curves show the relationship between the input light and fluorescent intensity.
From the flow cytometry results, we knew the correspondence between color and wavelengths of light. We then controlled the intensity of the input light to see the change of the fluorescent intensity over time. The figure 12 demonstrated that the stronger the input light was, the less fluorescence would be. The phenomenon was probably because that under relatively low light, the light sensor could be induced and under relatively strong light, the light"

Afterwards, we filled out a survey for them, outlining some of the things we would like to see changed. We also asked them to send us a screencast of the program so we could see the functionality of the program. Evan and Jenhan asked us to update our DataSheet model with any changes we liked that Purdue had made, and make any new reorganizations we thought necessary. We liked the protocol form idea, to help set up the datasheet template. We are looking forward to incorporating that part into our project. As of now, both teams are going to work on their own datasheet apps, mainly because a large goal of ours is to get it to connect to a Clotho database. We hope to compare and contrast both apps later in the summer, and again see what changes could be made to improve it further. We planned to meet again a week from today with Evan and Jenhan to show them another draft of the datasheet.
Datasheet - July 25, 2013
The members of the iGEM met together to talk some more about the Datasheet. We decided we wanted to separate the Datasheets into two types: Basic Parts and Composite Parts.
We mapped out what sort of information would be required for each type of Datasheet, and how we might incorporate some of the ideas that Purdue presented to us. We liked the idea of a restriction map being available, but thought it might take up too much space on the page. We liked the idea of a singular sheet holding all the information for the part. We decided we would re-use the existing presentation of the sequence map already on the registry. It has a link to a plasmid map, like the one Purdue had on their version of the datasheet.
We also talked with Sonya about what some of the other protocols might be used for in the datasheet. For the time being, we want to set the standards for flow cytometry, since that will be the main demonstration of functionality that we will be using.
(Due to some scheduling conflicts with a meeting with Wellesley to try out their latest Eugenie program, the meeting with Jenhan and Evan was moved to the following week: 8/7/2013

We recieved an e-mail from Mr. Gene, They say that E3 and E9 colicin domains have always been tricking to synthesize, The E3 toxin has already been amplified by PCR, but the E9 sequence has been dificult to obtain. The GFP biobrick is cloned into any plasmid from Mr.Gene
It seems that they were not able to clone neither E3 nor E9 colicines, we are worried about the dificulties that we will have to clone them.

Obviously it is a question of getting used to things. A new platform does not solve the problem that team members need to get used to checking a new place for information when they start with an iGEM project. But if HumHub became the norm of communication within iGEM, it would be adopted by new teams fast and with little effort and it could also function as a means to find other teams to work with. Contacting others may also become more simple as teams would have less communication streams from different platforms coming in. If everything was focused on one platform, noticing new messages and replying to them may be more likely than staying on lookout for invitations to collaborate coming through e.g. Facebook, Twitter and email.

WHAT'S UP? 21/06/15
Hi iGEM world!
We haven't posted anything for a while because term and exams have been taking up all our time. But school's out now and we're preparing for a busy summer of iGEM. Our DNA arrived a few weeks ago and has been waiting for us in the fridge. The primers are in the post and we're busy filling in safety forms for induction into the lab tomorrow. And so after months of reading about secretion systems, studying biofilms and sussing out how to use SnapGene, we're ready to get started!
An aim of the project is to outreach to as many different groups of people to ask for feedback on our project, and to spread the message of iGEM and synbio. In lieu of this, last week we skyped with team:ITB Indonesia to talk about both our projects. They brought up concerns about depletion of our bacterial population in the secretion system and we talked about the possibility of antimicrobial resistance. Their project is concerned with exrtaction of oil/dispersing oil spills.
We have a preliminary design for the wiki (which hasn't been implemented yet) and meetings about the modelling approaches we can take for the project. Henry has been reading up on mass action ratios and Michaelis Menten and dry lab team is preparing to start planning the modelling tomorrow. Silas has been taking footage for the videos (""biofilms"") he will be making throughout the summer and James has been looking into the effects of our antibiofilm agents on the bladder biome.
We're also giving our first ""Concepts of Synthetic Biology"" this Tuesday to high school students attending a summer school in Oxford as well as talking about our project at the upcoming open days. June and Mabel have been busy contacting nurses, doctors and professors and we've had some promising comments on our ideas. We're looking forward to meetings to discuss our project further.
Keep track of our weekly blog posts about our progress in the lab. Until tomorrow!

To amplify the integration products, PCR was done, both to the cleaned up sample and to the original itegration product. PCR mix and cycle can be found on protocol.
The PCR products were analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gels are shown on Figure 2.

Figure 2 shows 2 interesting PCR products observed (lane 2 and 3). Note the 2 PCR products are not observed in the negative controls (lane 4 and 5). No PCR products observed for lane 1-14 (when PCR clean up was done before PCR), most likely due to too little product, which got lost during PCR clean up.
A second PCR was done from the product of the first PCR to amplify the product further. The PCR product wan run on 5% TBE native PAGE shown on Figure 3.

2nd Annual Mid-Atlantic Mini-Jamboree
July 22nd, 2016
In the summer of 2015, UMaryland iGEM founded the first Mid-Atlantic Meet-up and hosted four teams: UVA, William and Mary, Duke, and Rock Ridge High School. Each team gave a 25 minute presentation of their project followed by a Q&A with the audience. We were also fortunate enough to have Special Agent Edward You of the FBI and UMD Professor Raymond St. Leger as guest speakers.
This summer, we included more iGEM teams in the Mid Atlantic Area by hosting the University of Pittsburgh, the US Naval Academy, the College of Willam and Mary, and University of Virginia iGEM Teams. We shared ideas and received feedback about ours projects during our discussion session. We were joined by guest speakers Dr. Eli Groban and Dr. Ganesh Sriram with opening remarks by Dr. Edward Eisenstein, an iGEM judge, who spoke about the overall iGEM experience, what it takes to make an iGEM team successful and the importance of human practices. Closing remarks were made by Ana Sifuentes from iGEM headquarters.
The presentation portion allowed teams to practice their project explanations before the Giant Jamboree. We also included a long discussion section after presentations so teams could get feedback from each other and from faculty advisors. We set aside time for the University of Virginia team to survey the four other teams for their biocontainment outreach and to gather feedback about their material on biocontainment. Furthermore, William and Mary was able to gather more participants for their Pen Pal program

Description
New England iGEM, or NEGEM , is a gathering of iGEM teams from the New England and the Northeast. Started back in the fall of 2012 by the Boston University team, NEGEM has become a BU team tradition! In 2012 and 2013, NEGEM was a one-day event that took place a few weeks before the Regional Jamboree as a venue for teams to practice their presentations and get feedback on improving their talks.
The Third Annual NEGEM meet up was a 3-fold event spread throughout the course of the summer and fall. Unlike previous years, we decided to kick things off in June with NEGEM 3.1 so the 6 participating teams could get feedback early on in their project development. We were fortunate to have Dr. Kim de Mora from iGEM Headquarters attend, along with Measurement Track Chair Dr. Jacob Beal from BBN Technologies. We met up again in August for NEGEM 3.2 to discuss progress, critique the introduction and motivation slides for each project, and form collaborations between the 5 participating teams. Ana Sifuentes from iGEM HQ also joined us for the NEGEM 3.2. Finally, NEGEM 3.3 was in early October where 4 participating teams ran through their more polished presentations, including more results and conclusions. This time around, everyone gave detailed feedback to each team on presentation style, data representation, and narrative, thus helping each team improve their slides and presentations in preparation for the Giant Jamboree.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

performing a complex 13C labelling experiment
Single Expression
To check the heterologous expression of mdh, hps, phi and xpk in E.coli, we inserted them into a vector downstream a strong lacI repressible T7 promoter. Therefore, we used the pSB1A30 plasmid that was built by Team Heidelberg 2014 [1] . In this vector, you find the BioBrick scar downstream the promoter.
All four genes were cut with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into a pSB1A30 plasmid that was digested with the same enzymes. As these construct require a T7 polymerase, they were transformed into BL21 Gold (DE3). Thus, we created microorganisms that, after IPTG induction, expressed the four MCC genes separately. For testing, we ran SDS-PAGEs with cell pellets that should contain the enzymes.

The modularity of type I PKS is reflected in three aspects. First, the gene clusters of type I PKS are modular that each enzyme corresponds to the unique sequence of gene cluster. Second, each enzyme of PKS has only one function. Third, the process of polyketide synthesis are modular that each module modify one unit of polyketide chain[11].
PKS is comprised of a series of module that contain several domains. Each domain have only one catalyst center with defined function which works well though it’s a part of module. The domains we used are as follows: a ketosynthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT), a dehydratase (DH), a ketoreductase (KR), an enoylreductase (ER), an acyl-carrier protein (ACP), and a thioesterase (TE).
AT selects an extender unit and charges ACP with it; KS catalyzes a decarboxylative condensation to elongate the polyketide; ACP transfers the newly-formed β-ketoacyl intermediate to processing enzymes; KR can stereoselectively reduce the β-keto group and control the orientation of an a-substituent; DH can catalyzes dehydration to yield a trans-α, β-double bond; ER can stereoselectively reduce the double bond and control the orientation of α -substituent. TE can catalyze the intramolecular cyclization of a polyketide to create a macrolactone[10][12].(table 1.)

The domain KS, AT, and ACP are resposible for the elongation of the polyketide chain. And the DH, ER and KR are the processing enzymes that modify the newly-form unit of polyketide chain. TE can terminate the elongation of polyketide. The AT can select the substrate and the processing enzymes can modify the unit, All of that finally determined the structure of polyketide chain[13].
There are three kinds of module: loading module, elongation and modification module, termination module. Each module condenses and"

Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.

We worked to recreate the formation of nanotubes, and we did it!
We are the second group that is able to see this nanotubes, Ben Yehuda's work team and us, and answering the question  that Paris Bettencourt had in iGEM 2011 , TUBE OR NOT TUBE? We said TUBE.
PY79 cells were grown to midexponential phase, plated on LB agar, incubated for 6 hr at 37°C, and visualized by SEM Rej34 circles: (A) Bacillus subtilis cells(x 7,500). The red circles indicate intercellular nanotubes connecting neighboring cells. The scale bar represents 1 micrometer.
We prepare our cells with the SEM Analysis Protocol , We fixed our cells in the right moment (6 hrs of growth at 37°C), that is when they are in the exponential growth phase, and then we watch them in the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and we get different and amazing pictures.
We got similar results to the article, tube length ranged from 0.25 micrometers to 0.9 micrometers, whereas width ranged approximately from 50 to 80 nm.

We also got an amazing picture about the nanotubes in which we can see, that there are many nanotubes among the cells,  and that they communicate between different nanotubes to the same cell, observing this amount of nanotubes, we could think that the probability of transfer will raise.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html,"frac{g}{L}) $ titer is higher in the case of high growth rates.
The above observations actually illustrate another aspect of the growth rate - production rate tradeoff, namely the economic aspect. Lower growth rates actually lead to higher final delftibactin concentration in the bioreactor, which is of course wanted, but on the other hand the process takes a lot longer to finish, thus requiring more operational costs. Exactly this trade-off will be explored in the next session.
Delftibactin Production Cost
The ultimate goal of the aforementioned simulations was the optimistic calculation of the cost required for production of delftibactin. Thus, for each of the simulated points, we calculated the costs by starting with the following assumptions:
The cost of the growth medium of the E.coli is equal to the cost of glucose spent.
The operation of the 10 L bioreactor requires 1 full time technician with a wage of 2000 euros per month.
After finishing the operation of the bioreactor, the next cycle can start after a time offset of 3 hours.
The electricity cost of the bioreactor is calculated based on its power rate and assuming constant operation.
Delftibactin has been secreted to the supernatant and it does not have to be purified in order to selectively precipitate gold, as shown in our experiments. Instead hydrogen peroxide has to be used to remove reducing agents except delftibactin from the medium.
Figure 6: Delftibactin cost as a function of the growth rate. The trade-off between high growth rate and delftibactin production rate, which is also seen in Fig. 4, results in this parabola-shaped curve. The global minimum is attained at 0.37 1/h and has a value of 0.1755 Euro per mmol of Delftibactin.
For these calculations, the following prices were looked up and used:

Making the Mtd Biobrick
To create this biobrick, we utilized a combination of splicing overlap extension PCR and Gibson Assembly to extract a sequence from the BPP-1 phage's genomic DNA that would be free of the standard biobrick restriction enzyme sites. The protocols for those methods are listed below:
PCR to generate fragments of mtd
In this step, four separate fragments of the mtd gene are created via PCR. This step is necessary to eliminate illegal internal biobrick sites (EcoRI, PstI, NotI) and to add necessary biobrick sites to the 5' and 3' ends.

Hallå!
We are the Dalhousie iGEM team from Halifax, Nova Scotia in Canada.  Our team is comprised of 15 undergraduate university students, 7 mentors and 2 faculty advisors.  We are from a range of programs making it a fun and interesting summer working with so many diverse backgrounds!
We wanted to tackle a local issue for our 2018 project: an increased amount of aluminium present in Nova Scotia’s freshwater systems due to acid rain.  These increased aluminum levels have been responsible for environmental challenges such as a decline in the Atlantic salmon population.  Our goal for the season is to develop a sensitive and inexpensive bacterial biosensor with Caulobacter that can detect toxic levels of aluminum.  This biosensor can be developed into a “point-of-care” diagnostic for Nova Scotia rivers at risk and would be more accessible to community groups that protect Nova Scotia rivers.
Good luck with your project!

Benzyl alcohol, 2-methylbenzyl alcohol, benzoate, and 2-methylbenzoate of concentration gradients from 0.3 uM to 3 uM were prepared to characterize the performance of Adaptor XylB and identify the best testing methods therein (Fig. 8). Responses of Adaptor XylB in the three testing methods were compared with that of biosensor XylS without Adaptor. Testing modes that employing E. coli double-transformed with two Adaptors turned out better than the co-culture one, as shown in the dose-response curves for benzyl alcohol (BAL, Fig. 8a) and 2-methylbenzyl alcohol (2-MeBAL, Fig. 8b). To test the Influence of Adaptor XylB to the responses of biosensor XylS to benzoates, M9 minimal media containing benzoates were processed with the same procedure and then tested by biosensor XylS. Induction ratio was then compared to that without Adaptors’ treatments. It showed that E.coli double-transformed with the Adaptor 119-XylB and 114-XylC showed least interference to biosensor XylS’s responses to both benzoate (BzO, Fig. 8c) and its analog 2-methylbenzoate (2-MeBzO, Fig. 8d).

Therefore, using the fifth testing methods, biosensor XylS equipped with two Adaptors XylB and XylC could successfully respond to benzyl alcohols without perturbing its response to benzoates. The detection limit of benzyl alcohol was around "

PCR Amplification
In order to begin the cloning process, individual portions (amilCP, spisPink, PcArsR) of our insert must be amplified to facilitate digestion and ligation of our plasmid. This PCR involves two different primer pairs; one pair matches to the chromoproteins and the other matches to the arsenic regulator.
The basic PCR master mix includes 1x GoTaq Flexi Green Buffer, 0.2mM dNTPs, 2mM MgCl2, 1.25U GoTaq Polymerase, 1μM FWD primer, 1μM REV primer, 1ng template DNA, and molecular water to a final volume of 25μL.
The typical thermocycler protocol heats the reaction at 95C for 5 min. Then it cycles through steps of denaturing (95C for 60s), annealing (60C for 10s), and extension (72C for 30-60s) for 35 cycles. There is a final extension of 72C for 5 min before the reaction is complete and held at 10C.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," own RBS and a T7 terminator. We chose to use the same RBS's and terminator sequences as Kallio's group, as they had already tested the system. Our construct's terminator sequence is used in common cloning vectors (such as pET and pDF). Our second plasmid includes the same promoter, RBS’s, and terminator, but the genes AtoB, Hbd, Crt and Ter, which is a similar construct as the original one made by Kallio's group. We decided to add another promoter to the plasmid to create two operon systems. We did this to ensure that all the genes would be transcribed by the polymerase. The last genes in our second construct, ADO, PetF and Fpr function under the same promoter and induction systems as all the other genes.
Instead of Hbd, our Propane Plasmid 2 originally had FadB2 as the second gene. Hbd was originally used in Kallio's constructs, but FadB2 was used in an earlier experiment. Due to an error, FadB2 was built into our original construct instead of Hbd. According to literature, FadB2 had been shown to function in E. coli, but after the pathway's bottlenecks were modeled, it became clear that the enzyme's kinetics properties were a serious problem. We then changed this gene to Hbd in our constructs, which functioned much better according to our model.
Figure 4. Propane Plasmid 2
We first planned on creating a BioBrick from each of our genes and assembling the plasmids with the three antibiotics assembly method, but soon realized it would take too much time. We were then introduced to the Gibson Assembly system, and decided to give it a try. This is also when we decided to provide whole plasmids that would allow easy production of propane, rather than creating a separate brick of each of our genes.
So, we divided our whole plasmids into pieces of about 2000 bp each and included 30 bp overlaps into our gBlocks-to-be. This is when we also realized that synthesis isn’t as simple as it sounds: we had to optimize more than half of our sequences to be fit for gBlock synthesis. We will then proceed with NEBuilder kit , overlapping PCR (OE-PCR) and/or Exonuclease and Ligation-Independent Cloning (ELIC) to combine our constructs. We used multiple methods because of the time constraint and the fact that we didn't know which one would work the best."
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," centrifuge the cells to obtain higher densities. This caused interweaving of the flagella and single filaments were not visible anymore (B).
Results
For MG1655 nice pictures were obtained since the strain grew very fast and seems to be quite robust (Fig. 9). However, we were not able to obtain meaningful pictures showing flagella of the BL21 strain. Under stress conditions bacteria tend to lose their flagella very easily (Blum, 1971). Apparently the transport form our Lab to the EM-facility was enough to stress the BL21 E. coli. It appears that this demands quite something for MG1655 however, or the pictures we got from this strain were already in a stressed state and the flagella are usually even longer or more in number. We had a look at the different strains with a light microscope in our lab before the EM sessions and they were all motile. This consideration, that the cells were stressed during the transport was supported by their subsequent investigation under a light microscope. The cells were not motile anymore and featured very heterogeneous shapes whereby some formed very long rods. All these appearances are indications for stressed cells. Another problem with BL21 was the very low growth rate, since a high optical density is required in order to obtain an adequate number of cells during preparation. Therefore we had to centrifuge the cultures in some cases which ended up in interwoven filaments (Fig. 9).
In conclusion, we were not able to get informative data about the flagellar structures and morphologies, but we found out, that BL21 is very sensitive and drops its flagella in no time.

UESTC-Software
Gold Medal
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, two additional goals must be achieved:
1.Provide a convincing validation, testing the performance of the development -- experimentally (can be outsourced) or by other teams and users. Note, even if the algorithm or tool turns out not to work that well, the Gold requirement is fulfilled if the test is good and the analysis convincing. Validation may include: preferably experiments, informatics analysis (complexity, run time) of an algorithm, or user studies.
We have provided a convincing validation in the validation of our wiki. https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Validation.html
And the second goal can be any one of the following:
1.Make your software interact / interface with the Registry.
2.Re-use and further develop previous iGEM software projects (or parts thereof) or use and/or improvement of existing synthetic biology tools or frameworks.
3.Develop a well documented library or API for other developers (rather than “only” a stand-alone app for end users.)
Please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/API.html .
4.Support and use the SBOL and / or SBOLv standard.
5.iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
Silver Medal
1.Demonstrate the relevance of your development for Synthetic Biology based on standard Parts.
We have demonstrated the relevance of our development for Synthetic Biology based on standard Parts in the overview of our wiki. Please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Overview.html .
2.Provide a comprehensive and well-designed User Guide. (Be creative! An instructional video may work as well.)

Furthermore, it is able to predict the probable cleavage site of the signal peptide after its translocation into the ER. For all constructs, signal peptide functionality is predicted, as well as a potential cleavage site. The complete translated amino acid sequences of the respective receptor constructs were used as input. The algorithm for eukaryotes with default D-cutoff value was chosen.
Figure 2: A) Schematic depiction of a protein-coding mRNA containing a 5'- and 3'-UTR, the first of which being an important factor in translation efficiency. B) Identification of signal peptide functionality and cleavage site within the receptor construct containing the EGFR, Igκ and BM40 signal peptide via the SignalP 4.1 server. Plotted probabilities represent the raw cleavage site “C-score”, the signal peptide “S-score” and the combined cleavage site “Y-score”. C) ClustalW multiple  sequence alignment of the BM40, EGFR and Igκ signal peptide construct, depicting a gap for the EGFR-signal peptide construct compared to the newly designed ones, indicating smaller length of the 5'-UTR . For the Igκ and BM40 signal peptide constructs, a T7 promoter spacer as well as a Kozak sequence increase the distance between TATA-box and protein-coding region.
For all three signal peptides, the high S-score indicates high signal peptide functionality. For the Igκ signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 20 and 21 within the signal peptide is predicted. For the BM40 signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 17 and 18 is predicted, and for the EGFR signal peptide, a cleavage site between amino acid 24 and 25 is predicted.
Quantification of signal-peptide mediated translocation via a secretion luciferase assay
For the quantification of signal peptide functionality via a luciferase assay, three constructs were created and tested - each containing one of three signal peptides (the EGFR signal peptide, the Igκ signal peptide or the BM40 signal peptide) and a nanoluciferase as well as a CMV promoter, a Strep-tag II for immunochemical detection and the hGH polyadenylation signal sequence. Not containing a transmembrane domain, the nanoluciferase fusion protein is being translocated into the ER and then secreted into the medium. Using a luciferase assay, one can quantifiy the amount of luminescence - and thus, proportionally, the amount of secreted luciferase - by measuring the"

The goal of this activity is to promote the entrepreneurial culture in the development of synthetic biology, where the participation of school and graduation is also encouraged. Students are supported in the development of synthetic biology, laboratory techniques and promotion of entrepreneurial skills in order to enable students to develop innovative research results. The ultimate goal is to get businesses to support the best team.
In addition, the team invests in UC_iGEM they call synthetic sociology, where they try to make a ""constitutive expression of Synbio"" in Chile. They consider it early, exponential and adulthood. Planning to do this with society something analogous with the project developed, putting their outputs (people being informed and entering the synthetic biology) downstream to its endogenous machinery (schools, colleges etc). In the early stage the program called PENTA UC (Talents Development and Study Program at Catholic University) aims to educate creatively and proactively strengthen children and passion) develop children’s passion for knowledge. Simultaneously the PENTA program helps in personal development and across multiple disciplines and practical workshops that lead to potential growth of the student. One of the courses, called ""What if Dr. Frankenstein were alive today?"" Is designed to introduce children of 13 years practice and the theory of the foundations of genetic engineering. While that teaches how to deal with ethical issues to understand how you can work with genes and use them for the benefit of the human race. The exponenciasl phase comes to dialogue with other college courses on biotechnology and synthetic biology and how to see all courses involved in this way promote roundtables to discuss synthetic biology causing people to be interested not only in their field of specialization.

Theoretical background:
“Reactive astrocytes"" change their gene expression profile relative to quiescent astrocytes. Two such distinguishing genetic markers are Steap4 and Timp1 genes, expressed exclusively in reactive astrocytes1-4. Genetic reporter systems are widely used to study eukaryotic gene expression and cellular physiology.
Our promoter assay kit is a ""Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System"" of Promega. The term “dual reporter” refers to the simultaneous expression and measurement of two individual reporter enzymes within a single system.
Typically, the “experimental” reporter is correlated with the effect of specific experimental conditions, while the activity of the co-transfected “control” reporter provides an internal control that serves as the baseline response. Normalizing the activity of the experimental reporter to the activity of the internal control minimizes experimental variability caused by differences in cell viability or transfection efficiency.
Thus, dual-reporter assays often allow more reliable interpretation of the experimental data by reducing external influences.
We used pGL3 series of firefly and Renilla luciferase vectors for the DLR™ Assay Systems. Our vectors are:

Overview: The red light producer
Firefly luciferase (EC 1.13.12.7 ) from Photinus pyralis is one of the most efficient bioluminescent proteins known. Its emission peak is about 557nm at pH 7.8 (this is the ordinary internal pH of E. coli during growth). We submitted a mutant luciferase which produces red light, in order to activate the red light sensor part (which responds optimally to 660nm light).
Previous works such as Branchini et al. (2007) and Moradi et al. (2009) have already identified several luciferase mutants that produce red light. We used site-directed mutagenesis on the wild type to produce three different red light mutants, the emission spectra of which are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 :
Substitution mutant S284T
Insertion mutant 356K
Insertion mutant 356R

Strategy
As stated above, we used site-directed mutagenesis on the wildtype to produce three different red light mutants. We successfully produced two red mutants of the firefly luciferase: mutants 356K"
