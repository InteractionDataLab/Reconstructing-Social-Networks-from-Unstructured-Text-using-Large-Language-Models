CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Software#Synbiobot_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d instantaneously be available on our app.
We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to support biologically active systems, such as cultures [2]. Each bioreactor typically has one population where the product from one reactor is fed into another until the final product is created [2]. With Oscillate, there would be no need for multiple bioreactors since there would be the possibility of collapsing multiple bioreactors into one co-culture reactor. The product from one population feeds the next within the same reactor until the final product is produced.
Application 2: Biological Clocks
We also considered the idea of biological clocks. Biological clocks are innate mechanisms that control the cyclic activities of an organism [1]. One commonly discussed example of a biological clock is circadian rhythm, which is the 24-hour cycle of physiological processes in an organism. The main issue that arises with biological clocks is that when they become irregular, processes that should occur on a cycle are disrupted [1]. This negatively affects sleep cycles, digestion, body temperature, and other important functions that could lead to diseases such as diabetes, depression, and sleep disorders. The current solution is to treat the resulting symptoms with medication rather than the underlying causes. Medications are developed to help with sleep, to regulate insulin, or to produce antidepressant hormones. However, they never address the root cause: irregular biological clocks.
Using Oscillate, cells could sense when a cycle is irregular via frequency sensing and then respond accordingly. This would adjust the clock itself instead of simply treating the symptoms, thus reducing the need for additional medication and the risk of several disorders. One of the biggest impacts this could have is on sleep. Many people struggle with a regular sleep cycle, which could result in a lot of other problems [3]. With Oscillate, the hormones that promote sleep could be produced on a regular cycle and get people the sleep they need.
Application 3: Cell Therapy
Finally, the last topic we explored was cell therapy. Cell therapies use therapeutics at a cellular level in order to treat diseases [5]. Relevant uses today include stem cell therapy, cancer targeting, and hormonal therapy. Although there have been promising results with these therapies, there are also many issues, ranging from insufficient response to rejection to insufficient means of control [5]. Instead, simple dose-dependent administered drugs and other medicines are currently still being developed to combat these diseases.
Using Oscillate, frequency could be used to control the cells involved in these therapies. The frequency would penetrate the human tissue and offer more precise control over the therapies, such as where the cells are going and when they get activated. This could be extremely relevant in oncology, where T-cells have been modified to"

Dextran is indeed a good choice of hydrogel considering its biocompatibility and affinity for glucose.
Follow-up
We researched skin infections and kidney failure as potential applications.
We focused on applications in which bacteria can produce useful products.
May Brainstorm sessions
Inspired by the Dutch iGEM meet-up and by our participation in the TU/e Contest  , we were determined to find an application relevant to society. During several brainstorm and literature sessions, we composed a list of possible applications. Inspired by work performed by previous iGEM teams,  the experts we talked to during the Dutch meet-up and by our meeting with professor Dankers, we decided to investigate bacterial sensors (malaria, urea, scabies), kidney failure, water filtration, bone infections, vaccines, eczema and wound infections.
May 22, 2018. Netherlands Biotechnology Congress
Our first conference! With the other Dutch iGEM teams, we were invited to present a poster at the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress. During the several talks we learned about new developments in biotechnology and public acceptance of GMOs. The highlight of the day was an intriguing talk by Marc Lynas, a British environmental activist and journalist who explained how he moved from violently opposing GMO crops to supporting them. The conference also offered a platform to discuss our project with biotechnologists and with the overgrad winning team of iGEM 2017, TU Delft. After a few drinks and a good meal, we returned home with a lot of new insights.

Insights
The several experts we talked to made us aware of various technical issues we needed to address:
How will we prevent the penetration of other bacteria into the patch?
How will we prevent unlimited proliferation/overcrowding of the gel?
Will E. coli consume the dextran gel?
From team TU Delft 2017, we learned that iGEM is not fond of GMOs in the human body. On the skin is a more realistic option.
Several experts stressed that they like the safety introduced by our adhesin system. They suggested to upgrade previous projects in terms of safety.
Follow-up

Introduce the concept of synthetic biology, the principle of iGEM and our latest work to the community.
Lecture in Jinling High School
On the afternoon of 18th September, the volunteers of our iGEM team gave a lecture at Jinling High School in downtown Nanjing.  We introduced the basic knowledge of molecular and synthetic biology to the students, and helped them comprehend how to modify Salmonella Typhimurium through molecular experiments to increase their ability of tumor targeting and decrease their toxicity in order to be suitable for clinical treatments.  We later presented iGEM High School Division part which they showed great interest in.  We encouraged them to take part in the division and would like to help them with all our efforts.  After the lecture, we had a great time talking with the students.  They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.
Communication with Southeast University (SEU)
On 20th September, 3 members of our team went to SEU and had a seminar with students there.  They knew our work quite well because we had cooperation with the iGEM team of SEU during the summer vacation.  We mainly introduced some characteristics of bacteria therapy from other normal therapies like high colonization and capability of carrying multiple exogenous genes of bacteria.  During the seminar, they raised many valuable questions and offered many suggestions on our experiment methods.  We further discussed on the safety problems of bacteria therapy and came up with some ideas trying to solve them.
Lecture in Nanjing University
On 21st September, we presented our work to the teachers and students of School of Life Science in Nanjing University on Xianlin Campus.  We introduced the advantages for VNP20009, the bacteria we used, to be applied in bacteria treatment and the detailed method to optimize the bacteria, which is to screen auxotrophic strains and transfect anaerobic promoters into the bacteria to enhance their efficiency of tumor targeting and killing cancer cells.  In the end of our lecture, we made our outlook on the future of tumor targeting therapy with bacteria.  The professors gave high praises on our work and offered many constructive comments.

According to Schwartz, Helinski, 1971, 0.15 [mm^2/h] However, it is not the condition of semi-agarose gel. Hence, we decided the parameter range 0.05~0.5, around its value.
Future work: further model estimation
There are a lot of parameters that have not been determined yet. However, some of them can be determined by experiment.
Parameters on AHL(K, delta) can be calculated just like below.
Method
1. Construct the first strategy.
2. Varying pH (or construction itself), measure the concentration at the equilibrium point.
In a article, they estimated the parameter gamma in this way [9] . However, its model is different from ours.
If we can find this point from the experiment, some parameters can be estimated.  In the experiment, we vary the expression rate of colicin by the selection of promoter. This relates varying ${\kappa}$; from dimensionalized form, when the expression rate increase, ${\kappa}$ would be decreased. Prepare two or more systems that have different promoter, and there appears two equation, which kappa is different from each other. ${\kappa}$ is inverse proportion to the strength of the promoter, so the relationship between those two different ${\kappa}$ can be estimated. Since , there arise three equations, and we can determine those three values."
Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Discussion Session
After the lecture, we held an discussion session in which we freely talked about multidiscipline studies with our audiance. Biology is full of amazing questions, ones that can be seen from other perspectives, with tools of other subjects. These approaches can often sparkle new ideas and discoveries.
We introduced our own project, and demonstrated how mathematics help us investigate the system of living things. Probablity theory, information theory, ect. all make our project different. They asked us questions about the rationale of our design, showing great interest. One freshmen from Department of Automation later told us that she had never heard of such amazing things before, and that we opend up a whole new door for her.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching"

Public Engagement
Over the course of the summer we were lucky enough to interact with and share our project with people in our community.
SynBioBeta
In July we attended the SynBioBeta Activate conference at the University of Edinburgh King’s Buildings. Highlights were hearing Emily Leproust from Twist Bioscience, Axel Trefzer from ThermoFisher and Kevin Munnelly from Gen9 do a panel discussion on DNA data storage. It was encouraging to hear the leaders in DNA synthesis speak about how DNA is the future of data storage.
During breaks and the networking lunch we walked around and talked to people about our project. Naturally, many attendees were familiar with iGEM and were quire excited to hear about our project. We printed out flyers before the day to hand out so people could find out more about our project. Although engagement is often seen to be an opportunity to share synthetic biology with non-experts, we really enjoyed engaging with professionals in the synthetic biology community and getting their feedback!
National Library of Scotland: Learning at Work Week
As part of our collaboration with the National Library of Scotland, we were invited to give a workshop during their “Learning at Work Week”. We put together a presentation including the background to our project, the basics of the biology and what we had achieved over the course of the summer.
The workshop also included an interactive activity that demonstrated the data-DNA encoding and decoding process. The audience was split up into small groups of 3, each group also included a member of our team. The groups had a basket of DNA bases printed on paper – synthetic nucleotides, if you will – that they had to put together and encode to the words in a given sentence. This demonstrated how depending on the length of a DNA fragment, the number of possible encoding changes. This process mirrored ours at the start of the summer when we were determining the content of a BabbleBrick.
After ‘assembling’ their new BabbleBricks together, another group had to decode"
Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to gather Diabetes stakeholders with diabetic people to provide better tools and applications to ease diabetics everyday life. Our integration with the organisation was very satisfying because it meant that the FFD considered our project and saw a possible application in Diabetes prevention. We will therefore work in sessions with the organisation meeting with diabetics and specialists to bring our will and energy to the fight against Diabetes.
High School and Conferences
One experience that we particularly enjoyed was the supervision of students during the practical course in microbiology with iGEM UPMC ( See our Collaborations page ).     They invited us to participate in the framing of practical work in a scientific course in Montrouge High School in Paris. They have developed protocols in order to explain the genotype/phenotype relation to students through mutagenesis in yeast in two different sessions. We used a yeast strain called Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ade2- which accumulates a metabolite that turns red because of oxidation giving the yeast its red color. Supported by UV mutagenesis, this toxic compound causes mutations of the mitochondrial oxidative chain reversing the yeast color back to white. Through this experiment, we introduced the students to the possibilities of bio-engineering and synthetic biology through the iGEM competition. Becoming a teacher after years of studies and sharing knowledge was very rewarding to us. It is an accomplishment to be recognized as a qualified person to assume the responsibility for school courses. Students really enjoyed our teaching methods and the exchange was amazing. They enjoyed meeting older students because the context is different from standard classes. The proximity with us allowed them to communicate and ask many questions around fields of study in biology and jobs.
National Contest of Scientific Mediation of AFNEUS
AFNEUS is the French acronym for the National Federation of Science Students. This federation aims to develop interest around Science through scientific communities in Universities and to build a synergy across the country. It represents Science Students officially and contributes politically to the improvement of student’s life. AFNEUS accompanies them in their formation proposing events and conferences around Science to promote knowledge.
The federation launched the first edition of a competition called the National Contest of Scientific Mediation organised with the French National Institute of Research (CNRS) and other personalities of science communication. Several associations of the federation at the national scale participated and among them us from iGEM Evry Paris-Saclay. Each association was represented by one member through several preliminary phases to reach the final contest in a congress at Nantes, France. Each participant had 8 minutes to present in front of a jury a subject chosen at random among several field such as Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry"

We used this protocol to successfully make a new part BBa_K1845000 which we submitted to the registry.
Following this initial protocol we tweaked the reaction protocols to optimise 10ul reactions and test the use of PEG to speed up the reaction. We used the ""Quick SPLiCE"" reaction protocol, comparing +/- PEG8000. PEG 8000 is a crowding agent that by reducing the amount of free water in the system (used for the solvation shell of PEG) increases the effective concentration of the reaction components. We used 3ul of the SPLiCE/SLiCE reaction for a total of 30ng of vector DNA (100ng in the 10ul reaction) and plated all the cells (500ul from 50ul of competent cells resuspended in 450ul of 2xTY). Control had water in place of PEG. A picture of the colonies and the colony count is displayed below.

Discussion
We are excited of having developed this new assembly method into the framework of the biobrick assembly. All the parts formed are compatible with RFC10 and contain the correct restriction sites. This method only utilises 21 bases of homology, allowing to assemble DNA parts already containing the biorick prefix and suffix, hence without changing the design or established standard. The parts created are ultimately equivalent to a Gibson reaction, with the advantage of utilising E. coli cell lysate instead of an expensive highly purified reaction mixture. We believe that this method will be of great utility for the DIYbio community, and we are now testing it in a variety of conditions. This will make sure to obtain cross-reproducibility and an easy to use method - exponentially cuttind down the cost of DNA assembly for an amateur and professional audience.
We successfully assembled a biobrick part using the SLiCE method and submitted it to the iGEM registry. We optimised this reaction to speed up the ligation using PEG8000, cutting down the reaction time to a 10 minute one pot reaction. We called this assembly ""SPLiCE"" which also stands for ""Seamless PEG-mediated Ligation Cell Extract"" - with the ""P"" also conveniently standing for ""Presto!""

    Guided by the head of the R&D department, we visited the company's laboratories, learning a lot about some high-tech equipment. In the conference room of the R&D department, we conducted a far-reaching discussion with the person in charge. He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.

Biofilm PFA fixation before staining
We wanted to avoid biofilm damage or loss during these steps. In order to do that, we used Bouin solution to fix the formed biofilm after 24 and 48 hours of culture (Figure 17). Biofilms were then either stained with crystal violet 0.1% and resuspended in acetic acid 30% or directly resuspended in PBS 1X.  Surprisingly, with this method, the biofilm formation was higher when cultivated with cell extracts containing RIP. For now, we are not able to explain why.
Figure 17: Biofilm culture fixed with Bouin's solution in 96-well microtiter plate
With more time, we would certainly have been able to optimize our protocols to best fit with the strain we use, but for the time being, we are not able to give a final conclusion on whether or not our RIP peptide inhibits S. aureus biofilm formation.
Potential ideas for improvement would first be to better standardize starting amounts of biofilm cultures. Secondly, to find more gentle planktonic cells removal methods. Thirdly, better staining methods in order to get better absorbance readouts that can also take into account biofilm formation on the walls of the 96-wells plate and not only on its floor. Finally, the use of RIP peptides that have been processed through the export machinery and that would be cleaved from their export signal might have higher activities.

This was an expected output for the model. This comparison between just 2 selected outputs, details the variation between very small changes in the initial conditions and how they affect the behaviour of the model.
Assumptions and Complications
The modelling was based on a set of assumptions and there were a variety of complications that were neglected to simplify the model initially. Any further work would have included more of these complications to match the real biological system.
The theory based on the system was based on a unicellular system however the concentrations used are for multicellular environments. The cell’s own pH was assumed to be similar to deionised water when referring to the degradation of arabinose inside the cell. The diffusion of arabinose within the cell was assumed to be instantaneous, moreover that once the arabinose has entered the cell it would remain intracellular. In addition to this, the diffusion of compounds within the cell to the right place was deemed as instantaneous, i.e. space in the model was neglected. There is also an equilibrium created between L-arabinose (the particular structure that induces pBAD) and L-ribulose [1], so as increased concentrations of the arabinose is added there is a shift to create L-ribulose (which is another sugar that would have been consumed by the cell). This means that the arabinose concentration may decrease slightly before the equilibrium stabilises. In our case we assumed that this shift, again, was instantaneous [1]. The degradation of arabinose was to include any consumption or use of it in other metabolic pathways in the cell.
Also it was presumed that there were infinite supplies of ribosome and ribosome binding sites available and that the RNA polymerase would not become degraded.  A condition we placed on the model, as well as assumed, was that the maximal transcription rate is always greater than the half-maximal transcription rate as this makes logical sense. Dissociation and association constants of the AraC protein from the half-sites were neglected at this stage as were investigating the simplest setup of the biology. This particular process is reasonably slow and would have caused a time lag in the initial stages.
Conclusions
Based on our current results, we were not able to find conclusive data. The next stage would have been to look at the stability of the system and which rate values the model would have behaved as expected or become oscillatory.

There is no procedure to examine if the sources contain genetic modified materials for high-level processed products. However, we can examine the sources by strict tracking system.
The legal basis of check, registration and border inspection
According to the Food Sanitation and Safety Regulation, if the material before didn’t pass risk assessment, genetically modified food can’t be sell to the market.
In terms of the registration before the product are sell to the market, if our nation has the raw material certified by certain international standards, the raw material can be processed to processed food without another certification .If the raw material is not given the certification, it cannot be used to be the material of processed food in our nation. TFDA does sample survey on commercial available food every year. They check if those foods comply with labeling regulation.
Border inspection
According to the Food Sanitation and Safety Regulation, imported genetic modified products with the certification should be classified into Customs Classification of Products Columns. Importer should apply inspection to the authorities and declare the information of the products.
The estimation of border inspection
Both domestic and foreign companies should carry out inspection, so it complies with the principle of non-discrimination. However, there is no genetic modified raw material produced in Taiwan, therefore, the regulation only effects foreign companies. Moreover, in order to avoid our product being hold under inspection, we must go through the risk assessments that take an average of a year to go through. It is necessary to focus on the number of the cases reviewed and the time that takes for assessing in order to avoid unnecessary detention.
Tracking
The purpose:
When there are problems on food safety, it’s easier to know the source fo the product
Enhance monitoring quality
Strengthen risk assessment under the concept of prevention
Correct labeling ensures consumers to get correct information for them to select.
The information circulation between companies is the basis of tracking.
Conclusion
The genetic modified food regulation in Taiwan does not violate SPS or TBT in general. Some details can be adjusted to avoid controversy. The food safety regulation should clarify consumers’ right to know and select by implanting the labeling system. It can not only strengthen the food safety system but ensure the coordination to international trade regulation.

This DNA part will encode for an RNA riboswitch senstive to theophylline. The RBS is not exposed in the absence of theophylline. When theophylline is present, it binds to the riboswitch and causes a conformational change which leads to the exposure of the RBS and consequently translation of the adjoining gene. In this case, the gene which will be expressed is CheZ, which is a protein fundamental to bacterial movement. This theophylline riboswitch (type1) CheZ fusion BioBrick activates the expression of the CheZ gene in a theophylline-dependent fashion. It is composed of a theophylline-sensitive riboswitch clone 8.1 (Topp and Gallivan JACS 2007; BBa_K249026 and BBa_K411001) that is detached from its associated translation unit (coding region) and fused to a CheZ gene which has a N-fusion prefix and lacks a stop codon (although a TAG stop codon is provided by the RFC 25 suffix). The riboswitch regulated N-terminal part can be fused to a reporter or other CDS.
CheZ is the chief regulator of the molecular events that lead the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella motor during the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E.coli. This counter clockwise flagella motor rotation results in bacterial swimming (instead of tumbling) in the presence of a chemoattractant (in this case, theophylline).

to Release Lactase to Treat Lactose Intolerance
Lactose intolerance is often caused by the lack of lactase in the small intestine mucosa, leading to dyspepsia and malabsorption of lactose. Clinical symptoms include abdominal distention, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. Chinese severely lack lactase, and lactose intolerance is relatively common, bringing great suffering to patients’ life.
At present the treatments of lactose intolerance are to reduce the lactose intake, to add lactase long-term, and to give probiotic products, which are not able to achieve sustainable and effective results.
To solve above problems, we propose using genetic engineering technology, transmitting plasmids carrying a lactase gene and a suicide gene into E. coli K12 strains. Patients take genetically modified strains of the bacter"

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb. The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

3. The length that can be recognized is not strictly twelve or fourteen. According to the published results, the length of recognition sequence are dependent on the number of monomer.
We can gather 96 bioparts based on Freiburg, and each part has its counterproductive sticky ends base on certain location(1,2,3,4,5 or 6). By picking every two bases on certain location, we are able to design one TALE protein sequence.
Previous Review: Freiburg’s way of connection
The main principle of connection is built upon the idea of Golden Gate Connection.( Sanjana, N. E. et al. A transcription activator-like effector toolbox for genome engineering. Nature Protocols 7, 171–192 (2012).)
The key point of their procedures is a type II Restriction Enzyme, BsmBI enzyme.
Figure 1.4.3 BsmBI recognition site
The main feature of this enzyme is that the recognition sequence is on only one side of cleavage site. It provides the way which can be used to get certain sticky ends with out breaking the whole sequence. The sticky end has 4bp, and it could be designed for combination of multiple sticky ends. That feature is excellent at first, but we cannot ignore its latent shortcomings.
Let’s analyze the example (AA1) provided by Freiburg.
Figure 1.4.4 DNA sequence of AA1 part
The underlined sequence is recognized by BsmBI. Vertical bar(|) is the cutting position. As for this sample, TGAC is one sticky end which can combine with six other sticky ends.
Evaluate seven sticky ends designed by 2012 Freiburg
2012 Freiburg's parts have seven sticky ends:
TGAC,GCTC,CTTG,GCTT,ACTG,CCTG,ACTC
We all know that certain two parts can combine together, under the principle of complementary base pairing. However, is it possible that not totally matched sticky ends can bind together? We found, in fact, the more similar they are, the more possibility that they can form new but incorrect base pairs.    Inspired by BLAST algorithm, we evaluated the similarity of every pair of sticky ends.
Figure 1.4.5 Strict rules score table
The higher score, the higher similarity, and the higher possibility of mismatch.     The table shows that more than 30"

The tetR protein might be poisonous to the E.coli, when the promoter is deleted by lox71 site, the bacteria will get the survival advantage and quickly occupy the dominant position in LB medium. Therefore, we recommend that you save the plasmid rather than bacteria when you use the cre/lox system.

Li Siting
I'm Li Siting, major in Automation. With the love for both programming and biology, I developed the online E.coli War game in JavaScript. Then I came up with the idea of analogizing our game about bacteria’s competition to the typical history events. I drafted the descriptions and designed pictures for our game and discovery on wiki. As I am good at writing, I wrote our visiting plan for a company, presentation advertisement and designed an exhibition board for science museum. With the crazy love for softball, I want to say playing softball helps me to be very energetic and proactive. Photography is also my hobby.

ULB-Brussels,2012,Team:ULB-Brussels#Conclusion_-_-_TEXT.html," the way our competition experiments have been thought does not strictly represent what is found in nature. Putting 2 microcins producing bacteria in direct contact would apply a strong selective pressure on both of them. That selective pressure could lead to gene rearrangements in the integron that could never have been seen in the environment.
     Secondly, it has already been proven that the integron is a powerful tool when it comes to optimize pathways. Bikard et al. (2010) managed to use the integron to enhance tryptophan production in bacteria. The experimental set up was similar to ours albeit with a few differences. The 5 genes from the tryptophan operon were packaged into gene cassettes: the genes of interests were preceded by an RBS and followed by an attC recombination site. The different cassettes were then assembled in an integron on a plasmid and in an arbitrary order. To make sure that the primary gene order could not allow tryptophan production, 2 transcription terminator cassettes were assembled along with the gene cassettes. Tryptophan auxotroph Escherichia coli strains were transformed with the plasmid and with another plasmid containing the integrase controlled by a PBAD promoter. After an overnight culture with arabinose, tryptophan prototrophs were recovered by the researchers. The tryptophan productions were measured and some prototrophs had productions that ranged from 4-fold less to a 2.8-fold more than the original strain carrying the natural tryptophan operon. Bikard et al. used the characteristics of an auxotroph strain to isolate tryptophan producing cells. Similarly, we proposed to put bacteria in competition to isolate microcin producing cells.
     To conclude, according to our model (see modeling section) it would not be possible to select any population producing a higher amount of microcin in our competition assays. Actually, it seems that the subpopulations of bacteria producing lower amounts of one microcin type would be selected as well as those producing larger amount of microcin. The bacteria producing low amounts would benefit from the protection granted by the high producers. Moreover, the selection pressure of this model should be the resistance of the bacteria and not the production. Putting a sensitive or lightly immune bacterial strain in competition with a microcin producing strain, will have the same results except that the selection pressure should be on the production of microcin. On the other hand, we could select the subpopulation that produces the largest amount of microcin according to"

OpenScope: Experience the Accessible
Problem Statement
Microscopy has had a major impact on science and society since its invention in the 1600s, revealing a previously undiscovered world and leading to an explosion in ideas on the future possibilities of such imaging systems. Despite this, more that 400 years later, microscopy is still a tool reserved for those with the means to invest. Microscopes for tens of thousands of pounds can be found in professional research labs being used for some fantastic, but generally publicly removed, work. We want this to change: making microscopy a tool accessible to anyone, no matter their occupation or what they wish to do with it.
Fluorescence Microscopy has become a fundamental analytical tool in biology: from clinical diagnostics to research environments. Fluorescent molecules have replaced the use of radioactive materials for research scientists, allowing the tracking of specific molecules within a biological system. The field of synthetic biology extensively utilises fluorescence imaging, but in a way that is contrary to its ethos of accessibility and public engagement.  We aim to increase the public’s awareness of synthetic biology by redesigning a generally inaccessible research tool to highlight the importance of microscopy in science.
What are the current options?
Fig. 1: Comparison of characteristics for several microscopes.
In Fig. 1 each microscope has several attributes that make it well suited to its specific niche. It is well known that commercial microscopes are able to produce immensely high quality images and will always be indispensable research tools. However, it is also clear that they have several undesirable qualities, decreasing their appeal to some users. For comparison we have the low cost, light-weight and easy to use alternatives. These microscopes are created to specifically fulfil their one objective: The FoldScope (a disposable educational tool and potential diagnostic tool); the FlyPi (for fluorescence macro-imaging of Drosophila flies) and the smartphone microscope (for low resolution imaging using your phone). OpenScope is intended as a more"

BioAccumulation
File:TUM13 General principle of accumulation of persistent chemicals along the food chain.jpg
Figure 1: General principle of accumulation of persistent chemicals along the food chain.
Bioaccumulation is a difficult concept to define. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010 defines bioaccumulation as a “general term describing a process by which chemicals are taken up by an organism either directly from exposure to a contaminated medium or by consumption of food containing the chemical”. The majority of definitions is aimed at the build up of persistent chemicals such as DDT, PBC or dioxins along the food chain (see figure 1), where the pollutants accumulate in predators until they become toxic. This can lead to the local and global extinction of species and health problems for humans. As most of these persistent chemicals are not biodegradable a different approach is necessary.
Figure 2: Principle of our bioaccumulation system.
Using our transgenic moos ( Physcomitrella patens ) as a chassis, we can produce effectors for specific binding of pollutants. For the sustained removal of the target pollutant the effectors must be membrane-anchored, in contrast to the cytoplasmic or secretory localization of biodegrading effectors. The membrane association ensures the fixation of the pollutant to the membrane after successful binding. Internalisation of the effectors either results in metabolism or accumulation of the pollutant in the transgenic plant cell. In case of accumulation, controlled disposal of the plants in the filter would be necessary.
There is a broad range of natural as well as engineered binding proteins available. Natural binding proteins act as a model and initiator in design of new artificial binding proteins combining research in different fields of biotechnology. Lipocalins"

Threshold device
In the threshold device, we need to prove that the in-promoter will have different responses corresponding to different plasmid numbers. In our project, we use the inhibitor protein as the signal. We combined the wet experiment results and the mathematical model to prove our system can work in order. We divided it into two main goals:
(1) To prove that inhibitor’s concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
(2) To prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Results:
1. Simulated the production of inhibitors with different concentrations by adding different concentrations of arabinose
2. Found out the concentrations of inhibitor under different concentrations of arabinose and used the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit.
3. Employed plasmids with different copy numbers and simulated the concentrations of plasmids losing on different levels
4. Employed different RBS and promoters with different strengths to change the inhibitor concentration
Experimental details [Expand]
Build result
1. Constructing the circuits.
We used PBAD promoters in all three circuits. All the circuits contain a B0034 and a B0015. [BBa_K2120303] [BBa_K2120304] [BBa_K2120304]
Fig. 1 Arabinose induced expression cassette of three kinds of inhibitors
We used the red fluorescent protein to replace the killer gene and constructed three circuits [BBa_K2120301] with different in-promoters (controlled by inhibitors). Two of them [BBa_I13521] [BBa_I6031] comes from DNA Distribution kit.
Fig. 2 In-promoter controlled expression cassette of RFP. RFP is used to replace killer gene.
And we separately assembled the two devices.
Fig. 3 Assembly of inhibitor and in-promoter. They can be used to test the minimum arabinose concentration which can totally repress the expression of RFP.
But when we added the arabinose, the RFP intensity increased, and it contradicted with expected results. We thought the terminator cannot completely isolate the two devices. So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. [BBa_K2120310] ["

BioBricking the genes NisT, NisI, NisP and the combined genes NisF,  NisE and NisG gave problems with illegal restriction sites.
The illegal restrictionsite in NisI could be removed using the reverse primer as listed above. This primer contains a mutation needed to remove the illegal restriction site.
The other parts gave more problems, as these all contained multiple restriction sites. Therefore, it was decided to use Gibson assembly with primers containing mutations to remove the restriction site. By using Gibson assembly, the genes could also be constructed in pSB1C3 in one go.
The primers in the table below are denoted with the position of the  illegal restriction site that they should remove. Illegal EcoRI sites  are abbreviated with an E, XbaI sites with an X, SpeI site with an S and  PstI sites with a P.

Intra-Provincial Collaboration
IISc Bangalore: Modelling
In terms of modelling, we created a system that was modelled the buoyancy of GVP proteins, independently of diffusion. We had assumed that diffusion plays a negligible role in the overall speed of the E. coli bacteria that eventually rise to the top. However, after collaborating with the IISc Bangalore 2017 team, who is also working with gas vesicles, they informed us that diffusion plays a significant role in the buoyancy of the bacteria. They highlighted this importance by their Peclet number (Pe) calculation: the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity by the flow to the rate of diffusion of the same quantity driven by an appropriate gradient. When they calculated this number for very similar environmental conditions as ours, they found that this number was on the order of 10^(-3), a lot smaller when compared to 1. This evidently suggested that diffusion is dominant over adjective transfer and must be considered during our calculations.
Since the IISc team was also working with gas vesicles, our collaboration did not stop at modelling. Over the course of the iGEM period, our team continued to discuss experiment plans, objectives, results and tips that could help the both teams succeed. In the future, Team UAlberta and Team IISc will continue to benefit heavily by combining their manpower and resources to strive for the goals collectively.
UrbanTundra Edmonton, Sister Team
Throughout the course of the summer, the members of Team UrbanTundra had become an extended part of our iGEM family. In both general lab training and the InterLab Study did we develop a robust collaboration. A large majority of UrbanTundra had not had previous experience with the techniques of molecular biology. So, as many of members of Team UAlberta had been in the same boat in iGEM 2016, we were glad to help acquaint UrbanTundra with the skills they would need. Over a series of several days did we train their members in the various laboratory protocols that are commonly used in synthetic biology. This included guiding them through a workflow which"

Collaboration with CIDEB-UANL Team
We conducted a training workshop to get team CIDEB-UANL ready for the [ IGEM HSD 2012 ] and [ IGEM HSD 2013 ]. They did great! They came 2nd runner up in the competition and were awarded with best model and honorable mention for best presentation. This year, we continued mentoring them, and we are very proud to say they were again finalists, and ended 2nd runner up!
Collaboration with National Polytechnic Institute
First of all, we attended to the first forum of Synthetic Biology at the National Polytechnic Institute - Interdisciplinary Professional Unit of Biotechnology (IPN - UPIBI ) on 7 and 8 August 2013 where we met various personalities of the field such as Dr. Augustino Martínez, MB José Antonio Pavón , Gerónimo Villanueva , Dr. Osvaldo Reséndiz and Dr. Pablo Padilla , and other IGEM teams . The UANL_Mty – Mexico’s iGEM team gave a presentation about what is iGEM and the challenges a team faces when they perform synthetic biology. We answered questions and encouraged young people to adventure into the Synthetic Biology field. We agreed to establish a permanent  collaboration network with the IPN students.

Now, based on our equations, we can run simulations to estimate αY, the parameter of interest of our model. For that, we decided to try to find the maximum αY that will, according to our model, fit the EC50 time and the maximum value of ρ.
For that, we must assume a new assumption: That all the proteins in the systems (synthases, receptors and reporters) are approximately equal, therefore we can say that their production and degradation rates are the same, if not explicitly given a value.At first, we defined our parameters based on literature values. (To know precisely the parameters used in the runs, see the table at the end of the page).
After establishing the parameters of interest, we created an algorithm that will receive the EC50 time (tEC50) and the maximum ρ (MAX) and return the values of αY. The algorithm is resumed at the flowchart below:
In this flow chart, we can see the process of the algorithm's workings. Where a parallelogram represents the initial data, round rectangles represent processes and diamonds represent decision processes. Af is used as αY and ε is a small increase. From that, we’ve been able to, comparing to our data and using some literature data as proxy, estimate the alphas!
We've been able to predict the values of α and, also, estimate a basal expression, called now γ, for each promoter, by adding a single term in the differential equation:
The first value represents the value of γ and the second of α.

Johns_Hopkins-BAG,2009,Team:Johns Hopkins-BAG#Synthetic Yeast Genome_-_-_TEXT.html," A FLO8 gene has been added; this gene allows yeast to grow and organize into “fuzzy” structures similar to mold, technically referred to as pseudohyphae.
We are doing experiments to initiate recombination in the presence of both FLO8 and the synthetic chromosome, which contains a number of genes required for fuzziness.  A control group of fuzzy yeast (with no synthetic chromosome) should not respond to the addition of hormone.  The experimental group should show a reduction in colony count, varying colony size, as well as a mix of fuzzy and non-fuzzy colonies.  This should show that recombination is occurring and can be controlled.
What do we have so far?
Most of the left arm of chromosome three, and all right arm of chromosome nine have been constructed and assembled. We submitted most of the left arm of chromosome three as can be seen in the diagram below:
Most of Chunks A1-D3 of the Left arm of Chromosome III have been submitted

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.

For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)
LED
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0v, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce"

Or may because the type of bacteria--Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been used in this method before, and the plasmid vitality in the bacteria is lower than in Escherichia coli. We are searching for other reasons, like the promotor strength, codon degeneracy and so on. We will solve the problem in the future.

USTC-China,2012,Team:USTC-China#groupmeetings_-_-_TEXT.html,"pRM is activated by the protein cI. By adding IPTG, plac is activated, which leads to the production of the protein cI. With the existence of cI, pRM-RFP starts to work. Therefore, we can test the function of pRM by comparing the intensity of RFP with and without IPTG.
b.Repression to the translation of cro by antisense RNA
⑴.Design an effective antisense RNA:
i). Length of asRNA. Use all the sequence of cro, or cut some fragments of different length?
ii).Formation of secondary structure.
iii).Excluding the cleavage sites.
⑵.Construct the fusion protein cro-gfp.
⑶.Construct the genetic circuit:
By adding IPTG, plac is activated, which leads to the transcription of Anti-cro. We can test whether Anti-cro is able to repress the translation of cro by comparing the intensity of cro-RFP.
c.Function of cII
The promoter PRM can transcript to the left with the assistance of protein cII. In that case, antisense RNA of cro is transcripted and protein cI is produced. However, it’s difficult to test the function of cII.
d.Suicide——lysis
The gene lysis can cause the suicide of E.coli. Likewise, IPTG activates plac, producing cI to activate pRM. Then lysis is expressed and E.coli will suicide.
In case of the leak expression of plac, we can improve the circuit with the aid of promoter T7, which is activated only when T7 polymerase expresses.
e. AHL Quorum Sensing
To build an “alarm system” in E.coli, we also use AHL Quotum Sensing system. When some of the E.colis are infected by λ phage, they use AHL to “warn” the others.
B. Parts to use:
BBa_I12006：activated by lamda repressor (cI) and repressed by 434 repressor (cI)；
BBa_I12007：activated but not repressed by the lambda repressor (cI)

2.Code-circuit
We use three kinds of informational molecules: AHL, Ara and IPTG as “keys” to the code-circuit.Only when the three materials are added in the right order, GFP can express. Otherwise, the promoters below are activated and lysis expresses to cause the suicide of E.coli.
However, we need to consider how fast the three informational molecules can combine with the corresponding"

Q2. How frequent do you have meal in lab (excluding the situation if you have the meal in a separated resting room)
A. I had meal in lab almost every day.
B. I often had meal in lab.
C. I only have meal in lab when I have no alternative choices.
D. I have never had and never will have meal in lab.
E. Other situation
Some experiments have special requirements for time management. Sometimes experiments can last for so long that students have little time finishing their lunch. For the labs without a separate room for resting, students might choose to have lunch in the lab. However, most of them know that it's harmful. 38.75% of the students had never had and would never have meal in lab. 30% of the students only do this when they had to.
However, there are still 1/3 of the students unaware of the harmfulness. Usually the leaders of these labs are so strict that they favor students who spend the longest time in the lab. When doing the research, we saw a student having lunch near a mice cage. (The smell is really unpleasant-we wondered how he could do this.) In some cases, students left the snack packages open in the lab while conducting experiments.
We also saw that several labs have a little kitchen in it. In one lab, the ""kitchen"" is just located beside the experiment bench.
The situation in few labs: the kitchen is really close to the experiment area. The experiment bench is on the left of the shelf while the kitchen is on the right.
Cross analysis: How long have you been working in the lab?
A. Less than 1 year.
B. 1-2 years.
C. 3 years or above.
From this analysis, we could approximately infer that the students would have meal in lab more frequently as they work in the lab for longer time. First, they might become busier and busier. Students are under more and more pressure gradually so they have to spend more time in the lab. Second, they are used to the working environment. As a newcomer, they are vigilant about the dangerous factors. When they are used to the lab, they gradually lower their guard.
Q3. How do you spend weekends and holidays?
A. I spend almost all my time in lab.
B. I often give up my spare time to study in lab.
C. I sometimes give up my spare time to study in lab.
D. I never give up my spare time to study in lab.
E. Other situation please specify

The interview of District Center
Q: How does cockroach mainly impact on human life?
A: At present, it mainly affects the health of human body. The inflection of cockroach is mainly about mechanical transmission including the spread of the feces as well as spread because of touching the cockroach. As for the spread of the feces, it means the pathogen is eaten into the body and then discharged into the human digestive tract through the feces. And the second one means that, the substance secreted by the cockroach can cause Allergies, red spots, and mucous membranes.
Q: According to the current situation, how many diseases can cockroach cause?
A: There are many types, and there are about 40 kinds of bacteria that have been confirmed to be infected from the cockroaches. There are more than 10 kinds of viruses, a small number of parasites and fungi, and they can all be infected through sputum contact.
Q: What is the habit of cockroach?
A: It’s habit include activity patterns, growth cycles, feeding, and migration. In activity patterns, cockroach is afraid of light and usually stay in dark corners. In growth cycles, cockroaches belong to insects, which are incomplete metamorphosis, and the growth cycle includes: egg stage, larval stage, adult stage. Generally speaking, the egg period of cockroaches is about half a month, and the larval stages of cockroaches of different varieties are also different. Among the two cockroaches that have the greatest impact on us, the larvae of German cockroach lasts for a month, and American cockroach’s is about three months. The peak period of cockroach is from May to October. They prefer to live in groups, and there will be mutual gluttony.
Q: What measures does the CDC take to prevent and control the cockroaches?
A: We mainly conducts training and basic guidance in the prevention and treatment of cockroaches. We guide the streets, urban management departments and professional killing companies how to use drugs safely. In addition, there is also monitoring of radon density in the city. For the family, there will be lectures every years with the city management department will do it together. We will introduce the killing methods of the cockroaches and distribute the commonly used drugs.
Q: How does it work for the current killing?
A: Every year, there are millions"

UB_Indonesia,2014,Team:UB Indonesia#backup_-_-_TEXT.html,", which makes them prospective photoactivatable markers. In this project, we used amilCP blue chromoprotein. This chromoprotein was extracted from Acropora millepora and  display purple-blue colour (Alieva et al, 2008).
This is one of chromoprotein collection from Uppsala Team 2012 . This chromoprotein will be connected to detector using linker. amilCP bind to E coil and interact with Tale-K coil. This reporter show the presence of Human Papilloma Virus by colour change. When the HPV DNA is bind to detector, spesific sequence of HPV will be recognized and blue colour appears  in the second strip. The Colour intensity will be detected in our software and we can determined the risk level of cervical cancer disease. Dark blue colour show the amount of  DNA  from HPV 16 and 18 is high and indicate the patient get severe cervical cancer.
D. PROTOTYPE
With those concept as explained before, we’re trying to make a prototype for early detection to cervical cancer that has some common with test pack. These are our model for the prototype:
We test the sample from menstrual blood that we hypothesized if she got cervical cancer, the menstrual blood will go through the endometrium and then to cervix which is can bring some of the infected cells. Then the give a little bit of menstrual blood to the applicator. Inside the test pack we’ll use nitrocellulose membrane to get the result. Next steps is the binding from TALE 1 that already bind with the linker and reporter to the HPV DNA that can be found in menstrual blood. We can’t be sure if the TALE 1 and HPV DNA is binding without the TALE 2, so the sample will be catch by TALE 2 that stands for positive line. If that two TALEs can’t bind to the DNA it means negative result. Meanwhile we make control line too to compare the positive line and the control line.
E. SOFTWARE
This software help user to early detect her cervical cancer with capture image from c3+ kit. This software also inform all about cervical cancer, especially preventing, screening, and therapy.

Abstract: “Our project aims to design a genetic device able to count and memorize the occurrences of an input signal. We achieved this by utilization of auto-inducing loops, that act as memory units, and an engineered riboregulator, acting as an AND gate. The design of the device is modular, allowing free change of both input and output signals. Each increase of the counter results in a different output signal. The design allows implementation of any number of memory units, as the AND gate design enables to extend the system in a hassle-free way. In order to tweak bistable autoinducing loops we need a very fast and robust method for characterizing parts. For this we have created a genetic algorithm that will enable us to find parameters of the parts used in the design. It also allows the combination of data from multiple experiments across models with overlapping components.”

Abstract: 'Essencia coli' is a vanillin producing bacterium equipped with a control system that keeps the concentration of vanillin at a constant level. The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.

Once Dr. Mishra from Heritage Institute for Medical Sciences received a tapeworm sample containing eggs from Taenia Solium and processed them, the Berlin Team had to transport the RNA-sample from India to Germany. The only problem was, that the Indian government changed their trade policy in June 2015. Since then, no company, hospital or physician can send a sample abroad without obtaining an “Import Export Code”. Obtaining this code is bureaucratic and makes taxation more complex. For this reason, despite having the sample and a carrier with expertise in the field (World Courier, an AmerisourceBergen company), diagnostX was unable to get the sample to Germany. At this point, iGEM IIT Delhi supported the Berlin team again by shipping the sample to IIT and subsequently exporting it with permission of the IIT. This process described in one sentence took over two months and the joint effort of the Berlin and Delhi iGEM team to manage this challenge was the key to the transcriptome and the sensor described by iGEM Berlin diagnostX.
How iGEM Berlin team assisted us?
While we were working on our square wave generator project, one of the essential things was to remove the Degradation tags in order to reduce noise. But the parts we got from the kit plates had Degradation Tags attached to them already. So, in order to remove them, we decided to use knockout strains. CLPP Protease is a strain which recognizes the degradation tags and degrades them, but it wasn’t available to us in our lab. This is when iGEM Berlin Team helped us out and they sent us the strains as they were available in the Berlin diagnostX lab.  We would like to thank and congratulate the iGEM Berlin diagnostX team on this successful collaboration and look forward to doing more work together in the future.

PROJECT DESIGN: WEEK 1 (16 July 16 2012)
The first criteria for the project is to identify the most prevalent ALDH isoforms which have been identified in the literature as being markers of cancer stem cells. ALDH1A1 was identified as the most prevalent isoform and ALDH1A3 and ALDH 3A1 have also been identified. ALDH2 has been selected as a control as its expression may be up-regulated by introducing alcohol.
WEEK 2
This week a protocol for identifying the promoter sequences of the ALDH isoforms has been designed.
PROTOCOL
1. Identify the start of the protein sequence (the promoter will be upstream of the start site).
2. Locate the TATA box within the region up-stream of the protein sequence.
3. Select 1000bp up-stream of the protein start site to include the TATA box.
4. Compare selected promoter sequence with commercial sequences.
5. Analyse sequences for illegal sites.
(6. Later we identified the European Promoter Database and compared selected sequences to sequences there and were able to select sequences which excluded illegal sites.
Primers to amplify the ALDH promoters were designed as follows:

Test of prepared chemo competent cells (empty) due to present resistance for chloramphenicol
Results
Again 14 colonies have grown on the plate, after incubating at 37°C over night. One can presume, that the newly prepared competent cells have taken up any plasmid providing chloramphenicol resistance (e.g. pSB1C3), makin them unuseful for our experiments. The uptake probably took place when inoculating the LB medium, one day befor the cells were prepared, because a sample of our old competent cells was used for the inoculation instead of a plated colony of e.coli- XL1-blue.

Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," pad and an overnight face mask seemed to be a lot less popular options for daily use than a cream or a face cleanser. Those were the two application options where the cellulose binding domain would have been necessary. To support other possible acne product applications, we still weren't entirely sure if Dermcidin would remain active when bound to cellulose, even though we had managed to prove that without the cellulose binding domain Dermcidin showed some antimicrobial activity and the molecules with the binding domain really could bind to cellulose. Therefore we shifted our focus to creams and face cleansers.
Even if cellulose based exfoliating beads and overnight face masks didn't seem to please our potential customers, we wanted to hold onto the cellulose aspect of our project while shifting our focus a little. We visited Aalto Bioproduct Centre in order to see what forms of cellulose even exist. There, we were introduced to hydrogel which we decided to use in our final product. In application design we got a lot of help from a PhD student Andreas Lindberg, doctoral candidate from Aalto University, School of Chemical Engineering. He is specialized in cellulose materials and working with designers at Chemarts school and Aalto Bioproduct Centre. He made it possible to work with cellulose hydrogel (CMC) by providing us with the raw material and helping us to proceed with it. What ever problem we had with the application design, he was very willing to help us to solve those problems and encouraged us to keep on looking for the best possible solution.
Ethics, Environmental Impact and Safety
Since we are working with Safety level 1 organisms, the produced product Dermcidin can already be found on human skin and cellulose is a natural material, our project can be considered to be relatively safe and the potential harm in a situation of our modified Escherichia coli escaping outside the lab is relatively small and it would be difficult to use it to do harm even on purpose. This does not mean that it would be entirely safe or responsible to free them into nature since their antibiotic resistance to Kanamycin or Chloramphenicol could spread to other bacteria in nature and cause some trouble in the future.
Considering our concept and product design, the end product needs to be safe to use on the human skin, on an everyday basis. We are lucky in this regard, as the Dermcidin peptide (DCD-1L) we worked with is already present on the human skin. The only thing that needs to be considered is whether abnormally high concentrations of the peptide risk the development of microbial resistance against it. In that case"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," find a solution; at Oxford iGEM, we believe that a targeted solution is essential. To show this, we have developed a treatment to a specific and serious example of antibiotic resistance: the urinary tract infection. As the world health organisation director general recently stated: ""No action today means no treatment tomorrow"".
Antibiotic resistance is defined as the inability of an antimicrobial agent to treat an infection by a given bacteria that it could once effectively treat. As a result, over time, a given drug is less and less effective at treating an infection. The problem itself is not new and has been observed since the 1950s, around the time antibiotic use reached large scales. While some bacteria have been resistant to a given antibiotic prior to it being used as a medical treatment, the majority of resistance cases are the result of evolutionary selection pressure due to human use.
This can be understood from a simple scenario. If a patient has an infection of a given bacteria and is given an antibiotic under normal conditions, the antibiotic will kill the bacteria and cure the infection. If, however, a mutation occurs in a single bacteria that allows it to survive in the presence of the antibiotic, then it will survive to reproduce the resistant bacteria. Therefore it has an advantage. When the bacteria reproduces, its offspring will now also be resistant, hence the population of bacteria able to survive the antibiotic increases and so the infection persists.
This however, doesn't represent the entirety of the problem; bacteria are able to transfer genetic material between one another. This is termed horizontal gene transfer and allows bacterial species to acquifer resistance to multiple antibiotics. This results in the so called superbugs such as MRSA.
As such, over time, the available antibiotics to treat a given bacteria infection begin to decrease. For instance, in the case of the STD chlamydia, only azithromycin is now effective. The pressure therefore is very real and it is highly likely that no current antibiotic will be effective against such a common infection in the near future.The historical tactic to solve resistance is to develop new antibiotics that target the same bacteria in a different way. An example of this is ampicillin. Related to penicillin, it acts to prevent bacteria from producing functional cell walls. It does this by inhibiting a different enzyme: transpeptidase, rather than DD-transpeptidase. This strategy, while in the short term effective, does not solve the inherent problem of resistance, but merely delays it. The problem is costly with an estimated billion pounds a year spent on treating resistant infections by the NHS alone; globally, resistance presents a cost of"

As can be seen from the results shown here, the fluorescence intensity of the experimental group is higher than that of the C2 and C3 groups by a large margin. Considering the precision of our equipment, this can demonstrate that the MVN-mRFP fusion protein is truly displayed outwards by using the INPNC displaying system. The results of the Experimental group and C1 group are close and it may be because of the breakage of Linker1 when we centrifuged the cells. However, the relatively high result of the C1 group is still in accordance with the demonstration.
E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay
This assay is the final testing to identify the binding effect of our genetically modified E. coli. First, we designed and constructed the plasmid for the experiment group (See Fig. 7). As described in the Design, we inserted 2 transcription units into the same vector pSB1C3. One transcription unit that encodes INPNC-MVN under a library of promoters was first introduced by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The second transcription unit that codes for GFP only was first constructed in another plasmid and later inserted into the first plasmid by Biobrick Standard Assembly. We also constructed one plasmid for the control group that only had the second transcription unit encoding GFP. After construction, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells.
>Figure 7. The final construct of the ""Binding"" plasmid. One transcription unit that expresses INPNC-MVN and one that expresses GFP are inserted into the same plasmid pSB1C3. GFP is expressed under the constitutive promoter BBa_J23117 while INPNC-MVN is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters (Pc). INPNC and MVN are separated by Linker1 which is a 10aa flexible protein domain linker.
We also carried out this binding test with 2 different strains of cyanobacteria, M. aeruginosa PCC7806 and M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cells of the experiment group and control group were both incubated till their OD600 reached 0.6. Then both E. coli and M. aeruginosa were applied to short period of mild sonication to break up the colony formed and harvested by centrifugation and PBS washing. E. coli and M. aeruginosa were co-incubated and observed under fluorescence microscope afterwards. We used microscopic counting to quantify the binding effect. The same"

Glasgow,2011,Team:Glasgow#Control of Dispersal#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," parts to work. We have sequenced the parts given to us by Edinburgh as our contribution towards improving them. The cph8+ pOmpC promoter in pSB1C3, LOV-Tap+ trp promoter-mCherry in pSB1C3, corrected light sensor cph8 with RBS but no promoter, and cph8 plus pOmpC-lacZ in pSB1C3 were the ones sequenced by our team to contribute to the Edinburgh 2010 registry pages.
Results:
In the first place we wanted to test the reliability of our constructs and we wanted to see with our own eyes to what extent is gene expression affected by a weak or strong ribosome binding site.
We then grew the cell cultures containing all the component to detect light, in dark and light and compared the fluorescence to determine the functionality of the light responsive system.
Fig 2
Figure 2 above shows how the strength of the RBS influences the levels of YFP expression in Top10 E.coli cells. These cells are lacking the machinery required to detect red light (phycocyanobilin path. + cph8) therefore the expression at the OmpF promoter is constitutive. The intensity of the YFP is reflected by the strength of the RBS. This shows how our constructs can be used to optimise expression levels in multi-step pathways to maximise carbon-flux and avoid unnecessary build-up.
Figure 3: EcoRI-PstI digest of OmpF-sYFP and OmpF-wYFP(uncut sample followed by double digest). 1 Kb ladder is on the right hand side.
The gel electrophoresis of the two version of the OmpF-YFP construct show that the cells we used for microscopy contained the correctly assembled construct.
Figure 4
This set of pictures on Figure 4 show incomplete light responsive constructs.
Unfortunately we realised too late that the EDIN1+2 ligation was in fact either just an EDIN1 which reannealed on itself or a dimerised plasmid backbone, byproduct of the ligation reaction.
The controls show a constitutively expressed RFP under control of an OmpF promoter lacking the light sensing machinery.
The negative control shows the green haze at the air-culture border under the coverslip. We suggested that this type of green fluorescence is due to the LB media in which the cells were cultured.
The series of images shown here provide unconsistent results: - any RFP under control of OmpC is supposed to be transcriptionally silent or very weakly"
Grinnell,2011,Team:Grinnell#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," variety of sources (Ryan et. al,  2010). Caulobacter is even capable of halting cell cycle progression in extreme dilute aquatic environment (Laub et al. 2007).
One feature of Caulobacter that is often overlooked is its surface layer. The S-layer of Caulobacter is composed of a single protein—RsaA, which is secreted and assembled into a hexagonal crystalline array that covers the organism. RsaA provides Caulobacter a measure of protection for the cell from attacking agents such as proteases, viruses and parasitic bacteria (Nomellini et al. 2004). RsaA makes up approximately 10-12% of the total cell protein production. The synthesis of RsaA occurs without need for induction and the protein is produced continuously throughout the life cycle (Nomellini et al. 2004). The secretion system for RsaA is also well studied: secretion is ATP-driven and considered a type I secretion pathway given the fact that the C-terminal secretion signal is not cleaved off after secretion (Awram & Smit 1998). The secretion signal has been shown to be within the C-terminal 82 amino acids of RsaA (Bingle, Nomellini and Smit 2000), and proteins as large as RsaA (98kDa, 1025 amino acids) (Gilchrist, Fisher and Smit 1992) can pass through the cell membrane successfully.
Thus, the reasons we chose Caulobacter as our chassis organism can be summarized as follows: Caulobacters secrete recombinant proteins using the Type I secretion system, not the General Secretory Pathway (GSP), which is more common. The bacteria are obligate aerobes and grow to high densities in minimal media, up to OD 25-30. They do not secret other proteins and have a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that has surprisingly low endotoxin potential. They are easily manipulated in lab and have a sequenced genome. And the yields are usually high for heterologous protein secretion (Nomellini et al. 2004).
Biofilms
Biofilms are a unique community of usually heterogeneous microorganisms that readily attach to rough and hydrophobic surfaces1. They are composed of cells encased in a hydrated extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix that is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids(Lu & Collins 2007).
Due to its extracellular structure, a biofilm can act as a protective barrier"

Steering away from the confines of the laboratory, the Macquarie University 2016 team headed out into regional NSW to interview various agri-business owners operating entirely off-the-grid. Our aim was to understand their needs and concerns, whilst integrating their feedback into the design of our very own sustainable energy producing system,“The Living Battery”. A system that imparts E. coli with the ability to synthesise hydrogen gas as a renewable energy source. Our conversations with the farmers and 4WD enthusiasts brought elements of portability, low maintenance and ease of use to the designs. We called upon advice from experts within the fields of biotechnology and microbiology to address biofilm formation and potential contamination issues caused by the E. coli cells."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

Cloning Methods
PCR Overlap Extension
When cloning parts into our construct, we chose to use PCR overlap extension and digestion/ligation techniques. In order to perform PCR Overlap extension (our preferred method of cloning) we were required to fabricate a set of primers that were ligated onto the insert. These primer extensions served to add overlap sites that match those of the parts we were adding. This allowed for PCR to extend the part onto another part with a matching overlap site; with the primers on either end of the inserts acting as the site of initiation for Taq polymerase. Our primary resource was this paper . A picture representation of PCR-Overlap Extension can be seen below:
High Throughput Cloning
The protocol for this method is standard.
98C for 30s
60C for 30s
72C for 1.5/kb
- 18 cycles optimum
72C for 10min (final extension)
37C for 30min - Add Dpn1 (digest methylated DNA)
Tranform
The choice of polyemerase is important! The article suggests using Phusion DNA Polymerase for the best results. We used Kapa Hi-Fi Hotsart Mix and confirm that it worked. The reference includes data for other polymerases as well.
