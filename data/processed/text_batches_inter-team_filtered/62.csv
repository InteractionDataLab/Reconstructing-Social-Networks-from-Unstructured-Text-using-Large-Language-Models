Queen's University
The Queen's team helped us with understanding PyRosetta and its inner workings a little better, which helped us develop our PyRosetta tools.
oGEM
The five Ontario, Canada iGEM teams ( McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , Ottawa , and Waterloo ) have worked with each other over the course of the year to help build each other's projects. We provided general wet and dry lab support for each other, as well specifics for protocols, business advice, and contacts.
We had two meetups over the spring and summer, one to help with project ideas and identifying interesting topics to pursue, and the other to provide feedback on presentations, general advice for preparing for the Jamboree, and sharing wiki content to make set up and development easier.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Detection_-_-_TEXT.html,"Surfactin and Tyrosidine were detectable with MALDI-TOF after optimizing their extraction methods. Tyrocidine is not shown here, but was detectable using the positive scan mode with the reflectron. See below for detection of the exact mass/z peaks of surfactin spotted on the MALDI plates. Surfactin was detectable using the negative scan mode making for easier identification due to the lack of other compounds ionizing with that detection method.
Freshly prepared colonies that were recombineered with the previously described MAGE method to create an NRPS that could switch out the aspartic acid for asparagine, were extracted after only 12 hours of growth, and analyzed on the UHPLC-DAD-QTOFMS, showed very small amounts of detectable surfactin. This result is expected as surfactin is produced during sporulation and this occurs with older bacterial samples. In addition only about 4% of the transformants were expected to have the mutation. One sample was run that showed a mass spec correlating to the expected mass of the mutant. This result indicates that the MAGE method was successful! More samples will be submitted for verification of this result with older streaked B. subtilis mutants biomass.

Mechanism
Three Parts in Circuit Designation
In a synchronized oscillatory system, three important parts should be included: the oscillator, which is the biochemical machinery that generate the oscillatory output; the coupling pathway that ensure the connection among cells; and output pathway, which is also known as a reporter that reflect the state of the oscillator to downstream targets (Fig. 2-1).
Fig. 2-1 Circuit working mechanism
Oscillator
Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that refers to the ability of bacteria to respond to chemical hormone-like molecules called autoinducers. When an autoinducer reaches a critical threshold, the bacteria detect and respond to this signal by altering their gene expression. In our circuit, QS (from Vibrio fischeri) is installed as a positive feedback while aiiA (from Bacillus Thurigensis) acts as a negative one to compose an oscillator together. In the quorum sensing part, the luxI gene is at low expression level and produces LuxI protein that synthesize a kind of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which is a small molecule that can diffuse across the cell membrane and mediate intercellular coupling when it reaches the threshold as enough biomass accumulated. AHL will bind intracellular protein LuxR, which is also consecutively produced by luxR gene. The LuxR-AHL complex can activate the luxI promoter, and the positive feedback loop is built. At the same time, the aiiA gene, which is under control of the same promoter is expressed and produce a lactonase enzyme known as aiiA that hydrolyzes the lactone ring of AHL. (Fig. 2-1) In this system, the activator enhances the expression of both activator and repressor, which shares the common motif of many synthetic oscillators.
Coupling
The communication range of quorum sensing, however, is limited by the diffusion rate of AHL, could only reach cells over tens of micrometers. So, we introduced the coding gene for NADH dehydrogenase II (ndh) and put it under the control of the same luxIpromoter, which means ndh also has a periodical expression in accordance with the oscillator"

Every step of the project has satisfied requirements from within the institute as well as legal requirements from the government. Having been designed by humans for humans, much thought has gone into gECO’s acceptability in society.
Awareness Activities
With an aim of creating awareness among people, following activities were carried out by the iGEM team members:
Awareness session for pollution control and waste management conducted by team members at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Mandi Village, New Delhi, 110047 on 23rd September 2017. 10:00 Hrs IST.
During this session, children were told the very basic steps that can be taken at the individual level that can be taken by anyone to contribute towards pollution control and waste management. It was an event worth learning from as students too gave a few innovative ideas to deal with the environmental problems being faced by the society particularly as a part of the way onto development by countries like India.
A slum survey was done and people living there were given guidance to lead a healthy life. The details of the same are as written below:
Time and Date: 17:30 Hrs - 20:00 Hrs on 07-10-2017 and 17:30 Hrs - 19:00 Hrs on 08-10-2017   Place: Jagatpura, Beside Sector 48-C, Chandigarh (30.679218, 76.756539).   The team members met 5 families and 2 cluster joint families consisting of 6 nuclear families each. It was found that:
All of them settled temporarily and most of them had no identity proof.People settled there were from different states - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Punjab.No sanitary facilities were available in their settlements. All went for open defecation near the drainage that passed through the slums.No waste disposal mechanism was provided. Large piles of plastic were seen everywhere.Except two families that alternatively used gas, all others permanently used wood as fuel for Cooking food.Wood, used as fuel, was mainly procured from nearby woodland and waste grounds. While some said they picked the dry, dead branches, others axed out fresh trees and dried them in their localities.Also we were told that whenever they came to know about any clearing of forests for industrial purposes by the government, they picked up wood from there in masses.During winters, even those who use gas, shift to wood burning as they don't want to spend their money on heaters and electricity.

Each gene of interest was amplified from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA, and Gibson Assembled into a linearized vector consisting of pSB1C3, BBa_B0034, and BBa_B0010. The constructs were first transformed into Top10, and characterized and sequenced in BL21(DE3). Confirmed sequences of these parts are available in the registry. It should be noted that pRob (BBa_K2451006) is subject to denial/exception to the registry due to EcoRI and PstI in the coding sequence. However, the pRob mutant was characterized alongside the other three mutant strains, and the data remains relevant to the overall analysis. The following strains were characterized.

A liquid Ampicillin toxicity test was performed to observe activity for the transcriptional regulators. Log-phase cells were inoculated at an OD=0.1 in various ampicillin concentrations, and optical densities were measured over 24 hours on a Thermo-Scientific Genysys30 Vis-spectrophotometer at wavelength 600 nm. Due to the relative volatility of benzaldehyde, the experiment was performed under semi-aerobic conditions (capped headspace). The following strains were characterized, with BL21(DE3) WT and BL21(DE3) + pSB1C3 serving as controls. A more detailed experimental protocol can be found in the Methods section.
Figure 11: Liquid ampicillin toxicity test
Our transcriptional regulators performed as expected. The overexpression of the transcriptional activators (MarA+/SoxS+/Rob+) conferred ampicillin resistance, and the repressor (AcrR+) displayed increased susceptibility. These phenotypes have been previously established in literature [8]. To further validate our results, a solid media assay was also performed on the mutant strains BL21(DE3) + pMarA and BL21(DE3) + pSoxS with BL21(DE3) + pSB1C3 serving as control. LB media + 1% agar was autoclaved and cooled in 55˚C water bath."

Cell Culturing Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | Harvard iGEM
This collaboration between the BostonU Hardware Team and the Harvard iGEM team was based around engineering a microfluidic system to culture cell and measure the resulting cell growth.   Each team was responsible for separate parts of the system.  The BostonU Hardware Team primarily worked on the design, manufacturing, and testing of the microfluidic device. The Harvard iGEM team primarily worked on an optical density sensor which was aimed to measure cell growth. Even though each team focused on individual parts of the system collaboration was imperative to test and develop each teams work.
Stage 1
The initial stage of the collaboration focused on outlining the goals we wanted to achieve from the collaboration. This meeting occurred over the summer after initial interest was sparked after hearing about each other's work at a local conference. The Harvard iGEM team had initially wanted to design the chip in order to do culture fiber producing cells.  After looking over the initial designs that the Harvard team produced, both teams agreed that more literature review was needed to redesign a new microfluidic chip.
Stage 2
After reviewing different cell culturing microfluidics devices, we had come across a microfluidic chemostat and turbidostat which matched the same functionality that both teams were looking to achieve. The teams agreed that this design was able to be manufactured and suitable for performing the cell culturing experiment.
The two main challenges that were involved with replicating the microfluidic chip were designing the microfluidic device and manufacturing the PDMS membrane with the proper thickness. An initial chip was designed by the BostonU Hardware team using circular chambers. After performing several tests, it was determined that the paper’s original design would be more suitable. The next step was to obtain the proper PDMS. The PDMS membrane needed to be extremely thin (75um thickness) in order to be actuated the full depth of the chamber. This prompted the BostonU Hardware team to learn how to spin coat PDMS in order to obtain the precise thickness. There was varied success in the beginning, but eventually we were able to get a consistent result."
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#AppliedDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,".6% of the general Dutch population thinks we should be utterly careful about the genomic privacy of athletes based on 181 respondents. We however do believe that guaranteeing athletes’ privacy in gene doping detection is one of the most important values to take into consideration within our design.
So, why is genomic privacy important? From one of our initial talks with Professor Dimeo it became apparent that there is not only a threat of hacking attempts on databases. In addition, all the people that work in the regulatory cycle and get to see the results give rise to an opportunity for blackmailing athletes, a real risk that Professor Dimeo is afraid of.
“Whole Genome Analyses are privacy invasive. Not only is there a possibility for hackers, also blackmailing of athletes might ensue by the regulatory personnel. There is a lot of money going on there.”
Prof. Dimeo
The fear of genome database hacking is not fiction. Scandals are already happening. Big companies known for their ancestry analyses for example have their databases hacked, leaving 92 million people with their genetic code up for grabs ( Shaban, June 5 2018 ).
Why should people be afraid of hacking? Apart from the fact that companies can earn much money with your genetic code, in time your genetic information can be used against you. An example is in health and life insurances. If this continues, in many countries only the good risks can still have a cheap insurance once their health insurer knows their genetic disease predispositions. The same applied for job and sponsoring offers and loans and mortgages. This can lead to large social problems and possibly unethical situations that we will then need to find other solutions for. For our method at least it means we highly value athlete privacy.
Current data storage and safety
Recently it became apparent that around the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, the medical information of 250 athletes from 30 countries who have a dispensation to use certain medication was hacked ( NOS, October 5 2018 ). The year before, the same hackers had already obtained the information of several other athletes. We make sure that no more data is stored than is absolutely necessary, thereby guaranteeing that no personal information will be leaked by a hack.
4.5 Biosafety
As a team, we believe biosafety is more than biocontainment, which we achieve by having a cell free method. Additionally  we created an infographic for the Dutch Ministery of Health, Welfare and Sport on how safety has been integrated throughout our project, from start to finish.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html,"arda Santos on 26/09/16, we had another meeting with Dr Ceri Lewis. Dr Andrew Griffiths recommended we speak to Dr Lewis because he believed she would have an interesting perspective on gender inequality, having been aware of her own, and her students experiences on the matter. Dr Lewis had taken part in programmes, like the Aurora leadership programme, run by the University to improve attitudes to gender equality as well as give more confidence to women in their own abilities.
As Dr Santos talked about how women can also be very discriminatory, we were shocked to hear Dr Lewis’ personal experience of the effects of discrimination by a female role model.  She spoke of her PhD student who was an incredibly intelligent individual however lacked confidence in presentation skills. Dr Lewis stated that her worries were needless because her work had already been published, and it was at an extremely high quality in a very good journal, but she was still anxious and fiddled with her hair throughout her presentation. Despite the fact the presentation went well, a woman came up to her afterwards and said:
She would never make it in science unless she learns to give a talk without sounding like a silly little schoolgirl
It is shocking to think that a female role model would feel this is an appropriate comment for a nervous, but aspiring, young scientist. Dr Lewis argued that you could
never imagine a man being told he gave a bad talk because of a mannerism
and this kind of advice and influence has the potential to destroy all confidence in an individual.
Confidence is something Dr Lewis stressed needed addressing. In the initial interview with Dr Griffiths, he spoke of the difficulty in addressing womens’ confidence and how it might affect them applying to senior roles, however here, Dr Lewis argued that good role models and mentors are required throughout a student’s life to guide them in the right direction and to give them the confidence in their own abilities from the beginning.    We have to question what is the problem with confidence and how can we solve it? Dr Lewis said:
To succeed in academia, you have to be willing to put your head above the parapet, and talk, and tell people about what you do and why you’re great
Considering the problems that we have heard from different academics at the university about establishing yourself in science as a woman, it is understandable why this in-built confidence in your own ability is very hard to attain. Interestingly Dr Lewis highlighted that there is a
ingrained difference
and that many academic situations are
built around the male world
. For example, presentations. She had observed many male tutees stand up and be naturally confident in"

They brought up concerns about depletion of our bacterial population in the secretion system and we talked about the possibility of antimicrobial resistance . Their project is concerned with exrtaction of oil/dispersing oil spills.
We have a preliminary design for the wiki (which hasn't been implemented yet) and meetings about the modelling approaches we can take for the project. Henry has been reading up on mass action ratios and Michaelis Menten and dry lab team is preparing to start planning the modelling tomorrow. Silas has been taking footage for the videos (""biofilms"") he will be making throughout the summer and James has been looking into the effects of our antibiofilm agents on the bladder biome.
We're also giving our first ""Concepts of Synthetic Biology"" this Tuesday to high school students attending a summer school in Oxford as well as talking about our project at the upcoming open days. June and Mabel have been busy contacting nurses, doctors and professors and we've had some promising comments on our ideas. We're looking forward to meetings to discuss our project further.
Keep track of our weekly blog posts about our progress in the lab. Until tomorrow!
GENE LOSS IN PLASMIDS: CHALLENGING SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Synthetic biology allows for the manipulation of living organisms in order to generate novel functions. This new field has the potential to revolutionise medical treatments, industrial protocols and potentially how we interact with the planet. Key to synthetic biology is the ability to manipulate the genetic information of the target. In most instances, this involves the addition of genes not normally present, hence producing a novel function. To do this, scientists use a vector (which simply means a method of transferring genetic information from one organism to another), the most common of which is the plasmid.
While the use of plasmids is the standard method of transformation, use of plasmids presents some unique challenges, most important of which is the loss of plasmids over successive generations. This so called gene loss effectively removes the inserted genes removing the synthetic organism's novel function. As we shall discuss, understanding of gene loss presents both challenges and opportunities.
One of the core elements of synthetic biology is applying biological molecules from one environment to another in order to solve a problem. To do this, genetic information must be transferred. Fortunately, bacteria already possess several methods of transferring genetic information from one to aother. By far the most common is the use of plasmids. Plasmids are circular loops of DNA that exist separately from the main bacterial genome; they can replicate independently and be transferred between members of the same and different species."

We started our project in March, and we have three parts of experiment, basic circuits part, regulation part and Error-prone PCR part. Basic circuits part was finished by Zongzhi Lv's group (including Hui Luo) and Wenxin Bai's group (including Changxin Zhang and Jiaqi Xu), Regulation part was finished by Jinlin Li's group (including Jiadong Zhong and Pengcheng Zhang). Error-prone PCR was finished by Jing Yang's group(including Chengyi Li, Mingming Cao, Xiao Peng and Zeyan Li). The experiments of Regulation part consist of the construction and verification of two pH-induce promoters (P-atp2 and P-asr) and recombinase system. The main work of error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) gruop is to select different promoters by error-prone PCR. The duty of Basic circuits group is to construct our basic resistance sub-system and basic regulation system.
Week1 (Mar 16 -Mar 22)

Also, she gave an overview outline on wetlab protocol for this summer.  Swapnil talked about how invertases work, and what would be a simple algorithm for computing potential permutations.
The comp team now has a good idea of what our goals are for the summer. Michelle and I will focus on observing the wet lab environment to see how a tangible user interface would potentially help research in a bioengineering lab.  We may talk to more people later on in the summer about certain features to improve on G-nomeSurfer, and adjust our goals based on the needs of the wetlab.
Week of 6/6/2011
Summary:End of training; beginning of Wet-Lab Observations and Background Research
6/8: 1st lab meeting at BU with the wet-lab.  Michelle and I spent a couple of hours in the wet-lab observing the wet-lab team.  We took notes on the organization of the lab, team interactions, and where HCI tools would come best into.
There were a couple of questions we had in mind:
How useful would publications be when the team is starting to do research?  Would they need a lot of background reading?
What potential sources would they go to for publications?  Would they prefer PubMed, GoogleScholar, or some other specific database?
Found out that publications are not the main focus at the moment.  They need to first learn about the equipment in the lab, and also how the Registry of Standard Biological Parts works.
A sample variety of BLAST visualization considered.
6/9: 1st HCI lab meeting at Wellesley- there was a general brainstorming session on BLAST visualization.  After doing some background research on existing BLAST visualization, I divided the designs into categories based on linear vs. circular format, color scheme, and content organization. The circular BLAST visualizations are interesting, and we'll look more into GView and CGViewer.  The team will keep the designs in m ind when considering how to design the paper prototype for the widget.
Work for the rest of the week: I need to start fiddling with Geneious, to see the pros/cons of the design.  What are aspects that are great that may inspire the next generation of G-nome Surfer?  What are some things that won't work on a Tangible User Interface? We need to first understand the basic functions of Geneious before we know what to tweak about G-nome Surfer.
Some members of the team are starting to develop"

She did this by using jell-o in cups to represent a cell, then taught the students about organelles contained within a typical animal cell. Each intracellular eukaryotic organelle was represented by a different candy. She then explained how DNA helped tell the cell what to make, and how integrating new dna would allow the cell to change part of its function. The kid's had a blast learning about cells, and after they passed a quiz on the material, they were able to enjoy a fun snack.
Board of Regents Meeting
Sam Dugan and Megan Tabor presented our biofuel project to the Board of Regents for the system of higher education for the state of Nevada. The presentation focused on educating the board members on what iGEM is and specifically the project that we are working on this year. A power-point was given at the meeting on the University of Nevada, Reno campus for roughly two-hundred people. Questions from the board were answered following the ten minute speech. This allowed the University administration and system of higher education administration as a whole to experience some of the research that we, as undergraduates are able to accomplish. This speech was highly successful and all involved were impressed with the research as well as initiative shown by iGEM Team Nevada 2011.
Presentations for Rotary Clubs of Reno and Sparks
Throughout the summer our team presented to three different rotary clubs in the Reno and Sparks area. The goal of these presentations was to explain our project to the local business community and receive feedback from them on our presentation, and our project as a whole. Presentations lasted roughly twenty minutes and were followed by question-answer periods. We presented to roughly 300 people total and got to answer many questions that as scientists, we may not always think of. These presentations were extremely helpful in fine-tuning our speeches and allowed us to involve the community as a whole in the concepts of biofuels and synthetic biology. These were again given by Sam Dugan and Megan Tabor, who both felt that the business community offered a different perspective on the research we conduct. This perspective brought up issues and positives which we were then able to incorporate into our presentation and further outreach projects.

Biodiversity
Biological diversity is defined as: The variability of living organism from all sources. Terrestrial and marine, and of cause the ecological complex they are a part of. This also include diversity within species, and between species and ecosystems Convention on Biological Diversity From a biologist point of view, this include all genes, species and ecosystems of a region.
Biodiversity is threatened by climate change. The climate change have not caused extinctions, but have lead to a decrease of fitness in a number of species. By reinventing how to use transgenic organisms, the aspiration is to improve on the degrading biodiversity that can already be seen. If you want to learn more about the impact caused by GMO and climate change on biodiversity you can read more here.

We also made an assumption that using EGFP to do homologous recombination with Fus1 behind fus1 promoter in yeast genome, the EGFP would be integrated into the genome and eliminate the differences of the copy number between each yeast. What’s more, the reporter gene will not be lost and can be inherited steadily. Besides, more promoter can be tried, such as fus2, fig1 promoter [5], from them we can compare their intensity and choose an appropriate one.

February & March
Initially, we considered a wide range of topics, from glucose sensors to                         solar energy, and from ocean clean-ups to artificial organs. The number                         of options seemed unlimited, and our search was scattered. As a source of                         inspiration, we consulted newspaper articles, checked the wiki pages of                         previous iGEM teams and talked to several professors at our university.                         When going through the wiki pages of previous teams, we realized that                         many of them  struggled with the use of their creations outside of the                         laboratory. We also came across an article by Liu et al. (2017), who                         attempted to design a ‘living material’ by means of several layers used                         to entrap bacteria. Inspired by this cool work, we decided we wanted to                         do something similar in order to facilitate the easy use of GMOs.                         However, instead of using several layers for entrapment, we wanted to                         equip our bacteria with their own anchor. After several brainstorm                         meetings, we settled on this challenging subject as the goal of our                         2018 iGEM project!
April & May - TU/e contest
Right after we decided to anchor bacteria to a hydrogel, we decided to register for the TU/e Contest . This is an annual ideation contest organized by our university, in which students are encouraged to develop their innovative ideas into start-ups. The contest was intended for students who already had a clear idea that they wanted to bring to the market. Unfortunately, our project was still quite vague (‘adhering bacteria to a hydrogel’). Nevertheless, our participation was still useful. We got to meet companies, participate in workshops and pitch our project to the public. Along the way, we received quite some feedback from the participating companies.

April & May - TU/e contest
As we did not have a clear project yet, not all workshops were as useful as they could have been in a later stage. Nevertheless, we are glad we participated. Not only because we won the audience prize (€1000!), but also because we were forced to make our ideas more concrete. Our Human Practices trajectory thus clearly benefitted from our participation in the TU/e Contest. If you want to know how we won the audience prize, please have a look here.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Instead, swimming was initially observed after 2 days. In order to allow chemotaxis on M9-minimal agar, the addition of L-methionine was required, as described by Adler, 1972. In comparison to the tryptone-swimming agar, chemotaxis experiments were much more reasonable with the defined M9-minimal agar leading to a high degree of reproduction. Thirdly, different stocksolutions of attractants in the Whatman paper were tested, including L-aspartate (10 mM), a mix of amino acids (0,2% w/v) and tryptone (0,5% w/v). These components were used to trigger chemotaxis of the bacteria. Here, we used L-aspartate in most experiments when we worked with the aspartate receptor Tar of E. coli. We adjusted the volume of all attractants to 100 µl, which was the maximal amount that could be soaked into the Whatman paper (2 cm X 2 cm in size). Furthermore, it proved beneficial to pipette the 100 µl attractant solution on the Whatman paper before the paper was placed onto the center of the semisolid agar. Moreover, the incubation temperature turned out to be a crucial parameter for swimming assays. It is known that long-term bacterial growth at 37°C leads to inhibition of flagella growth. Therefore, incubation of swimming assay Petri dishes was conducted at 33°C. The fine-tuning of the experimental setup was closely related to the choice of our E. coli strains. Since we worked a lot with the tar-knock-out mutant (Baba et al. 2006) that was created in the background of the laboratory strain DH10B, we tested all our media and parameters with DH10B in the first place. But, soon we realized that laboratory strains were not developed to be the best swimmers and we figured that other strains might have better swimming characteristics. Therefore, the chemotaxis strains MG1655 and RP437 joined our collection. In addition, the E. coli laboratory strain BL21 showed better swimming properties than the laboratory strains DH10B or XL1 blue (Fig. 1).

Background
Human actions derived from industrial activities, agriculture and domestic sewage are among those responsible for the pollution of the environment by toxic metals (Biondo, 2008). Mercury occurs in the environment combined with other elements and naturally in different chemical species with distinct solubility, reactivity and toxicity. Occurring in volcanoes and mercury mines, which are responsible for emissions of mercury in the order of 2700-6000 tons/year (Micaroni et al. 2000). In the Amazon, it is also used in mines in the amalgamation of gold (Au-Hg) (Figura 1), where a quantity of metallic mercury (Hg0) is released upon rivers and soils by the handling  in insecure situations , and through the outdoor burning process, which releases element's vapor to the atmosphere, that leads to the aquatic ecosystem contamination.
Figure 1. Direct contact with mercury in the Amalgamation of gold process.
In Amazon rivers, about 3000 tons of mercury are available and can be bioconverted in its most toxic forms for living beings, through methylation - the addition of the radical CH3 – of mercury, bioaccumulative properties are acquired by its high affinity to animal tissues (Souza and Barbosa, 2010). The mercury methylation is a crucial step to its entry in the aquatic food chain organisms, because of it riverside communitiesA traditional pupulation that resides in the rivers proximities and they have the artisanal fishing as main food supplying activity. are the main affected by contaminated fish ingestion.
Figure 2. Death of fish caused  by dumping  Mercury in the river.
Worldwide, there are cases of accidents with mercury as occurred in 1908 with the chemical industry Chisso Corporation that produced fertilizers settled in Minamata Bay in Japan. In 1932 the factory started to produce acetaldehyde, mercury sulfate in production, reaching 6,000 tons in 1951 and 42,245 tons in 1960.
Chisso's factory did not properly dispose their liquid waste, which were released into Minamata"

Biosensor of reactive oxygen species using E.Coli
Active oxygen (O2-) is produced from oxygen (O2) by receiving a single electron (e-). The 90% of the active oxygen produced in cells comes from electron transport system in mitochondria. Although most of active oxygen produced in this process is released as water (H2O) by receiving another electron, few of them are released to cytoplasm as active oxygen.
Active oxygen is very unstable and has high oxidizing power that is utilized as defense system against infected bacteria in vivo. However, excess active oxygen is also harmful to the organisms. It oxidizes nucleic acids, lipids or proteins that can damage cells and tissues. The damage could at least partially cause Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, cancer and other diseases related to aging. Therefore development of sensitive and economical detecting system for active oxygen would help us to understand these diseases.
Although influence of active oxygen on ecosystem is not fully understood yet, excess active oxygen in environment is very likely harmful to organisms. To detect harmful substances in high sensitivity or to study their influence on ecosystem, we sometimes carry out bioassay, using organisms typically found in the environment. Different from chemical and physical detection system, the direct effects on the organisms can be    tested by the bioassay. However, the sensitive and economical bioassay system to detect active oxygen in environment has not been developed yet.
The bacteria grow fast in the simple medium and we can cultivate it easily at low cost. Therefore our team aimed at developing the technique to detect active oxygen in vivo and to quantify oxidative stress in the environment by creating biosensor system using E.Coli.

Improvement
1.Characterization of existing BioBrick part: Sucrose-limitation induced kill switch（ BBa_K302035 )
Considering the biosafety in our project, we used the original part BBa_K302035 from iGEM10_Newcastle team, which is a suicide switch induced by sucrose. This part encodes a stable non-specific ribonuclease toxin (mazF) and its inhibitory antitoxin (mazE) in Bacillus subtilis . Contains Sucrose sensitive inducer that will only allow coding sequence translation in the presence of sucrose. When translation of both genes is turned off by sucrose limitation mazE will be degraded faster than mazF. There is then no inhibiton of mazF, killing the cell.
We made characterization of this part in our chassis B.subtilis WB800 .The sucrose was added in the culture medium when the value of OD600 reach stationary phase initially, and the final concentration of sucrose was 20mmol/L. Then we recorded the variation of OD600 by interval of 4 hours (Fig.18) and the result was shown as follow.
Fig.18 The OD600 of original strain WB800 and recombinant B.subtilis WB800 _MazEF recorded by interval of 4 hours.The red arrow represent the adjunction of Sucrose (20mmol/L).
As can be seen from the figure above, the Sucrose-limitation induced kill switch in B.subtilis didn’t show obvious function on our chassis. It might because the concentration of sucrose wasn’t suitable or the degradation of ribonuclease toxin (mazF) is too fast.
2. Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part : Carbonic anhydrase (csoS3) of the carboxysome of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus ( BBa_K1465205 )
In this year, we change the sequence of original part( BBa_K1465205 ) submitted by iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2014. We add the RBS of B.subtilis and a segment of signal peptide at the upstream of cds of Carboxysomal Carbonic Anhydrase(csoS3)(Fig.19) from Haloth"
Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#AdamNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", we plan to pursue many new exciting projects to move Clotho forward. The team is much bigger than last year, so hopefully we will not be too overwhelmed. My main focus this summer will be language development.
Short-term project:
I will be making a plug-in that will take a textual description of biological parts in an input file, tentatively named Adam's Language For Synthetic (ALFS), and generate an image with BOGL symbols.
Long-term project:
Familiarize myself with Proto , Antimony , and SBML .
Get an existing language to work with Clotho.
Design and implement our own language (structural netlist first).
Adam z liu 00:25, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
I finished a simple plugin called Pictoparts. The user inputs a *.p file describing BOGL parts, and my plugin parses the file, stitches together images, and outputs and displays an image of the composite part. I also met my partner Lesia, and we had our first project meeting with Doug. We came up with the following outline of tasks to complete this week:
Think of a name for our language
Give Lesia the Proto paper
Look for other languages
Write up a draft language for the BOGL RFC
List of primitive datatypes
List of properties for primitives
Rule syntax
Once we have a first draft for syntax, we will test the expressive power of our language on a set of diagrams by a member of the Stanford BOGL effort. We will then submit everything to the BOGL/BOL community for critique. Next week, we plan on giving our language to the wetlab to test, as well. After we settle on acceptable syntax, we will specify the grammar to GNU Bison to parse our language.
Adam z liu 19:22, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
Doug, Lesia, and I got feedback from various different sources about the sample syntax :
Cesar Rodriguez - contributor to the Stanford BOGL project
Rename Part to Component and Composite to Device
Make the language object-oriented with everything inheriting from Sequence
Paul Hilfinger - compilers professor at Berkeley
Need a way to define modules
Use a parser generator
CS community not really interested in domain-specific languages unless new processing is being done
J. Chris Anderson - Berkeley iGEM wetlab instructor
The language cannot be just a tweaked version of others already out there
Be able to elaborate on the ultimate purpose of the language
Lesia and I are developing a grammar for ANTLR . We also gave a PowerPoint presentation about our project to the group.

Workshop Concept
With the workshop we intend not only to inform as many people as possible about synthetic biology but we also want to encourage them to start a thinking process. By giving them background information as well as examples of synthetic biology a basis for further discussions about ethics as well as security and safety is laid.
The theoretical part - that consists of three sub-presentation - about basic principles of genetics, as well as genetic engineering and, last but not least, definitions, principles and exemplary applications of synthetic biology.
For better understanding of laboratory processes we included a few practical experiments. These contained the isolation of banana DNA, banana-smelling bacteria (transformed with BBa_J45200), as well as showing and explaining a blue-white-screening plate and hydras expressing GFP-fusion proteins.
Furthermore a discussion about possible risks and chances of synthetic biology takes place.
To conclude the workshop and let the participants apply what they've learned so far, we let them design paper BioBricks, as introduced last year by the team of TU Delft.
Report First Workshop
Our first workshop took place on Friday, September 2, in the Biocenter of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University. Our participants, aged 18 to 63 had little (based on high school) to no knowledge about the basics of molecular biology.
As already explained in our concept we had theoretical and practical parts. Our participants had lots of fun isolating DNA and most of them were successful!
During the discussion they expressed their concerns with synthetic biology as well as their hope that it might help to solve a number of problems, i.e. concerning health and environment. The most prominent fear was that of biological weapons constructed by rogue states. The question whether there is a worldwide authority that controls synthetic biology arose.
Further thinking about that topic led to another idea for our human practice part, a model United Nations resolution about synthetic biology.

Our project aims to construct a safe and efficient drug delivery system targeting specific oncogene to provide a new strategy of cancer therapy. We chose lung cancer as our disease model due to its substantial morbidity and mortality.
Generally, the project design can be divided into three portions: (1) RNAi module; (2) targeting module; (3) RNAi module and targeting module assembly.

filter_dramaRNAi & KRAS
RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging technology of gene silencing. It uses siRNA segments to destroy specific mRNA, thereby, shut down the expression of target genes. RNAi has been demonstrated as a novel treatment modality of cancer and we decided to utilize this technology to silence the expression of specific oncogene[1]. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer. The mutation rate of KRAS can be up to 25% in NSCLC (a main type of lung cancer)[2]. Thus, we picked KRAS as our target oncogene. Then we designed anti-KRAS siRNA as a therapeutic agent to degrade KRAS mRNA, therefore, repressing the expression and function of K-ras protein. We used a specialized software developed by team SYSU-software to find the ideal siRNA sequence. This tool also designed pairs of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. When the shRNA plasmids of KRAS are transfected into HEK293 cells, the dsRNA is cleaved into siRNA of KRAS by the enzyme Dicer, and then target KRAS mRNA. However, due to the short half-life period and poor cellular uptake of exogenous siRNA[3], an efficient delivery vehicle is needed to stabilize and enhance the naked small interference molecule's function.

Abstract
Cadmium is the heavy metal which is very harmful to a creature. The pollution of cadmium brings a serious problem for natural environments. It is very important to collect this efficiently. We tried to solve this problem with recombination Escherichia coli which our team made in this year.  We decided to make two kinds of recombination Escherichia coli. One traps cadmium on the outer membrane. It produces fusion protein with the heavy metal binding protein and outer membrane protein and it traps cadmium. Another collects other Escherichia coli. It produces aspartic acid of positive chemotaxis factor to Escherichia coli.
Is it necessary to distribute it to two kinds of why? We suggest the following theory for this question.
""One E. coli has One function theory""
There is the possibility that the following demerit occurs when I summarize two functions in one.The first is that the ability of the Escherichia coli situation decreases by producing multiple protein at a time.The second is that subsequent editing becomes difficult when we complete a  gene cassette once. The merit in case of one kind is next.  At first it is that a function becomes very simple.We can make Escherichia coli which was specialized in it by a function becoming simple. The number of Escherichia coli just leads to the level of the function, analysis becomes easy.

Overview: Background
For many years our society has wanted to have a comfortable life. It has invented and produced a lot of things that allow this comfort [1]. For example, in a typical day we can observe the use of plastic glasses for coffee, plastic bottles for water, disposable cutlery for lunching, plastic bags for supermarket and so others.
Each year, about 300 million tons of plastics are manufactured and between 5 to 13 million tons of it ends up in the ocean [3], which are responsible for the death of 1,5 million of marine animals alla around the world [4].
In Chile about 25 thousand tons of wastes are thrown into the ocean, where it can be brought back to the coast, sunk or accumulated near the Easter Island [5], but that is not all! Recently, a report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States revealed an emerging and worrying problem: all this plastic thrown to the ocean has starting to fragment in micro-particles which can act as sponges for waterborne contaminants such as dioxins and are swallowed by marine species accumulating in their bodies [3].
Fossil plastic contamination is not a new issue and several ways to reduce it have been explored. For example, in Chile, the government has generated a proposal of law to forbid using supermarket plastic bags made of polyethylene, polypropylene and other artificial polymers which are non-biodegradable, which was accepted in the Patagonian territory last year [7]. On the other hand, recycling seems to be a great action, but is not a really viable solution, knowing that only up to the 30% of plastic produced is actually reused [8].
A more sustainable initiative is to produce, from renewable resources, biodegradable plastics, due to their short degradation time, for example it can be up to two years in the case of PolyLactic Acid (PLA) which physical properties are very similar to the classic plastic ones [9]. Nevertheless, the current synthesis, essentially driven by chemical reactions, is quite expensive since the process requires complex experimental conditions, for instance the absence of any trace of water, rising production costs [2]. Besides, we estimated that today the cost production of biodegradable plastics is about 12-times higher than fossil plastics"

We introduced the scoring card to the insecticidal protein to see whether we could also predict invertebrate proteins from ion channel impairing toxins, improving their searching tool while finding more candidates for the project last year.
     First, we collected the insecticidal and ion channel impairing toxins by 2016 selection database . After                         deleting peptides which contained non-standard amino acids, we randomly chose positive and negative data to our datasets and divided them into two datasets, training datasets and testing datasets.

     For training parts, after initializing the first scorecard, we used IGA to optimize the scorecard for ten generations.

Discussion
     To improve the project of NCTU_Formosa 2016, we introduced the scoring card method to the insecticidal proteins. By using the method, we can predict more new insecticidal proteins.

NEW PART:
- fMt with a constitutive promoter
Introduction
      fMt is a metallothionein that has high affinity with As(III). 2009 Groningen iGEM used it to purify the polluted water. However, 2009 Groningen iGEM ligased it with a low constitutive promotor, BBa_J23109. We failed serval times when and tried to ligased these two parts. After sequencing its plasmid, we found out there was two SpeI site in the plasmid. So we decided to replaced J23109 with J23119 and conducted a series of experiments to ensure the function.

Contacting Experts
Speaking with experts has been an enriching experience for the entire team, it has allowed us to improve our communication, working times, and the way that we do this work and how we perceive our own project. We must thank technology for giving us a wide range of communication forms, because it has not always been possible to establish an interview, using emails, phone calls, and video calls for people that weren’t in Santiago. Our experts can be classified in different subjects:
Economy and profitability
It took us by chance that at the beginning of the year an MIT workshop was organized to strengthen start-ups, and due to the fact that it took place in our university, we were able to participate free of charge. We learned to observe the market and present a solution in the best way possible. We assisted amusing presentations about creating and maintaining an undertaking, and we also partook in workshops about communications and preparing an elevator pitch. These things were essential when we had to look for economical support and carry out our crowdfunding campaign .
On the other hand, Patricia Echeverria has a start-up in Atacama region, where she produces food coming from algae. She told us about the options that has this emerging market and all the competitive funds that are possible to go for as a project. Moreover, she encouraged us to keep on going and maybe even try out our results in her reactors in the middle of the desert!
Download the food brochure! .
Laboratory
Working with Chalmydomonas reinhardtii is and has been a great challenge for us, mainly because the facility where we are working hasn’t cultivated them before, so we were actually quite blind in our path at first. But lucky us, we found Tomas Egaña’s lab, who works in the HULK Project , that consists in tissue regeneration using the same microalgae that we work with.
Additionaly, the academic world that surrounds us helped us contact LMU München who specialize in working with this little Chlamy and guided us to work with. They also revised the protocols that were used (view the document) .
Finally, Dr. Alison Smith of Cambridge University kindly offered us the promoter sequence to"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," prion aggregate might be associated with the generation propagation, however, a generation of the yeast can be very long, which may reduce the usefulness of the application.There are evidences showing that the yeast prion can work in E. coli[1]. So one of our future work falls on expanding our systems to E. coli make our system faster.
Find more interacting protein pairs
This year we use the sfGFP split to construct our Pro Priontein system, but theoretically, any interacting protein pair can be exploited in this system, which could be recognized as a universal protein-level switch. In scienticfic research, especially the protein field, the interaction of proteins is frequently taken into consideration. Thus our system appears to be a very useful tool in protein study. To verify its universality, more protein pairs are required, which makes a part of our future work.
Find a more convenient fluorescence reading method
Before performing our experiments, we thought the difference of the intensity of fluorescence would be distinguished by eye, however the results overthroughed our former assumption. Therefore we can only see the difference by the fluorescence microscope and process the images using Matlab. Thus a more convenient fluorescence reading method is required to make our system portable and ready-to-use.
Automatically eliminate the noise
The noise of the background of the images took through fluorescence microscope would seriously influence the quantativating. However, we could not figure out how to eliminate it automatically, because we didn't know the specfic relationship between the noise and the subject. We have tryed to use subtraction and division to eliminate, but the error still remained. Thus we concluded that the relationship between the noise and the subject was very complicated. Now we can clearly see the difference of the intensity by eye but have't figure a way to precisely quantivate it.

Image Processing
For the original photos we got, we handled all of them in the same way. The image processing method is showed here.
Take one photo for example. This is an original photo of fluorescence experiment(Image 1).
We use the mathematical software Matlab to calculate the brightness of fluorescence according to how bright the pixel is. Then we convert the photo into a 3D plot where XY surface denotes the location"

p-Aramid team member Anna introduces the p-aramid project
Why aramids?
For our exploration purposes, it is important to have a membrane that can withstand harsh environments without bursting. While our collagen-elastin fiber and latex polymer display promising properties of elasticity and strength, their ability to withstand high physical stress is limited. Due to its rigidity (70,500 MPa [1]), toughness (2,920 MPa [1]), and low density (1.44 g/cm³ [1]), Kevlar®  is highly capable of meeting the unique needs of inflatable modules and habitats. It can act as both a lightweight balloon reinforcement and shield against atmospheric debris. In addition, it is also highly resistant to chemical, thermal, and physical wear--making it ideal for durability in a harsh environment.  Today, a Kevlar® composite is used as a protective outer covering for the Bigelow Space Module on the International Space Station for exactly these reasons. We wanted to make an aramid fiber similar in structure to Kevlar so that it can exhibit those same desirable properties that Kevlar possesses.
Cartoon depiction of the detrimental impacts choosing of a weak balloon material.
Current industrial production of Kevlar® is based on materials which are derived from petrochemicals. The long term use of fossil fuels is hazardous to the environment and will become unsustainable as our fuel sources are exhausted. By replacing the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine and terephthaloyl chloride with a single biologically produced monomer, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA),"

Intergenerational TU Delft iGEM BBQ
We believe iGEM doesn't stop after the competition. Not only do many teams continue their project, the iGEM experience creates intergenerational bonding. Therefore, we organized an intergenerational TU Delft iGEM BBQ for which we invited old team members since the beginning of TU Delft in iGEM.

OWee
During the first week for freshmen in Delft, there is a big event organized called the OWee. Here, we presented our project with beetroot juice. Beetroot juice has been speculated to improve physical performance, which we wanted students to test on our running track. In the meantime, we would of course tell them all about our project!

Figure 1:  The maturation of an B-lymphocyte in reaction to a specific microbe.
Activated B-lymphocytes only produce one type of antibody that has affinity for a single epitope on an antigen. The antibody structure consists of a constant part and a hypervariable part. The hypervariable part is responsible for the specificity towards the epitope of an antigen. The hypervariable part is generated by rearrangement of gene segments during development of B-lymphocytes and by RNA splicing. Reference: Lubert Stryer JMB, John L. Tymoczko. The Immune System.  Biochemistry. 7 ed: W. H. Freeman and Company; 2012. Furthermore, protein processing contributes to diversity and affinity of the produced antibodies. A somatic mutation Somatic mutationWhen mutations occur in somatic cell lines the mutation will be present in all descendants of this particular cell within the organism. These mutations can lead to malignant cancer. can greatly increase affinity for the antigen, a process called affinity maturation. Reference: Lubert Stryer JMB, John L. Tymoczko. The Immune System.  Biochemistry. 7 ed: W. H. Freeman and Company; 2012. Every B-lymphocyte processes differently, thus every B cell will produce different antibodies. This increases the antibody repertoire and ensures the best possible protection from intruders.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of TorA tag to GFP did not impair the functionality of GFP, widefield images were taken with the widefield protocol . As shown in Figure 43, GFP fluorescence was both observed in the KEIO and WT strain. Consequently, It is shown that more GFP is present in WT. Furthermore, you can see that the shape of the KEIO strain cells is elongated. This is probably caused by the deletion of TolA, which destabilizes the membrane ( Baker et al. 2014 ).
Figure 43: Widefield images. Widefield images of GFP-TA in the KEIO (right) and WT (left) strain.
For GFP to be able to be transported into vesicles, it needs to be present in the periplasm. Therefore, an osmoshock was performed using the osmoshock protocol , to check the periplasmic fraction of the KEIO and WT strain, both with and without TorA-GFP. After the osmoshock the fluorescence of the GFP in the periplasm and cytoplasm was measured in the plate-reader.
In Figure 44, the fluorescence intensity in the periplasm in WT is significantly higher than in the cytoplasm. However, this difference in intensity is much less pronounced in the KEIO strain. A possible explanation for this is the previously demonstrated vesicle production. Previously, it was shown in Figure 40, that the KEIO strain produces a large amount of vesicles, while the WT strain produces none. This result suggests that in the KEIO strain GFP is transported into the vesicles, which reduces the amount of GFP in the periplasm. Another possibility could be that both the growth and the protein production is greatly impaired in the KEIO-strain, due to its mutation. This means that the overall GFP production is lower, leading to a lower concentration in the periplasm as well. All in all, we see that GFP-TA is transported into the periplasm.
Figure 44: GFP fluorescence in the periplasm and cytoplasm. Intensity of GFP in the periplasm and cytoplasm. The fluorescence intensity is measured for the samples TorA-GFP in the WT and KEIO strain and WT ad KEIO strain without plasmid.
In Figure 45, the analysed data is shown. Evidently, GFP is present in the purified sample of GFP-TA in WT, even though previous experiments showed that WT produces little to no vesicles, suggesting that those values are a background from the protocol used, due to a cell destruction during the centrifugation step.To"

Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#wetlab#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," of MtrC, MtrBC complexes are not detected in a mtrA deletion background 7. Moreover, while isolated MtrA and MtrC can complex, it appears that MtrB is further needed in order for MtrAC interactions to be stable [7]. This indicates that in vivo, there is likely a requirement for association of MtrA and B, followed by association with MtrC for efficient electron transfer.      MtrB is also integral to the correct localization of MtrC, MtrA, and OmcA to their respective positions along the Mtr respiratory pathway. In a mtrB deletion background, MtrA is unable to localize to the OM [7]; similarly, significant amounts of OmcA and MtrC have been shown to mislocalize to the CM in mtrB deletion strains [9].      Of the b-barrel mtrB paralogs that exist in the Shewanella genome, mtrB has been shown to be the most functional in Fe(III) citrate reduction. Coursolle and Gralnick, 2012, recently looked at different combinations of PECs, b-barrel, and OMC paralogs using a DMtr/DmtrB/mtrE strain. Of the functional iron-reducing modules examined, MtrA/MtrB/MtrC showed the highest Fe(III) citrate reduction levels followed by MtrA/MtrB/MtrF . Combinations with MtrE, a MtrB paralog, were also able to reduce Fe(III) citrate, albeit at a lower rate, while neither DmsF nor S04359 produced functional iron citrate reducing modules [1]. This combined with the integral role of MtrB in positioning of PEC and OMCs along the Mtr respiratory pathway makes it an ideal target for our reporter systems.

NEGEM Meetup
We shared our progress with Tufts, Boston University, WPI, Harvard, and MIT on June 21. We got feedback on running killing assays and also heard concerns that AMPs were not suitable for clinical distribution. This feedback helped us to refine our focus on the foundational advance of post-translational modifications. We also completed surveys for WPI on lead contamination and for BU Hardware on microfluidics in synthetic biology.
INSA-UPS
We talked over Skype and email to team INSA-UPS concerning their work with AMPs for combatting cholera. We gave them feedback about their project and possible collaborations between our group including the opportunity for us to try to produce one of their AMPs in our cell-free reaction. Unfortunately the timing for this collaboration didn't pan out. In addition we completed their survey about a hypothetical water treatment device. We gave troubleshooting advice but were unable to test each others’ parts.
Boston U
We also talked to the Boston University Wetlab team working on cell-free expression for RNA controlled switches. We compared cell free protocols and discussed challenges in using the expression system but did not have time to test each other’s parts.

Capsule
Up to now, we’ve successfully obtained transformed P. aeruginosa expressing our antigenic peptides as T3SS effectors. To make our aim bacteria the form more suitable for therapeutic use, we decided to prepare them into freeze-dried powder as filler of capsules. One more thing we must take account of is that since we’re aiming at colorectal cancer (CRC), the drug must be released in the small intestine. So we have to find an enteric capsule shell, which is acid-resistant and merely soluble in the small intestine, to protect our therapeutic bacteria from being destroyed by gastric acid. After consulting Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and comprehensive web searching, we finally decided on one product of Suzhou Capsugel ® Ltd., DRcapsTM. According to the instructions of DRcapsTM, it bears at least the following merits that suit our project well:
It provides effective protection for acid-vulnerable ingredient in low-pH environment.
It has lower water content, thus providing better protection for hygroscopic drug components.
Made of plant-source hypromellose, it is also applicable for vegetarians and religious people.
We found that SJTU-BioX-Shanghai was also in search of enteric capsules for their own project, and that they knew well how to make freeze-dried powder. So we communicated to reach an agreement that we would provide them with reliable capsule shells and they help us prepare our bacterium freeze-dried powder in return. On 15th October, we trafficked empty DRcapsTM capsules and aim bacteria stored in liquid medium to Shanghai Jiaotong University. There, we were glad to see our P. aeruginosa turn into dried, pinky powder. Later, we filled it into empty capsule shells carried with us in biosafety cabinet. We sincerely appreciate iGEMers and teachers of SJTU for their generous help.
Owing to limitation of time, we haven’t yet figured out what kinds of adjuvant fit our therapy best. However, during our visit to Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd. last month, the company promised that we could contact their Research and Development Department for further discussion on"
Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"itor strain has now been transformed with all the parts necessary for operation of our DNA degrading switch. Maxicell induction will activate the kill switch due to expression of homing endonuclease I-SceI linearizing pImm. To perform DL2524 maxicell induction:
• Measure OD600 of overnight culture.
• Dilute culture at 0.025 OD600 in LB with 0.2 % glucose.
• Grow for 80 minutes at 37 °C.
• Dilute culture 10 times with 0.5% arabinose and LB.
• Incubate at 37 °C shaking gently.
3.6 Validation
In order to observe the DNA degradation as a result of our switches activation we propose to run gel electrophoresis periodically over the 24hours after maxicell induction. We would expect to see a number of small DNA fragments from the maxicells degraded chromosome and bands corresponding to our 2 constructs pImm and pCol. After degradation switch activation we would expect to observe the bands corresponding to our plasmid constructs dissapear as Colicin E2 degrades maxicell DNA. Due to our need to visualise potentially very small DNA fragments we propose to use SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain or some similar high sensitivity strain.
Meetups
iGEM teams meetups was some of the most useful collaborations we had. Constructive critique we got during meetups and new ideas ideas we heard from meetups attendees and organisers had a huge impact on our project.
Scottish iGEM Meetup
As our first meetup we attended Scottish iGEM Meetup which was held at The University of St Andrews and hosted by St Andrews iGEM 2018 team at 3rd of July. Hence, all three Scottish teams participated (St Andrews, Edinburgh_OG and us). We first presented our projects, had a discussion about them and as well we had some talks on useful topics as human practices, collaborations, etc. We were delighted to talk with Will Wright, Europen Ambassador of iGEM  community.
iGEM UK Meetup
We attended iGEM meetup UK which was organised by SynBioUK and hosted by University of Oxford iGEM team at 12th-13th July 2018. It was an amazing experience to meet almost all UK teams and talk with our collegues from the same field about projects, and getting very valuable feedback. Moreover, it was one of the first experience to present our project as well. We attended a number of workshops and talks of speakers,"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"1], we can compute the protein concentration in µM: for E. coli we have 3x103 µM, while for S. cerevisiae we have 80x103 µM. These estimations enable us to say that the nM range obtained in our simulations is within reasonable orders of magnitude.
From the simulation, we see that the ratio between proteins and gRNAs (included GFP, when espressed) is very large, i.e. proteins outnumber gRNAs. This behavior was confirmed experimentally both in E. coli, where this ratio was 1000, and S. cerevisiae, where we reached a ratio of 10'000 [16].
Comparaison with experiments
We can observe that the predicted time-response (outside of equilibrium) is somehow different from what we observed experimentally (cf. Results ). This is mainly caused by the difference in initial conditions. At the beginning of the experiments, cells are growing at a a faster rate than the rate of GFP production, therefore the OD600 normalization causes a drop of RFU (relative fluorescence units) levels. In contrast, our model is at a the single cell level and does not represent this phenomenon. For this reason we can only compare our model and experimental data at steady state.
Transistor activation in E. coli
Since our first simulation of the basal expression produced acceptable results, we focused on the activation of our biological transistor-like element. Experimentally (cf. Results ), we found the following ratio between basal and activated states (after subtracting the autofluosescence) of:             \[                 \frac{\alpha_\text{max}}{\alpha_b} \approx 17.             \]             This ratio is very similar to the one obtained by Bikard et al. [24], which is around 20. Therefore, we can link \(\alpha_\text{max}\) to our estimation of \(\alpha_b\) (cf. Constants ), thus obtaining the last parameter needed to model activation.
Activated GFP expression in E. coli.
Modeling enabled us to predict an activated GFP expression that is 17 times higher than the basal expression. GFP is now present at high concentration, but this concentration is still compatible with the total protein concentration within a cell.
Transistor inhibition in E. coli
Experimentally (cf. Results ) we found the following ratio between basal and inhibited states (after subtracting the autofluosescence):             \[                 \frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_b} \approx 0.6             \]             However, in our model of dCas9-g"

In summary, After initially characterizing the dose-time response manner of MerR based reporter system, we constructed a saturated mutagenesis library at MerR binding site, a dyad sequence between -10 and -35 region of promoter PmerT. Shift of switch point and maxima of dose response curve was observed in dyad-sequence mutants, which shows that the binding affinity between TF and its operator site greatly influence bacterial sensitivity to mercury.

Register and attend
Our team has been part of the iGEM competition and had an amazing summer developing our project. 13 members of our team are registered to attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston and could not be more excited about it.
Deliverables
We have completed and submitted all 8 required deliverables on time.
Attribution
We have many people and institutions we are thankful for this year. Special thank you belongs, of course, to our university that provided us with finances and space to execute the project. The many others who deserve a great thanks can be found at our Attributions page.
Characterization/Contribution
This year our team decided to both participate in Interlab Measument Study and to characterize an existing biobrick from iGEM Slovenia 2010 which has been an inspiration to our project. You can read more about the characterization in the Contribution page of our project.
Silver
Validated part
One base of our project was to extend the zeaxanthin pathway by introduction of three enzymes into E. Coli. We validated all three enzyme BioBricks by sequencing ( BBa_K2423005 and BBa_K2423008 ). The BioBrick with CsADH (BBa_K2423007) was, is in addition to sequencing verified by SDS-PAGE and activity assay. You can read more in our Results page .
Collaboration
Our team takes pride in collaborating with other teams and getting insight from the iGEM community. This year our most notable collaboration was a panel discussion we organized with iGEM Stockholm where more than 100 people participated. But we also worked with iGEM Lund to help them with their first year, organized webinars, made postcard and more! You can read about our collaborations on our Collaborations page.
Human Practices

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,", no GFP signal could be observed in cells transfected with GFP reporter driven by EF-1alpha promoter. Originally, we thought that the sequence of EF-1alpha promoter cloned from iDUET101a contained the full functional promoter region annotated in pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen). We believed that EF-1alpha did trigger transcription but failed to translate the GFP coding sequence due to insufficient 5’ untranslated region (UTR). After the regional jamboree, the promoter was re-cloned with additional 3' sequences after the identified TATA box to allow a longer 5’ untranslated region before the GFP coding DNA sequence. From the the results above, we believed that translation of GFP is successful this time.
Conclusion
EF-1alpha promoter was observed to drive expression of GFP in HEK293FT cells and green fluorescence was observed under fluorescence microscope.

Thus, we tried several ways to spread our idea on campus and in society.(e.g. Questionaires, brochures, lectures, interviews, etc) Meanwhile, we also collected information from different sources, including education field, government officials and charity organization,etc.
Education
We propagandized biology and synthetic biology concepts, iGEM history and ideas, as well as our project. We hope our education can cover people from different walks of life as many as possible. As a result, we pay attention to every opportunity that we can obtain to contact with people out of the lab.
Pupil & middle school students in rural areas in China
In summer 2016, some of our team members went to remote areas in Gansu and Sichuan Province in China for volunteer works. They taught primary and middle school students who cannot receive scientific and cultural education of good quality due to economic reasons. Considering interesting synthetic biology knowledge can bring happiness and inspiration to them, we briefly introduced what can be achieved by synthetic biology in an imaginative and creative way, including the knowledge of bacteria, plasmids and genes, and what we can manipulate on genes to generate a different thing. We also asked them to draw pictures of the ideal biology in their mind.

We were able to successfully print and image of up to 4 layers of bioink with only little mixing between the layers. Our prototype passed its final test in a collaboration with the iGEM team from Groningen confirming that it can not only be easily used by any other iGEM team, but also is even compatible with the different strain they were using, B.subtilis.  Although redissolving jellified alginate becomes more challenging with size, our bacterial cells were able to survive under alginate dissolving conditions for 36 hours.

Since the 1980s numerous applications and materials have been developed for 3D printing. Nowadays, starting from a computer generated three dimensional image file (stereolithography .STL) metals, plastics or even food can be printed in any shape imaginable. Recently, significant progress has been made in the three dimensional printing of mammalian stem cells towards creating  artificial organs within many renowned research groups all around the world working in the field. Since 3D bioprinting has high potential and is still largely unexplored, we set out to find a novel application. Inspired by machine-specific properties: precision and reproducibility, we came up with the idea to print cells in a structurally defined pattern. In this way we intend to meet the increasing demand of reliable product testing in medicine and health applications.
In the following pages, we describe the development and the printing conditions of our prototype.
Making 3D Biofilms
Biolinker: From 3D printer to a Biological System
Normal 3D printers generally follow the same principle: a raw material is transferred into liquid state by melting, or utilization of a fine powder, to obtain high precision upon deposition of the material. At this point the material needs to form a  stable, solid structure,by cooling  it, or using UV light that chemically solidifies the compound.
Based on 3D printer general principles, we identified the following design requirements for the Biolinker:
- Liquid bioink
- Curing reaction to form a supporting scaffold
- Removable scaffold to obtain the final bacterial structure
- Cells need to survive every step of the entire process
- Sterile environment needs to be maintained at"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.
NICE Criteria
Our Sensor
The condition being screened should be a serious health problem in terms of frequency and/or severity
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.
All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable

Biosafety
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
Lab safety Manual
To deal with the problem, we have edited a security manual in Chinese, which includes risk assessment, personal protection facilities, the use of laboratory equipment, emergency treatment and so on, providing a reference for biosafety education in Chinese universities. We sent the manual to teachers responsible for laboratory safety in our university and received positive feedbacks saying that our work is helping to explain the details of biosafety at an international level. We will complete it continuously and make it become an indispensable part of our experimental lessons.
For complete lab safety manual, please click here .
Education video in Chinese
We’ve proposed an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Science_-_-_TEXT.html,". We made liquid cultures of different colonies then extracted the plasmids with an Qiagen Midiprep Kit. We also performed midipreps with the plasmid vector pET-32a(+) and the iGEM plasmid vector pSB1C3. We carried out the digestion of the inserts and the vectors, and after migration on agarose gel and gel extraction, we isolated the inserts and both vectors: pET-32A(+) and pSB1C3. After a step of dephosphorylation of the vectors we carried out the ligation of the inserts with both vector plasmids and then directly transformed these new plasmids in competent cells DH5α (for storage) or BL21DE3 (for protein expression). (see Figure 6)
Figure 6: Scheme for the cloning and expression strategy for the protein components of our device.
The plasmids pSB1C3 containing the inserts were then placed in liquid cultures, extracted, sequenced and finally sent to iGEM. The plasmids pET-32a(+) containing the inserts were also placed in liquid cultures and then protein expression was induced by adding IPTG. Once the production of the proteins was completed, the cells were lysed by sonication.
Degradation of Anthracene by the Aether enzyme cocktail
To demonstrate the activity of the enzyme cocktail mix in its ability to degrade PAHs, we used anthracene as substrate.  We devised a spectrophotometric assay based on the absorbance at 254 nm of the substrate.  Cells were induced to produce the enzymes E1 (E1-1, E1-2), E2, E3, and E4. After lysis, cells extracts were used as the source of each enzyme component. A control was set with induced cell extract transformed with the empty pET32a expression vector. The degradation of anthracene over time was effective only with the enzyme mix. Therefore, we have shown that our Aether cocktail mix is able to degrade PAHs. This assay can be potentially extended to other compounds belonging to the same family of compounds, such as benzo[a]pyrene.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," know that we are tackling a useful problem and that synthetic biology is in fact a tangible and realistic strategy to use.  We also needed to ensure that each component of our system was developed with the concerns, priorities, and opinions of oil sands professionals, political leaders, policy makers and environmental activists in mind.  Finally, in order to really make a difference, we needed to do this in a safe way and needed to find a way to relay what we’re doing to a broader audience.
Welcome to the human practices component of our project where we address all these issues.

Collaboration
In order to assess if FRED and OSCAR have a real application in the oil and gas industry, we became involved in a synthetic biology dialogue with the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI).  Here we discovered that biosensors and tailings ponds remediation were two potential platform technologies which the oil sands could use, suggesting our project has relevance in the oil sands.
Interviews With Experts
In order to determine the relevance of producing a device capable of detecting and breaking down toxins in the tailings ponds, our group talked to some experts in related fields to try to get a sense for the relevance of a synthetic biology approach in the field, and how to design our system in the best and safest way possible.  This allowed us to make informed design choices for our system!
Physical/Engineered Design Considerations
Based on findings from our conversations with experts, we wanted to design a contained and safe biosensor and bioreactor.  We took care in designing enclosed systems with structural safety mechanisms in place. In addition, we worked around these restrictions to maintain a structural design with expense and productivity in mind.
Genetic Killswitch
While the physical design considerations served as indispensable first steps to ensuring the containment of our systems, we also felt it necessary to implement genetic safety mechanisms. This took the form of a killswitch, which selectively destroys the genetically engineered bacteria in the rare case of their escape from our biosensor or bioreactor.  Keeping both our environment and industry concerns in hand, we developed a novel ribo-killswitch system for containing our organism using exo/endonucleases.
Safety
We take great care in making sure our project is safe for not only the environment, but also to all of the team members working on FRED and OSCAR. There are a number of safety considerations that we have taken from the sections above in order to ensure that the construction of FRED and OSCAR was done in the safest way possible.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," putting GFP gene in downstream of Pnrd and measuring the time shift of fluorescent strength of GFP. Second one is putting GFP in downstream of Pconst and conduct the same measurement as above. The concentration of GFP estimated from fluorescent strength is shown in the table below. The data obtained from these experiments are shown below.
We estimated the transcription rate of genes in downstream of Pnrd ($TC_{pnrd}$), transcription rate of genes in downstream of Pconst ($TC_{pconst}$), translation rate of protein (GFP) ($TL$), half-life of mRNA ($HL_{mRNA}$), half-life of GFP ($HL_{GFP}$), maturation time of GFP ($MT$), cell cycle ($CYCLE$) and length of  activation period of Pnrd ($PNRD$),  by parameter fitting.
In the experiment using Pnrd, the time series of concentration of mRNA encoding GFP, immature GFP protein, and mature GFP protein would be described by following differential equations. $$\frac{d[\mathrm{mRNA}]}{dt} = TC_{pnrd} - \frac{\ln{2}}{HL_{mRNA}}  [\mathrm{mRNA}]  \mathrm{(with Pnrd)} $$ $$\frac{d[\mathrm{mRNA}]}{dt} = - \frac{\ln{2}}{HL_{mRNA}} [\mathrm{mRNA}] \mathrm{(without Pnrd)} $$ $$\frac{d[\mathrm{imGFP}]}{dt} = TL [\mathrm{mRNA}] - [\mathrm{imGFP}] \frac{\ln{2}}{HL_{GFP}} - \frac{\ln{2}}{MT} [\mathrm{imGFP}] $$ $$\frac{d[\mathrm{GFP}]}{dt} = \frac{\ln{2}}{MT} [\mathrm{imGFP}] - \frac{\ln{2}}{HL_{GFP}} [\mathrm{GFP}] $$ In the experiment using Pconst, differential equations of mRNA would be described as follows. Differential equations of GFP proteins would be same as above. $$\frac{d[\mathrm{mRNA}]}{dt} = TC_{pconst} - \frac{\ln{2}}{HL_{mRNA}} [\mathrm{mRNA}]$$ We fitted measured value with these equations with an algorithm called “differential evolution”. We also developed a tool which can calculate parameters with inputted data and output the result. The source code of the tool is this"
