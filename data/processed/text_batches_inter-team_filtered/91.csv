Acknowledgements
The iGEM Amsterdam 2011 team would like to thank everyone that helped with our project for their generous support.
As this is the first year the Vrije Universiteit and the Universiteit van Amsterdam sent a team to the iGEM competition, it was a learning experience for everyone. Representing two universities as one team has proven to be very challenging, especially because we are the first team to do so, and we couldn't have gotten this far without all the support. A special thanks goes out to:
Domenico Bellomo; for his invaluable support and experience in running a successful iGEM team.
Pernette J. Verschure; for her help in maintaining the general flow of the project, and for her assistance with all our biosafety related enquiries.
Our daily supervisors: Lisette Anink, Frédéric Crémazy and Diewertje Piebes; for their invaluable advice and limitless patience.
The Nuclear Organization Group of the Swammerdam Institute of Life Sciences; for allowing us to use their lab space and equipment.
The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics; for letting us use their climate chambers and cold storage.
Nadine Bongaerts and Eva Brinkman from BioTecture; for their help with developing our game for the night of the nerds.
Willem Fokkema; for an insightful brainstorm session on outside-the-box applications.
Tsjalling Swierstra, of the Universiteit van Maastricht; for giving us a workshop in ethics and the socio-public aspects of synthetic biology.
All Dutch iGEM teams; for the great get-togethers and moral support.
Team Yale; for sharing their anti-freeze proteins with us.
Team Stanford-Brown; for offering us the opportunity to participate in their extreme altitude balloon flight experiments.
And to all our sponsors; for their most generous support.
Thank you all!

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Transcriptomics test_-_-_TEXT.html," nucleotide strand in mostly eukaryotes for translation purposes. They are added onto the ends of our RNA to work as a primer target in the next step of the process.
4. cDNA Conversion
Using our newly added Poly(A)-tails as a primer target, we subject our RNA to reverse transcription to create complementary DNA copies - or cDNA. The RNA needs to be converted into DNA to be sequenced with the MinION device. The original RNA template is then degraded and a second strand is synthesized onto the cDNA.
5. Barcoding
A necessary step to be able to make sense of the sequenced data is to attach so-called barcodes to the end of each cDNA strand. Barcodes are small sequences which are known beforehand and allows us to differentiate between different samples. Because two transcriptome samples will be sequenced at the same time, this will let us know which sequence came from which sample.
6. Library Preparation
One final step before sequencing can begin is to attach adaptor sequences onto the end of the barcodes. These specialized adaptors allows the sequencing device to recognize the cDNA-strand and move it into the sequencing machinery.
7. Sequencing
The MinION device works by applying an electrical current and pulling the DNA strand through small biological pores. This movement causes changes in the electrical current also passing through the pore - and the charge of the current varies depending on which nucleotide of the DNA strand is passing through at the moment. This is what enables the sequencing - the current changes are translated into the nucleotide order of the DNA strand.
8. Bioinformatics
With the genetic information of the samples finally deciphered, it is time to match it to known genes in the E.coli genome and quantify the amount of genes that was expressed way back before step one of this pipeline. This allows us to see the possible difference in gene expression between the E.coli worm samples and the E.coli control samples."

Week Beginning 13/7/15
Summary
Protein expression optimization experiments were continued this week. A growth curve assay was carried out to assess the effect of LbpA expression over a longer period of time.
14/7: Plate Reader Growth Curve Assay
Aim of experiment: To induce expression of LbpA using different concentration of IPTG and allow cells to grow for 16 hours in order to monitor cell growth.
Protocols Used: Growth Curve Assay
Results: Figure 6
Next Steps: A plate reader experiment will be set up next week to monitor the growth rate of the the cells over a longer period of time after LbpA expression has been induced.
17/7: Sample Preparation for Western Blot
Aim of experiment: To check if the cells in the induced cultures ~7 hours after being induced are producing LbpA.
Protocols Used: Western Blot Sample Preparation Note: The day cultures were grown for 7 hours after they were induced and then the samples were frozen, to be blotted on Monday.
Results: N/A
Next Steps: The samples will be ran on an SDS gel on Monday and blotted.
Week Beginning 20/7/15
Summary
Samples from the growth curve assay were blotted to see if LbpA is being produced at the later stages of the growth curve. A further growth curve assay was also performed which monitored cell growth until a certain OD600 was reached, at which point the cultures were induced.
20/7: Western Blot LpbA Culture Samples
Aim of experiment: To western blot the LbpA culture samples from Friday.
Protocols Used: Western Blot
Results: Nothing was visible on the blot.
Next Steps: Another plate reader experiment will be set up on Thursday where the cultures will be monitored for three hours before induction with IPTG and then for a further 20 hours afterwards.
23/7: Growth Curve Assay
Aim of experiment: To check if the cells begin to die after induction with IPTG after having already grown to an OD600 of 0.5.
Protocols Used: Growth Curve Assay
Results: Figure 7
Next Steps: Samples of these cultures will be taken 6 hours after induction to check for the presence of LbpA.
Week Beginning 27/7/15
Summary
The presence of LbpA was confirmed in the culture 6 hours after induction with IPTG so protein purification was started this week.
27/7: Overnight Cultures

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Reporter System#Feces Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," of amilGFP, LB-media and feces were mixed and filtered through a coffee filter and a Munktell filter shows some linearity in the fluorescence intensity.
Figure 3. Unfiltered samples at varying concentrations, x-axis and intensity of light being emitted from the sample on the y-axis. As one can see, there is unfortunately no correlation between the different concentrations. I.e. the lowest concentration of amilGFP shows the highest intensity followed by the sample containing the highest concentration.
Figure 4.This graph shows the data from the filtrate, and shows some linearity as could be hypothesized. There is a negative slope from higher concentrations on the right side of the graph to the lower concentrations on the left, showing that higher concentrations of GFP can be seen via the plate reader in filtered horse manure.
Conclusion
It would be interesting to redo the experiment and to see if there would be any change over time. Other settings for the plate reader also might yield different results.  Furthermore it would be interesting to redo the experiment with lower concentrations and a smaller interval to come to a conclusion on what the lowest amount bacteria that is required for detection of fluorescent bacteria in feces is. There was also some inconsistency in the fluorescent intensity measured between triplicate samples, and more duplicates would likely make the results more accurate.
Chromoproteins may possibly be a viable strategy as a reporter system in horse manure if a proper amount of cells can be grown. We do not know how cultures would be excreted out of a horse, whether in somewhat solid colonies, completely liquid, or a combination of both.
Building upon this, we decided to go forward and test a new reporter system that responds specifically to bilirubin, since bilirubin is present in mammalian intestines and would potentially prevent extraneous readings [3, 4]. This followup experiment can be seen at our UnaG Page.

This time the BIOSINT_Mexico iGEM team had the opportunity to support the new Guanajuato_MX team. This team is made up of students from different universities, who with the intention of starting their experience in this competition, they decided to join efforts to carry out their project. Competition from synthetic biology, iGEM, is not only based on the successful completion of the main idea of ​​the project, but also has other areas of knowledge in which the teams must approach, the development of ethical attitudes and free spreading information are some of them, as well as integration between different teams. Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the development of the project to meet all the objectives; in this case the Guanajuato_Mx team, with all their encourage decided to participate in the annual version of Interlab Study, nevertheless, its iGEM kit was unfortunately not given them, so this study could hardly do. Fortunately for both teams, we were able to be in contact and because BIOSINT_Mexico did have its kit, with great spirits was given them the necessary material, to perform their Interlab Experiment and still participate in the study. That was how Guanajuato_Mx began working to achieve its mission, were later presented other problems, some doubts were clarified between both teams to get results. Finally, although it was a mutual effort to achieve results, different conditions make it impossible to get them; however, the collaboration was always the best intentions of continuous improvement between the teams.
Guanajuato_Mx, thank you for allowing us to work with you and make us participants in these activities, It will be always a pleasure to participate in this kind of stuff whose sole intention is to spread the knowledge in the best way possible, making friends.

NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," another, the festival provided bikes for visitors a opportunity to have a “sneak peek” at college life.
This year had 116 stands and more than 6000 people participated, most of the stands are school departments. They will give brief introduction to their department, giving high school student a clue of what they are studying now and what they will do after             graduate. There will also have interview practices and campus tour for the high school students, overall it is a joyful, full-packed festival.
It is a big event that so many people will come, therefore it is a very good chance to promote iGEM and synthetic biology. Besides, visitors are from all over Taiwan, which means we can spread the ideas throughout Taiwan. This is the main reason that             make us so eager to join it.
Process
Actually, being the only few stands that is not a school department, before we stoped them to introduced us, most of them take the initiative to our stand and ask what are we doing. Some of them even ask “Are you a department?” When they are curious,             it is the best chance to showed them what are iGEM and what are we doing recently.
We talked about the three candidate topics that we want to do, and described what issue we want to conquer. But most importantly, we asked them to choose a project that they want the most, and collected their opinion on each topic.
For us, the main goal is not only promote iGEM but also synthetic biology. We want to let the students and their parents has more information about this new but definitely strong technology, which have already changed the human life a lot.
In order to have a little connection to the high school students, we designed a game that is associated with DNA. We want them to understand synthetic biology is not a concept that is extremely difficult to understand but something you have already learnt             a little at school. The game is called The Fantastic DNA Matching, which has beginner version and advance version.
The rule is simply same as classic card matching but with a little twist.
Lay out all the cards facing down in rows forming a large rectangle on the table.
The player can only turn over two cards at one turn, if the player successfully making two cards match, they can place it on their stack.
If the cards are not a match they are turned back over and it is now the next turn.
4. The cards are not typical poker, for the beginner mode, we have written the nucleic acid bases of DNA and RNA on it. So a matching pair is not to same cards but two nucleic acid"

The S-layer protein SbpA is extremely resistant to deletions changing its properties. The deletion of up to 237 carboxy-terminal amino acids does not affect the ability to self-assemble into square lattices. After deletion of 350 amino acids the lattice structure changes from square (p4) to oblique (p1) symmetry (Badelt-Lichtblau et al., 2009) .
Expression in E. coli
The SbpA gene under the control of a T7 / lac promoter (<partinfo>K525403</partinfo>) was fused to mCitrine ( BBa_J18931 ) using Freiburg BioBrick assembly for characterization experiments.
The SbpA|mCitrine fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli KRX after induction of T7 polymerase by supplementation of 0.1 % L-rhamnose and 1 mM IPTG using the autinduction protocol by Promega.
Fig.2: Growth curve of E. coli KRX expressing the fusion protein of SbpA and mCitrine with and without induction, cultivated at 37 °C in autoinduction medium with and without inductor, respectively. A curve depicting KRX wildtype is shown for comparison. After induction at approximately 4 h the OD600 of the induced K525405  drops slightly when compared to the uninduced culture. Both cultures grow significantly slower than KRX wildtype.
Fig.3: RFU to OD600 ratio of E. coli KRX expressing the fusion protein of SbpA and mCitrine with and without induction. A curve depicting KRX wildtype is shown for comparison. After induction at approximately 4 h the RFU to OD600 ratio starts to rise in the induced culture. Compared to the uninduced culture the ratio is roughly three times higher. The KRX wildtype shows no variation in the RFU to OD600 ratio.
Purification of SbpA fusion protein

ITB_Indonesia,2014,Team:ITB Indonesia#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," a substrate for TCA cycle. The engineered bacteria are not designed to be exposed to the general public. We intend to utilize bioreactors to concentrate these bacteria in order to achieve high efficiency. To eliminate safety risk to people around bioreactors, in the future, we are planning to use kill switches that kill escaped bacteria. Horizontal Gene Transfer become the most common risk that could appear from GEOs. Other strain/species may uptake engineered genes, and if the genes give advantage in fitness, it may outcompete other strains creating natural imbalance. So that designing a safety containment to degrade DNA and/or separate the DNA from the environment and/or prevent natural strains from gaining advantages from modified DNA is very important for further development.
Further Comments
If you are completing a Preliminary Version of your Safety Form, use this space to describe how far you have progressed in your project, and give some comments about any questions that you left blank. You can also use this space for any other comments or additional material.
Currently our projects are already at the stage of assembling parts and test for the expression of several parts. So far our lab safety condition is quite good and can be handled well too.

Since too much starch may lead to obesity, we should make a reduction. Lastly, if he can follow all these requirements, we can than adjust his diet into a much healthier one, like, adding more organic food or something. If we ask a client to stick to all these rules at first, we can say that there’s no possibility that his determination will last.
We: Have you ever seen someone, like, desperately push himself to the limit no matter what it cost, and, just to lose weight?
  
Coach: Of course, yes. But, I would like to say that if you only care about your stature, but ignore the true value and purpose of exercising; I will tell the person, I’m sorry, but, I think we may not suit your need, and it will be better for you to look for someone else.
We: So, how do clients get started?
Coach: First, we reach a consensus with our clients. Then, we analyze their current physical conditions. Since we should prevent clients from over exercising, we, have the obligation to remind those who train themselves in rashness of the importance of keeping a regular daily routine. 
We: So, how’s it like to have a “regular daily routine” ?
Coach: Try to avoid overworking. Also, too much sleep is not advisable.
 
We: So, how healthy we get is not in proportion with how much we exercise, right? 
Coach: Exactly. You shouldn’t do what your body can’t afford just to get a sense of achievement. 
We: So, in addition to exercising, do you control your diet as well? 
Coach: Of course, yes. But, we don’t deliberately restrain the appetite, for people drop off easily because of that. 
We: So, according to what you said, do you consider our project beneficial?
Coach: Sure. I can say that it is really an innovative idea. But, what you should know is that the mechanism of sugar controlling in our body is much more delicate than you can imagine. You guys should give an insight into some impact it may bring to, like: Will there be any side effects? Will people be too reliable on it? Will a long term dosing lead to endocrine disorders? These are all what you should be wary of.  
We: Can we lose weight by just stop eating anything? 
Coach: Yes. But, I must say that if you stay in"

In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR V36F mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM).

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html,"V domain (sensory domain) from YtvA and histidine kinase domain (effector domain) from FixL. This fusionprotein was designed and constructed by Möglich et al. (2009). YF1, nor it's precursors, do not exist naturally in E. coli nor reportedly interfere with indigenous E. coli genes but according to Möglich et al. (2009) the sensor works well in E. coli: it's capable of 70-fold supression of the target promoter when illuminated with blue light. The sensor does not require additional, foreign molecules in order to get activated by blue light. The gene is only 1132 bp long and it has been used by previous iGEM teams, including Uppsala 2011 , STJU BioX Shanghai 2013 and Tokyo NoKoGen 2013 . Thus, we evaluated YF1 to be the most suitable light sensor protein for our three channel switch.
Based on the work of Möglich et al. (2009) we describe the mechanism of YF1 blue light sensor in greater detail. YF1 is a water soluble chimeric fusionprotein that contains two domains linked together with a Jα linker sequence. The N terminal domain is a flavin nucleotide binding LOV domain (light-oxygen-voltage, a sub group of PAS sensor domains) from Bacillus subtilis YtvA. This domain incorporates flavin mononucleotide noncovalently and this induces a conformational change in this light sensory domain.
YF1 light sensor protein is a combination of two protein domains from two different organisms.
The C terminal domain of YF1 is a histidine kinase, the FixL effector domain from Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The original protein, FixL, is involved in regulating the nitrate respiration and nitrate fixation. The histidine kinase is functioning only when it is phosphorylated. It has autophosphorylation activity that is regulated by the sensor domain. Autophosphorylated histidine kinase activates a FixJ ( BBa_K592005 ) response regulator by transferring a phosphoryl group. However, when the histidine kinase domain is unphosphorylated, it has actually phosphatase activity for the response regulator (Diensthuber et al., 2013). Phosphorylated FixJ binds to FixK2 promoter ( BBa_K592006 ) initiating the expression of the corresponding genes. This system should be completely orthogonal in E. coli.

Igem Xuzhou communication meeting
  Northeastern    University  
rPeking University
    On July 14, 2018, we came to Peking University for a collaboration and exchanged ideas with Peking University's IGEM team.
    After the self-introduction, we introduced each other's projects and proposed suggestions on the project. The project of Peking University's IGEM team is to design a protein scaffold to increase the enzymatic reaction rate and yield, and hope to be applied to industrial production. In the exchange, we raised our confusion and exchanged experimental design.
    Later, we introduced our own projects, and Peking University students also made opinions for the improvement of our projects. In addition to considering whether urate oxidase can be expressed and correctly modified in E. coli nissle, we should also consider whether UOX can pass through the intestinal wall cells from the intestinal tract into the blood, rather than being ""absorbed"" by the intestinal wall cells. In addition, due to the existence of certain immunological rejection of human uric acid oxidase, the immune response of UOX in the blood is also a problem that I must think about and solve.
    During the collaboration and exchange with Peking University's IGEM team, we saw each other's bright spots and re-examined our projects from a new perspective. In such exchanges and thoughts, we believe that we will find problems in our thinking, improve our projects, and make progress together to showcase the charm of Chinese students on the international stage of IGEM.
rNorheastern University
    In August 2018, we came to Shenyang, China, and exchanged ideas with two iGEM teams at Northeastern University, and further explored the next step of cooperation.

KP 3/29/13
Today when we showed up at the lab, our beautifully plated e. coli infused with IG78 were not quite as beautiful as we had anticipated. Yes, something was growing, but unfortunately not what we had anticipated. So, with Jordan’s help, we re-did the transformation and hopefully we have what we need show up on Monday.   I did some research and found that T1-T7 bacteriophage are lytic bacteriophage. We unfortunately need lysogenic bacteriophage to incorporate into our e. coli, because we want to to stay dormant in the host genome until cholera is sensed. The sensing of cholera will set off the chain of events leading to the expression and creation of the bacteriophage, so it has to be lysogenic bacteriophage that we use. I will do more research to see if there are any examples of one of the T# phages being used as lysogenic phages, because that will help us to connect with the phage group and contribute to an overall better presentation and iGEM project.  We have our presentation on Monday and I will be giving a background of lytic and lysogenic phases of bacteriophage and why that is important to our project.

KK April 1st 2013
Our transformations worked this time and we had several beautiful lawns of E.Coli. The E. Coli did NOT fluoresce either red or green to the naked eye. We haven’t yet looked at them under UV light. Clarisse streaked several singles, and also set up two overnight colonies. Kelton and I practiced streaking to singles for the first time, using old plates. We placed our E.Coli singles in the 37 degree room to grow, along with the overnights on the shaker.  Most of today we spent presenting our progress thus far. It appears that bacteriophage K139 will not be very useful to us, as we will need to use E.Coli bacteriophage lambda for our system. Dr. Grose has ordered Lambda and it is on it’s way. Our goal is to incorporate the Lambda genome as a lysogenic prophage into the genome of E.Coli, and have that prophage remain dormant until the presence of cholera’s autoreceptor triggers the phage to be excised from E.Coli’s genome and become lytic. The lysogeny/lysis balance is determined by the relative concentrations of two proteins, CRO and CI"
Madrid-OLM,2018,Team:Madrid-OLM#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He work in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modeling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signaling circuits"".
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the center of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works and it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places of the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up"

Trevor
Trevor is beginning his MPhil program in Bioengineering in HKUST during the summer. After spending three years, he finally discovered what he longed for was not just the wonders of life per se but the power to accurately control it. Thus he shall begin the study through understanding promoters.
Funny random things:
After years of trial and error and literature search and experiment, he still can't figure out why agarose gels are so inconsistent in giving presentable figures.
Steven
Steven is a year 2 MBMS student who plan to apply for graduate school after UST.
Funny random things:

For a fully functional chemoattractant tracking system, the receptor itself is just one brick of the puzzle. The promoter constructs for the related gene were also aim of improvement. To identify the perfect promoter for the Tar membrane protein, a quantitative real-time PCR was performed. Quantitative real-time PCR measures the amount of expressed mRNA while relative fluorescence measurements quantify on protein level. In perspective of stability and half-life periods of mRNA and proteins or due to protein modification, it is comprehensive to obtain varying data sets and expression rates. Another problem that occurred during our quantitative real-time measurements was the deviation in some of the biological replicates. This problem was also observed in another iGEM group’s experiments (Kelly et al., 2009). They mentioned variations throughout various experimental conditions in the absolute activity of the BioBrick promoters. To reduce variation in promoter activity, they measured the activity of promoters relative to BBa_J23101. Furthermore, the iGEM team of Groningen, which participated in 2009, also measured the relative fluorescence of TG1 strain with the promoters J23100, J23109, and J23106 via Relative Promoter Units (RPUs). Their values indicated the comparable tendency to our documented values (see their wiki ).
As our project proceeded, we wondered about the small phenotypic effects and low protein expression levels, even with the strongest constitutive promoters in charge. Finally, sequencing approaches revealed that a ribosomal binding site (RBS) is missing in our constructs. Including this in our analysis, the low impact of even the strongest promoter was plausible. However, we did see effects, which led us to the assumption that the existence of a RBS is no essential prerequisite for basal protein expression. A paper by Brock et al. from 2008 supports this outcome as well. Furthermore, we even found a correlation between the amount of mRNA in the cell and production of the encoded protein. Taking into consideration that the physiologically necessary number of receptor copies ranges in the small magnitude of three to four figures the findings mentioned above become more plausible.
Besides the recognition of chemoattractants, a directed movement towards these is an equally important quality of E. coli. Our attempts to improve its motility were largely successful. Overexpression of the genes fliC and yhjH led to an enhanced swimming ability. However, it was hard to control all parameters of the swimming agar assay, which might be caused by its special requirements. Therefore, it was difficult to compare and associate the produced results.

Почему так происходит? С того момента, как в 1928 году Александр Флеминг открыл пенициллин, позволивший значительно сократить число вызванных инфекционными заболеваниями смертей в 20 веке, ученые разработали огромное количество антибиотиков, позволяющих эффективно бороться с бактериальными инфекциями.

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!

During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," only minute off-target effects in the order of one in a million are observed. In addition, we gain a deeper insight into the effect of having multiple on-targets in the genome: this increases the sensitivity of the detection method, but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Conclusions
We employed a recently proposed kinetic model to assess the reliability of our crRNAs in the Cas13a-mediated detection system. In general, we find the predicted false positive probability (given a positive output) to be low (as low as 1 in billion). Moreover, the simulation unveiled a design flaw in crRNA 5 that prevented us from wasting time on testing it in the lab. Subsequently, we simulated the off-target activity of all our crRNAs on the genomes of relevant organisms: Escherichia coli BL21, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis and chromosome 27 of the domestic cow (Bos taurus). As expected, the false positive probability increases for the presence of larger genome sequences being present. We repeated the simulations for parameter that correspond to a higher mismatch tolerance and observed that this resulted in false positive probabilities exceeding 90%. This situation would greatly compromise the reliability of the detection system, so we set out to investigate possible solutions. In order to do so, we re-evaluate the model’s assumptions and find that if we incorporate our sample preparation protocol, amplifying and in vitro transcribing the gene, the probability of false positives is reduced accordingly. In addition, we propose a method that allows calculation of the required amplification factor α for achieving a desired reliability in the output.

Although it seemed to be an assembly like any other, it had its complications. Several colonies were screened for the right insert. Two types appeared to be present. The first one, with colonies that were fluorescing as expected and the second with colonies that did not give fluorescence (after aTc induction). However, the insert size of the first type was around 1200bp (see lane 2 in the adjacent image), significantly smaller than the expected 3028bp.
The non-fluorescent colonies did have bands corresponding to 2072 and 3028bp, but also one corresponding to the (linear) 5100bp fragment (compare lane 3 and 4). It was assumed that the colony had a mixture of plasmids, some that could get restricted by both enzymes and some that could not. Sequencing for this part failed, possibly because of the prescence of multiple kinds of plasmid.
Gel electrophoresis of  in pSB1C3 backbone, isolated from 1 colony under various conditions. The isolated plasmids were restricted with I-SceI and PstI, with expected bands of 1891 and 3109bp. Lane 1 and 2: not induced. Lane 3,4: induced with aTc. Lane 5,6: induced with IPTG. Lane 7,8: induced with aTc and IPTG.
Ideally a plasmid would have been isolated that gave only two bands when restricted with the enzymes mentioned above. But due to time constraints this was not possible. The selected colony was incubated in liquid culture under various conditions of induction (aTc and IPTG) to see if (some of) the plasmids would get degraded by the expressed homing endonuclease.
The outcome of the experiment was disappointing. Although at least some plasmids were present that had the expected size, none of the cultures induced with aTc showed any fluorescence. Also, the restriction pattern for the cultures that were induced with IPTG (for the expression of the homing endonuclease, lanes 5-8) was identical to the non-IPTG induced cultures. This shows that these plasmids were probably not restricted by I-SceI, because the restriction site was still present. Usually linear DNA will be degraded inside a cell, so if the restriction site had been cut, one would have expected the plasm"

What is the Blood Clotter?
When our team started meeting, we had many great project ideas, such as taking on autoimmune disorders or treating fetal alcohol syndrome. We also considered bacterial fuel cells, terraforming bacteria, biofilm inhibitors, and synthetic ivory production. After a gladiator-style fight to the death, we narrowed it down to clotting blood. We asked ourselves who we wanted to help, what kind of wounds we wanted to treat, and how we could interact with our community. We decided that we want to focus on the medical field, more specifically medical treatment in emergency situations. We recognized that in most emergency situations, excessive blood loss is a threat that could result in hypovolemic shock, anemia or even death. Preventing or reducing blood loss would greatly increase the chances of survival as well as speeding up the healing process. After discussing different wound sizes and how our project could be applied to each, we decided we would focus mainly on treating medium to large sized wounds. Then, we started designing a construct based around snake venom. Some snake venoms are very effective at inducing blood clotting by skipping many steps of the clotting pathway and thereby greatly increasing the rate of blood clotting. The Cerastes cerastes snake venom acts similar to thrombin in the blood clotting cascade, causing inactive fibrinogen to be converted into active fibrin monomers. Along with Factor XVIII, the fibrin monomers form a crosslink structure that traps red blood cells, resulting in a blood clot.
For human practices we have been contacting professionals in relevant fields to ensure that our project is applicable in real-world emergency situations. Another component of our human practices is the community outreach we have been conducting. For example, we have gone to schools in Southern Alberta to educate students with respect to our project and iGEM."
Berkeley,2013,Team:Berkeley#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," tinctorium, an indigo producing plant. In the healthy, green part of the leaf, this plant naturally sequesters a toxic compound produced in plants called indole into a glucosylated form called indican. Indican is soluble and harmlessly stored in the vacuoles of plant cells. However, the plant's behavior changes when it is under stress. The leaf that is turning blue has been sprayed with ethanol, and parts of the plant may have begun to degrade. Though the plant is still producing indican in the vacuoles, a glucosidase enzyme previously isolated away from the indican gains access due to the failure of compartmentalization in the cell, and cleaves the glucose ring off of indican. This produces an unstable intermediate called indoxyl which quickly oxidizes and dimerizes to indigo, turning the leaf blue.
Our Green Pathway to Dye Jeans
Drawing on our knowledge of the indigo chemistry in plants, we believed we could take advantage of the indican production pathway for jeans dyeing. Because indican is soluble, it adheres to jeans and can be mass produced as a dyeing agent. After jeans are coated in the soluble indican, they can then be exposed to a glucosidase similar to the mechanism in stressed plants, producing indigo dyed jeans. This process would circumvent many of the hazardous chemicals used industrially to produce blue jeans.
We aim to establish a pathway in E. coli to use soluble indican to dye jeans. Our pathway begins with indole, a toxic intermediate generated in E. coli as well as plants, and uses a heterologously expressed FMO enzyme to produce indoxyl which would then be taken to indican using a GT or glucosyltransferase enzyme. After using indican to coat cloth as desired, a B-glucosidase enzyme, or GLU, would cleave the sugar from indican and generating indoxyl which oxidizes to blue indigo.

Risks of Your Project in the Future
What would happen if all your dreams came true, and your project grew from a small lab study into a commercial/industrial/medical product that was used by many people? We invite you to speculate broadly and discuss possibilities, rather than providing definite answers. Even if the product is ""safe"", please discuss possible risks and how they could be addressed, rather than simply saying that there are no risks at all.
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or themethods you develop became widely available?
Our project when properly functioning, should not have any harmful effect on the environment, researcher, or the public. We keep everything contained within lab and all the plates and wastes are autoclaved to prevent all bacteria we use from spreading to the outside environment. Our BioBricks parts this year do not raises any serious safety issues. If our project moved from a small-scale lab study become widely used as a commercial/ industrial product, the risk are kept at a very low level because our Engineered Modified Bacteria only could survive when the environmental conditions are appropriate.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
Synthetic biologist, and iGEM teams in particular, design genetically engineered Organisms (GEOs) to benefit people and communities. Our team goal was to break down PET at the source of the problem itself. Our BioBricks parts this year do not raises any serious safety issues. However we are using LC-Cutinize gene(BBa_K936000), encodes an enzyme that breaks down PET into ethylene glycol, a moderately toxic substance. We are also designing converting module which contain Glycol aldehyde Reductase and Glycol aldehyde Dehydrogenase that could convert ethylene glycol become glycol ate so E.coli that we are using as chassis could use it as a substrate for TCA cycle. The engineered bacteria are not designed to be exposed to the general public. We intend to utilize bioreactors to concentrate"

Mass-E-mail
Through biologists social network Biosns. With the speed of sending an email every 30 second in 24 hours one day, we planted to present our work to 500,000 users of other biological internet platforms . When you read this, our mass E-mail system is still sending E-mail non-stop to those users ,  most of  whom are biology professionals. We hope to involve as many people as possible to make them aware of innovative applications of  Synthetic Biology on drug resistance. Meanwhile, we invited them pay attention on the 2014 iGEM Synthetic Biology Competition and the 10th iGEM anniversary celebration. After the mails were successfully sent, we will extract a few recipients to do telephone return visiting, in order to have the statistics of the life science community who learned the synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance trough our mails. Based on the feedback, we concluded and analyzed the effect, and also consulted whether they have some suggesting about antimicrobial resistance or not.
The following is the detail about sending such great amount of e-mail.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots"
Linkoping_Sweden,2018,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ES-Substrate releasing rate factor for the three different protein profiles.
Since we did not have any data on the rate at which GroES could bind and release the substrate, a wide range of the release rate was tested. As the hypothetical holdase effect is described by the release rate of the substrate, we only concerned ourselves with decreasing the releasing rate factor. This is indicated by the arrow from GroES to the unfolded state, which is shown in the simplified picture of our model above.
In figure 2, above, we can see how the three different theoretical proteins natively folded state concentration changes over an increasing holdase effect. The differences in concentration that could be correctly folded between the proteins were satisfying enough to proceed.
Figure 3.
Describes the relationship between the yield of native substrate an the GroES-Substrate releasing rate factor for the three different protein profiles.
By optimising the addition of GroES concentration that would give the largest yield for a given releasing rate factor, see figure 3, we can see that the misfolding prone protein would need additional GroES at a lower releasing rate factor than for the other two proteins. Compared to the aggregation prone proteins, the non-aggregation prone protein shows no positive response together with additional GroES. The yields plotted in figure 3 suggests that for low holdase effects, an addition of GroES would not result in any improvement. However, as the holdase effect increases, an improvement of the yields begin for the aggregation prone proteins. The improvement continues until it reaches a maximum, then starts to decline.
How valid are these results?
The first question one might ask oneself is if the concentration added to the system is within reasonable ratios relative to the initial concentrations. A study has shown that during stress in E.coli induced by heat shock, GroES concentrations can rise from 1.9µM to 4.7µM[3]. FoldEco uses an initial concentration of GroES that is 35µM. However, this is of the monomeric component of GroES and in E.coli, GroES consists of 7 subunits.  An increase of mostly between 30µM and 120µM relative to 35µM could be interpreted as a reasonable amount. In addition, the yield is not too dramatic either, but a 30% increase of a protein that is hard to fold and prone to aggregation is something that could be beneficial for a range of reasons.
What does this tell us?
The holdase effect of GroES is unknown, but a potential holdase effect has been implemented in the model. When"
Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Sustainability#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html," site comes from the phage P1. When an enzyme called the CRE recombinase is expressed, all the DNA between two Lox sites is deleted. Each lox site is made of one overlap region (in bold) surrounded by two complementary flanking regions. The middle of the sequence can be modified, but two LoxP sites will recombine together only if the sequence is exactly identical for both (Richier 2015). The flanking regions cannot be mutated and determine the specificity for one recombination enzyme.
Here are the four orthogonal Lox sites we used:
LoxP: ATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTAT
Lox2272: ATAACTTCGTATAAAGTATCCTATACGAAGTTAT
LoxN: ATAACTTCGTATAAGGTATACTATACGAAGTTAT
Lox5171: ATAACTTCGTATAATGTGTACTATACGAAGTTAT
The ID gene: This gene is entirely optional but can be used as a barcode to identify the strain. This allows for quality control of what is inoculated when a new production culture is started.
The landing pad: This part allows for easy integration of new gene cassettes into the system.
CRE-recombinase: The CRE recombinase should be integrated in the chromosome as well, so we do not have to use an antibiotic for maintaining the plasmid. It has to be under the control of an inducible promoter. The expression of CRE will trigger the differentiation.
The Landing Pad
Starting from this chassis, up to four metabolic pathways can be added by using the attB sequence as a landing pad. Like the Lox sites, this sequence comes from a bacteriophage: the PhiC31 phage uses it to integrate itself in the genome of the host. To insert a new sequence in this landing pad, all you need to do is build a plasmid with the matching ""attP"" site and express the PhiC31 integrase.

attP: AGTGCCCCAACTGGGGTAACCTTTGAGTTCTCTCAGTTGGGGGCGT
When inserting something in the landing pad, a new landing pad should be added for subsequent integration. This landing pad should be orthogonal to the first one to avoid multiple successive integrations. The same integrase can be used, the central TT just has to be"

Features
Our app works on both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa . We recommend trying it out - the usage instructions below detail how to set it up if you're unfamiliar with the platforms or just want more help. Our app can currently lookup parts and iGEM teams or lead you step-by-step through protocols.
One of the most important features is that it makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek .
Hands free
Being hands free eliminates the need to touch surfaces such as phone screens or keyboards. This reduces the contamination risk, especially while handling biologically hazardous materials. This in turn improves biosafety, but also means you’re less likely to  contaminate your own experiment.
Not requiring books or laptops frees up space on the lab bench. This means you are less likely to knock over tubes when leaning over to look something up (trust us, we’ve done it)!
Integration with existing services
It sources parts data from iGEM’s Registry of Standard Biological Parts API, uses Protocat (Michigan Software 2014-2017 iGEM) for protocols and iGEM’s teams API.
It’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d"

Interlab
The Interlab Measurement Study was conducted by Walter Thavarajah, Vivienne Gunadhi, and Jenny Lee on 7/18/15 - 8/23/15, with support and troubleshooting advice from Phillip Kyriakakis.
Devices Used
GFP generator I13504 was expressed under promoters J23101, J23106, and J23117 to form devices 1, 2, and 3, respectively. GFP device I20270 was used as a positive control and promoter R0040 was used as a negative control. DH5-alpha E. coli was used as a chassis organism. All DNA samples were obtained from the Spring 2015 DNA Distribution Kit. All final constructs were contained in backbone pSB1C3.
Assembly
After amplification, the promoter-containing plasmids were digested with SpeI and PstI, while the GFP-containing plasmid was digested with XbaI and PstI. The GFP generator was gel purified and ligated into each of the promoter-containing plasmids with NEB Quick T4 DNA ligase. The completed devices were verified by sequencing.
Growth Conditions
For each sample, 5mL of bacterial culture in selective LB media was cultured in plastic, 14mL test tubes overnight. Antibiotic was added from a 1000x stock kept at -4°C. The tubes were kept at 37°C and shaken at 300 RPM. The shaker used was a New Brunswick Scientific Excella E24, with a shaking diameter of 19mm. Cultures were prepared in triplicate.
Sampling
After measurement of sample OD600, the cells were resuspended in water to a final volume of 500µL and a final OD600 of 0.5 for plate reader measurement. Fluorescence measurements were also taken in the cells’ growth phase. To do this, sample OD600 was measured, then cells were resuspended in LB media for a final volume of 3mL and final OD600 of 0.1. These cells were allowed to grow for five hours before resuspension in water to a final volume of 500µL and a final OD600 of 0.5 for plate reader measurement.

Project Design
Inspired by the natural Bordetella phage's diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) system, we sought to develop an in vitro analog that could produce even greater numbers of possible major tropism determinant (Mtd) protein variants. This would test the structural limits of the Mtd and its target-binding ability, provide a broader perspective on the bacteriophage’s host-range specificity, and potentially introduce a new method of generating antibody-like proteins that can bind onto selected targets.
Generating Diversity
To this end, we first isolated the Major tropism determinant (mtd) gene from the Bordetella phage genome, which was generously donated to us by Jeff Miller’s lab at UCLA. Initial attempts at moving the components of the DGR into E. coli have not successfully yielded a functional product. However, the Mtd protein is still a choice candidate for our project given its ability to resist structural deformation following mutagenesis of the variable binding domain. Without the native reverse transcriptase-mediated homologous recombination system to generate diversity, we designed a series of overlapping oligonucleotides with mutagenic islands that bind to the mtd gene’s variable repeat and introduce random nucleotides during PCR. The farthest oligonucleotide at the 3’ end of the gene also contains a Serine-Glycine linker and a FLAG-tag that would facilitate purification from undesirable byproducts during mRNA display.
Oligonucleotide design for generation of Mtd mutagenic islands
This in vitro system has several advantages over the natural DGR, and boasts even greater possible protein diversity. Naturally, only adenine bases within the mtd gene’s variable repeat region are modifiable. While this still provides a significantly large number of possible variants, the primers used in our experiments do not have to follow the same adenine site-specific mutation restrictions, and permit entire sections to be modified. Primer-mediated mutagenesis thus provides even greater sequence variation than the normal DGR system. An enormous library of unique variants can increase the chances of identifying a protein-binding species in a screen. Having a large copy"

Lab Work:
Due to the hard work required to take care of several mutants libraries and to go through our diverse selection methods, most of the team took part in the lab work. But beyond the daily work we can highlight the work of Adrien Gauchet who designed a protocol to extract maltodextrins from glycose syrup; Antoine Godeaux, Joaquin Guzman and Meredith Wouters who, relying on their lab’s experience, trained the rest of the team; François Tyckaert and Maxime Velings who realized most of the sequencings.
Maltodextrin production:
Purified maltodextrins, is a substrate needed in large quantities during our selection process. It is a key component for our project, difficult to obtain and which prices can rise to 1500 €/gr. Thanks to Cargill who delivered free corn glucose syrup, we were able to extract from it the wanted malt"

Robots!
Yesterday, time was spent on building a robot (Biobert) that will act as a guide to our lab and also the rest of the island. It had to be built from scratch because the first one wasn't very good and creeped people out because it transformed from a pipette and had an empty souless expression. Once it was built, Mandy added the script so it could talk to people (including several secret phrases!). I designed it to move its arms and mouth when touched and optimized to use the least prims possible in order to make sure we have enough left for other things on the island. Today, a second robot was also made in the same fashion (Synthia) because Biobert was lonely and he needed a friend. We also had an important meeting deciding on the structure of the Second Life areas.

Plasmid isolation
…was also done exactly as I described in my July 8 update. One of my tubes struggled through the lyse stage but the rest seemed to work better. The plasmid yield was not as lucrative as last time – around 70 ng/uL (100 uL sample), but it’s an improvement on the 7 ng/uL present the first time I conducted this procedure with these cells.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," as copper into bacteria. We found the microorganism Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium used in the industrial process of bioleaching of copper ores which lives under extreme environmental conditions (Romo, E. et al., 2013). We wanted to transfer and optimize its copper uptake system into the model organism Escherichia coli (E. coli). Together with the other components of our project, our E. coli should be capable of digesting electronic waste and form nanoparticles that could be used for various new applications. But a closer look also revealed the potential for abuse of our project: In the wrong hands our bacteria could theoretically be used intentionally for digesting working electronics although at extremely low rates with very limited capabilities. However, this could be misperceived by the public.
This technomoral scenario derived from our own project idea shows that research results could be used for benevolent and malicious applications alike. We addressed this problem by working with metal ions dissolved in mining drainage instead of recycling electronics. Nevertheless, we got curious and wanted to know how scientists in general deal with similar problems when they appear. During our research on how to deal with such ethical dilemmas we came across the terms Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). We were quite startled that no one of our team learned about this in their academic education although our team is formed by members of different fields of life sciences. Unfortunately, addressing this issue has shown itself to be far from trivial as we did not even know who to address at our own university as we just got in touch with DURC issues through iGEM. Consequently, we investigated whether other students and scientists deal with similar problems. Therefore, we put a lot of time and effort into education and outreach on ”biosecurity”, “Dual Use”, and “Dual Use Research of Concern” at our university and on an international level.
But first: Let’s get the Definitions straight!
Biosecurity vs. Biosafety
The definition of biosecurity published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 is:
“The protection, control and accountability for valuable biological materials within laboratories, in order to prevent their unauthorized access, loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release.” (World Health Organization, 2006)
Due to digitization and big data, we think this definition might be outdated. The term is restricted to laboratories and materials. The definition called “laboratory biosecurity” is incomplete because it does not include the protection of biosecurity relevant information such as important data or protocols.

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack_-_-_TEXT.html," colonies grew on the co-transformed plate. These four colonies were each restreaked on two plates on Saturday. One plate was used as a control and the other one was UV shocked.   Today, we took some of each colony and mixed it with 1mL of PBS. This was vortexed and then centrifuged for 1 minute at top speed (15000). The liquid was removed and 500uL of PBS was added. This was then vortexed. 200uL of each of the 8 samples (four controls and four UV), as well as a blank of plain PBS, were put on the plate reader. The plate reader was used to find the cell concentration as well as the fluorescence. Using these two values, the normalized fluorescence was calculated and plotted in Excel. (See ""GFP Fluorescence Reading on the co-transformed plates"" for all of this data.) Using the concentrations, each of the samples were diluted to the lowest concentrations, and the concentration and fluorescence values were measured again on the plate reader. Colonies 1, 2, and 3 showed significantly higher fluorescence values that the controls. Colony 4 did not.  We inoculated the UV+pACYC184 and the three colonies that showed higher fluorescence values so that we can make glycerol stocks tomorrow. We used 5mL of LB along with the appropriate antibiotics (Amp and chlor for the 3 combo colonies and chlor for the UV+pACYC184.)  We ligated some more HSP and pACYC184. Used 50ng (3uL of X1:16.5ng/uL) of pACYC184 and 36ng (0.4uL of HSP:99.5ng/uL) of HSP. 2uL ligase buffer, 1uL ligase, and 13.6uL water to get 20uL total volume. Started ligation at 3:30PM.  We restreaked the three successful colonies of UV+pACYC184/GFP+pBR322 on five different plates. One is a control which was wrapped in tinfoil so no UV light would reach it. The other four were UV shocked for 1 second, 5 seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds. Tomorrow we'll test their fluorescence.

While our new project still fit into the scope of the Nitrogen Project and we continued to understand the impact of nitrate runoff in the agricultural regions around St. Louis, we also began to consider other applications of our research. We contacted companies that use synthetic biology for more industrial purposes, and asked them to comment on how our “supercharged” cells could be practically utilized.
Nitrate Runoff and the Midwest
To begin our education on nitrate runoff, we began with faculty within Washington University. At first, we requested time with Ray Ehrhardt, a professional engineer with a position in the department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering. Ray’s experience lay in devising water filtration and management systems. Nitrate runoff, he said, is excruciatingly difficult to filter out on a large scale. Nitrate runoff has well documented side effects including algal blooms and “blue baby syndrome” in children, but can only be removed via energy intensive processes like distillation or reverse osmosis filtration. Water contamination from agriculture, he said, is best dealt with upstream of filtration. Otherwise, the aqueous pollution becomes very costly to remove. Mr. Erhardt had several contacts in the St. Louis area, and suggested we reach out to other regional authorities.
We contacted the St. Louis County Soil and Water Conservation District Board, the governing body encouraging sustainable farming practices in our area. They invited us to one of their monthly board meetings, where they commented on the usefulness of our project. The crux of excess nitrate runoff isn’t agriculture, they said. Instead pet waste and other urban runoff can contribute a surprising amount of pollutants that aren’t as heavily publicized. As for the runoff that does occur from plants, the popularized notion of “industrial farms” spraying millions of gallons of fertilizer isn’t necessarily true. Most farms in the midwest are privately owned and operated they said, and it is entirely possible to get these farmers to adopt practices that they believe can mitigate runoff. While a GMO may be useful, they thought it wasn’t the only option, and certainly not the most effective.
Next, we reached out to the Missouri Coalition for the Environment. They are a small nonprofit organization that educates farmers on sustainable practices and lobbies for legislation to minimize ecological pollution. Opposed to GMOs, they advocated for other sustainable methods of providing fertilizers to crops – most poignantly, the unused resource of livestock manure that is plentiful in the midwest. They noted that there is little movement in the local and federal legislature to slow the growth of the"

The Fusion Parts standard proposed by Freiburg serves to allow fusion proteins but remove some of the disadvantages of the Biofusion standard. It does this by adding two new restriction enzymes: NgoMI and AgeI. This standard allows a less disruptive scar of threonine and glycine, while maintaining in frame fusions. However, this does require the purchase of two new restriction enzymes.

The BglBricks standard allows in frame production of fusion proteins with a benign scar of of glycine and serine. The prefix and suffix are also quite simple, containing only the 2 restriction sites connected by 3 bases. However, this method uses 3 new enzymes: BglII, BamHI and XhoI, of which BglII and BamHI cannot be heat-inactivated.

The BB-2 standard proposed by Tom Knight was the method we ended up following to produce our chimeric flagella. This standard requires the addition of only one new restriction enzyme (NheI), and produces in frame fusions with a benign scar of alanine and serine. Also, the NheI cut site is fairly rare in E. coli, decreasing the likelihood of having cut sites within proteins, and this enzyme can be heat-inactivated."

Laws and Regulations
Advanced Policies in POCT field
The medical reform policies, together with the reasonable superintendence will promote the rapid progress of POCT（point-of-care testing） in America. [1]
America now is encountered with the payment pressures imposed by enormous medical insurance fees resulted from the aged tendency of population and the changes in the spectrum of diseases. According to the forecast by CBO, the expense of health products will reach up to 4,600 billion in 2020, accounting for 20% of the GDP. Besides, it was shown in the OECD report that in 2011, American people's average expenditure on health care was up to 8233 dollars, twice the expenditure of comparatively developed European countries like French, Switzerland and England. In March, 2010, American president Barack Obama carried out the “Affordable Care Act”, aiming at improving the quality of American health insurance service, and decreasing the cost of health care service. The “ACA Act” established the balance sharing plan, which encouraged doctors and hospitals to meet the patients' medical needs by an integral medical service system through encouraging accountable care organizations. Under that balance sharing plan, suppliers and organizers of the service who meet the standard set by US HHS can serve those who benefits from the medical insurance plan through co-organizing and coordinating. ACO could help reduce the cost and increase the efficiency, and distribute part of the surplus among members. Under the design of the ACO system, the new service supplying mode integrate hospitals, general practitioners, medical specialists and other specialists to answer for the medical quality and medical cost together. [2]
In America, POCT is supervised by FDA, and is co-organized by certification authority, POCT committee, and POCT coordinators. It exists as one of the branches of IVD. Therefore, it is also supervised under the policies of medical apparatus and instruments. At the same time, IVD products are also supervised under CLIA 88 enacted in 1992, which divided IVD into three registering levels (low, medium and high) basing on the complexity of experiments. Before obtaining the right of market entrance, producers have to make appliances according to CLIA categorizing system. After that, CMS, DCLD and CDC will"

We discovered their use of a model of sympathetic ganglion 'B' type cells of a bullfrog as described in Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Synapses to Networks [1] . The large amount of Spanish comments in their MATLAB model made it even more difficult for us to understand the link between yeast cells and these neural cells, so therefore we decided to remake this model. We were able to do so, performed a complete parameter sensitivity analysis, tried to adapt this model to the characteristics of yeast cells and finally had to decide that this model simply does not fit the calcium homeostasis in yeast cells... :'-( Let's create a new model...
Exploring the lab
Unfortunately most of our lab team members never worked in a biochemical lab before. We were used to the basics of wetwork, but performing a PCR was completely new to us. We just started to work with the yeast cells provided and made a lot of mistakes, but during the weeks we created more and more feeling with the wetwork and the possibilities of our field of interest, the yeast cells! We made a first design of the device in collaboration with the Equipment and Prototype Centre at the Technical University of Eindhoven.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," instead of purple. However, the B. subtilis cells were rod-shaped so we assumed that the reagents we used for Gram staining were contaminated or out-of-date. We are planning on obtaining new reagents to try the Gram stain again.
We attempted transformation by incorporating the suggestions made by Dr. Schryvers. Instead of diluting the overnight culture directly with xylose, we diluted it with LB media that was also shaken overnight. This was followed by adding xylose to make a final xylose concentration of 1%. Unfortunately, we did not get transformation despite repeated trials. We returned to our old method of diluting the overnight culture with a stock solution of 2% xylose. However, this method no longer worked. We are guessing that our cells might have been contaminated so we will try to get new cells.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
This week we received the primers designed for the thrC sites. We tried using miniprepped thrC vector to obtain our desired PCR products which we could then use to transform ''B. subtilis''. Our first few tries were unsuccessful. Our team advisor suggested diluting the miniprepped sample since too much template can interfere with PCR. We tried a 1 in 100 dilution and it worked!
Week 18: August 25 - August 29
Dr. Wong was kind enough to provide us with a fresh batch of supercompetent B. subtilis cells. Initially, we were still having trouble transforming the cells since the starting absorbance was not high enough, but we figured out that this was due to the LB being contaminated. For the first set of transformations, although colonies that grew on the plain agar plates were clear while colonies that grew on spectinomycin plates were red suggesting successful transformation, this was not the case; the untransformed colonies grew on the spectinomycin plates, which should not have occurred. Also, these cells were red so they were somehow exposed to the thrC DNA.
The second set of transformations were also unsuccessful because not only were the colonies that grew on the plain agar plates red, but so were the untransformed colonies that grew on the plain plates. We are guessing that our pipettes might be contaminated with spores, which are highly resistant to heat and ethanol among other things (Eichenberger, 2012) .
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
This week we transformed B. subtilis using PCR product. Unfortunately, each trial gave us different results. For the first trial we used frozen B. subtilis"

Human Practice (Silver)
Tsinghua July 19th, 2016
On July 23th, we went to Tsinghua University with our questions and initial ideas to communicate with the members of Tsinghua team. They helped us solve the problems and taught us more about iGEM and genetic biology. Then we discussed the ideas and programs of the iGEM teams a few years ago. This communication helped us build up a clearer understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM.
BIT-China July 23th, 2016
On July 25th, we visited the iGEM team of BIT-China. They showed us their iGEM progams in the past two years, shared with us the difficulties and challenges they met and the ways for them to solve the problems. They also guided us on the designing and making of Wiki.
 
We did a survey (500 questionnaires including online and in community )on how many people have relatives or friends with CVD, and we found that 50.67% of these people are using medicines which contain tanshinone, so that greatly proves that this medicine has an important effect in curing CVD. People who are taking this kind of medicine also have positive testing results on many metrics. Finally, almost 30% of the petients want to use our medicine, if we finally produce it, so there'll be a bright future for Tanshinone, which we are currently studying at in our project.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Any product made for human consumption that has different nutritional characteristics than conventional ones due to its genetic modifications must be clearly labeled as GM.
India has supported the mandatory labeling of GM food by Codex.
Out of the two options under discussion by Codex i.e.
Option 1 requires labeling when the products obtained through biotechnology differ significantly from the corresponding food as regards the composition, nutritional value or intended use.
Option 2 requires the declaration of the method of production for food and ingredients composed of or containing genetically modified/engineered organisms and food or food ingredients produced from, but not containing, genetically modified/engineered organisms if they contain protein or DNA resulting from gene technology or differ significantly from the corresponding food.
The labeling of food derived from biotechnology is a major issue for India as its delegation at the CCFL has been seeking to achieve mandatory labeling as set out in Option 2. However, Option 2 has also raised a number of issues of concern including the enforcement, methodology, economic cost, consumer perception and difficulties likely to be faced.
The products must be clearly labeled they contain GMO if they do.
There are no requirements for labeling products that do not contain modified gene or products do not contain protein made by a modified gene. There are requirements for labeling products of which the modified gene constitutes more than 5% of its materials or if the genetically modified ingredient is within the top 3 ingredients.
Any product containing more than 1% of genetically modified material, such as DNA and proteins, must be labeled as GM food.
6. What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.
When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.
For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"

Negative controls are ABTS and hydrogen peroxide, and ABTS only. Standard error of the mean bars are based on a sample size where n=8.
In order to complete our kinetic analysis we had to determine the catalytic properties of our Prussian blue ferritin according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. For these tests we varied the colourimetric substrate concentrations (ABTS and TMB) (Figures 7 and 8). We also varied the hydrogen peroxide concentration in association with TMB as this the first chemical compound that will react in the system (Figure 8). This test was not repeated for ABTS as we had decided TMB was a more viable substrate at this point in the summer. Based off of the calculated catalytic constants (Table 1) it would appear that TMB is a more effective substrate for our system.

Velocities were generated from the average slope of eight data sets. Standard error of the mean bars are not displayed but are present in the foundational data (eg. Figure 6).

Synthetic Biology Presentation
After their experiment, we had the students watch a short, fun video on the basics of synthetic biology, which can be found below. Then, we further explained the field and its potential applications for the future. The students were greatly interested in the ethics of synthetic biology, especially issues of intellectual property and bio-security leading to discussions about issues of ownership of biological parts and processes as well as techniques for improving security of the parts.
Having explained the importance of synthetic biology and its potential problems, we next introduced the students to iGEM. We went through the aims of the foundation, the different levels of competition, and what our particular team is working on. We paid special attention to explaining BioBricks and the potential they serve in the biological community. See our presentation slides here: File:HSiGEMPresentation.pdf
Future Outreach
As previously mentioned, Janet Standeven is forming a high school iGEM team at Lambert High School. We expect to work closely with Mrs. Standeven in the future to establish her team and their project.
Potential activities include bringing them to the Georgia Institute of Technology to see the iGEM lab space and discuss both general and specific scientific practice for the students. It is expected that we will keep close contact with Janet and Lambert High School in the future to further the benefit to both of our groups of students.
Our workshop at Lambert High School was also featured in the Forsyth County News, a local newspaper. See the article here: http://www.forsythnews.com/m/section/3/article/14721/ .
Safety
Safety Rules and Regulations are an important component of working in a laboratory setting, especially in a synthetic biology lab. That is why, at Georgia Institute of Technology, safety procedures are in place to minimize the risk of mishaps in a laboratory and utmost care is taken such that any accidental or experimental mistakes do not harm the welfare of staff as well as the community.
General Lab Safety
The Georgia Tech iGEM 2012 team follows the guidelines as implemented by the university and all of its members have been trained in Lab Safety Protocols for this purpose. All the team members have attended a presentation on general safety in the lab, understanding material safety data sheets, the meaning of various warning labels, such as those on refrigerators, waste disposal, and autoclaving techniques conducted by the lab safety officer in School of Biology, Marc Pline. The GT iGEM team follows all the safety protocols and guidelines as described by the Georgia Tech Environmental Health & Safety here

ABSTRACT
Elevated Granzyme B (GzmB) levels are associated with many chronic inflammatory conditions including vascular, autoimmune and skin diseases. As a serine protease that induces apoptosis in tumor cells, GzmB is an essential part of the immune system. However, high levels of GzmB also result in the random cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which leads to damaged tissue structure and elasticity. Our project aim is to prevent tissue damage from chronic inflammation by limiting GzmB activity in the ECM without affecting its intracellular functions. We mutated an extracellular protein (ACT) to allow"

The Importance of Collaboration
The iGEM competition stresses the importance of collaborations between scientists and encourages teams to significantly collaborate with one or more iGEM teams. Collaboration is an important component of scientific research, as it teaches will-be scientists to exchange ideas and assist others in their innovations. Our team has collaborated with several iGEM teams as well as a team of undergraduate researchers outside of the iGEM Competition.
University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM Team
Our collaboration with the University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM team began with a Skype call. During the meeting, we discussed our project designs. Because of our extensive human practices efforts, we felt that we could best collaborate by providing information about extending their outreach. After attending the BMES Coulter Conference in August, our teammates visited the UM iGEM team lab in Minnesota. We advised their team to reach out to areas affected by their project (mercury ion pollution) and to speak with  environmental regulatory groups in Minnesota to gain insight about potential users. We also suggested they start a crowdfunding campaign so their entire team can attend the Jamboree in Boston, since they had not considered that to be an option.
iGEM Team in Montpellier, France
We heard about the Montpellier iGEM team through the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations Facebook page created by iGEM Thessaloniki. Their project, Vagineering, aims to create a non-hormonal contraceptive. Our projects both address inadequate access to contraception, so we were interested in collaborating with them. We Skyped with their team and discussed our designs, human practices, and progress in lab. We suggested that the Montpellier team consider dosage of their final product, since it would be inserted into the human body, ways to switch off production of the contraceptive, or a delivery method.

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a member of the Our Lady Of the Snows Catholic Academy iGem team. We are a small high school based based out of Canmore, Alberta, Canada. We are contacting you because we have chosen to tackle build ups of keratin in wastewater treatment, and well as the poultry industry as this year’s project, and your team’s 2013 project involved Keratinases too. When talking about wastewater treatment, these build ups of hair can lead to clogs causing flooding and the breakage of water pumps and pipes, something very costly to repair. The only current way to deal with this issue is to have a worker manually remove the blockage, which is slow, unpleasant for the worker and inefficient.   Upon further research our team discovered that the reason hair is such a huge issue for waste treatment facilities is because of the protein keratin, which as you probably know is a very hard protein to break down due the tightly wrapped helixes and hydrogen bonds. Once we discovered this pressing issue we looked into keratin more and realized it is also a component of the basic construct of feathers and they to build up and are hard to break down. With more searching on the iGEM parts registry we discovered your project, as well as one other project, both of whom attempted to solve the keratin issue. With this research and the exploration of previous iGEM projects, we decided to create a construct that would express a Keratinase enzyme to break down the keratin in the hair and feathers, thus solving the issue.   Because iGEm requires collaboration between teams, we decided to try contact you due to your decision to tackle this project in 2013. As we understand it, you reached the planning stages of the project and then dropped it? As much of our project is based on building on, and optimizing previous constructs, we are looking for some more in-depth information concerning the cleaving process, and some issues you would've tackled there, and how you would've dealt with them. We know that Keratinases are difficult to express in E. Coli, due to the double membrane, and because when expressed, the export tag does not always get cleaved properly, so if you could give us any insight upon this, that would be appreciated. We would also like to get some of your current opinions on the issues, if you have any advice for us that could make us more successful at the competition and if you had devised a way in which you would have deployed your construct outside of the lab, if you had completed the project. We also were wondering what your plans were for implementation of the bi"

Outreach
From interviews with cataract patients, ophthalmologists, veterinarians, polls from residents in Taipei and our school community, we learned that cataracts are prevalent and have a huge impact on everyday life. Now we wanted to raise awareness through education. We started by informing teachers and students of various grade levels about the severity and causes of cataracts, and how our project could tackle these problems.
Then, in our community, we handed out pamphlets, taught people how cataracts form, and simulated a cataract experience by wearing goggles of varying cloudiness.  Below is a list of activities and programs that we did in outreach.
Spring Fair
This is a photo of a lower school student at our booth, playing our interactive game and learning about what it is like to have cataracts.
During Spring Fair we conducted a survey to gather public opinion and designed an interactive game to raise awareness of cataracts. In the survey we asked questions regarding people’s opinions on genetically modified organisms, cataract surgery, and our project. For the game we taped parafilm onto lab goggles and asked people who came to our booth to play the “piano tiles” app with those goggles on, and thus experiencing a real life simulation of the effects of cataracts on vision.
Taipei Cataract Awareness Day
Our team went on an excursion to five different landmarks in Taipei and passed out flyers containing information on cataracts to the general public. We explained the formation of cataracts and the basic concepts of our project to local crowds and asked them to fill out our survey to get a wider sample size.

Kindergarten Science Experiments
We designed some easy experiments so that Kindergarten students could explore some common science concepts.  The kids (and our team members) loved it!  Some of the experiments included how to use the microscope, why light reflects through prisms, and how static electricity works.

7th Grade Introduction to Synthetic Biology
For 7th Graders we decided to introduce the concepts of synthetic biology, since they had just be introduced to DNA in their science classes.  Aside from teaching a general idea of what synthetic biology is, we also introduced them to some basic laboratory techniques essential to synthetic biology. We made up scenarios and asked them"

TetR plasmids
First plasmid - pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR
This assembly was quite tricky, as we had to test 3 plasmids before succeeding.
We first took the J23019 plasmid from the registry and designed plasmids, but we never succeeded in amplifying it during PCRs. We assumed that probably the plasmid is not exactly the one described in the registry and went on with plasmid number 2.
Our second choice was pSB3C5, as we could partially reuse the primers designed for J23019. But the PCR results were very weak and the assembly failed.
So finally we used pSB3K1, which is really similar to pSB3C5, designed new primers and succeeded in doing the Gibson assembly!
We amplified this backbone, and added TetR under control of a constitutive promoter.

Bioethics Interviews
To understand more about the global perspectives on a field fraught with ethical considerations as synthetic biology,             we spoke with Sherine Hamdy, scholar of Islamic Bioethics.
Can you tell us about the origins of islamic bioethics?
Islamic bioethics is not a formal field of study, but rather it exists as a branch of the bigger field of islamic                 jurisprudence. Modern technologies and advances in biology and healthcare have spurred conversation among                 doctors, patients scholars of islamic law. These conversations though are not legally binding and more closely                 resemble advice and guidelines. With that said, traditions vary from region to region with Islamic bioethicists                 bearing a more formal role in institutions of Saudi Arabia.
How might bioethics differ based on geographic region (within sect)? Is there a difference in interpretation                     in Saudi Arabia Vs. Egypt?
There is a wide range of interpretations in Islamic law especially in Sunni world, lending to the plurality of                 opinion. Monarchical government structures, such as that in Saudi Arabia, generally do not consider the population’s                 opinion, resulting in more streamlined policy decisions but less representation of the people. However, historically                 in Egypt policy served the convenient purpose of appeasing the people as a counterweight to authoritarianism.
Does a stricter doctrine necessarily mean a more restrictive biological praxis?
Absolutely not and it is useful to separate interpretation of scripture from permissions and prohibitions. In                 Iran the state appoints islamic scholars as part of legislation producing governments, so Iran is a true                 theocracy. The scholars there permit infertile heterosexual couples to use donor egg and sperm to alleviate                 infertility, but this opinion is not as widely accepted in Sunni states with equally rigorous, though different,                 interpretation of Islamic law.
Does Islam see a tension in humanity’s manipulation of another organism’s DNA, the code that defines the                     chemical essence of that organism, and its espoused mandate to save lives when possible?
The framing of the question here"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Recombinant_-_-_TEXT.html," a clear optimum around pH 8.0 to 8.5. A luminescense value of more than 50% can be expected for pH values between 6 and 9 which is sufficient for most assays.
For the dependency of the luminescence on the ionic strength 50 µl of diluted NanoLuc, 50 µl of NanoGlow substrate and 100 µl of sodium chloride dilution series were incubated and afterwards the luminescense was quantified in triplicates. The result is impressing and again speaks for the NanoLuc luciferase as an innovative reporter protein. The obtained luminescense is constant from 0 to 250 mM of NaCl and upon 1 M of NaCl at least 50% of the maximal luminescense can be expected.
Catechol Dioxigenase (XylE)
File:TUM13 Animation XylEx.gif
Figure 25: Animation of protein structure of XylE
The catechol dioxigenase (<partinfo>BBa_K648011</partinfo>) is a BioBrick which was characterized by the Imperial College 2010 iGEM team. As we also want to use this BioBrick we produced it as a recombinant protein. Given the fact that previous teams did a great job in characterizing this proteins kinetic parameters we decided to focus on other aspects. Catecholdioxygenases are a wide variety of enzymes degrading catechol and various of its derivatives. The xylE gene we use is from Pseudomonas putida and has a ferrous ion ligand in each subunit. The enzyme has the structure of a homotetramer
Analytical preparation
Figure 26: Streptavidin affinity chromatography for the catecholdioxygenase
To investigate if our recombinant BL21 E.coli cells were producing the catecholdioxygenase we started with an analytical preparation in 2 l LB-medium. After we confirmed the succesful transformation of our cells we produced another 2 x 2 l flasks full of recombinant cells in order to have enough enzyme to work with. To induce protein production we used 5 mM of arabinose when we measured an OD of 0.8. We disrupted the cells by sonification and after dialysis in 1 x SA-buffer we performed streptavidin affinity chromatography. After elution of the desired protein in 1 x SA-buffer with 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 10"

It’s great to see, that Würzburg will also go to Boston with their first project and some good results in the backpack.   As science competitions are also a great possibility for stabilizing networks she stayed in touch with Annabel Maisl who is this years team leader of iGEM Würzburg, participating in iGEM for the first time.
Meeting iGEM Oslo
Our meeting with the iGEM Team Oslo was a great opportunity for us to present our project and our ideas on an international level for the first time while getting important feedback. Of course we also took the chance to get to know the city and culture of Norway.  The first day in Oslo was mainly used to introduce ourselves and to get to know the team in Oslo. They offered us a rich program of cultural and scientific exchange. On the second day of our trip we as well as the team from Oslo gave first presentations of our projects. Afterwards we exchanged constructive criticism regarding the projects and its presentations. During the lunch break we also had the opportunity to talk to the PIs and instructors who also gave us valuable tips. This was followed by a workshop with the communications officer where many factors were discussed such as ways of implementing public relations in the field of natural sciences and how to transfer them specifically to our project. This lead to the development of plenty of good ideas that were partially put into practice through projects like the Ract! Festival or our public debate. It was a weekend full of inspiration that created great memories.
Collaboration with iGEM Paris
We are especially proud of our bioinformatics collaboration with iGEM Team Paris: we were able to use our prediction tool BERT (for more information on that please see our Collaborations page ) on their project about therapeutic proteins providing them with information about ways to deimmunize their proteins and gaining external validation for our tool. Furthermore, we exchanged knowledge about machine learning as well as molecular simulations. We together are very happy to say that BERTs results are excellent. The iGEM Team Paris additionally offered their help for another molecular dynamics simulation, which sadly will not be finished before wiki freeze.
In closing, this year we stand out as a team that is excellently connected with other iGEM Teams, companies and public figures and is as present on social media as never before. Documenting and sharing our development and progress on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter we were able to reach iGEM Teams all over the world informing about our project, i"

In this sense the resulting moth vector movement will depend ultimately on the pheromone concentration levels in the field and the moth ability to follow better or worse the gradient of sex pheromone concentration.
The three clases of male moth behavior we consider for the characterization of males moth behavior are described in  Table 1.
Table 1. Male moths behaviour characterization.
This ensemble of behaviors can be translated into a sum of vectors in which the random vector has constant module and changing direction within a range, whereas the module of the gradient vector is a function of the gradient in the field. The question now is how do we include the saturation effect in the resulting moth shift vector. With this in mind, and focusing on the implementation process, our approach consists on the following:
To model chemoattraction, the gradient vector will be always have fixed unit magnitude, and its direction is that of the greatest rate of increase of the pheromone concentration.
To model the random flight, instead of using a random direction vector with constant module, we consider a random turning angle starting from the gradient vector direction.
Thus, how do we include the saturation effect in the resulting moth shift vector? This is key to achieve sexual confusion. Our answer: the behaviour dependence on the moth saturation level --in turn related to the pheromone concentration in the field-- will be included in the random turning angle.
Table 1. Approximation of the male moths behaviour.
This random turning angle will not follow a uniform distribution, but a Poisson distribution in which the mean is zero (no angle detour from the gradient vector direction) and the standard-deviation will be inversely proportional to the intensity of the gradient of sex pheromone concentration in the field. This approach leads to ‘sexual confusion’ of the insect as the field homogeneity increases. This is because the direction of displacement of the moth will equal the gradient direction with certain probability which depends on how saturated it is.

Robin - Continued on website coding.
Weiling & Catrin - Researched for project sponsors and potential contacts.
Alex, Ruxi, StJohn & Andy - Continued research into the project ideas.
18th June
The group met with advisors Darren Nesbeth and Philipp Boeing to discuss the three project suggestions. The 'Neural Network' proposal was effectively ruled out due to the high risk and low probablility of project success in terms of medals.
The anti-cancer project was previously the favoured idea, but after extensive review ,the Alzheimers project gained favour due to being relatively new (and hence exciting) to iGEM compared to a cancer project, which has been done several times already at iGEM. No final decision has been made however, work has continued on researching both projects. The wiki is also still being worked on.
The team also had a social gathering: pizza for lunch.
19th June
The group continued work on all three projects in order to send improved proposals to Darren Nesbeth by the end of the day. Many professors and experts were also emailed to seek guidance, in particular for the Alzheimer's project which seems to be particularly difficult.
20th June
Tom - Prepared a presentation to be given next week about iGEM to prospective UCL students to raise interest in the engineering faculty and also the iGEM competition. After this was complete, joined the rest of the group in research. Also performed"
