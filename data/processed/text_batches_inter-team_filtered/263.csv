Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," simple but classical: Two primers anneal with template chains and synthesize mutagenesis chain with FastPfu Polymerase. The mutation base pair locate in the overlapping region of two primers. And then DMT enzyme will digest the unmutated template chain with methylation. The digested product will be transformed into DMT Competent Cell, with following steps of mutagenesis seletion, which is similar to traditional cloning and mutagenesis. Sequencing is necessary for final examine of the mutagenesis.
As one of the mutation sites L-P locates in the middle 1/3 part of TOR2, and the other three (I-T V-A E-K) locate in the C-terminal 1/3 part, we started with introduction of single mutagenesis in one plasmid, and combine these mutagenesis respectively to get two, three and all sites mutation, meanwhile compare the resistance and activity brought in by our modification. 3.2.2  Overlap PCR (postponed) Overlap PCR is one of the most classical methods for ligation of fragment and site mutagenesis. Considering the size of tor2, we had to divide the whole fragment into three – 11tor, 22tor and 33tor. The part of 01tor contains the promoter and RBS region in addition to 11tor. Restriction sites are reserved in the overlapping region for later ligation and assembly of an integrated gene.
Due to the different sequences, mutation strategy varied from site to site. For L-P and E-K, we designed primers with 40bp overlap including the mutation sites. But for I-T and E-K, we introduced restriction enzyme site and mutation site in the 5’ end of one primer and then connect this piece back to the whole gene. We have already got all single mutagenesis on each part so far. But the discriminating GC content strongly hindered effective primer design for PCR, and the time spent on connecting and assemble different parts is far out of our expectation. Presently we have postponed the overlapping way. While all BioBricks based on pEASY vector are reserved and we hope teams with developed overlapping technology could continue this unfinished work.
With the mutated gene fragment built in E. coli, the subsequent step is transformation into the yeast. However, pSB1A11 is derived from PUC19 that cannot be normally expressed in yeast. Thus we turned to pYD1 for help. In Tianjin University 2010, pYD1 is used for surface display. But this year we need the yeast"

If the OD600 is....
Then you may...
below 2,
either continue growing the cells until the OD600 reaches 2 or proceed to Step 3.
over 5,
proceed to Step 3.
Note: In general, OD600 readings less than 2 will decrease the number of cells displaying fusion proteins. OD600 readings greater than 5 will delay induction of expression of the displayed protein.
3. Centrifuge the cell culture at 3000-5000 x g for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
4. Resuspend the cell pellet in YNB-CAA medium containing 2% galactose to an OD600 of 0.5 to 1. This is to ensure that the cells continue to grow in log-phase. For example, if the OD600 is 2 from Step 2, resuspend the cells in 20 to 40 ml of medium.
5. Immediately remove a volume of cells equivalent to 2 OD600 units. For an OD600 of 0.5, remove 4 ml and place on ice. This is your zero time point.
6. Incubate the cell culture at 20-25°C with shaking.
Note: In general, more cells will display the protein fusion at 20°C. However, if you do not have an incubator that maintains 20°C, try 25°C.
7. Assay the cell culture over a 48-hour time period (i.e. 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 hours) to determine the optimal induction time for maximum display. For each time point, read the OD600 and remove a volume of cells that is equivalent to 2 OD600 units (see Step 5, above). Proceed to Staining of Displayed Proteins, below.

In August 1st, we went to Tianjin Province in China and attended the conference held together with other four teams (NKU_China, Tianjin, NPU_China and TUST_China). In the morning, we visited the laboratory of NKU_China and we presented our project in the afternoon. After presentation, we discussed the projects heatedly and many novel ideas were inspired from this conference. Mingzhe Han from team Tianjin pointed out some shortcomings of our TA system, which helped us a lot to improve our project. Besides, we helped TUST_China to solve some problems in bacteria culturing."

One sugar that, according to our findings, Citrobacter freundii cannot use is xylitol – see our ‘Xylitol dehydrogenase’ section for more details on this. We could therefore combine this gene with the levansucrase gene to obtain an antibiotic resistance-independent selection-counterselection cassette that dependent entirely on sugars.
Levans
We have found that under sublethal doses of sucrose, the E. coli cells start to secrete a lot of gloopy substance, which we believe to be levans (Figure 7), the fructose polymers formed because of the levansucrase activity.
Figure 7: Secretion of levans outside of the cell – it is only present on the lower two colonies but is absent in the two controls above.
We find this important to mention, as levans have got several applications in various fields (Kang et al., 2009) .

Epigenetic Flip Flop
Overview
Epigenetic Flip Flop. Overview
There are still some open questions and challenges in synthetic biology at the basic level, as how to handle with noise, efficient designing of novel proteins with desirable functions, or epigenetic control of gene expression, between  others. (Purnick & Weiss, 2009) In our project we try to reduce this uncertainty.
The goal of our subproject is developing an epigenetic toggle switch, that make use of both transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, to precisely control gene expression of a gene reporter. We hope to maintain the whole population of Schizosaccaromyces pombe in one of two states, denominated ON and OFF, depending on whether the reporter gene is being expressed or not. What we expect by employing this combination of promoter regulation at the transcriptional level and epigenetic control level of compaction of the promoter DNA region is to reduce the noise that normally remains in many promoters after transcriptional repression. Moreover, it is expected that cells become able to pass on this epigenetic information to their descendants, behaving as a robust, heritable and stable memory.

    If time and conditions permits, we plan to design synthetic RBS by 'Ribosome binding site calculator' and RBSDesigner and measure their effectiveness with eGFP and RdhANP. We also recommend other teams to do this job if they have similar intention with us.
5.Verification of RdhANP-overexpression B. megaterium’s Dehalogenation
    After succeeding in transformation and inducing the protein production, we are faced with one of the most important experiments in our project. Since our intention is to overexpress RdhANP, this novel reductive dehalogenase in B. megaterium, and although it has been reported in the paper Reductive dehalogenase structure suggests a mechanism for B12-dependent dehalogenation published in Nature in 2015, we still have to verify this enzyme’s dehalogenation in our constructed proof-to-concept experiment for the sake of assurance.
    In our proof-to-concept experiment, we designed three different groups as follows:
B. megaterium
Transformed with rdhANP
Untransformed with rdhANP
Induced by xylose
Group 1
Group 2
Uninduced by xylose
Group 3
/
    By comparing the result of Group 1 and Group 2 both colored in light blue, we can see whether expression of RdhANP is the reason for dehalogenation. And by comparing the result of Group 1 and Group 3 both colored in yellow, we can measure the influence of xylose operon in the expression of RdhANP. Note that Group 2 is in both comparison, so it’s colored green.

Penn,2011,Team:Penn#notebook#_-_-_TEXT.html,"ar suggests that we have a higher signal that is less stable (and cells that may live a shorter span) because our goal thus far is just proof-of-concept.  We already have a working receiver component, so use it! Images of the cells were made in the Chen Lab under TE microscope, this is the proof that transfection was successful.
Next steps: image analysis of these pictures and ask for confocal time
2.     CatCh mutagenesis didn’t work a couple of weeks ago.  We ran it with our outer primers, we got many unspecific bands (that were very weak).  We tried a restriction digest with the original plasmid (5’ HindIII site and 3’ Xbal(?) site). It’s possible that they gave us the wrong plasmid from addgene because our primers should’ve worked.  We plan to send it for sequencing once it’s under pENTR-dTOPO.  Though we could sequence the pcDNA directly (and then complain to addgene if the plasmid is wrong).  Using Dan’s outer primers, the lengths seem ok.  Today we ran the restriction digest and a gel, product was found between 1500-2000bp.  We tried gel extraction purification with Qiagen kit and ran a nanodrop on the product but the graph was off because the spectra is changed by the gel contamination.  It is worth moving forward with it.
3.     The point of doing a double digest is to save time, but we’re able to run one single digest, purify the DNA, and run another digest to see if the problem was that the enzymes are not compatible, to ensure that we have the correct sites in the DNA, or perhaps the site is ecluded in the supercoil.  We could try this on the pENTR/D-TOPO-pcz-mODC to figure out what’s wrong. *Make sure that we always check NEB on the doubledigest finder to determine if it’s ok to use them together.  Also check to see that the enzymes have the same optimal temperature.
4.     For the gateway of pENTR/D-TOPO-pcz-mODC and pENTR/D-TOPO-CMV: The recA cells were left out for 30 minutes during aliquotting.  We should’ve been aliquotting them in the cold room and use liquid nitrogen to flash freeze them before putting them into the -80C.  This likely explains why the gateway reaction of pENTR/D-TOPO-CMV and p"

OVERVIEW
During our project, we performed or participated in several Human Practices activities, cover-
ing scientific and social thinking , project assessment and public engagement .
In these activities, we used materials to illustrate the mechanism of standard elements in synbio
to the public, talked with senior high school students and freshmen with basic principles and
potential safety problems. We also consulted with the teachers majored in biosafety, asking about
the laws and regulations in our country and our college on synbio or software. We collaborated with
SYSU-CHINA, organizing the Central China iGEM Consortium, with 28 iGEM teams attending. We found
deficiencies in our software design during Human Practice, including safety problems and model.
So we improve our design, making it easier, safer and more practical to use."

Figure 4B
Figure 4A and 4B: Fluorescence measurements of replicate 3 of B0031 (BBa_K2066036) un-induced (A) and induced [IPTG] 100µM(B).          Note the bimodal distribution compared to figure. In this case induction occurs, but a subset of the population is maximally          induced at all induction conditions. All induction conditions of number 3 contained this distribution, while other replicates          of this biological circuit had a more normal fluorescence distribution, indicating that something unusual, likely the loss of          the repressor is going on in this replicate. Of note, this bimodal distribution would not be noticeable without the use of FACs          to observe at a single cell level.
While teams have measured RBSs in the past (Warsaw 2010), to our knowledge no team has ever measured the entire community          library over a variety of induction conditions. As illustrated by B0035’s variable relative strength at different induction          conditions, it is vital to perform characterization at different induction conditions rather than just constitutively.          However, our findings have been consistent with the measurements on the registry, and much like Warsaw 2010 we found that          B0030 was stronger than reported in previous measurements on the registry. Additionally, measurements on the registry by Kelly          and Rubin in 2007 indicate that B0035 is stronger than B0034. Given that their data was recorded from a strong constitutively          expressed promoter, their measurement makes sense in the context of our findings that B0035 is a stronger RBS only when expressed          at a high level.
While the community RBSs are designed for and most commonly used for expression in E. Coli, we thought that it would be          useful to characterize them in a variety of conditions. So as a collaboration we sent a blinded version of the library to          University of Pittsburgh’s iGEM team, who then proceeded to characterize the RBSs in the cell free system S30 (Figure 5).          We also sent a blinded library to the high school team Alverno, who characterized them using Richard Murray’s TX-TL cell free system (Figure 6). In both cases, the majority of RBSs had relative expressions similar to our characterization. However, Team Alverno          characterized B0064 as having a significantly higher relative expression than was found in existing registry characterization as          well as our characterization. We talked to UPitt iGEM, and they noted that due to technical concerns they were not confident"

Efficiency of the Database Entries
86% of participants would like to see a ranking/rating      system for the parts by the other iGEM users which will be one indication      of if a part is working and how well in different laboratories. Few had concerns about how well the rating system will work for      rarely used parts while the widely used parts would even more popular      due the the rating system. Still many believes this would be one      futher towards a peer-reviewed quality control system for the parts.
61% of participants agreed that parts should be updated      regularly by the designers, where most agreed at least when there      is new information on the parts. It has also been suggested      to give permission to all the users of that part for updating information.
73% of participants have been agree with us that excluding      the low ranking parts or the parts with negative feedback from the      future plates will increase efficiency of the system. The      major concern about excluding any part is losing the variety of      parts in the database. Few recommends excluding only the parts that      are not working.
“Efficiency shouldn't be top priority in a database. First and foremost,     data is the top priority. Excluding those parts would make the system     more efficient”
“Some parts may be rare or new and have low efficiency, but can be     very important! Getting rid of them would eliminate any chance of improvement     to these parts, which not only a qualifier for an iGEM gold medal, but     also one of the focuses of biobricks.”
We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or with     negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still archive     them and make their data available through the parts registry.

Making use of our device to their farms in order to suppress the late blight disease.
Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute and Academia Sinica
Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute and Academia Sinica are two of the most well-known research institutions in Taiwan. We signed a contract to get the pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, from Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute and learn how to infect the potato. In our prevention stage, we cooperate with Academia Sinica on the FYVE experiment.
Farmer Outreach
We decided to work on potatoes out of all crops, because like rice and wheat, it’s planted all over the world. Common diseases found in potatoes are bacterial wilt, bacteria soft rot, ring rot and late blight. Recently late blight becomes the most severe disease out of all. We went to interview potato farmers in Taiwan to find out what kind of potatoes they were planting and learned the two main types of potatoes planted in Taiwan are Kennebec and Tainung No. 1.  These are the farmers we interviewed. video 1. video 2.
Varieties
1. Kennebec
Kennebec is bred by the United States Department of Agriculture, and is the most commonly processed potatoes in United States and Canada. Kennebec can be used in making French fries, potato chips, while Tainung NO.1 cannot. Kennebec has shallow and evenly distributed tuberogemmas, thin and yellow skin, green sprout, oval-shaped tubers, and light leave color. Kennebec has a big tuber size, which is generally preferred by people in Taiwan.
However, Kennebec can be easily infected with potato late blight. Now, the best method to prevent infection is to use healthy seed potato to plant, which requires the renewal of potato seeds every year. With a roughly 80 to 100 days to harvest, Kennebec has a shorter planting time than Tainung No.1.  It can crop about 25 to 30 tons of potatoes per hectare. Other advantages of Kennebec over Tainung No. 1 are shorter cultivation period, and Taiwan farmers are more familiar with how to plant it.
2. Tainung NO.1

This process would allow  in particular,the design of some diseases models.              The system, could also be used in order to induce forced protein interactions inhibition using the lack of light signal at a specific time T.
For example, by delaying proteins interaction it is possible to study the development of compensatory mechanisms; including the initiation of stress mechanisms.

Hello, my name is Haroon Ahmed and I currently attend Chinook High School. This is my first year of iGEM. I joined to learn more about the fascinating field of synthetic biology and how it can be used to solve many important real-world problems. Out of all aspects of iGEM, I most enjoy human practices and public outreach. I also enjoy playing sports, and when my high school education is over, I plan to eventually move into the field of medicine to become a physician.
Stefanie Dang
Hello, my name is Stefanie Dang and I’m currently a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGEM because it is an excellent opportunity to meet new people and experience how synthetic biology can be applied to everyday situations. Although there are multiple intriguing areas, I gravitate towards coding, graphics, and design. In the future after high school, although it is unclear, I hope to pursue a career in anthropology, graphic design, or creative writing. I have mastered the art of making puns so well, I die a little crying at my own jokes each time.

In my spare time I work as a lifeguard, I enjoy playing rugby and love to travel!
Allison Leam
Hello! My name is Allison Leam and I am currently finishing up my final year of high school at Lethbridge Collegiate Institute through the french immersion program. I was excited to join iGEM for the first time this year as I’ve always had a passion for science and joining the team would give me the opportunities to explore it in ways different from your common classroom methods. Though I believe it important to explore all aspects of the project, I enjoy getting down and dirty (in safe ways) working in the lab and also simply working alongside all the lovely people on the team. After high school, I hope to pursue post-secondary studies in the science field.

Bruce Paster, a Senior Member of the Staff at the Forsyth Institute, is a local professor of oral medicine, infection, and             immunity. He specializes in microarray technology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.The team met with Bruce to learn             more about the oral microbiome and whether the proposed outputs and delivery methods would be effective. Specifically, Team             MIT wanted to better understand the dynamics between different bacterial species in the microbiome and the vitality of the             role S. mutans plays in cariogenicity.
Dr. Paster explained how cariogenic bacteria use a variety of pathways to adhere to tooth enamel. S. mutans rely on             glucan-mediated adhesion so in theory the proposed output would only be effective in preventing S. mutans-induced caries.             While they are the primary contributor to dental caries, S. mutans are not the only cariogenic bacteria! In fact, 15-20% of             caries cases do not involve S. mutans!
The three main classes of caries in terms of pathogenic composition are S. mutans, a mixture of S. mutans with other             Streptococci, Veillonella, plus Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus. Therefore eliminating S. mutans would very likely             just result in another species taking its place. He told us about the glucosyltransferase vaccine team received the same             criticism.
An important thing for us to consider in terms of mode of delivery is proximity to the site of action. Mr. Paster explained             that while the proposed target area (gingiva) could be convenient due to the mechanics of saliva/crevicular fluid, it might             not be as effective as a varnish on the tooth enamel. Any experiments the team conducted would be proof of principle/circuit.             However, to claim that our system could prevent caries, clinical trials are necessary. Clinical trials are the only way to             determine the threshold of reduction (i.e. is reducing S. mutans by 50% going to be enough?) required to inhibit caries.
Another key obstacle that Mr. Paster highlighted was that of Saliva. Saliva contains a variety of molecules such as             proline-rich proteins and statherins that can block both the attachment of planktonic cells as well as receptors that promote             binding. We realized that whatever material used to simulate the tooth enamel will have to be incubated in saliva in order for             the experiments to be realistic/accurate.
In terms of quantification methods, Dr."

However, since safety is our highest priority, we decided to design and implement a killswitch in both FRED and OSCAR as an extra layer of security. The killswitch aims to to destroy the genome using two powerful non-specific nucleases in the unlikely scenario bacteria can escape into the environment. Click here to learn more!
Interviews
As an undergraduate team, we looked into speaking with experts in various fields, including the oil industry, tailings pond management, biotechnology, law, and politics to gather various opinions on our project. How useful is synthetic biology in a tailings pond environment? What design considerations should we include in our project to improve security? What legal policies must we consider before implementing our project?
Design Considerations
Since safety is the driving force behind our project, we need to ensure the physical design of our biosensor and bioreactor would be able to contain and manage bacterial cultures without allowing any to escape. We needed to build devices that would ensure the safety of both the user and the outside environment during their use. Click here to learn more!

Community Outreach
iGEM Calgary partnered with a number of different associations to engage the general public about science and synthetic biology. Click here to see what we've done this summer!
FRED
FRED is our Functional, Robust Electrochemical Detector. FRED is responsible for detecting and measuring NAs and is able to produce an electrochemical signal that can be measured. FRED can be used to measure tailings pond samples within minutes, without having to ship them to an off-site lab for testing. Click on FRED to learn more!
Detecting NAs
We conducted a transposon search for any regulatory elements that may respond to NAs. Click here to learn more!
Electrochemical Reporting
As a continuation of our 2011 iGEM project, we have designed a replacement for colourmetric assays. Electrochemical reporting can be used to measure miniscule concentrations regardless of how turbid the sample is. Click here to learn more!
Modelling
We conducted some modelling on FRED's predicted output.
Prototyping
We built a prototype biosensor in order to give FRED a home. This biosensor device is capable of performing voltage sweeps that will detect specific compounds. Click here to learn more!

Week 1
This week was dedicated to make buffers such as CCMB80 and SOC, SOB and LB medium (See the protocols SOB-medium , LB medium and competent cell preparation ). We also prepared selective agar plates with ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin (See agarplate preparation). Finally we prepared competent TOP10 cells and froze them in -80°C. We received the pTJ122 plasmid carrying the ccaS, ccaR and cph8 genes as well as the PcpcG2 promoter from Christopher A Voigt at University of California San Francisco.
Week 2
2011-06-27
This week we started with testing the competence in our cells. For this transformation we used one positive control (plasmid pUC19 from New England Biolabs) as well as a negative control without plasmid. For the procedure we followed the protocol for transforming TOP10 competent cells . The result was good, we measured a competence efficiency of 1.7 * 10^8 transformants /ug DNA.
Blue / green output
The strains carrying the amilGFP (green/yellow output) and amilCP (blue output) plasmids were provided by J.F Miller, UCLA. They arrived on plates witch were malhandled during the delivery. Both colors looked really nice but since the colonies were all mixed into each other we started by re-plating to obtain single colonies.

In the reversible Michaelis-Menten reaction the Product can bind the enzyme again and react back to the substrate.                                              This process is described by the ODE system.
$${{d[S] \over dt} = -k_1[E] \cdot [S] + k_{-1}[ES]}$$
$${{d[ES] \over dt} = k_1[E] \cdot [S] + k_{-2}[E] \cdot [P] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]}$$
$${{d[E] \over dt} = k_1[E] \cdot [S] - k_{-2}[E] \cdot [P] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]}$$
$${v = {d[P] \over dt} = k_2[ES] - k_{-2}[E]\cdot [P] = v_f - v_b}$$
After derivation $${v = {-ds \over dt} = {d[P] \over dt}}$$
Finally we use Vfmax = k2⋅Etotal and Vbmax = k−1⋅Etotal to get the common form for the reversible Michaelis Menten equation

Although MFC is high efficiency of power output and environment friendly, most of the power generation MFCs are still in laboratory and not come into massive scale of industry.
One major drawback is the output power density is far less to adapt the standard in industry. electron transfer rate is determined by the potential difference, the reorganization energy and electron donor and receptor distance, main factors to determine the output power density of the microbial fuel cell is related to the electron transfer process, that is to say, the biological system of slow electron transfer rate is the bottleneck of the development of microbial fuel cell.

Riboflavin
Riboflavin, a yellow-orange solid substance with poor solubility in water, was originally recognized as a growth factor in 1879 and named vitamin B, according to the British nomenclature system.
Its IUPAC name is 7,8-Dimethyl-10-[(2S,3S,4R)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxypentyl]benzo[g]pteridine-2,4-dione[8]. Riboflavin has two active coenzyme forms, riboflavin 5'-phosphate (R5P; flavin mononucleotide [FMN]) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)[9], which can both transfer electron.

Hello, we are the 2016 Dundee Schools team from (you guessed it) Dundee, a small city on the East coast of Scotland. Pictured above is where the magic happened, a.k.a. our project; it is the College of Life Sciences, a building owned by Dundee University (who also so very kindly funded us, hint hint here's our Attributions page, which also tells you a bit more about what we all did to contribute to our project).

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"-use the creation. Thus, the patent is an incentive tool for technological innovation. It contributes to technical progress, economic progress and social welfare. Therefore, it seems necessary to protect one’s product before entering the market.
Interested by such a protection for aether, we decided to patent our project. But a major problem occurred to us: Can we patent it even if we are involved in the iGEM competition ?
We made some research and asked the previous iGEM Paris Pasteur team (that has made a guide about iGEM and intellectual property). Here is what they wrote about patenting: “As previously mentioned, the rules of iGEM regarding patenting are quite unclear. On one hand, the foundation promotes open science when it comes to the parts deposited into the registry (…). But on the other hand, filing a provisional patent is one of the judging criteria of the “entrepreneurship track”, that allows teams to be eligible for a grand prize: “The cross-track entrepreneurship prize recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project (...) Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products?”.”
From their work, we deduced that this grey area was profitable to patent. Thus, we continued our process to patent our final product, like the way we created it. Biobricks, as they are concerned, remain recorded in the registry of standard biological parts. This registry follows the open source spirit of Get & Give (&Share). Therefore, we did not want to patent our biobricks.
Nevertheless, one of the French patent condition was still a problem for us: novelty. Indeed, everything that has been disclosed to the public in any way, including material posted on wikis and presented during the giant jamboree cannot be patented.
ALTERNATIVE1
Thus, to ensure the economic viability of aether, we chose to patent our project before going to Boston.
ALTERNATIVE2
Unfortunately, because of a tight deadline, we did not patent our product before going to Boston.It is still possible for us to patent it in a country where a novelty grace period exists.
We decided to protect our prototype by depositing at the Institut Pasteur Patent office a request for patenting our device. It also benefits from design and model protection. Thus, its shape, its pattern and its color are ensured, such as its running.
At least our logo is safeguarded by copyright (there is no registration needed). Nonetheless everything in the scope of the iGEM competition falls under the Creative Commons (CC) attribution license"
UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#safety.html_-_-_TEXT.html," gain any selective advantage over other microbes, since our plasmids were designed to create a visual pattern.  They may, however, receive some slight antibiotic resistance due to the fact that our plasmids have antibiotic resistance for use as selective markers in the lab, but this is not significant enough to be considered a selective advantage.
Should our E. Coli pick up pathogenic genes from other microbes, our E. Coli would be just as harmful as if it was a normal E. Coli.  We did not give our E. Coli any selective advantages, other than the few antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers for use in the lab.
Researcher Safety
We, the researchers, were safe because we worked in a clean and well-maintained laboratory setting.  Everything, including but not limited to samples, solutions, cabinets, were properly labeled.  Safe laboratory procedures were also practiced; gloves were worn, glassware contaminated with cells/genes was bleached prior to being washed, biotechnological waste was autoclaved, etc.  Furthermore, we even took a laboratory safety course ourselves to learn about the special safety codes and whatnot.
Building the spatial oscillator was safe experience as well.  After all, we are working with a non-virulent strain of E. Coli.  In fact, E. Coli is a specimen that is naturally found in the gut.  Nonetheless, we did not work with any toxic substances nor did we work in a radioactive environment.
Engineering Safety
The new parts created will not cause any issues.  First of all, our parts are made from parts already in the registry.  This means that our composite parts will not cause harm or issues to the public.  Furthermore, malfunctioning of the parts will not result in anything harmful.  If the parts malfunction, our E. Coli will either exhibit an unexpected visual pattern or nothing at all.
When we test to see if our construct works or not, we will see whether our parts work or not with the use of RFP expression.  This is a perfectly safe process.
Ethics
Our project will not raise any ethical issues, unless the issue is about the idea of synthetic biology itself.  If anything, we strongly believe that people would be fascinated!

NCTU_Formosa Taiwan
On the 4th of August we had a Skype conversation with the iGEM team of NCTU. After 15 minutes of getting the technology to work, we finally can talk. We started with sharing our project topics. Jenny Gee, one of the team members held a comprehensive           presentation of their project. What we noticed and surprised us is that it seems that most of the teams have a lot of members. However, our team consist only of nine(9) members, we seem to be quite on track. We are all now working at least 40           hour a week on iGEM, and it was nice to hear that NCTU team also does. They are arranging a big event among the Asian iGEM teams. For us that’s maybe also an idea, to arrange one more time an event among the Dutch teams. It was a nice conversation,           we had fun meeting them and seeing how far other teams are in their project.
Oxford Team
Oh the 24th of June we received a message via Facebook from Kyle Sam Bennett of the Oxford iGEM Team. They contacted us because we were both working with biofilms. In their project they focus on the breakdown of biofilms in the urinary tract in order to treat Urinary Tract Infections. For testing the breakdown, they need biofilms with their modified bacteria. Because we also create biofilms with a modified E. Coli bacteria, with the help of a 3D printer, our projects fit really well.
Our project can be a good support for theirs. With the use of our printer in combination with the vector with the curli gene inserted in their modified bacteria, they can print biofilms in the structure. A second subject in which we can help each other is to discuss the safety of the projects. We finally decided to induce the biofilm formation with rhamnose. The last collaboration point with Oxford was about the modeling. We had in total 2 skype meetings, and a few times contact by email. We shared ideas.

UnaG Biobricks
As part of this year’s iGEM project, the newly discovered inducible green fluorescent protein UnaG was characterized. At a size of 15.6 kDa, it is about half the size of GFP. Hence, UnaG would be appropriate to use as a fusion protein. With this in mind, we designed three different UnaG BioBricks; UnaG with a 6xHis-tag (BBa_K2003010) for characterization of the protein, UnaG with a 6xHistag and a flexible linker (Gly-Ser-Gly)2 (BBa_K2003011), and lastly UnaG with only the flexible linker (BBa_K2003012).
The default UnaG BioBrick (BBa_K2003010) was designed and ordered from IDT with a hexahistidine tag on the 5’ end of the gene and a flexible linker (GSG)2 on the 3’ end. However, right upstream of the flexible linker, two stop codons were added, meaning that the flexible linker will not be translated from this gene. By PCR mutagenesis, these two stop codons were removed, resulting in BBa_K2003011 which contains both the flexible linker and the histidine tag. Lastly, PCR was performed in order to remove the 6xHis-tag from BBa_K2003011, resulting in a UnaG BioBrick with only the flexible linker.
Figure 3: Schematic view of the three different UnaG BioBricks. From the top left is; BBa_K2003011, BBa_K2003012, and BBa_K2003010, respectively.

Subsequently we proceeded to observe the samples in an epifluorescence microscope. In the following figure you can se one micrograph of each sample at 100x.
Additionally, we analyzed 4 micrographs of each sample (n=4) with the software ImageJ
All the different treatments presented significant differences, except (B2+ & protease K) and (B2+). Remarkable is the difference between (B2+ / SN B3+) and (B2+ / NS B3-). Also, the direct application of protease K over the samples decreased even more the fluorescence. However, the low fluorescence of B2+ is very weird. We will have to repeat this experiment, but at least the major part of the results makes is what we expected.
June 18 – 24, 2012
We repeated the experiment to investigate the interactions between our bacteria B2+ and B3+ with a serious protocol and recording the data for later analysis. This time we added the control B2-. In the following figure you can se one micrograph of each sample at 100x.
In the figure each row represents one sample. The first row contains the micragraphs with UV filter. The second row  contains the micrographs seen with light. The third row contains the previous micragraphs overlayed (the light image is in grayscale, and the UV image has its black background removed). The forth image is an amplification of the third image (1:4 ratio). Click over the image to open it in a higher resolution.
Additionally, we analyzed 4 micrographs of each sample (n=4) with the software ImageJ
The results were quite different compared to the ones of our previous experiment. Remarkable is that, as expected, B2- and B2+ present the lowest and highest fluorescence intensity. Additionally, (B2+ & B3+) and (B2+ & Protease K) present very similar fluorescence. However, for second time we obtained a weird result: (B2+ & B3+) and (B2+ & B3-) present the same amount of fluorescence.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"First of all, we wanted to test if our primers would anneal to the unknown genome of the isolates, which most likely contained a variant of the blaZ-gene. Three different DNA isolation methods were used: the boiling method ( DNA isolation boiling ) and two commercial kits ( Plasmid Isolation (Promega PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit and Milk Bacterial DNA Isolation Kit ).
To test the sensitivity of our method, we decided to prepare a dilution range in milk of 10-3 up to and including 10-9 of S. aureus. Next, we used the boiling method to isolate the DNA. ( DNA isolation boiling ). After DNA isolation, the samples were amplified, transcribed into RNA, purified and then loaded on a gel ( RPA+in vitro transcription protocol, of the RNA  isolation protocol and the RNA electrophoresis protocol). The samples prepared in LB-medium all gave a positive output. However, all the dilutions prepared in milk did not show a band. We wanted to test if the samples were too diluted already, so we prepared the 10-1 and 10-2 dilutions both in milk and in LB. The results can be found in Figure 17.
Figure 17: Target RNA of blaZ-gene made by RPA and in vitro transcription. (A) To test if the primers we designed on the conserved regions of blaZ work, we extracted DNA from S.aureus (1.0), Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus 1 (2.0) and Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus 2 (3.0) prepared in Tryptic Soy Broth in 3 different ways, namely: the boiling method (0.1), the commercial promega miniprep plasmid isolation kit (0.2) and the norgen milk isolation kit (0.3). (B) To assess the sensitivity of the boiling method, different dilutions of S.aureus were prepared in milk. These dilutions are on indicated per lane. We prepared the 10-1 and 10-2 dilutions of S.aureus both in milk and in LB and performed RPA and in vitro transcription. We used DH5-α transformed with pSB1T3;(Tet) as negative control.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," Helsinki. The goal was to find out what people actually knew about synthetic biology and cyanobacteria. We wanted to see what kind of need there was for informing the general public about all the possibilities synthetic biology offers, as well as, from our project’s point of view, the need to inform about the dangers of cyanobacteria. The interview can be viewed below with subtitles in English. It seemed that the general conception of synthetic biology was something quite foreign and that there is a need for raising awareness of the hazards of cyanobacteria.
LUMA centre
Presenting our project to high schoolers.
We met with high school students who were candidates for the Finnish team of the International Biology Olympiad. Our team gave them a presentation about our project and synthetic biology. The students got to design their own little iGEM projects and hopefully learned about molecular biology and synthetic biology. They also asked questions about our studies and how one needs to prepare oneself to study them. Hopefully we were able to inspire them to continue with the study of biology in the future and perhaps even try themselves in the field of synthetic biology.
Math seminar at the University of Helsinki
In addition to Luma we gave a talk on “Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology” for math students at the University of Helsinki. After giving them a “Biology 101” lecture, they got to hear how modelling was done in our project. It was great to see that so many people were interested in our project as well as modelling in synthetic biology. Let's hope that some of these students will be members of Aalto-Helsinki 2017!
Talking about modelling in synthetic biology.
Media
Our project was on display in the media. We had quite a few articles written about us and we were even a part of a radio program. As we had also gotten sponsorships from certain companies they posted about us and our project on their web pages which was nice.
The University of Helsinki’s Faculty of Science wrote an article about our project and especially what the two mathematicians of our team had learned from this synthetic biology project. The article was later posted also on the university’s main news page. The articles are unfortunately in Finnish.

You can find the band at lanes which are added IPTG just beneath the band of 68 kDa.
2,Growth curve
We measured the turbidities of the transformants every 2 hour and made the growth curves. We transferred the transformant to 200 mL flasks and add 660 µL IPTG and 108 µL isoamyl alcohol to them after 2 hours of the start. We measured the turbidities every 2 hours. The measurements were carried out for 10 hours.
LB 100 mL
ampicillin 150 µL
sample 50 µL
IPTG 660 µL
isoamyl alcohol 108 µL
37°C, 125/min
In addition, we measured the turbidities of the transformants without adding IPTG and isoamyl alcohol too. We measured 4 samples; ATF2-pET-15b, ATF2-pET-15b + IPTG, empty pET-15b, empty pET-15b + IPTG.
As the result, ATF2-pET-15b transformants grow well relative to control(transformants having empty pET-15b vector). We propose the folllowing hypothesis. Isoamyl acetate indicates a stimulatory effect of growth on E.coli cells when compared to isoamyl alcohol so that transformants having ATF2-pET-15b grow well relative to control.
And ATF2-pET-15b without IPTG grow well relative to ATF2-pET-15b add IPTG. It is explained by the following hypothesis. When we add IPTG to the transformant having ATF2-pET-15b, ATF2 protein (AATase) is expessed in bulk in the transformant. A massive amount of AATase has a potential to surpress the growth.
3, Bioassay using Drosophila
Next, to confirm the activity of AATase, we added isoamyl alcohol after IPTG induction and cultivated for about 2 hours. We used E. coli cells carrying the empty vector (pET-15b) as a control and compare it with the E.coli cells carrying pET-15b-ATF2 after addition of isoamyl alcohol. To compare the production of isoamyl acetate, we carried out a bioassay using Drosophila because D"

Len, you’ve said before it would take about a full year and approx. $AU100 000 to fully prepare our Winsulin for patenting.
Len Mancini
Yes. It’s a rough estimate and highly dependent on the product, but generally that’s our rule of thumb.
Team DISCO
We are already starting to see just how costly these kinds of endeavours are, without even including the biosimilar trial and clinical trials required for both of our insulins. Surely there are some other alternatives? Could we not just start producing insulin in bathtubs all around the world?
Nick Coleman
Guys, that’s a great idea, but we have GMPs for a reason. Safety is more paramount than simply meeting demand. Regulating something like that would be way more of a nightmare than it’s worth.
Team DISCO
Yeah, we guess you’re right. Recombinant methods of production of an open source insulin seems like our best option moving forward. Market hurdles included! We should probably investigate how an open-source business would function though with a few more experts.
Our Final Applied Design
Following these discussions, we decided to follow the mantra ""Keep it Simple, Stupid"" and just focus on synthesising insulin from bacteria, rahter than producing an insulin pump alongside it. We also decided to model the activity of our Winsulin to determine what kind of insulin it is. This will also be important information for future endeavours. Furthermore, we became a little more comfortable with the idea of going open source with our Winsulin also. However, these talks also demonstrated that raising the initial capital for manufacturing plants may be a little difficult given the start up costs, specifically Good Manufacturing Practice approvals.
Entrepreneurship
Our Original Entrepreneurship Plan
Originally, we were full steam ahead on the open source direction. We planned on raising capital through crowd funding measures and with angel investors. Other open source tools were considered, such as Public Investment 'matching' schemes and Private Trading Schemes.

Camp Launch & SEP
Not all students attend schools where they have the chance to work with lab equipment or are exposed to many of the potential careers in science. We partnered with Camp Launch and William & Mary’s School of Education to reach more students from diverse socioeconomic statuses. To create an accessible and relevant outreach program we followed the Outreach Planning Guide . An overview version of the guide can be found on the Database Page page
Find Communities
Not all schools offer students the chance to work with lab equipment and many students are not exposed to the wide range of potential careers in science. William & Mary’s School of Education hosts Camp Launch and a SEP (Summer Experience Program) to reach students from diverse socioeconomic statuses. These programs provide enriching opportunities and advanced academic instruction in a variety of disciplines including STEM. We partnered with the STEM sector to help promote a love of synthetic biology, and facilitate an exploration of the potential careers in STEM.
Evaluating Interest & Understanding
To insure our programs were a good fit for the students we connected with Deanna Marroletti from Camp Launch & SEP. Deanna emphasized that one of the most important parts of the program was helping the students feel successful. With this in mind we worked to incorporate techniques from our activities booklet that could be mastered quickly. We also adapted our lessons to match what the students would be covering in their classroom lessons with camp launch. The students would be covering DNA structure and function as well as forensics just before arriving at our class so their minds would be primed to learn about Gel Electrophoresis and DNA editing techniques. The goal of this project was to provide an opportunity for students practice with synthetic biology techniques, develop their confidence, and encourage them to feel like they could grow up to be amazing scientists. The goal of the presentation we gave later in the week was to present some of the exciting careers in STEM and get students interested in the field.
Consider How to Connect
The leaders at Camp Launch and SEP requested an in-lab experience for their students. To make meaningful"

UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE COLLEGIATE TEAM
We are collaborating with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate Team for the 7th year in a row. The collegiate team members have assisted our project by providing us with mentorship and assistance in the lab. It was easy for us to collaborate with them as both our projects contain protein capsids from viruses, and therefore we were able to help each other design these constructs. We were also able to have connection to collegiate team members who have had previous experience with tailings ponds in their past iGEM projects, which helped our project greatly. Sydnee Calhoun, Chris Isaac, Luke Saville, and Kristi Turton, members of the collegiate team, were advisors for our team and provided valuable assistance and help for our project."

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of DNA that occurs during sample preparation and targeted sequencing preparation
Using regression, the half-life of EPO gene doping DNA in blood was determined to be around 41 days.. While the half-life of cfDNA in blood is around 10 minutes, the slow release of the gene doping DNA from the dying infected cells significantly increases the detection window. EPO gene doping cDNA administered to cynomolgus macaques using adeno-associated viral vectors was detectable for up to 57 weeks after injection in infected white blood cells ( Ni et al. 2011 ). The concentrations ranged from 333 to 500 copier per mL. While the target cell of the study was muscle cells, the DNA was found in white blood cells due to off target infections. Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, can live up to several months ( Tough and Sprent, 1995 ). Our detection window could be further increased in the future if we moved away from detected doping DNA in plasma and isolated white blood cells instead.
Microdosing was determined to be the best doping method for doping athletes. The benefit of this method is that it avoids detection through the biological passport. Assuming that the athlete begins the treatment prior to becoming a professional athlete and continues microdosing during, their red blood cell count would appear to be constant and naturally high.
Figure 22. Effect of EPO gene doping using IM microdosing on red blood cell count. The initial dose is 96 billion vectors followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days. The black horizontal lines are the range of EPO concentrations found in healthy adults. The red line indicates the red blood cell count at which the risk of stroke to due blood clot becomes significant.
Comparison of a Large Single Dose and Microdosing for IM and IV Administration
The red blood cell production model is combined with the compartment and infection model to determine the effects on EPO gene doping on red blood cell count. Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injection are compared, and two methods for gene doping are tested. The first consists of a single large injection while the second consists of a large initial dose followed by smaller doses every 20 days.
Large Single Dose Gene Doping
Figure 23. Comparison of intravenous (a) and intramuscular injection (b) at day 0 on red blood cell production. The black line is the total EPO (doping and natural) present in the blood over time.

Cellulases (MATLAB model)
MATLAB is a general-purpose mathematical tool, developed by Mathworks , and commonly used by engineers. Among other things, it can be used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by numerical integration.
An attempt was made to use MATLAB to model the degradation of cellulose into glucose in a biorefinery. But accurately predicting how much is converted in the synergistic system (where enzymes are kept close together) is difficult without literature to provide the ODEs and the kinetic parameters. Therefore this model only looks at the free floating (non-synergistic) enzyme approach. It is deterministic and is set by a series of initial conditions.

Assumptions
The mathematical model is based on the ODEs and kinetic parameters outlined in Kadam et al (2004) . The following are its assumptions and basis:
Underlying assumption: cellulose, cellobiose, and glucose concentrations change continuously with time.
Rate equations assume enzyme adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm model.
Glucose and cellobiose, which are the products of cellulose hydrolysis, are assumed to ""competitively inhibit enzyme hydrolysis"

Meetups
The European Experience
The European Experience was a meetup of around 25 European iGEM teams from eleven different countries, including four teams from the Netherlands. The meetup was in Paris and it was organized by two Parisean teams, team IONIS and team Évry. It started with a gathering where everyone could meet and talk about their project. Immediately people showed great interest in our project and wanted to know everything about our biolasers and lenses. We found out that the Pasteur iGEM team is also going to work with silicate, and we had lunch with some of their team members to discuss about our projects.
After lunch there were two conferences about synthetic biology, one that focused on challenges and risks of doing research and one that focused on the economics of synthetic biology. At the end of the conference Randy Rettberg, the president of iGEM, talked about why he started the iGEM competition and about the values of sharing information between the teams.
On Saturday evening there was a party for all the European iGEM teams. First there was a possibility to watch the football match between Italy and Germany and later that night the party really started. There was beer and a deejay, so our team really enjoyed ourselves. Later on the evening there even was a real fire breather!
Our team had a great time at the meetup, and you can also read about our touristic activities in Paris over here.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," from a different angle. After doing so we also concerned ourselves with the ethical aspects of our project. The problem of safety concerns does not only lie in the way people observe laboratory work but also starts with the way terms are used in synthetic biology. We analyzed ethical problems regarding the terms ""living machine"" and ""artificial cell"" and came to the conclusion that for a public debate a clear and precise nomenclature of terms used in synthetic biology is very important. For the reason that synthetic biology is a young field of research we have now the chance to build up an informed basis for debate. We propose the usage of ""mechanical living organisms"" and ""genetically artificial"" cell as proper terms for the discussion. As a new field of science synthetic biology has the opportunity to  model the public awareness. Synthetic biology has the potential to change the life of people and to solve important problems. It is crucial to include the public to achieve these prime goals.
Changes always begin with a small step. We asked ourselves how to make a difference in the public perception of our project. Even though we are confident about the safety of our projects, people hearing about viral vectors create horror scenarios in their minds. Often when explaining the safety of our project to the public we did not realize using certain terms that might be obvious for us but swamped the public. Therefore we created a spreadsheet explaining safety aspects of our project and viral vectors in general to inform the public. We wanted to make it understandable for not only scientists but for everybody.
As a conclusion we want to once more accent our goals we want to achieve by creating LINK-IT. In our opinion it is very important to link policy and practice with safety. It is or strong believe that after careful investigation these two belong together and safety should always be a part of policy and practice. This is the only way to create a public acceptance of synthetic biology and it is also a great opportunity to bring synthetic biology to the center of society. You cannot change the world if you are not aiming to achieve understanding.

Saturday Balloon Fever
In Germany and many other parts of the western world there is a huge negative public opinion about genetic engineering. Especially reports in mass media often stoke further prejudices. Sadly, these reports are mostly unqualified and unscientific. Due to the reports and a general lack of education about molecular biology, many people indeed reject genetic engineering, but have no idea, what genetic engineering is about. This leads to an ambivalent public opinion. On the one hand, biofuel production (“green” energy) via (usually genetically modified) algae or"

Model of MIN system
Tianjin Team use a classical model, density-dependent growth model, for helping BIT-China to stimulate population of E.coli growing. Also they use some other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
Then they use these equations to simulate the function of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
Figure 1. The dynamic change of cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell division process is inhibited.

Plasmid isolation and gel analysis:
While the presence of white colonies are consistent with the hypothesis that they contain plasmids with Cld inserts, they do not prove the hypothesis. White colonies could also arise from the rare ligation of the host plasmid backbone using non-compatible ends. To verify that they contain Cld inserts. The plasmids must be purified and shown to contain inserts that correspond to the sizes expected of Cld(SP+) and Cld(SP-).
We therefore purified (mini-prepped) the DNA from overnight cultures derived from six white colonies selected from the Cld(SP+) plate and six colonies selected from the Cld(SP-). Shown below (Tables 1 and 2) are the spectroscopic results for each plasmid isolates which provide a measure of their concentration (ng/uL) and purity (OD 260/280 ratio). Each measurement was made twice from separate aliquots.
As shown below, duplicate values are very similar. For all plasmid isolates the concentration ranges from a low of 76ng/uL to a high of 98ug/uL while 260/280 ratios range from 1.77 to 1.83. The 260/280 ratio is a measure of the amount of DNA (260nm) relative to protein (280nm). Values of 1.8 are considered to be free of protein (Thermo Scientific Technical Bulletin T009). Therefore all plasmid isolates show minimal protein content.
We compared the insert sizes of the 12 plasmid isolates relative to the insert (Tinsel) of the host plasmid, CPB-38-441. The inserts were released by digestion with BsaI, electrophoresed and imaged as shown below (Figure 3).The CPB plasmid backbone (CPB Bkbn) fragment (3.9 kBP), found opposite the 4.0 kBP marker. In the positive control column, the lowest band sits between the 0.7 kBP and 1.0 kBP marker, which is the 0.75 kBP Tinsel gene fragment. Lower bands on the Cld+sp gel are slightly above the Tinsel band, but still below the 1.0 kBP marker, indicating that the sequence is between 0.75 kBP to 1.0 kBP long. This corresponds to the 0.9 kBP sequence coding the Cld+sp gene. On the Cld-sp"

Also, there are some new ideas in Canada and America.
For example, The Planet Bottle (TPB) is designed to oxo-biodegrade through the inclusion of Reverte additive. The Plant Bottle is manufactured from sugar cane and virgin PET pellets, 35% and 65% respectively, They have been advocating a total switch to 100% rPET – with Reverte – to deal with the reality that some companies are largely unsuccessful in their weak pursuit of a socially responsible position on recycling and reuse. They said, ""We think that recycling is good, but 100% rPET with Reverte is best "".
In January 2009, ENSO Bottles, of Phoenix, Arizona was introducing a biodegradable PET plastic bottle that could change the way we think about plastic. Enso bottles are not oxo-biodegradables or PLA (Polylactic Acid). ENSO bottles are 100% biodegradable and 100% recyclable PET plastic bottles. Our PET bottles will biodegrade in anaerobic (no oxygen, no light) and aerobic compostable environments.

Recycling of PET was mainly using physical recycling method in China. Compared with physical recycling method, chemical recycling method makes it easier to develop circular economy and has better prospects. In recent years, chemical recycling method has been developed rapidly in domestic recycling of PET, meanwhile, related technology is also gradually mature.

Sin (sporulation inhibition) Operon Model
In order to create a more realistic model of our sporulation system, in addition to the previous model, the team has decided to include the Sin (sporulation inhibition) Operon Model, which the team designed in CellML.
The sin operon controls the production and activity of the repressor SinR, which in its active tetrameric form, inhibits sporulation by repressing stage II and spo0A promoters. On the other hand, the accumulation of Spo0A~P induces the expression of SinI, which binds to and inactivates SinR.[9]
Diagram 1: Simplifed Schematic of the sin Operon[9]
With reference to Diagram 1, the parameters varied in this model, are the concentration of SinR, S2, as well as k3.
The following differential equations makes up a deterministic model which describes the Sin Operon.[9]
Equation 1: Concentration of SinI, [I]
where:
AI, the expression rate of SinI = 0.8 sec-1
γI, the degradation rate of SinI = 0.02 sec-1,
kIon, the rate of the formation of dimers = 0.083 nM-1 sec-1,
kIoff, the off rate for SinI:SinR = 0.5 sec-1,
Equation 2: Concentration of SinR, [R]
where:

On June 11th, we participated in WPI’s TouchTomorrow event. This is a STEM event geared toward the community to help educate children and their families about different science, engineering, technology, and mathematics related topics. Through this event we were able to teach the community about important topics relating to biology and interacted with over 400 people. The activities that we held at TouchTomorrow were adapted from the protocols in the Synthetic Biology Teacher Curriculum designed by the iGEM Team at The College of William and Mary.
DNA Extraction
This activity allowed children to extract the DNA from strawberries in order to better understand how small DNA is. Using an extraction liquid (comprised of water, salt, and dish soap) along with isopropanol, they were able to extract white DNA from squished strawberries. Using a coffee stirrer, the children were then able to remove the DNA from strawberries and put it into a colored centrifuge tube. We then placed the centrifuge tube on string and the children were able to bring home their DNA. This activity was supplemented with a poster explaining what DNA is and what it does. Nearly 20 Ibs of strawberries were used for this activity!
Wall of Traits
This activity allowed participants to put stickers into different columns depending on the genetic traits that they had. We covered an entire wall with paper and made columns based on either or questions relating to genetic traits, such as having a widow’s peak or not. Children were able to see that many of the traits that their parents or siblings had were the same as theirs. This activity was supplemented with a poster explaining the role that genes play in determining traits. As the day went on the wall became filled with dots, allowing us and attendees to see the prominence of certain traits within our community.
Trait Bracelets
This activity corresponded to the traits used in the Wall of Traits. Each question that the participant answered for the wall had a corresponding question for the bracelets. Each answer to the questions had a corresponding colored bead. Each participant ended up with seven beads on their bracelets. Older children and adults were able to recognize that their bracelets were similar to people they were related to because of traits being passed down from their parents.

Ligation
Ligation is the process that target DNA gene is inserted  into a plasmid. Both the vector and insert are prepared to have the sticky ends.  These two kinds of DNA pieces are placed in a reaction tube and the proper DNA  ligase, buffer, and cofactors are added for the reaction to take place. When  done properly, the ligation will result in a successful combination of the  insert and plasmid into one plasmid.Based on the digestion of mutant-pSB1A3,GFP and RFP DNA fragments,also ligation  can be done. We ligate mutant-pSB1A3  vector and sticky GFP and RFP DNA fragments to construct an new plasmid  mutant-pSB1A3-GR.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," seems not only safer but also more sensitive dye. However, because it also binds to nucleic acids, we treated it as a potential mutagen as well – we worked in an active fume hood and wore lab coats and gloves. The disposal of the product was carried out according to protocols and safety regulations.
Environmental considerations
Synthetic biology involves taking genetic material from various organisms and creating new organisms that may never exist in nature. Such organisms could have unpredictable impact on the environment if they escaped from the laboratory conditions. Due to this reason, iGEM has a strict Do Not Release policy our which our team took very seriously.
Even though our project does not result in a genetically modified organism (GMO) but we generated them for our basic cloning, transformation and PCR experiments. To fully understand what we were working with, we not only studied the biological parts we are working with, but also the organisms they came from and the organism they are transferred to (in our case E. coli strains). Those factors helped us determine that our project is required of Biosafety Level 1 and according means for handling the resulting GMO.
Examples of considered characteristics included:
Treats arising directly from the inserted part: assessment if the product of inserted gene has known biological or pharmacological functions that may cause harm (e. g. toxins, gene expression regulators, oncogenic gene sequences, antibiotic resistance, allergens, etc).
Pathogenicity of the host strain, consequences of exposure and availability of treatment.
Whether our modifications could increase pathogenicity of the resulting GMO."

So yes, there shouldn’t be completely unbridled experimentation without any oversight at all, but it shouldn’t be completely opposite where you say, well we don’t think that we should even do this technology because we are still evaluating it. That’s ridiculous. We’ve been doing genetic engineering since the 1970’s, so it’s not something completely unknown. Synthetic biology is just making it faster and easier.
Team Paris Saclay : When you work in an academic space, you are very much controlled.  Do you follow some rules, laws, do you have constraints as we have in an academic research center?
Ellen : Of course we do, and I think that because there’s so much public attention in DIY labs, in lots of way there are actually safer than university labs.   We have a science advisory board that includes the biosafety officer from MIT, Claudia Mickelson, as well as a bunch of other people that have degrees and many years of experience. That’s on top of the two people running it, myself and Oliver [Medvedik] both having PhD in molecular biology … We also have safety training that is mandatory for all members before they set foot in the lab. We dispose of all our chemicals and living organisms the same way a university does. We contract waste companies and package them the way they say, and they dispose of it according to US regulations. I don’t really see that much difference… Having worked in a lot small start-up biotechnology companies in the US, a DIY lab is not that much different. It’s a small lab with not a lot of funding, maybe in an unconventional space. I used to work in a biotech company  that was in a hospital building. I don’t really see what all the fuss is about… Another thing is that we all got together and wrote a code of ethics. That’s really more than conventional scientists have done. so there is a code of Ethics in Euope and a code of Ethics  in the United States. That was in 2011. It is posted on-line if you want to see it.
Team Paris Saclay : We are building a bacterium that can degrade PCBs, do you think it is a good idea to put GMO in water ?
Ellen : It depends on how you are doing it ! I mean, certainly it’s not a good idea to just release GMO in water system to clean it up… but they use bacteria to clean oil out of  … There are certain industrial practices that produce oil and there is water, and there is oil, and they"

Utah_State,2013,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"s, it is no wonder that a variety of mechanisms are possible for bacterial cell killing (Epand et al., 1999). Most AMPs that have been studied follow the Shai-Matsuzaki-Huang (SMH) model (Zasloff, 2002) (Lai & Gallo, 2009). This model overviews the interaction of a peptide with the outer layer of a cell membrane. The general flow of this model includes the “carpeting” of the membrane with the AMP followed by the displacement of lipids in the membrane, and finally the lysing of the membrane. The SMH model can be seen below.
Shai-Matsuzaki-Huang model (Zasloff, 2002)
The SMH model demonstrates that one of two outcomes is achieved to reach cell lysis: (1) the peptide will physically break the membrane to cause cell lysis or (2) the peptide will enter the cell to perform various interior mechanisms of action against the cell (Zasloff, 2002). This model demonstrates a general explanation of the mechanism of how AMPs operate. How exactly they act in killing a cell varies greatly from peptide to peptide. Some examples may be: depolarization of charged cell membranes, pore formation in cell membranes, and degrading of important cell structures. However, it is generally agreed that most AMPs work to achieve cell membrane permeabilization (Andreu & Rivas, 1998). Many organisms use a series of different AMPs from various classes to work more effectively against bacteria (Zasloff, 2002). AMPs are usually not produced in high concentrations until injury or illness occurs to the organism. Other AMPs are stored as inactive compounds and are controlled by cellular receptors (Lai & Gallo, 2009).
AMPs are characterized according to their structure and function. Our team selected AMPs from most of the classes of AMPs. These include anionic peptites (Scygonadin), linear cationic alpha-helical peptides (LL37, Grammistin Pp1, EcAMP1), and anionic and cationic peptides that contain cysteine and form disulphide bonds (Cg-Defh1) (Brogden, 2005). Generally, AMPs are alpha helical or contain beta-sheets. However, some are extended in structure or form loops.
Drug resistance is especially important in health settings in modern society. The use of antibiotics to treat bacterial diseases has led to the emergence of “superbugs”, drug resistant bacteria that infect"

BIT,2017,Team:BIT#HW1_-_-_TEXT.html," temperature to low temperature, ice crystals may generate, and then puncture bacteria cells. So we need to find a reagent to protect bacteria. At the beginning, we choose glycerol. Soon, we found glycerol is too sticky too let the powder out(Fig.1.2.1). We decided to use skimmed milk whose quality fraction is 10% to have a try.
  Freeze the suspension of bacteria and protective reagent at -80℃ for an hour. Open the vacuum freeze dryer and push the button of “Compressor” after 5 minutes. Freeze the cold trap of the dryer at -53℃ for an hour. And then, put the pre-frozen suspension into the cold trap. In a vacuum state, the water in suspension will sublime into water vapor leaving the system. Dry powder is left.
  We also need an index to evaluate the effect of vacuum freeze drying on bacteria. So we designed such an experiment: we use E coli transformed into BBa_K2305004 as material. After the bacteria was made into dry powder, dissolve the powder with LB medium, resuscitate the bacteria in a shaker of 37℃ and then measure the growth curve. By comparing the curve trend before and after freeze drying, we can make the effect clear.
Results:   Though there are some differences between test groups and contrast group, they all have linear area, which we can use in our project. It confirms making bacteria into dry powder is feasible.
Ⅱ. Fluids part:
   As a microfluidic chip, the assessment of the flow of liquid is a necessary part of characterizing the performance of the chip. For the purposes of this project, the risks that may present during the infusion process include:
   ①: Blocking may occur in injection process.As a consequence,the injection would be not smooth,which would even lead to chip damage.
  ②: Bubbles are possibly be produced during injection,which would lead to dead volume increasing and biochemical reaction as well as optical detection process would be impacted consequently.
   ③: The fast flow rate may make the upstream beads to be washed to the downstream, so that the aptamer’s complementary strand would cleavage and release lysine with absence of the AFP,which would increase the risk of false positive diagnosis.
   In contrast, in this regard we need to meet the requirements as follows:
   ①: Ability to perform a smooth injection without blocking and bubbles in constant injection rate condition.
   ②: Magnetic beads would not be washed to the downstream"
