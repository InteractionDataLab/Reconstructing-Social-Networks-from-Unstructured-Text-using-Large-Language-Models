TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"1.0 wt%. This is counterintuitive, as it is hard to imagine that addition of more spermine actually decreases the amount of coacervates. However, this is perfectly in line with theoretical considerations as we explain in the coacervate modelling page.
Figure 19: Absorbance of polyU/spermine coacervate solutions. Barplot shows the absorbance (500 nm light) of coacervate solutions containing varying amounts of spermine and a fixed (0.1 wt%) polyU concentrations. The result indicates that there is an optimum and that addition of more spermine after 1 wt% in fact decreases the overall turbidity. This result, although counterintuitive, is predicted by theoretical models of coacervates. Error bars indicate standard deviation from the mean of three measurements.
Proof of the coacervation method with RNase A
With coacervates formed, the next step was to test the coacervation method for an unspecific RNase to give a proof of principle. This RNase would eventually be substituted by Cas13a. Besides the proof of principle, the experiments with non-specific RNase (RNase A) would already give us information on timescales, concentrations and methods of measurement. In Figure 20 two tubes are shown, both containing polyU and spermine. To the left tube, RNase A is added. There is clear difference in turbidity between the two tubes, proving that coacervates do not form in the presence of RNase A.
Now that we were able to prove that RNase can inhibit the formation of coacervates, we did an RNase A titration to determine from which concentration of RNase A the formation of coacervates is inhibited. The results are shown in Figure 21. From these results we can conclude that the formation of coacervates is inhibited above an RNase A concentration of 10-4 wt%.
Figure 20: PolyU/spermine coacervates with (left) and without (right) RNase A. As is directly visible to the naked eye, coacervate solutions of 0.1 wt% polyU and 1.0 wt% spermine are cleared upon addition of 0.05 wt% RNase A. This serves as a first proof of principle that coacervates can be used to indicate RNase activity.

We hope for more free intrinsic electrons in our material because that'll largely increase the electrons transferring into E.coli. We could replace CdS with CdTe for better efficiency.
CdTe is another kind of nanoparticle which is fully researched both in semiconductor physics and biology due to lower energy gap(1.5eV, compared to CdS 2.51eV),which result in more intrinsic free electrons activated. In the mean while, it is a very popular material as Quantum dots (QDs) which is supposed to attach to living cells for the sake of application of colorful lighting. Though CdTe has toxicity to E.coli but according to Fang TT1 et al, scale of CdTe has reverse ratio to the toxicity adhering on the cell. So we can control the reaction  condition to minimize the toxicity to E.coli.

What is CRISPR-dCas13a?
Cas13a is a new Cas protein that, unlike previously characterized DNA-targeting Cas proteins such as Cas-9, has demonstrated RNA-guided RNase activity. Originally discovered in Leptrotrichia shahii, Cas13a provides interference against RNA phage. Biochemical characterization has shown that Cas13a cleave ssRNA targets by using catalytic residues in its two HEPN domains. In deactivating these catalytic residues by mutagenesis, the result is dCas13a, which is able to target and bind to RNA, but unable to cleave RNA. This ability of dCas13a to find an arbitrary binding sequence, makes dCas13a effectively a programmable RNA-binding protein. We want to harness this power of dCas13a to bind to splice sites of interest, thereby occluding the spliceosome from cutting at those sites. [2]

Introduction
Bio-safety is an important issue in synthetic biology. Concerns surrounding synthetic organisms  escaping into the environment have prompted the development of novel methods of bio-containment.   Many iGEM projects that require an organism to be released from the lab use kill switches to address   concerns about the effect of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the environment.  Unfortunately, kill switches - inducible genetic   devices that cause cell death - are poorly categorised in the standard registry of genetic parts.   There is a distinct lack of quantitative data which prevents them being used with confidence.
Our initial concerns surrounding the use of kill switches as bio-safety devices were centred  around their efficiency, robustness over time and ability to prevent transfer of synthetic DNA into the  wild population. We contacted Dr Markus Gershater , chief scientific officer at Synthace Ltd, to ask him  what the application of kill switches might be in an industrial setting and what evidence would be satisfactory  for their use. Dr Gershater gave the view that kill switches would not be as effective or economical as the  physical and chemical bio-containment methods that Synthace currently employ. One of his concerns was that  any leakiness in a system would provide a strong selection pressure against cells with fully functional kill   switches. In order for Dr Gershater to be satisfied, the kill switch would need to be tested across a wide   range of environmental conditions and still remain effective. He would also need to see high efficiency levels,   as in the context of large culture vessel, even a low proportion of cell survival would result in a large   population lacking an effective kill switch.
There’s no need for kill switches in the industry area that we operate. Even in the case where we might think there was a need for extra containment, the idea of putting in multiple systems to a production strain is concerning
-Dr Markus Gershater, Synthace Ltd
We also contacted Dr Tom Ellis of Imperial College London and   asked his opinion on kill switch reliability. He gave the view that combining multiple mechanisms could   greatly reduce organism escape rates after kill switch induction. Combining several kill switches was an  approach we had discussed during the development phase of our project"

Disadvantages

Not as sensitive as other sensors that have been compared.
They are large and very expensive for only one sensor. This would require building an X, Y stage to automatically move the plate over the sensor to get a reading from each well, which would be costly time wise and more complicated for an open source project.
One of the more expensive options when compared to other sensors.
Table 3: This table shows the different sensors that are able to detect changes in light brightness, which were investigated for use in our device.
1- Photodiodes are a type of transducer that can convert light into an electrical current proportionally to the amount of like that falls onto it. How a photodiode does this is explained in more detail below.
2- Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) are components that can vary the levels of resistance across it depending on how much incident light is hitting the component. Usually, the LDR's resistance will decrease as the brightness of the light increases, and then this change of resistance can be calculated by measuring the voltage and current change across it.
3- Photomultiplier Tubes are the most sensitive of the sensors choices investigated. This is because a small amount of light coming into the device will cause the releasing of an electron (a small negatively charged particle). Once an electron inside the device is released a massive amplification is generated by using electrical components inside known as dynodes. This will give a very large output signals which are directly proportional to a very small input signals, however, this type of sensor is much more expensive than the others we investigated.
4- Phototransistors work much the same as photodiodes in that they are able to respond to light by generating a current that is directly proportional to the brightness of the light. They are also able to amplify the current so that there is a larger output for a small input.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

The optimized coding sequence would produce more protein, theoretically. And optimization also improved the activity of [FeFe] Hydrogenases according to the experiment that we did.
>Improvement:
Codon usage bias adjustment
We analysed the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of the optimized coding sequence and the original one. And the distribution of codon usage frequency along the length of the gene sequence is increased from 0.33 to 0.97. A CAI of 1.0 is considered to be perfect in the desired expression organism, and a CAI of > 0.8 is regarded as good, in terms of high gene expression level.
Fig. 4：The distribution of codon usage frequency along the length of the gene sequence.
We also compared the Frequency of Optimal Codons (FOP). The value of 100 is set for the codon with the highest usage frequency for a given amino acid in the desired expression organism. As we can see, the percentage of 91-100 increased largely, from 36 to 86, after the optimization.

>Conclusion:
A wide variety of factors regulate and influence gene expression levels, and after taking into consideration as many of them as possible, OptimumGene™ produced the single gene that can reach the highest possible level of expression.
In this case, the native gene employs tandem rare codons that can reduce the efficiency of translation or even disengage the translational machinery. We changed the codon usage bias in E. coli by upgrading the CAI from 0.33 to 0.97 . GC content and unfavorable peaks have been optimized to prolong the half-life of the mRNA. The Stem-Loop structures, which impact ribosomal binding and stability of mRNA, were broken.

But man, of all animals, is the one that seldom comes up to his         average. He ought to live a hundred years, according to this physiological         law, for five times twenty are one hundred; but instead of that, he         scarcely reaches, on the average, four times his growing period; the cat         six times; and the rabbit even eight times the standard of measurement.         The reason is obvious. Man is not only the most irregular and the most         intemperate, but the most laborious and hard-worked of all animals. He is         also the most irritable of all animals; and there is reason to believe,         though we cannot tell what an animal secretly feels, that, more than any         other animal, man cherishes wrath to keep it warm, and consumes himself         with the fire of his secret reflections.

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html,". When we were there we explained the iGEM philosophy of standardization and the cooperation of teams through the registry of parts. In a round table discussion with experts we got to hear their concerns having to do with iGEM.
Alex: I remember that they expressed concern with making synthetic biology easier to access. Some of their largest concerns with that is someone could potentially either on purpose or on accident release antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment causing an epidemic. Other concerns had to do with the potential to engineer a host that will more efficiently create biotoxin, which a terrorist or disgruntled scientist could use in an attack. So the threat of a bioweapon that can’t be found in nature is real.
Dev: But does that mean that open-source biology is contributing to that danger? Drew Endy seems to believe that keeping synthetic biology transparent and open is the best way for us to monitor labs for malicious activity. He said “The only way the (expletive deleted) doesn't hit the fan is if everybody engineering biology does so in the open. We're co-opting the idea from open-source software that 'many eyes lead to few bugs.' In other words, I don't trust you not to make any mistakes the next time you program a piece of DNA. You shouldn't trust me.""
Alex: Alright, so I guess the argument can be made that open source science allows science to self-monitor for unethical or dangerous practices. But this system wouldn’t work for do-it-yourself biologists who work with no federal funding. Synthetic biology may therefore necessitate a new model for addressing ethical and policy issues because of the complexity of the biological systems being manipulated.
Outro: Well thanks for joining us while we explore the ethical issues associated with synthetic biology.

Genetically Modified Foods
Alex: Hi my name is Alex Grigg, and I’m here with my teammate Dev Vyas, and this is the third of our synthetic biology ethics podcast. Today we’re talking about a heavily debated topic within synthetic biology, which is genetically modified foods.
Dev: ""There will be a significant challenge for agriculture and the science that will be required to provide a healthy, nutritious and adequate food supply in coming decades for a rapidly growing population,""
Alex: Wow Dev that’s pretty profound, did you come up with that?

M.Omar Din, et al. engineered the LuxI-LuxR AHL QS system in a clinically relevant bacterium to lyse synchronously at a threshold population density and to release drugs to treat cancer. The 2016 Imperial College team used the synthetic LuxI-LuxR AHL QS system to maintain the balance of the co-culture bacteria. The 2016 Arizona State University Team continued to engineer several new AHL-based communication systems to enrich the diversity.
Figure 2. Natural AHL-based quorum sensing system (A) and synthetic communication system (B), cited from reference [2].
The Peptide-based QS systems in Gram positive bacteria
Gram-positive bacteria use peptides, called autoinducing peptides (AIPs), as signaling molecules in the QS system. Once produced in the cell, AIPs are processed and secreted. When the extracellular concentration of the AIP is high, which occurs at high cell density, it can be either sensed by a cognate membrane-bound two-component histidine kinase receptor or it can be imported into the cytoplasm to be sensed by a cognate transcription factor. In the two component system type, AIP binding activates the receptor’s kinase activity, it autophosphorylates, and passes phosphate to a cognate cytoplasmic response regulator. The phosphorylated response regulator activates transcription of the genes in the QS regulon. The Agr system from S.aureus belongs to the two component system type. In the cytoplasmic sensing type, AIPs are transported back into the cell cytoplasm where they interact with transcription factors to modulate the transcription factor’s activity and, in turn, modulate gene expression changes. The AimR-AimP system from B.subtilis bacteriophage phi3T and the PlcR-PapR system from B.cereus belong to the cytoplasmic transcription factor type.
Fig 3. Two types of peptide-based quorum sensing systems in Gram-positive bacteria. (A) two-component signaling pathway, (B) cytoplasmic transcription factor. Cited from reference [3].
The characteristics of peptide-based quorum system from Gram positive bacteria
Compared to the AHL-based QS systems, the signal peptide encoding capacity is far more expanded. Even as short as seven amino acids, the encoded information capacity can reach to 207 different types. The peptide configuration is far more diverse than the AHL molecules, which will limit the cross talk of the signal"

Overview
We have chosen to put a great deal of effort into making our project as safe as possible. This safety section of our wiki represents our thoughts and ideas, as well as throughout  assessments of the safety and security of the project. We have, in addition to assessing the safety and security, attempted to create a new safety standard in the form of a watermarking standard.
We have taken care, throughout the process of electing a project, not to create a potentially pathogenic bacteria. This made us abandon our initial project as we foresaw some issues concerning the pathogenicity of our construct.
We have blasted all genes and proteins for homologs in pathogenic bacteria, and performed a risk-assessment of each BioBrick as well as an overall assessment of the entire project.
We have taken care to uphold the laws and safety guidelines laid out by the UN as well as by the Danish Government, especially concerning assessing the risks of our project, as well as the properties of the individual parts, such as substitution of potentially pathogenic material, and the guidelines for personal safety. We have enlisted the help of our local bio-safety group , associated with the university, to help us better grasp the potential risks of our project as well as offering a lab-safety course, that all participating students passed.
Finally, to further the safety of the world at large, we have created a watermarking standard . We propose to insert watermarks into synthetically engineered parts. The watermark consists of a licence associated with the creating team, accessible from the parts-registry, containing information on how to contact the creating team, as well as all relevant information and characterizations of the parts involved.

As may have been expected there is a significant difference between the younger and older generations with respect to dealing with genetic engineering in everyday life. Generally speaking, younger participants are better informed and more prone to accepting and using genetically engineered products. Moreover, our survey clearly indicates that education and acceptance of genetic engineering correlate!
Lastly, one big point of discussion was whether or not a labeling of genetically engineered food or other products that are produced via biotechnological processes makes sense or not. The majority of interviewees come down in favor of a labeling of these products. From our point of view, an impartial education is able to take away fear of scientifically unfounded risks.
With this letter we aim to show the public attitude towards Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering and, more importantly, where we see chances and possibilities to put these topics into focus.
We have tried to contribute to public relations by organizing our own information meeting. Feel free to visit our homepage https://2012.igem.org/Team:Goettingen . Additionally, you can find out more about this year’s iGEM competition here: https://2012.igem.org/Main_Page .

Panel discussion - Glyphosat zum Salat?! - Chancen und Risiken des Herbizids
During our human practice events we realized that most people do not have enough information about the herbicide glyphosate but are very interested in getting to know more about the topic. Therefore our iGEM Team invited to a panel discussion with the topic “Glyphosate on my plate?-Chances and risks of the herbicide” on the 12th of July in the Adam-von-Trott-Saal of the old Mensa in Göttingen which had the perfect ambience to discuss this controversial topic.
Our Team after the panel discussion together with our guests.
The event started with an introduction of our project by our team member Jonas in order to inform the very diverse audience about the iGEM competition, why we are participating, about what glyphosate is, the current state of the research and of course about our project and aim to find a solution to this controversially discussed herbicide.
Afterwards Robert and Marie of our team introduced our four guests (from left to right) Horst-Henning Steinmann of the centre for Biodiversity in Göttingen, Werner Wille of the “CDU” of Göttingen, Achim Hübner of the “Landvolk Niedersachsen” and Harald Wiedemann of “die Grünen” of Göttingen.
Horst-Henning Steinmann (Center for Biodiversity, Göttingen)
Werner Wille (CDU, Göttingen)
Achim Hübner (Landvolk Niedersachsen)
Harald Wiedemann (Die Grünen, Göttingen)
The panel started the discussion about the wide application of glyphosate in the agricultural areas of and around Göttingen. Lower Saxony , which Göttingen is part of, is known as the number one state of Germanys agriculture and produces for example almost half of the total german potato yield.
Harald Wiedemann expressed his severe concerns about the biodiversity and the extinction of specific species"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.
Jiang WU
Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.
Making a plan, doing experiments and fail and planning again. Following this circle and eventually gained payback.
He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final goal"

The final product of the pathway
ATP analysis:
In our optimization of P(3HB) production module, we discovered that increasing in the PhaB expression can efficiently increase the yield of P(3HB). It’s important to see whether increase in the PhaB expression would dramatically affects the metabolic pathways or not. As ATP is the essential energy carriers in the cell, we carried a parameter scan for the variation in ATP concentration under different concentrations of PhaB.
There is an approximately 5.3% drop in the concentration of ATP when increasing the phaB concentration from 50uM to 200uM. It suggests that increasing the flux in our pathway may reduce the energy transportation in the cell. However, it’s still unsure about the effect of 5.3% drop in ATP concentration on the cell growth.
Large scale PHB production and implementation in MAPLE
In our MAPLE system, the bioplastic  P(3HB) is produced from both 3HB monomers and glucose. 3HB is the degradation product from the wasted P(3HB）plastic and glucose is the product from the degradation of mixed waste. Therefore, the overall PHB production rates need to be determined by the model.
The result shows that the PHB yield can reach 70g/L after one day with both inputs whereas about 30g/L with glucose. It proves that using"

iGEM TecMonterrey team participates in the Interlab study
""The goal of the interlab study is to obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP from iGEM teams around the world. Can you measure fluorescence somewhere in your lab? Then this is the perfect study for you! Even if your lab or the organisms you work with mean that you can’t measure GFP from the specific devices, we want every team to be able to participate: email measurement at igem dot org and we will work out an alternative.""
Section I: Provenance & Release
Eduardo Ramírez Montiel and Mercedes Vázquez Cantú were the two members in charge of the Interlab Study, and they did most of the actual work to acquire the measurements. Other people that should be credited are the remaining team members who also helped with this section. It should be noted that all persons involved consent to the inclusion of this data in publications derived from the iGEM interlab study.
The protocols began to be run on July 23th with the transformation of the biobricks. The next day a single colony from each of the selection plates was selected and inoculated in 20mL LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic. The tubes were incubated overnight at 37°C with 250rpm. Afterwards, a miniprep of the liquid cultures was performed and a glycerol stock was made.
On July 29th the restriction gels were run and all the parts purified except for the RFP. The next day another gel was made for the recuperation of RFP. On July 16th the ligations of D2-GFP, D3-GFP, D2-RFP and D3-RFP were done, and they were transformed the next day. However, no growth was observed in the selection plates. This protocol was repeated and finally on August 12th the D2-GFP ligation grew. The other ligations (D3-GFP [Amp] and D2-RFP [CAM]) were grown on September 4th. After this, the D3-GFP had to be cloned into a pSB1C3 vector but we weren’t able to do so before the deadline. Thus, a collaboration was made with the team UANL_Mty-Mexico. They gave us four D3-GFP ligations and we"

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a function of increasing cell-population density. Bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of these autoinducers and regulate the expression of LuxCDABE [4]. Consequently, we removed these regulatory proteins to ensure that cell concentration dependent luminescence through quorum sensing is surpassed and our cultures can fluoresce independently. By using a blue light repressible promoter (PBLrep) [1], we will ensure that our bulb is only active in the dark and excess buildup of substrates and luciferase, potentially toxic, will be prevented.
Blue light repression is achieved through the incorporation of a photosensitive protein (EL222) and a blue-light repressible promoter (Pblrep). PBLrep consists of the 18bp DNA binding region of EL222, a natural photosensitive DNA-binding protein from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, positioned between the -35 and -10 regions of the RNAP binding site. For blue light repression, cells must also express EL222 (BBa_K2332004). In the dark, EL222 is inactive as its N-terminal LOV domain represses its DNA-binding C-terminal HTH domain. In the daytime, exposure to blue light (465nm) results in the LOV-HTH interaction to be released, allowing it to dimerize and bind its binding region, causing steric hindrance to RNAP binding, ultimately repressing transcription. Therefore, only at nighttime the transcription of LuxCDABE will occur [1].
Figure 1: Blue light repression system. Under blue light, the EL222 DNA binding protein dimerises and binds its binding region within the designed Pblind promoter, positioned between the -35 and -10 regions of the RNAP binding site, causing steric hindrance to RNAP binding, ultimately repressing transcription of LuxCDABE. Figure adapted from Jayaraman P. et al. (2016).
Planned experiment: Cells would have been transformed with PBLrep-LuxCDABE and  EL222 (constitutively expressing EL222 protein) plasmids. Cells would have been either kept in the dark or exposed to blue light (465 nm) for 6 hours and bioluminescence levels would have been measured by aliquoting samples into a 96-well plate every 6 hours using FLUOstar plate reader.

Helped Viktor debug Resource Manager, it was giving him a ""java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException"" exception. It turns out he was encountering a ""WellOverFlowException"" which simply shows up as a InvocationTargetException on the python side. I changed it so now it prints the error message instead of giving an unambiguous exception

Friday 6/17
Aaron came over today to discuss the issues of sample naming and sample history. He raised a good question during our discussion about how to implement sample history, he asked us what are we going to be doing with the history, and is it worth the time to look in sample history implementation or is it not critical at the moment. We agreed that it should be something to do in the longer term.
Took the protocol graph annotation out of AlgorithmManager and into a separate file called ProtocolGraphAnnotator.java. I emailed this file as well as SDSTree.java which I have modified to Janoo and he got the Puppeteer output generation working on his GUI.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

Nanjing-China,2016,Team:Nanjing-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"-known to universities and scientific research institutes, it still lacks online propagation and social communities. Thus we made up plans to propagate iGEM through social activities in the community and propagations online.
 
Education
To propagate basic ideas of synthetic biology and iGEM and promote education, we opened up our lab to children from Nanjing Foreign Language Primary School on June 1st, which is the National Children’s Day. Eight third-year children came to our lab with great enthusiasm about science.
 
One of our team members, Zhen Li gave a training to the kids about the biosafety issues in the lab. He took the kids to wash their hands and wear gloves before they went into the lab. These children were very curious about the various facilities, reagents and materials in the lab and observed them very carefully. We showed some simple experiments to the kids at first, namely, the reaction between iodine and starch. The kids were very surprised that the color turned blue when iodine and starch were mixed together. We also gave the children some 10ml tubes and taught them how to use the pipette. Under our supervision, they added 1ml of NaCl to 1ml of AgNO3 and were excited about the “magic power” of the white precipitation in the tube. One girl even said that she felt as if she was a fairy. Besides, we also showed the kids the E.coli that we cultured and taught them how to use model organism to test our hypothesis. We told these passionate young scientist that science is a journey of ups and downs and the up moments really make the down moments worthwhile!
 
Considering the safety issues, we took the tubes and materials back from the children, although they seem to be fascinated about these magic “toys”. Captain Chen Chen sent the kids cards and T-shirts to them when they left our lab. The kids said that it was the first time that they get to know synthetic biology and it was very interesting. This activity is indeed a good propagation of both iGEM and synthetic biology!
 
Community Propagation
The development of new energy is always expensive and takes a long period of time, making it difficult for the public to know and support. Therefore, our team planned to attract public attention to new energy development by community propagations. We went to an activity center in a neighborhood in Henan Province and promoted knowledge about new energy development to the citizens there. We also propagated our project to them in a simple and easy-to-understand way. Besides, we appealed people to choose green energy and ultimately we got 256 signatures from people who realized how important it is"

Fudan University: We partnered up with Fudan University to complete the Interlab. Since our school’s plate reader was unable to measure fluorescence, Fudan University’s iGEM team was kind enough to let our team use their lab and borrow their plate reader. They provided us with all the necessary lab materials and instruments needed to complete the study. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation for all the members on the Fudan iGEM team for providing us assistance on the Interlab."

Coralie Viollet
I am a 5th yr undergrad student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA), in Lyon, France. I joined the iGEM INSA team to discover the emerging field of Synthtic Biology. I was mainly involved in the computer-based approach of the project. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing the piano and driving in the Renault 4L Trophy across the Moroccan desert.
Antonio Freire González
Hi everyone! I am Antonio Freire González and I come from Vigo, the most populated city in Galicia and the biggest fishing port in Europe. I am studying 5th year of Pharmacy in the University of Santiago de Compostela, famous worldwide thanks to its cathedral, where pilgrims from all around the world head to. I made a practice in Lyon this summer so I contacted the team Insa de Lyon and proposed my help for this new IGEM adventure. My passions are waking up Alberto at 6 AM and sleeping in every possible place. I also have other less important hobbies, like playing basketball or geography.

2 Goals
Medal Criteria
Gold Medal
At least two of the following goals:
✓ Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab.
The functional prototype is fully described on our Design page .
✓ Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
We significantly improved the characterization of two inducible promoters in the Registry - the pCUP1 promoter (can be found as BBa_K945002 ) and the pGAL1 promoter (can be found as BBa_J63006 ).
✓ Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We helped Team Chalmers Gothenburg model and simulate their system modules comprising a kill switch and a contaminant reporter. We also cooperated in a Multinational GMO survey .
✓ Choose one of these two options:
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
We integrated several ideas from conversations and interviews with two experts in CTC diagnosis. As recommended we tested agglutination in microfluidic chips instead of tubes. Also, as was suggested, for signalling orthogonality tests in Module 2, we used GFP as the output signal instead of agglutination to make the result more obvious. See our Project page for more details.
Silver Medal
All of the following goals:
✓ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected."
Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," think is “Well, may this little super organism can change the whole cloning workflow all around the world”!
This organism has a doubling time of under 10 minutes. It can be carried out easily in your lab work as a nonpathogenic, fast growing prokaryotic organism with a broad range of pH tolerance.
The iGEM Team Marburg wants to Establish Vibrio natriegens as a new chassis organism for synthetic biology. They designed three new strain, which make work in the lab much easier and more effective. Imagine you just need one day for a whole cloning process. If this bacterium were be establish last year, we (and we think almost every iGEM team) could achieve 3 times as much since everything works three times as fast as in Vibrio natriegens. We did the InterLab study to help them getting done with their establishment. We transformed the included devices in Vibrio natriegens and measured the growth with a plate reader. We hope they will be succsesfull and wishes them all the best.

Makerere
The iGEM Team Makerere University helped a lot by personally evaluating and discussing our project and its application in countries like Uganda. They distributed our questionnaire to people working with malaria on a daily basis. Thanks to them we got invaluable expertise and input from social workers, nurses, lab technicians and epidemiologists. In return we assisted them with the planning of their experiments concerning the expression of PETase and proposed a basic kinetic cell model for their project.

Düsseldorf
We would like to thank iGEM Team Düsseldorf for organizing the iGEM postcard exchange. This enabled us to get to know various other iGEM teams with fascinating projects via well designed cards. Moreover, we really appreciate their commitment in providing us the theoretical knowledge to work with cyanobacteria. Finally, we are grateful for kindly allocating a magnificent picture of their cyanobacteria for the use in our wiki.

In the same time we had been improving our constructs by adding the terminator to them.
Step five
Finally, in order to confirm the functionality of our construct, we intended to make series of measurements using fluorometry. We tried to transform two different strains of Bacillus subtilis: 168 and 979 and used two different transforming procedures which you can see here and here .
First of all, we tried to select our transformants on plates with LB agar with chloramphenicol. Unfortunately, after several trials we didn't received desirable colonies. Bacteria that grow on dishes with chloramphenicol do not carry our plasmid. We thought that something could be wrong with the concentration of the antibiotic, so we tried few different ones, but none worked. Then, we tried to select bacteria using neomycin resistance, since pTG626 plasmid also carries a resistance gene for this antibiotic. Unfortunately, it didn’t work either.

Measurement
General info
We designed two new RBSes for Bacillus subtilis. We managed to successfully measure one of them comparing to RBS BBa_B0034. Our measurement was performed in E. coli. Our reasults are presented below.
We also planned to measure our part in Bacillus subtilis, but unfortunately we didn't manage to successfully prepare and transform our measuring construct into that bacteria.
Sample preparation
To measure the fluorescence of samples of 3 milliliters of LB with KAN were inoculated with a colony from the plate. Cultures were vigorously shaken in 37°C overnight. The next step was to centrifuge 1,5 milliliters of liquid culture in an 1,5 ml tube. The pellet was resuspended in 200 microliters of RF. Finally, the prepared samples were placed in the fluorimeter plate. We used Corning 96 deep well plates with"

The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ubiquitous environmental pathogen that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infection. Often it is found in water, soil, skin flora, and most man-made environments. It is a frequent cause of infections such as pneumonia, swimmer’s ear, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and bacteremia. For this reason, chemiluminescence and Lux system parts have been pulled and built into mutated Escherichia coli that can detect the presence of P. aeruginosa.
P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative aerobic rod. Like others in its genus, it is a free-living bacteria. It is known, however, as a true plant pathogen and increasingly as a disease-causer in animals. This opportunistic pathogen is gaining increasing attention. It rarely infects healthy tissue, but there is little tissue it cannot infect if the host tissue is compromised. It is becoming increasingly common in severe burn patients, and patients with cancer or AIDS who are immunosuppressed. Case fatality rate in these pacients is nearing 50%.
Source: http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/pseudomonas.html
Because of the increasing severity of this pathogen, we are creating a device to detect it. We are using E. coli as the base of our machine. It detects P. aeruginosa by quorum sensing factors and reports using the gene for Green Flurorescent Protein. Ultimately, we would like to create a device that detects and measures the glow to determine, not only if P. aeruginosa is present, but also an approximation of the concentration. We would like to have a small, handheld device like the glucometer shown in the picture to the right.

1. First the site of the deletion should be defined.
2. The primers need to be designed so that the fusion point will bridge two desired sections of the gene at the matching USER linkers.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
4. To amplify the BioBricks the protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR can be used.
5. Check the PCR reaction on an agarose gel before assembly. The new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification if needed.
6. The assembly of new BioBricks should be performed according to the protocol USER cloning .
7. A BioBrick, device or new plasmid with the deletion should now have been assembled.
Adding short sequences
Short sequences such as ribosomal binding sites, kozak sequences etc. can be added by incorporating them into the primer that will be used to amplify the part it should be fused with. Introducing a short sequence can also be of interest when two proteins are wished to be connected by a linker. The linker can also carry a single point mutation, be degenerate or non-degenerate, which means that only one or both primers needs to carry the mutation.  When creating a linker a short sequence of either random or known sequence is added by incorporating the sequence into the forward or reverse primers.
Introducing a linker
1. When introducing a linker in the connection with a gene of interest (GOI), the first step is to define the mutation.
2. Primers are designed for the defined mutation site. To introduce the desired mutation one nucleotide should be changed in the primer. Four primers are used per mutation.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.

Description
Synthetic Biology and House of the future Since its creation, Igem has led to the birth of many projects. Every year, many of them could be seen as tools for everyday life in a near future. From this point of view, we imagined the “house of the future”, in which many of Igem projects have their place. It is surprising to see how many projects could be integrated in this house. To illustrate that, let us show what we imagined with some of the 2010 projects.The concept can be enlarged to other years in order to add value to all of these projects.

Safety
safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we suggest that strict rules should be made to provide independent space for programmers.
2. We take it for granted that not only safety for programmers, but the safety for intellectual property should be taken into consideration. Thus we suggest that all codes and other achievement should be granted with copyrights before sharing.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#99_-_-_TEXT.html,", so the hypothesis is that the encysted strongyles react to a signaling compound. To find possible candidates for this compound a strategy is employed in which samples of infested host tissue are run through a battery of tests, and occurence of compounds is compared to a control of healthy tissue.
In our project we hope to perform studies to locate and identify this molecule. Since deworming drugs have no effect on encysted worms and killing of the relatively few grownups would induce cyst bursting, it would be important to figure out what the signaling molecule is for further study.
Modelling
Grass Sampling
Methods for detecting a strongyle infected field do exist, but they’re both tedious and time consuming. Our aim is to build reproducible and reliable models based on real world behaviour to reduce the area needed to sample. These models are based on the location and expected movement of the strongyles once outside of the horse.
Economic Modelling
A good model is a great tool to study the simplified behaviour of a real world problem. Often it can be more practical, time- and cost efficient to study the model of the real world system. We aim to showing the economic impact of strongyles and anthelmintic resistance.
In order to truly understand the expected market, cost and reach, we are opting for a predicting market analysis.
Global Worming and Society
Integrated Human practice
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will at least will contribute to the solution, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Raising Awareness
We’re attacking several angles to raise awareness for our project.  We plan to perform a market analysis of the problem, send questionnaires out to better judge the severity of the problem and to participate in local radio shows. We’ve even been published in a local magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
As our team is partly international we will try to spread the questionnaire to other countries besides Sweden, in hope of getting results reflecting the extent of the issue of strongyles on a bigger scale.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [19]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500"

P & P: On July 31st, P&P played polymerase tag and made oobleck with the kids at GIAC. P&P interviewed Dr. L. Pierce and Dr. N. Argyres of Washington University in St. Louis in two separate interviews on 8/1 about the potential risks and regulations relevant to our project (see interview notes for specific interview contents).
Business: Members are still reaching out to potential sponsors.
August 5th to August 11th
Wet Lab: We performed colony PCR reactions on assembled pSB1C3 vectors with inserts. We ran the colony PCR products on agarose gels but got only bands of about 300 base pairs, which indicated that our biobricks had not been successfully inserted into our vectros. After some troubleshooting, we realized that the antarctic phosphatase we had been using to dephosphorylate the pSB1C3 to prevent re-ligation  was expired and likely inactive. We ordered new quick CIP.
Product Development: PD identified algorithms for stochastic simulation model, found more parameter values, and updated graphics.

CAS SynBio Conference
Check out our poster
For July 23-25, the LMU’s Center for Advanced Studies ( CAS ) organized the 2012 Synthetic Biology Conference here at the LMU Bio-Center.
In conjuncture with this conference, our team invited several teams from Germany and Europe to attend the conference, and to participate in specially organized iGEM activities. We coordinated with the CAS organizers to create a special section within the conference for iGEM participants to present posters of their work, and to receive significantly discounted admission.
The conference was an especially valuable opportunity for teams to discuss their ideas and work with experts in the syn-bio field. Jay Keasling was one of many notable speakers who took time to converse with iGEM teams. Additionally, the conference offered teams the chance to exchange information with in person, and discuss collaborations. Of course, such a meeting would not be complete without some time spent getting to know one another, and as such, we guided the group to the Einkehr zur Fürstenrieder Schwaige, a local beer garden. There we shared laughs, stories, and cheers.
The list of speakers and conference program can be found here .

DESCRIPTION
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttlevectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.
What is the context of this research?
Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 grows under the same conditions as E. coli at comparable rates, but requires no encouragement to import DNA from its environment. The only catch is that plasmids that replicate in E. coli don't also replicate in A. baylyi. We are creating plasmids that replicate in both species to harness A. baylyi for genetic engineering.
What is the significance of this project?
The experiments proposed here will show the that Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 can be transformed with foreign DNA cloned into our shuttle vectors, thus obviating the need for expensive equipment to perform a simple transformation. We plan to make our genetic tools freely accessible to modestly funded labs in community colleges, high schools and private homes. They could also be used to streamline workflows at well-funded labs.
What are the goals of the project?
We are constructing shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows rapidly under identical culture conditions"

Flower Whisper
A sunbeam slants through the window into the ward, and shines the flowers on the side table. A pale and wasted girl, staring at the vibrant dewy flowers, reflects woefully: Flowers in the vase wither soon after bloom. Diagnosed with malignant tumor,  florescence of my life passes in advance. Can I feel the happiness of being loved? In the campus of Fudan University, wandering under the gentle touch of Spring sunlight, people with their sweet smiles and curious eyes are attracted by the tender red roses swaying in the breeze. “Flower Whisper” it says, “Select a postcard, write down your concern for tumor patient sand let them be loved.”
The date is ‘May 20th’, homophonic to ‘I Love You’ in Chinese.
Students and visitors, the elders and the young, alone or in couple… Varying fonts, colorful drawing, kind encouragements, sincere wishes… hundreds of postcards, full of kindness and love.
“Thanks for your kindness! This rose is for you.” To deliver the fragrance of roses, to spread love in such a lovely day. We are iGEMers from Fudan University. These are postcards written by this gentle world of love. We hope the gift can give you strength and comforts.
2017 iGEM Fudan built a bridge between patients and the public. We collected 218 postcards and gave out 215 flowers. The postcards were arranged and handed to the patients in Shanghai Cancer Hospital.
As is reported, mental status has tremendous effects on the quality of life of patients, which may affect the outcome of medical treatment. While we designed a platform for oncotherapy trying to cure patients physiologically, their psychological health is also what we pursuit. The warm encouragements from strangers, the love of society can lift the spirits of patients.
In Chinese current social public opinions, tumor immunotherapy has been controversial since an accident caused by outdated ineffective treatment provided by unqualified hospital. We explained our project and the concept of immunotherapy to whoever wrote on the postcards. We are so proud to see the hope raising in their eyes after listening to"

Modular Terpenoid Biofactory
Ever since the potential of genetic engineering became apparent, we have seen a rise in the use of synthetic biology to develop full-fledged systems working for the very interests of mankind. The idea that a basic system could potentially be used in the production of a whole range of molecules suggests that this kind of multi-directed manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize any given product at a given time. This is when the idea of a modular biofactory comes up, and the proper strategies for its design and execution were the focus of the project.
Starting from the assumption that a synthetic biology project is founded on the design of the proper genetic construct being transformed into an organism, it follows that most of the versatility of the project rests on the proper planning strategies applied to the DNA molecule. This would allow for distinct parts of the construct to be exchanged, added, or eliminated, depending on the development and focus that is ultimately given to the entire project.
Considering restriction enzymes as the basic tool for molecular cloning, it is possible to strategically locate the proper restriction sites in a genetic construct for the entire cloning process to be optimized. The proper design can come up with a master molecule from which a great number of sequence combinations can be derived using a limited number of enzymes. If certain restriction site pairs are assigned to each specific module, it would enable the future manipulation of each of these specific parts separately in the most efficient way possible.
The ability to manipulate specific portions of the genetic constructs opens up possibilities in the project execution that allow it to be more dynamic and adaptable. When working with a synthesized construct, one of the barriers for its proper realization is the high costs of producing long nucleotide sequences by oligonucleotide synthesis. This modular design strategy, by allowing to make multiple sequence combinations of the already synthesized construct, enables to study different sequence setups without having to synthesize each specific iteration separately, thus cutting a great amount of costs from the project.
Obviously, this can and has been achieved by working with digestion and"

To test the functioning of these crRNAs, similar fluorescent assays as for testing the functioning of Cas13a were repeated for different crRNAs. The results in Figure 10 show that all tested crRNAs result in Cas13a activation as expected. However, the efficiency of binding the target differs between the crRNAs, with crRNA 3 exhibiting the best target binding.
Figure 9: crRNA production. Electrophoresis of 10% PAGE stained with SYBR Gold. A Low Range ssRNA Ladder (LRL) is used. This gel contains the different designed crRNAs synthesized by in vitro transcription with (1-5) and without hairpin (1H-5H). The presence of bands of the expected length in all lanes indicates successful crRNA production.
Figure 10: Testing the crRNAs. This graph shows the activity of Cas13a in combination with different crRNAs for the same target designed with the crRNA model. The difference in activity demonstrates the difference in efficiency of the different crRNAs.
Conclusions
Although we did not manage to create our own composite BioBrick part containing Cas13a and the spacer sequence, we were still able to to construct a BioBrick composite part comprising the spacer sequence and a constitutive promoter that can be used in combination with other BioBricks encoding for Cas13a.
Furthermore, the Cas13a obtained from Gootenberg et al. 2017 was successfully expressed and purified following the Cas13a protein purification protocol . We confirmed presence of the protein by running on SDS-PAGE . An RNase alert fluorescence assay from Gootenberg et al. 2017 was used to show the functionality of Cas13a. Additionally, the fluorescence assay enabled us to test the efficiency of different guides (different crRNAs) designed using our novel crRNA design tool .
Sample preparation - From milk to RNA
Cas13a needs an RNA target to detect. Therefore, the bacterial DNA present in a milk sample first needs to be isolated, amplified and transcribed to RNA. DNA can be isolated by either boiling the cells or by the use of a microwave described by Dashti et al. 2009 . We decided to try out both with consecutive amplification and transcription. This included testing the sensitivity of our methods and testing the target in a cleavage assay using Cas13a."

Simultaneous expression of the LacI cassette and the integrase from a single promoter would ensure repression of Ribo key from the LacI promoter and therefore results in a controlled expression of both PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrase (Isaac et al. 2004).
Inducible Integrase and Recombination Directionality factor expressing constructs:
Inducible PhiC31 and Bxb1 Integrase and Reverse Directionality factor expressing constructs were also designed via the use of riboregulators. As mentioned in section above, controlled expression of  integrase would be achieved via a cis-repressor Ribo Lock and a trans-activating Ribo Key. The design of these constructs required the gene for RDF to be cloned under the control of a LacI promoter (BBa_R0011) with a Ribo lock cloned directly upstream (5’ UTR). For simultaneous expression of both integrase and RDF, the inducible integrase-expressing construct described above was modified to also contain RDF under inducible conditions (Isaac et al. 2004).
Figure 1. (A.) Inducible PhiC31 and Bxb1 Integrase-expressing construct: The gene for each integrase is placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter (J23119) with a Ribo “lock” directly upstream. The trans-activating Ribo “key” is placed downstream under the control of a PLlac 0-1 promoter. The lacI cassette is also placed under the control of promoter J23119. (B.) Inducible PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrase and recombination directionality factor-expressing construct: The genes for the integrase and the RDF were placed directly downstream from their corresponding ribo “lock” with the integrase under the control of a strong constitutive promoter and the RDF under the control of a PLlac 0-1 promoter. The lacI cassette (BBa_Q04121) was placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter (J23119).
2. Modelling Collaboration with uOttawa iGEM
We constructed a differential equations model to describe uOttawa’s feed-forward fold-change detection system and implemented it in MATLAB. Parameterization and analysis of the model was performed by uOttawa.
Accomplishments
This year Waterloo iGEM developed a comprehensive project, which attempts to improve an existing system that utilizes the use of DNA as the intracellular molecule for messaging between individual bacterial populations."
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Interestingly, younger students had less fear of Synthetic Biology and GMOs than older students. We believe that media plays a crucial role in the assessment of GMOs since older students had more concerns. Fortunately, we could eliminate such fear by e.g. explaining GMOs and educating them about safety instructions every scientist has to consider.
We handed out a survey to validate the impact of our presentation and discussion on the pupils. In this survey we asked about the understanding of and feelings towards Synthetic Biology before and after our talk. This survey revealed that the majority of the audience neither heard of Synthetic Biology nor iGEM but is open to get more information. This made us happy because this means that they are generally willing to expanding their horizons. To our pleasure, we got very positive feedback on our talk and the topics we introduced them to. Some of the students got interested in starting a career in science and many students are now open towards GMOs and Synthetic Biology. Our goal after organizing this event was to bypass the gap between the public and scientists and to show them, what Synthetic Biology exactly is about and which safety aspects every scientist has to follow. The students’ feedback revealed that we outreached these expectations and showed them that science and Synthetic Biology is not dangerous but opens the door to a very broad field of possibilities and applications to heal cancer, develop new drugs and understand how life is functioning.
March for Science — Frankfurt, Germany
We participated in the March of Science not only because of our affiliation with iGEM but also as individuals standing for freedom in science and research in Frankfurt this year.
Origin of the March of Science
The March for Science is a protest march started in 2017 in Washington D.C. against the suppression of science and research. When governments start ignoring fundamental problems like climate change and exclude scientific advice in general from political decisions, it becomes a slippery slope towards silencing science. The consequences are distrust towards scientific research and progress, simply because of the inconveniences meaningful and verified results create. More than one million people participated in the first march 2017 that took place in cities all over the world.
Why we need Freedom as Scientist
This year the march was conducted again after the huge resonance in 2017. This time with more than 70 events all over the world. The intention of the march is to point out the suppression of science and their representatives by governments in many countries to stop the divergence between sciences and society. Science needs to be unrestricted by governmental despotism in order to maintain its critical and objective standpoint.
Only free scientists are able to question the issues of our world and advance towards new and"

4. Method:
4.1 Sequencing
We designed the 5’-agatcgggctcgccacttcg-3’ as the reverse primer to sequence the promoters. And Tsing Ke Biology Technology Company helped us synthetize the primer and sequence those plasmids.
Analyzed the sample pCusC’s sequencing result, we found that the T7 promoter has not be digested , there is no pCusC in the plasmid, but mRFP has successful ligated. So the red color we observed was the red fluorescent protein expressed by the T7 promoter. Therefore, in the subsequent promoter test, we abandoned the pCusC samples.
In the PpcoA samples we successfully found PpcoA and mRFP. However, at the end of PpcoA's sequencing result, there is more 6bp than HUST’s sequence. We took PpcoA promoter to detection.
4.2 Promoter test
a. Add 2mL LB culture medium, 2uL Kanamycin (50mg/L) and 20uL bacterial samples to a 5mL centrifuge tube. Shaken overnight in the 37°C shaking incubator and set the rotational speed at 180 rpm/min.
b. Add CuSO4 solution to induce in concentration of 0, 0.02, 0.1 and 1mM. Set three copies for each concentration as repetitions. Cultivate in the 37°C shaking incubator at the rotational speed of 180 rpm/min for 4 hours.
c. Add 200uL bacterial samples from each centrifuge tube to the 96-well plate. Set two copies for each centrifuge tub as repetitions. Meanwhile, add LB culture medium containing and not containing 1.0mM CuSO4 as blank controls.
d. Read the OD600 and fluorescent intensity (with the emission wavelength at 607nM and excitation wavelength at 584nM) using a multifunctional microplate reader.
e. Divided the fluorescent intensity result using the value of OD600. Record the data for compare and analysis.

ABSTRACT
In a parallel galaxy, there are two brothers named T1R2 and T1R3, they living in a galaxy that is under the threaten of sweet monsters who want to rule the galaxy. Though the brothers were born with the ability to eat these monsters, they are too weak to fight with so many enemies. So they ask battle masters who lives in planet JB486 for help, they send their gene to a battle king SC84117 in the meantime. After gene adoption, SC84117 got brothers’ ability and transforms into a spaceship which not only a battle king but can also eat sweet monsters, known as the Sugar Hunter. Since then, he travels all around the galaxy to fight sweet monsters and measure them, the galaxy stays peacefully ever after.

When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.

A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with"

During one of the courses our team participated in during our second year of the bachelor, our current advisors introduced us to the iGEM competition. From this moment on they helped us with brainstorming about a suitable topic, advising us how to set up a research properly, and answering all our questions, sometimes with more questions. We are really grateful for all the time and faith they have put in our team! Please find a short profile for each of our advisors below .
prof.dr.ir. L. (Luc) Brunsveld
Prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld is a professor at our university. During our bachelor, all our team members have attended his courses, mainly concerning chemical biology, like Biochemistry or Molecular Cell Biology. Now he also advises us during our iGEM project, which we are more than happy with! For a more extensive biography, click on the arrow:
Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann. From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

I.journal club
Chen Wuyang, who talked firstly, introduced a kind of marine photosynthetic bacterium Rhodulum sulfidophilum which can produces extracellular nucleic acids. These were found to be produced concomitantly with cell growth. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon had not been figured out, instead, someone hypothesised that it is the process of lysis of a subfraction of cells that makes this happen. After that, the speaker addressed that using engineered plasmids and the bacterium can make the production of extracellular nucleic acid under control which had been proved by anther paper.
After that Zheng Xuexuan gave us a presentation about nanorobot. This autonomous DNA nanorobot was controlled by an aptamer-encoded logic gate, enabling it show different function in different cues. What’s more this kind of device can be loaded with a variety of materials in a highly organized fashion.
II.Introduction of SELEX
We invited Chen Liang, a graduate student, to refer us some knowledge about SELEX( Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment).In sum, he talked about the definition about this technology and the main round of this method. Additionally, some examples also were taken so that we can comprehend in a deeper degree.
III.Discussion about the probability of the SNS the program someone raised in the previous meeting and proposed more questions remaining fixed.

Thus, I tried a controlled reaction, cutting with different combinations of enzymes that would still produce an expected insert.  With the TetR part, C0040, I cut at E and S.

8/11:  The gel of the control reaction showed only single bands for the reporter parts.  It confirms that the plasmids I currently have are incorrect as they don't contain the insert.  Thus, I am going to start from scratch and use a two different methods of combinations to create the construct.  I will try the original method I used first, which is to combine the fluorescent protein with the Terminator first.  The other method is to combine the fluorescent protein to an RBS first (see diagram). Thus today, I will be setting up a restriction digest of RFP, GFP, and BFP cut for both methods.  In terms of my TetR gene, C0040, it seems like there is also only one band showing and no insert.  I will try the RD again, but using a larger amount of ng of DNA.

Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#project overview#project_-_-_TEXT.html," localized in the cell wall (Figure 1A), because of steric hindrance. By contrast, our “PepTag” has, compared to an antibody, the advantage that it is small and thereby can bind to a cell wall protein even if it is masked by other cell wall structures like glycoproteins (Figure 1B).
Figure 1| Schematic comparison of antibody and PepTag in the attempt to bind to a surface molecule. In part A and B from bottom to top of the zoomed-in section, the details are as follow. The Plasma Membrane is on the bottom. On top of it, the cell wall components: the β-1-3 glucan strains in light blue, chitin in purple, the β-1-6 glucan layer in grey, the glycoproteins (like mannoproteins) as red spirals and finally both the plasma membrane proteins and the cell wall proteins can be seen in different shades of green. Part A illustrates an antibody trying to bind, however the presence of the glycoproteins generate a steric impediment for such interaction to occur. Figure B shows how a small peptide attached to a scaffold protein can actually pass in between the glycoproteins and bind successfully to its target cell wall protein. Upon this positive interaction, different applications result evident, in this case the binding of an “Immune System Activator” (e.g. sorts of sugar or a chemical compound) molecule is depicted in orange, which would result in the tagging of a specific fungal strain so as to activate the natural immune system response.

Description
When we made the draft plan about our project, we noticed that NCTU_Formosa 2010’s project made use of Cry11Aa gene. And they constructed the related part BBa_K332011. In their project, they transformed the Cry11Aa gene into E. coli to kill the larvae of mosquitoes. Considering the potential safety problem, using E. coli in the natural environment is not a good idea. Therefore, we decided to use Chlamydomonas reinhardti to express toxin genes such as Cry11Aa. Firstly, we wanted to ask them to send this part to us. And we can transform it to Chlamydomonas reinhardti to test our idea. But we noticed that the codon bias of Chlamydomonas reinhardti was significantly different from that of E. coli. At last, we decided to synthesize the codon-optimized DNA sequence to replace it. We have mentioned in the wiki that we co-expressed Cry and Cyt by 2A-peptide system. So we submit the codon-optimized Cry11Aa with 2A peptide part BBa_K2074023. Users can link the other genes by infusion technology. Based on the result of SWISS-Model, 2A peptide residues will mot affect the function of toxins.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," filter's costs should be kept as low as possible, the usage of ordinary lab measurement tools is limited. Looking one step ahead it is conceivable to use a moss-filter in order to clean ponds or streams etc. Places that are not continuously supervised by humans. So our aim was to engineer a low cost and low energy solution, that maintain the filters autonomy.
Figure 22: Idea for a measuring device
This is where Arduino comes into play. Arduino is a platform that is based on one microcontroller which is attached to a circuit board. Its convenient handling and easy programming,  the lots of available hardware and the great community support make it one of the most popular prototyping platforms these days, especially for multidisciplinary applications. Among its many fans it already enjoys cult status. We first used the Arduino Uno. It is the most commonly used board. The first revision was released in September 2010.  Designed for beginners, it gave us an easy start into the handling, since none of us had any experience working with microcontrollers. Most libraries already worked out of the box and all shields and sensors we ordered came with an example code.  But the Arduino Uno came to it's limits, when we tried to get a display, WiFi and several sensors working.
Therefore we ordered the Arduino Due, which is the most powerful Arduino board at the moment. It has 16 times more flash memory (code storage) than the Arduino Uno and its clock runs 5 times faster. Instead of 2KB SRAM there are 96KB.  At least there are a lot more free pins that can be used for sensors etc, and still its costs don't exceed 50€ (~60$).
We installed a solar powered Arduino on one edge of our remediation raft in order to monitor the setting. A temperature and a light sensor collect weather data and a water sensor attached to the side of the raft registers, if the raft's tubes take on water and whether it lowers its height on the surface. For testing purposes we even attached a display to the microcontroller. All collected data are sent via WiFi and stored at a server's MySQL database in real time. Alternatively the data can also be sent via GSM if there is no WiFi hotspot close by. All data can then easily be displayed.

Figure 23: How it works
The controller can easily be extended by other sensors, such as a color sensor to monitor the moss's health or a potential die off, a pH-Sensor or even a webcam.
