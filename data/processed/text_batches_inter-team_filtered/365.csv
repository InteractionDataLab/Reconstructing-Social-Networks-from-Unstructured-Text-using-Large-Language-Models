Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html,"oshaga o Director of Information: Sid S. o Knights of Saint Patrick: Christopher Massie Adi – Meeting with Dr. Amos Monday at 8 am. We’re not looking at funding, but using facilities instead. Website new, Alex has been sent designs from past years and he is now requesting filler data and specifics on what we want included on the website. Everyone should write a short bio and find a picture to send to Asha. Asha will compile these and the meeting minutes to send this to Adi and Alex. Send these by Friday. We actually did have a website in 2010, so that will be consulted. For entrepreneurship, we need to find a faculty advisor. Bob emailed Rao’s contact, but she never followed up. Angela will contact her professor who is interested in bioethics. We also need to register for the entrepreneurship competition in the same way that we applied to the normal iGEM competition. Apply without the membership code and Courtney will approve of us later. Divya – practice time for undergrad research symposium will be on Tuesday. Uros, Angela, and Divya will be presenting. The symposium is on April 11, from 9-3/4. It is an hour poster presentation. We are now registered for quad day. Bob – Has created an entirely new page to start the website from scratch. Angela – For the next advisor’s meeting we are meeting Dr. Gene Robison in the first floor of the gatehouse. From 3-5. Dress casually, but not sloppy. At the end of the meeting if time permits, Courtney will discuss how to keep a standard lab notebook for us. April 28th is the chemistry outreach demos that Courtney is doing. The demos will be for high schoolers. Example demos are the vomiting pumpkin (elephants toothpaste) and the exploding gummibear. We will be going to Rantoul for this, but transportation is providing. Ideas for demos: color changing solutions, liquid nitrogen/soap/water, make a pickle battery, fire in a pumpkin. Cara will contact Dr. Ray of Chem 104 for demo ideas and protocols. Concrete times and a date for practice will be announced at the next advisor’s meeting. Entrepreneurship and human practices needs to draft a proposal. These proposals will get presented to the advisors on April 24th. On April 22nd we will practice these presentations.

Toronto,2015,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," mind that the more ambitious your build becomes, the fewer colonies you will get. In these situations you may want to consider using a high-efficiency transformation protocol.
Miniprep Analysis: The number of minipreps that are required to identify correct constructions will depend upon the number of parts used in the assembly (accuracy drops fractionally with the number of parts added). At Synbiota, we can generally achieve >80% accuracy with an 8-part assembly (including Anchor + Cap). For assemblies up to 8 parts, plan on doing 4-6 minipreps to be on the safe side.
The final construct will contain BsaI sites within the Anchor and Cap parts that will precisely excise the circuit at X’ or Z’ ends that begin the circuit and the X or Z ends that complete the circuit. Cutting 100-200 ng of miniprep DNA will therefore result in a fragment that corresponds exactly to the size predicted by your design, and a fragment that corresponds to the plasmid backbone that will range in size from 2.2-2.5 kb, depending the Anchors and Caps chosen for the assembly. Include an uncut control lane on the gel to be sure the enzyme has cut efficiently and to avoid confusion in interpreting band identities.
DNA Sequencing: Parts produced by PCR from the high-fidelity thermostable polymerases Phusion and Pfu, introduce errors at a frequency that is less, but close to physiological (Phusion: ~5x10-7 Pfu: ~1x10-6), therefore circuit errors that are contained within parts that have been derived by PCR will be extremely rare. For parts that have been chemically synthesized, the error frequency is considerably higher (~1x10-3) but since the total amount of synthetic DNA used in any given assembly is small, the likely hood of achieving an error-free construct is high. Nonetheless prudent researchers will always determine the DNA sequence of a circuit design either before functional testing or after discovering that something about the design is not working.
Complete sequence coverage of parts or circuits that are <1000 bp can typically be achieved using the BBa RFC-10 forward primer, BBa_G00100 (5’- tgccacctgacgtctaagaa) and its reverse counterpart, BBa_G00101 (5’- attaccgcctttgagtgagc).
The forward primer is located in all of the Cap parts provided, and is situated 184 bp upstream of the BsaI site. The reverse primer is only present in the high-copy Anchors, and is situated"

Zhao Yaran
Aha, this is Zhao Yaran,the team leader of 2015 SCUT-China. As to me, synthetic biology is magical, so I took part in iGEM when my researching journey was begaining and this is my second time to join it. I'm very pleasure to complete our project with a group of great men. We worked hard to the same goal, with joy and tear.That's a nice trip I would never forget. Last, hope veryone leads a way to dream.We are family. I am the guy who is mainly responsible for detecting the concentration of cGMP.
Mo Zongchao
I am a sophomore undergraduate interested in living in a world full of books and movies in the countryside with my grandparents, and with the pomegranate I planted when I was 12 years old. And I have great passion for biology, law and economics that accompany me on a trip to the exploration of the fantastic world. In addition, I am quite known to my friends that I am an amateurish director in making short films recording the happy hours with my family and friends. The part of the project I am excited about is the cell culture and cell growth that I endeavor to.
Wu Fengyi
Wu Fengyi is a junior student from biotechnology. What made her be a iGEMer?What she likes is to do experiments. Her classmates have been joined this competition before and she got many interesting things from them.During summer vocation, she had chance to learn something about scientific research, at the same time, she found that biology is fantastic and attractive. She is a member of the experimental group. She was responsible for quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction. She is gentle and quiet. In addition to learning, she has a few hobbies. Running, reading, planting or just listening to the music. The nature is her big friend, she like to see the blue sky or star-filled sky quietly. She can enjoy communicating with the flowers, the birds. Her idol is Li Jian, who has a good reputation in music.He moves his fans with his handsome look, profound knowledge,"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html," including the negative control, killed all of the Varroa mites. An alternative would be to use an assay where we dip honeybee larvae in protein extracts from the strains; a Varroa mite which feeds on the larvae should then ingest any toxins. Unfortunately, Varroa mites tend to share feeding sites and use them repeatedly 16 , which means that not all mites would consume the protein extract.
A sample-size calculation 17 was performed in R with the following code to assess the feasibility of such an assay.
> p=0.66
> p0=0.5
> alpha=0.05
> beta=0.1
> (n=p*(1-p)*((qnorm(1-alpha)+qnorm(1-beta))/(p-p0))^2)
Here, p is the alternative hypothesis, p0 the null hypothesis, alpha the type I error and beta the type II error. The values of these variables were based on the following assumptions:
The null hypothesis is 50% mite mortality. Natural mite mortality is very high in the laboratory.
Linea Muhsal estimated during feeding experiments that 3 out of 18 mites ingested the fluorophores she had dipped honeybee larvae in.
If an effective Cry toxin is ingested, we expect to see 100% mite mortality. This is an optimistic assumption.
16% of mites eat a toxin which causes 100% mite mortality, so if there is a toxin, we should see 66% mite mortality.
With these assumptions, a sample size of 75 was calculated. We were generally able to gather a maximum of 40 mites per week. Gathering enough mites to test all our samples was unfeasible. Therefore, pursuit of this type of toxicity assay was cancelled in favour of further development of an in vitro assay.
16s rRNA sequencing and SDS-PAGE results
We sequenced the 16s rRNA for all five isolates with Bacillus-like morphology. A search of NCBI’s 16S ribosomal RNA sequences database resulted in the following alignments, each with approximately 99% identity of their best match. The isolates and their matches are displayed in Table 1.

Figure 2. Invertible promoter switch test construct (PB state): The figure above shows the test constructs made for the PhiC31 and Bxb 1 invertible promoter switches in their PB state. The gene for GFP (with its ORF in a reverse orientation) was cloned downstream of each promoter switch. The gene for RFP was cloned upstream of each promoter switch. The invertible promoter switch is flanked by attP and attB sites (as represented by the triangles). The promoter within each promoter switch would drive the expression of GFP in the PB state. Test constructs for all Invertible promoter switches are flanked with iGEM Prefix and Suffix (as indicated by the box labeled “P” and “S”).
2b. Multi-copy Non-inducible Integrase-expressing constructs:
Two constructs for the constitutive expression of PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrases respectively, were assembled via Standard Assembly (Parts Registry Assembly Protocol). Genes encoding the PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrases (BBa_K1039012 and BBa_K1039003) were separately cloned downstream of a constitutive promoter and its corresponding ribosome binding site (K608002) in pSB1C3 (Parts Registry Standard vector) (Fig. 2). Each test construct is flanked by the standard iGEM suffix and prefix. The multi-test non-inducible integrase-expressing constructs include the following:
1)  Bba_K1039030: PhiC31 integrase-expressing construct with a Promoter and RBS
2)  Bba_K1039029: Bxb1 integrase-expressing construct with a promoter and RBS.
2c. Multi-copy Non-inducible Integrase and Recombination directionality factor- expressing constructs: Constructs were assembled to allow constitutive expression of both integrase and recombination directionality factor simultaneously from a single promoter. This construct was assembled via Standard Assembly (Parts Registry Assembly Protocol) for both PhiC31 and Bxb1 integrases/RDFs respectively (Fig. 2). Each construct is flanked by the standard iGEM suffix and prefix. The multi-test non-inducible integrase and RDF producing constructs include:
Bba_K1039014: PhiC31 integrase and RDF expressing construct from a single promoter
Bba_K1039007: Bxb1 integrase and RDF expressing construct from a single promoter.

Problem: Film cannot be copied. We have to be careful not to get light on film after taking a picture. It is not a matter of sensing but processing images in brain. Therefore, we are not sure of the feasibility.
Idea 6
Copyteria; we make a bacterium that copies. We put dye or degrader in e.coli. It would be important to design a threshold. We have to make bacteria to be alive during the coping process and lose its color after the coping process. So we are making bacteria ink.
Problem: we don't know the threshold, and, even if it works, Copyteria have to perform in a dark room. Since the idea is to get an image from a reflected image, we don't know how this reflected image would be copied: too many unknown variables.

Brain storming.
Idea 1
Leeches prevent blood to from coagulating. There is already a product derived from vampire bat. If we use similar system to make anti-coagulant using bacteria, it may solve localization problems related with conventional anti-coagulants.
Idea 2
Using bacteria, we could make a carrier that has chemicals that can cure cancer with targeting-capability.
Idea 3
Using magnetosome, we could make a system that can detect magnetic field just like other iGEM teams made product that detect toxicity.
Problem: It would be reacting passively to the magnetic field, so it is not appropriate for detection.
Idea 4
We want to make an oscillator. There is a memory network used in remembering. We can combine it with telomere. We can manipulate time using this protocol.
Idea 5
Using vibration, maybe we can make bacteria that make sound.
Idea 6
If we can make a NAND gate, we can make a calculator. Maybe we can make a compare system. We can use this for comparing concentration difference, and we may use it in a cell system that we will build.
Idea 7
We can put antigen in mosquitoes’ saliva, and the mosquitoes would naturally put antigens in people to build them immunity against malaria. Since malaria mosquitoes are active only during night, we can use mosquitoes that are active during day.
Problem: It could make a problem if mosquitoes accidently inject too much antigens?
Idea 8
In case of DDS, packing is the problem. And we can use vesicle system for packing.
Idea 9
Using Na+ pump, we can"

At each single conjugation event, with the expression relaxase, the corresponding tandem oriT pair is lost with the rolling-circle replication. Sequential conjugation and deletion of the different oriT pairs can be achieved by fine control of relaxase expression. To report the ending of tandem conjugation process, a reporter gene is attached after the last oriT pair, and hence expresses after all conjugation events happened.The resulting tandem signaling conjugation process will allow them to develop networks of bacteria capable of sequentially assembling tasks.
The riboregulator system was incorporated in Into their circuit to provide  an interface for interaction between their conjugation system and general genetic devices  to realize the goal of assembly line. According to the data that they measured, they concluded that  the open ratios of Key1 -Lock1 and Key 2-Lock1, the open ratio of key1-Lock1 was 3.3 times higher than  Key2-Lock1.

Overview
Modern ""lithography"" has made images vividly printed on pages and animations vigorously projected on screens.
From that point, we move a step forward. Our project aims at conceiving and constructing a colorful bio-imaging system, on which once you project an image, ideally, the bio-system would exactly print it out on the substrate.
To accomplish this, novel bio-bricks(light sensors & color printers), Caulobacter crescentus(a sticky bacteria)and riboswitches were utilized to conceptually render it colorful,clear and compact. The results did prove this idea sound in principle, although further evaluation is required.
We have managed to build light sensing circuits of three color and a motion control device in C.crescentus. furthermore, RNA logical gates were built in vivo as substitutes for certain parts with hopefully unprecedented effectiveness.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Project#Future#Scaffold_-_-_TEXT.html," was designed with the idea of serving as a platform for an enzyme conveyor belt. The array of enzymatic pathways which could be enhanced by a scaffold are numerous, though, we projected to increase efficiency and production of a resveratrol derivative called piceatannol.
The project consists of a couple parts, each a proof of concept and build-up of previous ones. The start of the project consisted of designing an RNA scaffold which is best tailored to PUF binding in a spatially specific manner. Once the scaffold was designed, synthesized, and purified it was important to show not only that PUF can bind specifically to its designated sites, but that the scaffold can support a concept such as a biological conveyor belt.
One assay which was designed to prove this was incubation of the RNA scaffold with non-specific endonucleases bound to PUF. The length of digested RNA parts would prove that PUF was binding specifically and appropriately to the designated sequences. Another assay would include tethering a split-fluorescent protein to wild-type and mutant PUF. An in-vitro gel-shift assay, or EMSA, would once again prove that PUF is binding the the appropriate sites. More importantly, an in-vivo experiment which shows fluorescence with presence of the scaffold and darkness without the scaffold would prove efficient enzymatic pathways could be achieved.
RNA Scaffold Design
Fig. 1.[1] The design of our RNA scaffold was based upon a scaffold created by the Pam Silver research lab at Harvard. This group was the only one to develop such a construct (pictured above) and prove its effectiveness so it was built upon in order to serve as the application for our own RNA binding proteins.
The d0 scaffold which is shown above has two hairpin loops with binding sites for two distinct RNA binding proteins, MS2 and PP7. Although the Silver group developed even more complicated scaffolds, we decided to work with the simplest (d0) as a way to prove not only that PUF can bind specifically, but that the scaffold can be used for efficient production of compounds in bacterial cells.
Fig. 2. The sequence in Fig. 2 is the DNA sequence coding for the d0 scaffold. The first highlighted potion is the T7 promoter followed by the MS2 binding site. The next highlighted region shows the PP7 binding site followed by the T7 terminator.

BV2 infection Cytokines Inhibition
BV2 infection by Lentivirus
Title: Lentivirus infection of BV2 microglia cells.
Conducted by: Einan Farhi, Ori Tulchinsky, Liat Tsoran and Mor Pasi
Date:  30.8.18, 15.9.18
Aim: The objective is to create a stable line of BV2 microglia cells with a genomic insertion of the shIKKb vector or a stable line with the IkBM vector.
Importance: The insertion of the IκBαM or ShIKK vectors will cause knockdown to the IKKB regulation factor in the NFκB pathway. We aim to demonstrate how targeting the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway will diminish the amount of inflammation promoting cytokines produced by the immune representative cells of the brain, microglia.
Procedure:
Production of viral vector using co-transfection of HEK293T cell line with vector and accompanying plasmids.
Infection of cells by spinfection method
Validation of infection success according to expression of GFP.
Selection for infected cells using puromycin. *
*Only for ShIKKb vector, as IkBM does not contain puromycin resistance gene.
Design:
Experiment 1: BV2 spinfection with 400 µl IκBαM viral medium.

Northwestern,2014,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," surveys that we handed out to CTD students the day before.
7/17 We reached out to UChicago informing them that we can provide them with some E. coli strains. We did extensive research on RBS of the non model organisms we are experimenting out. We also ordered a gBlock but it had some issues so we decided to fix it the following day.
7/18 We started to make a growth curve of strep, which was proving to be complicated as the OD kept on oscillating. We also revised our gBlock and finally ordered it to IDT. For the meeting with our professors on Monday, we prepared a powerpoint of what we’ve done this past week and questions we have. Lastly, we continued researching on RBS’s.
Week 6
7/16 In the morning, we attended a seminar about biotechnology and liver metabolism by Dr. Jamey Young. We ordered the RBSs and promoters and we autoclaved flasks, solutions, etc. We finished and submitted the safety form that was due and we made a growth curve for Strep and Pseudomonas.
7/17 Adam grew/plated backbone for miniprep, while David and Tiffany made a growth curve for Pseudomonas. Kristi and Abdullah grew E. coli strains for lysates and Mitch and Sharon worked on a growth curve for Strep. David and Kristi also made YTPG. We also made additional LB and had a meeting with the professors, who gave us tips on how to go about making a survey and test promoters.
Week 7
7/23 Adam grew a specific colony for miniprep, whereas Abdullah and Mitch miniprepped plasmid. Sharon did a cell-free protein synthesis and met with Jian to talk more about strep and what to keep in mind when experimenting with it. Sharon and Mitch checked OD of strep by vortexing at different temperatures, with the advice of Will. Kristi, Tiffany, and David harvested E. coli cells. We also responded to UChicago and WashU’s iGEM teams who were interested in collaborating with us. Lastly, Mitch and Abdullah got some water from a pond in the hope that we could culture a few environmental strains for sequencing in the future.
7/24 Adam miniprepped the backbone and worked with Kristi to compile a list of oligos in a spreadsheet for Will. Abdullah and Mitch harvested Pseudomonas while David and Kristi did PCR practice on old dNTPs. David and Tiffany lysed the E. coli and Sharon measured the biomass of strep throughout the day."

I can imagine it would be fun if we have a more complicated topography, like a module of design, maybe build a logic gate or switch, and ask them to draw out what they get and predict what will happen, but it would be a very intellectual activity.”
“In the future, I think focusing on easier activities (e.g. the LEGO genes and circuits weren’t easy to explain in simple terms) would result in a more positive experience. I also think the event would benefit from more variance in activities between middle school and high school students.”

Raising Awareness: Engaging with the “Focusing on the Future” Event
The School of Education at our college runs an annual career fair called Focusing on the Future for middle school students who are interested in careers in STEM. After connecting with Dr. Kim, the director of pre-collegiate programs in the Center for Gifted Education, invited members of our team to give a presentation at this event.
We prepared a short presentation about synthetic biology and how to get ready for a career in science. We also prepared a hands-on recombinant DNA activity for the students to have them think about synthetic biology. The activity can be found in our high school activity booklet .
While we had fun at the event, we were expecting an audience of 8th graders and parents, so we planned with that audience in mind. The audience ended up being mostly 7th and 8th graders and there were no parents. The students all seemed to have varying levels of biology background, as well, so both the presentation and activity were too difficult for some of the students present. If we were to do this event a second time, we would choose an activity that could have been more accessible to a wider audience.

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modules#In vivo_-_-_TEXT.html," is composed of these two bio-bricks, it is called BBa_M30109.
The experimental strategy used consisted in the extraction of the aforementioned biobricks from the iGEM DNA distribution.
RESULTS
Even it was tried to get BBa_M30109 in the first place and then BBa_K098010 and BBa_I15010 from iGEM kit plate, we could not get those bio-bricks due to issues with DNA submission from iGEM kit plate.
Emission module: LuxAB luciferase from vibrio fischeri plus YFP protein
OBJECTIVES
The final aim was the construction of the blue light emission bacterial luciferase (LuxAB)from Vibrio fischeri.
The structure of the device was designed as follows:
Design LuxY biobrick, send to synthesize and transfer the construction from Mr. Gene plasmid to pSB1C3 DNA submission backbone.
To test that the device works as expected.
Luciferase coded by luxA and luxB needs a substrate (an aldehyde synthesized by enzymes into the lux operon), in the project it was decided to add the aldehyde to the reaction in an exogenous way. So the biobrick to synthesize  the aldehyde was not designed.
METHODOLOGY
The lux operon
Vibrio fischeri’s lux operon is composed of several genes, all of them involved in bioluminescence and its regulation. This is the structure of Vibrio fischeri’s lux operon:
As it is shown in the diagram luxA and luxB genes, those coding for the luciferase, are placed together into the operon so the strategy was amplify them by means of PCR and then ligate PCR product with a strong constitutive promoter; the exogenously aldehyde added to the strain containing luxAB genes would be enough to trigger the luminescence reaction.
In the first place, we decided to purify genomic DNA from Vibrio fischeri strain MJ11 and then make a PCR with the following primers designed to extract luxAB region:
Forward primer:Standard iGEM prefix+RBS+Coding Region
CGG AAT TCG CGG CCG CTT CTAG   AGGA   A ACA GCT ATG AAG TTT GGA AAT ATT TGT TTT TCG TAT CAA CC
Reverse primer: Standard iGEM suffix+Coding Region

SCREENING 1 - Ojective: check the presence of non-ligated plasmids. We planned not to digest with standard enzymes because the resulting fragments would result either too small or too big. Insert excision would generate a possible 129pb fragment, while vector linearization would generate possible 3Kb or 5Kb fragments. We used ApE to decide the best enzymes to cut. Digestion with XhoI-PstI (6 ul of DNA, final volume 20ul). There are two XhoI restriction sites on pSB1AK3 plasmid: after the cut, we expected two fragments of the same size (~1.1Kbp) and one fragment of ~3Kbp for B3 positive clones (in negative clones the heaviest band would be ~1.4Kbp), while we expected the same two fragments of ~1.1Kbp and a heavier fragment of ~2.5Kbp for B4 positive clones (in negative clones the heaviest band would be ~1.4Kbp).
B3 and B4 digested samples (XhoI-PstI).
Gel results:
Only B3-1 and B3-5 showed the bands with expected length for the correct plasmid.
All B4 samples showed the bands with expected lengths!
SCREENING 2 - Ojective: check the presence of the right insert length for B3 samples, because there was the possibility that B1 vector (pSB1A2) ligated in B0015 vector (pSB1AK3) as an insert. If so, no XbaI site is present in the final plasmid, while correct ligations should show a ~1900bp fragment as an insert. Digestion with XbaI-PstI (2 ul of DNA, final volume 20ul). We decided to perform the reaction for all B3 samples, even if only two were good.
B3 digesed XbaI-PstI.
Gel results: B3-1 and B3-5 showed the expected bands for pSB1AK3 (~3200 bp) and B1-B0015 ligated insert (~1900bp).
We sent the following purified DNA samples to BMR Genomics for sequencing:
B3-1
B3-5
B4-2
B4-4
We planned not to perform ligations this week and to wait for BMR Genomics sequencing results, in order to be sure of what we were assembling"

Conclusion
Last year, Imperial college iGEM team has done a water report describing the details of global water stress problem. There is no ‘creation’ of ‘new’ water on the planet. (NEP, 2008) The difficulties we face right now is the recycling and renewing ability of natural water body and human recycling cannot compete with continues water demand of human activities.
In a narrow sense, the profit should be the main focus for an industry. However, water industry is the most basic key part of human life and its development should not limited by low profit temporary. Comparing to brackish water, developing seawater desalination will help ease the water stress for much longer time and with less concern.
Overall, we explain the significance of seawater desalination and how we will be involved in this big picture.

May
Week 1 (1st of May - 7th of May)
Getting started, learning how a MacBook works, proposal writing. Doing some course in the mornings as well.
Week 2 (8th of May - 14th of May)
Moved to iGEM Headquarters in the Helix building. Obtained a desk with window view and a PC with a shitty but understandable Windows OS. More proposal writing, pimping my desk and doing some course in the mornings as well.
Week 3 (15th of May – 21st of May)
Finished up proposal, tried to understand how Snapgene and Golden Gate Assembly works and printed the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness to inspire the team. Also went to NBC to show off our project.
Week 4 (22nd of May – 28th of May)
Finally acquired sufficient knowledge on Golden Gate Assembly, designed a load of primers and subsequent constructs and showed of my labskills by making both competent cells and several media.
June
Week 5 (29th of May – 4th of June)
Redesigned my primers and constructs and found out how to validate my experiments. The codon usage table suddenly becomes very fascinating when you need to find silent mutations.

Some goals that were not described in the answer list include creating novel engineered living systems, the will to know what separates the life from non-life, to have fun, to be challenged, to consider ethical issues,  as a way to accelerate human evolution towards ideality, to re-calculate the probability of life occurring spontaneously extra-terrestrially based on the ease/difficulty of synthetic biology.

18. Advances in synthetic biology should be communicated to all of society.
Please indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much you agree on this, with 10 being full agreement.
As has been stated in earlier questions, communication of scientific research to society is useful for a number of reasons. One of the bottlenecks is the correct approach. The majority of the synthetic biology community (61%) agrees that scientific advances should be communicated to the society. 28% is not sure about that and 11% does not agree with this. Although communication to the general public is important to keep research transparent, scientists are also obliged to communicate because very often the tax-payers are the ones who eventually fund the research.
A few reasons why communication of advanced research is not so popular amongst the minority of the group, include the uninformed state of the general public which makes it hard to explain research correctly, and the chance that media (newspapers etc) might give an inaccurate or even negative feature to the project.
Informing the public is perceived as necessary, but the media apparatus and the scientific community should generally work together on getting a clear unbiased and easy-to-access story on paper rather than making controversial and misleading headlines to draw the wrong attention.

The expression range of NEON system is considerably wider than non-positive feedback devices. Compared to other artificial positive feedback devices, NEON is more stable and stringent. By tuning pro-motor and RBS intensities it can be customized to have different stimulation thresholds and reaction inten-sity. NEON could be easily integrated to other projects that share the mutual quorum sensing device. And because lux pR is listed as one of the Top 10 Most Used promoters, we believe NEON could help numerous iGEM projects.
Figure.1. Design of lux pR mutation analysis circuit.
Lux pR Mutation Analysis
NEON as a complex double control system is quite delicate. With our model we have identified several key parameters that when changed are going to significantly alter the circuit’s behavior, one of which is lux pR. As lux pR controls the expression of luxI and sfGFP on Neon, and lacI on Safety Catch, it is the mutual component in both the positive feedback and CRISPRi systems. With simulations we learnt that increased lux pR transcription efficiency would increase NEON’s reaction to AHL, and decreased lux pR leak-age is going to improve NEON’s performance in conditions with lower concentration of AHL stimulation. Therefore we sought to use point mutations to improve the current lux pR and design a new promoter with higher expression intensity and lower leakage.
With the hope to find an optimal promoter for our NEON system, we designed 9 mutations on sites  -35, -36, -37 near the luxR binding site and tested another on -10 site that TUST 2017 reported to show decreased leakage. We conducted experiments to evaluate these lux pR mutants’ reaction to AHL stimulation and their leakage level. The test devices we designed include a constantly expressed luxR and a lux pR (or mutant) driven sfGFP (like BBa_K2558211 with original lux pR promoter, and a BBa_K2558212 with lux pR-HS promoter)We selected one mutation from the luxR binding site, combined it with the mutations on -10 region and generated a promoteor we believed to be hypersen-sitive. We named it lux pR-HS ( BBa_K2558001 ).

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," reduction may occur by direct contact between cell surface and substrate or may be mediated by Flavins[2] to reduce substrate far from the cell surface. Riboflavins can mediate such indirect reduction of the substrate because of their conjugated double-bonded structures, allowing the small energy transitions carried by the electrons. Additionally, its large polar tail confers its significant solubility within the external medium to shuttle electrons to distant substrates.
Aside from its extensive electron transport pathways, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is particularly useful to our project from a microbial fuel cell perspective because of its ability to produce biofilms that facilitate close contact between the bacteria and the cell electrode. These biofilms are formed by an interconnected network of a type IV pili from the cell membrane that adheres to the solid substrate. The pili are conductive and function as nanowires that aid in the direct reduction of the substrate[3]. It is, however, worth noting that more robust biofilm formation occurs in anaerobic and low-nutrient conditions. This was an important factor to consider while designing our microbial fuel cell as we had to decide the nutrient concentration of the culture medium for optimal cell growth and biofilm formation while maintaining an oxygen-free environment.
Figure 2 MFC design
Having gone through many prototypes, we designed our own microbial fuel cell taking inspiration from those of past iGEM teams such as the 2013 Bielefeld team[4]. We decided to employ 3D-printing as a fast and low-cost method to produce our own prototypes.  For the body, we chose ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) because it could not be degraded by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, while is known to be non-toxic. In our experimental set-up, as shown in figure 3, the anode compartment housed the culture medium containing Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain in anaerobic conditions. To achieve such an anaerobic environment, we initially considered flooding the chamber with inert nitrogen gas but later decided to use an anaerobic chamber due to limitations our lab faced with the usage of nitrogen gas. For the anode material, we decided to use carbon cloth as it has a high effective surface area and provides a suitable surface for the bacteria to tether onto and initiate biofilm formation. Meanwhile, the cathode compartment was aerobic in nature with Ferricyanide as the terminal electron acceptor and PBS buffer to maintain the pH constantly at 7 throughout the cell’s operation.

Senior High School: A newly set-up iGEM team
As for senior high school, we organized some lectures to introduce synthetic biology and our project. Firstly, we held a lecture in High School Affiliated to Fudan University (FDFZ). And this lecture gave us unexpected pleasure.
FDFZ is a well-known high school in Shanghai having a long history. And thanks to the abundant resource of Fudan University, the students of FDFZ can get easy access to top theory and technology in the science field and the atmosphere of exploring is really thick there. Thus, we reached a biology teacher in FDFZ discussing about holding a lecture in FDFZ and the possibility of establishing an iGEM high school team to help them participate in this creative competition. To attract more students to our lecture, we prepared beautiful posters for every classroom and made sufficient plans.     The outcome is more than fantastic. The number of students that came to our lecture is far over our expectation, and they were all eager to know iGEM and how to take part in it. Thus, we organized two interviews together with a teacher of FDFZ to select suitable students for future competition. In the interview, we asked about lots of things such as their basic knowledge of modern biology, experience in laboratory, the understanding of iGEM and their current ideas. To our surprise, some had attended the John Hopkins Summer Camp and had the experience of PCR, Western Blot and etc. And some had learned pharmacodynamic evaluation, mice emergency immunization, flow cytometry, labeling fluorescent antibody and so on. And their ideas were also innovative concerning Chinese traditional herb, malaria, controlling blood pressure, and regulation of K+. As for the division of labor, they also have their considerations. Some prefer wet laboratory, and others would like to major in modeling or visual designing…… We not only shared basic knowledge of synthetic biology, lab skills and safety rules with them in our mini-class, but also achieved a lot from them- discussing ethic and law issues in regard to advanced technology. What impressed us most is their passion on practice with their own hands. The knowledge they’ve learnt in class inspired fantastic ideas, while we provide a stage to help them realize. Welcome, new iGEMers!
It’s a really successful try, and we did help our next generation not only know about iGEM and synthetic biology but assist them to become one of us, to make them enjoy the interest of it. Now, a promising iGEM team is coming into formation and we will also support them theoretically and practically. The world is"

Again, the main idea that the CRISPR system allows for precise editing of genes is clear.
The press release is more suitable for a general audience. Using simpler words, even colloquialisms such as
home in,
the press release explains more clearly the purpose of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system.
...the engineered CRISPR-Cas9 system can be programmed to target specific stretches of genetic code and to make cuts at precise locations. Over the past few years, those capabilities have been harnessed and used as genome editing tools, enabling researchers to permanently modify genes in mammalian cells. In the future, these tools may make it possible to correct mutations at precise locations in the three billion-letter sequence of the human genome to treat genetic causes of disease in patients.
Being meant for a general audience, the press release is a summary the key points of the article. Very little of the specifics of the CRISPR system are brought up, as the general public would be unable to understand anyways. Most importantly, the foggy main idea from above is clarified: ""Researchers can now harness the engineered system to home in on specific nucleic acid sequences and cut the DNA at those precise targets.""
Very rarely did the more ""general audience"" articles cite from just the original source. This nature article provides a good overview of recent developments in CRISPR, and explains the science in an accessible way. It cites 15 scholarly articles, and includes graphics to clearly illustrate the gene editing process. It is worth noting that, because the nature article covers so much, it is quite long. The writer offsets this by grouping the advancements into sections, to make the article easier to process.
More specialized websites such as Addgene referenced several articles about CRISPR as well. Like nature, the entry about CRISPR's history has diagrams illustrating the process. The short ""reference"" is a lot more technical in nature. Rather than mention the researchers, the webpage explains just the science and its strengths and limitations.
The McGovern Institute at MIT's article is similar in that it references more than just one scholarly article. Instead of illustrations, a video explains the process. The video is targeted to a very broad audience, even giving the definition of ""a gene"" in the introduction. The animations illustrate each step of the CRISPR/Cas9 process very clearly.

However, a sudden and consistent drop in sucrose concentration was observed for the S5 series with 200 mM NaCl. We hypothesized that it was either a technical artifact or due to loss of live bacteria. Measuring OD confirmed that cell death could potentially explain the drop, since the OD for 200 mM series dropped throughout the experiment (Fig. 30). Such drop is likely due to rerouting of the carbon flux to the extracellular, however, we were only able to confirm that the drop in OD was dependent on the osmotic pressures, and that 50-150 mM were able to keep the cells alive (at least in figure 23, however, figure 25 tells a different story. They are likely both true and within a certain variance, we couldn’t measure).  We were also interested in measuring OD and sucrose accumulation when CAM was omitted to test the stability of the cscB transformation (Fig. 31 and 32). However, due to sample loss it was difficult to compare them after seven days. Although it would seem, that antibiotics did not to seem to be crucial to keep the transformation stabile for seven days.

These values were 395 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation wavelength.  These values were submitted into the Tecan plate reader computer program for accurate readings.

Antibiotics work by selectively targeting bacteria and killing them before they are able to reproduce. Unfortunately, when bacteria are treated with antibiotics, some will develop a resistance to particular strains of antibiotics due to random mutations. Antibiotic pressure is the term used to describe antibiotic promotion of resistance development by pathogens1. The evolution of bacteria, stimulated by antibiotics, is easily observed because of how quickly new bacterial generations are produced. If bacteria become resistant to multiple antibiotics, they can be termed “superbugs”.
As one could imagine, this problem is magnified in hospital settings. Hospitals have a high usage of antibiotics and therefore are exposing strains of bacteria to many antibiotics2. Some examples of resistant bacteria pathogens are methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter1.
New methods to eliminate bacteria to circumvent traditional antibiotics are being investigated. One of these methods is quenching autoinducing peptides of quorum sensing bacteria. Quorum sensing is the ability of microorganisms to coordinate gene expression in relation to their population density3. When certain bacteria are in high- density situations, small autoinducers or peptides are released to neighboring bacteria.
After binding to other bacteria, the peptide initiates a change in the expression of certain genes. This could result in bioluminescence in some strains of bacteria such as Vibrio"

I tried to do the same thing for the second time with larger volume, because Traci told us that the nanodrop quantification result from the extracted gels could be improved by using more sample instead of the constant ~10 uL that we had been using all this time. The pictures of the result can be seen below. We were still unable to see any separated band for the cut YFP and GFP composite part. Some promoters and terminators were successfully cut, but our previously made GFP+Terminator composite parts did not seem to produce the expected band and the same thing happened with the parts that encode fluorescent proteins.

Suma told us that she previously encountered the same problem and she pointed out that there might be problem with the restriction digest. In double digestion, where we cut the plasmid with 2 enzymes simultaneously, buffer 2 was always used since it has the highest activity in all enzymes combinations. But it turns out that this assumption may not be enough, since the website for New England Biolabs states that different combinations need different buffer and digestion time. So I repeated the restriction digest with this method and cut the following biobricks: GFP composite (Bba_E0240) and promoter (Bba_R2000 & Bba_R0040). The digestion time was 2 hours instead of the usual 1 hour in accordance to the optimization recommendation found in the NEB website. The digested plasmids were then kept"

Keypoints
In rodents, D-psicose is known to inhibit digestive enzymes, including alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. D-psicose also inhibits the absorption of glucose from the intestine by competing with glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells.
In rats, D-psicose-induced hepatic glucokinase has been reported to improve hepatic glucose utilization.
Rats fed D-psicose had significantly lower serum insulin and leptin levels. The D-psicose diet significantly reduced liver enzyme activity involved in adipogenesis, while gene expression of fatty acid oxidative transcriptional regulators was enhanced.

How 17-year olds want to make mules fertile
We facilitated discussion about the consequences of modifying organisms in synthetic biology with adolescents at the UCL Sutton Trust Biosciences Summer School. The session introduced synthetic biology, our biological light switches and their applications. The aim was to have students consider synthetic biology as a system, where changing one component will affect the others.
We started by asking students what their knowledge about the field is and then built upon this. For example, we highlighted the need for interdisciplinary work and then asked why that might be important. We discussed examples of how mathematical modelling can be combined with wet lab experiments and then entrepreneurship.
What worked well was having the students diverge and talk among themselves about given points and then converge back to share everyone’s opinion and then summarise conclusion or take-away points along the way. The most interesting example came in a discussion initiated by a student: ‘We should make mules fertile, as it can benefit agriculture’.
We went through 4 or 5 turns of diverging and converging to cover points such as:
what are the real-life trade-offs of modifying mules in an agricultural context?
if gene drives are used, what unwanted consequences can come along?
how should experimentation happen – behind closed doors or in a transparent manner?
What we hope to have had achieved was to give students a more holistic way of looking at ideas in synthetic biology. We encourage future teams to try and seek communication techniques from other fields that specialize in getting to the heart of problems, such as in management consulting.
Debating safety and ethics in synthetic biology
Together with the Warwick and Westminster iGEM teams, we organised debates at the UK 2017 iGEM Meet-up. Our goal was to see how useful debates can be to consider safety and ethics when developing an iGEM project.
At the start of our project, many ideas and projects were discussed, debated and pondered upon. What perhaps needed some more consideration, was how do we think about the project development in terms of ethical, safety and societal considerations? What directions should be pursued?
To see what a good way to engage in such a thought experiment would be, we organised debates between UK’s iGEM teams on synthetic biology matters. Topics ranged from whether synthetic biology should be merged with AI, to whether there should be a limit on what can be genetically engineered, to who should own the intellectual property of scientific developments."

SMITe - The Concept
In short
The Issue
Chronic wounds and antibiotic resistance are issues increasing in importance and often go hand-in-hand
Current treatment strategies for chronic wounds rely on mechanical removal of dead tissue, or systemic antibiotic therapy, which are largely ineffective or come with considerable risks for the patient
A major reason for ineffective treatments are biofilms; structures secreted by bacteria to facilitate establishment of a chronic infection
Our goals for SMITe - Spider Silk Mediated Infection Treatment:
We aim to construct a functional dressing for chronic wounds, using spider silk as a scaffold to attach biofilm-degrading enzymes. This includes:
Expressing biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins’ and quantifying their potency
Assembling combat proteins with a linker and tag needed for purification and attachment to spider silk
Attaching the enzymes to spider silk using Sortase A, a transpeptidase
Isolating Sortase A from the S. aureus genome and creating a ‘Sortase Package’ including basic parts needed for other iGEM teams to use Sortase in their own projects
Testing the efficacy of the fully assembled wound dressing with attached enzymes on biofilms
Our Path
A Project is Born
We are delighted to say that from its inception, our project has benefitted from being a truly shared endeavor; one which we cannot wait to show you.
Following initial selection of the team members, we undertook a series of small group exercises which merged team building with the generation of new ideas. Once these were narrowed down to several per group, we tested the ease with which each group could present an unknown idea to the rest of the team. This was a very revealing experiment in terms of the generalisability of an idea, as well as how marketable each one could be.
It became clear rapidly that the team were stuck between a focus on biomaterials and health, and it was alongside the opportunity to work with recombinant spider silk that our final project plan evolved, joining these two fields perfectly.
Chronic Wounds
Chronic wounds are a major source of disability and high cost for healthcare systems worldwide, not to mention pain, misery and the continual threat of infection for the affected individual"

All the transformations done on friday gave growth. However comparing to the chemically competent cells prepared by TMF buffer (RbCl) the number of colonies from TSS buffer competent cells was less. However the concentration of DNA added plays a major role in the efficiency of transformation. The λp-R-GFP-T DNA isolated by miniprep had a concentration of 116.5 ng/µl which gave huge number of colonies compared to the diluted pSB1K3 with mRFP biobrick. The electro-transformation of λp-rep biobrick was successful and gave good colonies. hence we have decided to work with electro-transformation hereafter.
Thus we can very well start the assemblies today. We did restriction for the DNA samples needed for 8 assemblies. We might have some problem with backbones but only in future assemblies.

Working Together
We collaborated with several iGEM teams from different countries and with different backgrounds. The exchange resulted in new inputs, insights and friendships.
Freiburg
We ran into the Freiburg team for the first time at the iGEM meet-up organized by the TU Delft team . Soon we realized that for both our projects the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role. Their designer cells should be able to reliably interpret environmental signals and only become active if they are in a solid tumor. Similarly, our bacteria should be able to do so as well but with different signals. Since it’s hard to reproduce such an microenvironment in the labs that were available to us we wanted to combine our expertises and help each other overcome this issue.
To discuss in more detail how such a collaboration could look like we were invited for a BBQ in Freiburg.
Visiting our collaborators in Freiburg to discuss our work and enjoy a nice barbeque together.
At the university there, our anti-cancer protein of choice, azurin, is quite well known and routinely purified at lab courses. They therefore agreed to make a killing curve of azurin on a mammalian cell line. Further, they provided us with samples of azurin so that we can reproduce their data and conduct additional experiments. Without their help, verifying the action of azurin would have been very hard.
We, on the other hand, leveraged our experience in modelling of the tumor environment.
Heidelberg
This years's team from Heidelberg worked, among other things, on mutagenesis plasmids for direct evolution applications. To improve reproducibility of their assay, they reached out to a number of teams and asked to participate in their mini-interlab study . We were happy to help out and are looking forward to the results of the experiments!

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Once the proposal is done, it is reviewed by the team members. Then she selects team members who will be responsible to send the proposal to some of the listed company. Proposal is sent by mail or email. The company is contacted for proposals confirmation by phone or email after 2-4 weeks. Another fund raising role is done by selling beverages, flowers, lunch, iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt, and etc.
Not only actively involved in the fund raising activities, as a wetlab team member, she is responsible for laboratory preparation such as accommodate laboratory supply, provide competent E. coli cells for cloning and expression. Then assembling reporter module and also have it transformed to E. coli cells.
Her hobbies are playing with cats and playing music.
Since contributing in synthetic biology is completely new for her, so she hopes that this practice will be more comprehensive rather than lecture in class. This practice provides her an ability to be creative and innovative inside or outside the laboratory. This competition also supports her to build a teamwork with a different disciplines and improve our leadership and managerial skill, how to act with integrity, courage, dedication and full of responsibility. So, iGEM is not only a place to get involved in synthetic biology but also a race in world class competition. I hope that in 2015 ITB could maintain the gold titles.
iGEM provides her a really brand new experience working with synthetic biology and also with the team, where we came up with unpredictable results. First, the modelling division confirmed that out first designated module will not work as expected. Then our wetlab division has to turn back re-designing a new module that fully approved by the modelling division. Second, Indonesia 2015 first quarters unstable economic condition consequence many of our proposal got rejected. While we have to deal with the weakness of IDR (Indonesia Rupiah) exchange value to USD (US Dollar). This situation urges our team to raise the money harder, for example by designing and selling an iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt to our colleagues. But this moment also makes our team solid. Third, Seminar and Meet Up iGEM 2015 All Indonesia Team, which was initiated and held by our human practice division is overall awesome. This was the very first moment where all iGEM Indonesia team could be gathered. At this meetup we also shared our iGEM project to the participants whose have different background such as computational, chemistry, mathematics, and etc. Lastly, iGEM competition is completely unforgettable experience for her.

TUST_China,2018,Team:TUST China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the United States, the average concentrations of tetracycline, oxytetracycline and aureomycin in surface water were 0.11, 1.34 and 0.15 ug/L, respectively. [3] Residues of these antibiotics can induce the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, it will do great harm to the ecological balance through the food chains, and eventually flow to humans, posing a fatal threat to human health. [2]
Although the problem of tetracycline abuse in medical treatment has been greatly eased in the 21st century, tetracyclines are still active in livestock farming area because of its low cost. In the initial brainstorm process,  tetracyclines was gradually being interested since some of our team members are exactly puzzled by tetracycline teeth, then we learned about the context of this antibiotic and discussed related issues about it. We thought it was feasible and accessible for us, so it appeared in our final preliminary project list.
Finally, our team members made a consensus, this year, we will focus on tetracycline detection and degradation, which is designed to sensitively detect tetracycline in contaminated samples and then degradatte it with a high efficiency.

Questionaire (Coverage: 100 people and the government)
Background Information
As a group of science enthusiast,we are always very curious to see how different people would think about scientific research, especially in Hong Kong. As Hong Kong is a highly commercialised city, new risky, or to be more precise,capital consuming ideas might not be favoured. Under such circumstance, we would like carry out an investigation to see student’s attitude  toward scientific research and their opinion on government’s new Innovation and Technology Bureau which is established in the November of 2015. We designed this 2 main direction  of as we hope to know more about scientific research in Hong Kong and general public perceive them. After the results are recorded, we will send our report to the Hong Kong Government for their further reference.
What we’ve done
As we hope to find out the real thoughts of the respondents, we conduct a private, anonymous  questionnaire to ask for their opinions.
The questionnaire consist of three part which are Personal Information, About the Innovation and Technology Bureau and Generally about Hong Kong Government. In a total of 14 question, multiple choice questions and opinion-seeking question takes up 9 and 5 respectively. The overall expected time for the respondent to finish the questionnaire is about 10 minutes.It was conducted in an online format via Google form as it can the results collected will be feedback to us automatically with graphs and and data ready to be used and it’s simplicity of its overall layout.
The questionnaire created mainly revolves around the respondent's opinion on the Innovation and Technology Bureau, the general impression on the government support for scientific research and their own level of interest for scientific"
NWU-CHINA,2017,Team:NWU-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," investigated the issue of biosafety by questionnaires. We asked the public their views about biology, their understanding of biosafety and how much attention they paid to biosafety. Surprisingly, people aren’t afraid to biology. To the contrary, people have a lot of interest in biology, however, they didn’t learn about biosafety scientifically, so that they also have a few of concern about biology. Therefore, popularizing biosafety knowledge is necessary.
In view of this situation, we made a short video to introduce biosafety to freshmen of our college and suggest them share the video with their relative and friends to spread biosafety knowledge. Besides, we also upload this video to famous online video platform in China, such as Youku, Bilibili, Tencent video and so on to spread biosafety knowledge to public.
To watch our video, please click here.
We hope that with our efforts popularizing biological knowledge, we can increase favorability of biology among the public and attract more and more people can be conducive to the biological field.
What’s more, through our PI, we know that, with the lack of teachers in this novel subject, there is a shortage in academic resources of synthesis biology.
The results of our survey also support this point. Most of people didn’t hear of synthesis biology ever and they don’t know the difference between synthesis biology and genetic engineering. However, people around us have a liberal attitude to synthesis organism and GMOs.
Therefore, we popularized relevant knowledge of synthesis biology and the difference between synthesis biology and genetic engineering on a influential platform, Shaanxi Province Lifescience forum held by Shaanxi Provincial Lifescience Alliance. This alliance composite with few of famous high school, such as, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xidian University, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Normal University. By this forum, we acquainted people with fundamental theory of synthesis biology. We have done the best we can to widespread synthesis biology.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

This section will examine several tools which attempt to provide a design environment for synthetic biology. These can be divided into both academic and industrial offerings.
Academic
APE
APE
APE (A Plasmid Editor) [6] is an editor which shows DNA sequence and translation information in a single text based viewer. It performs basic highlighting tasks for restriction sites (or user defined regions). It also shows translation, Tm, %GC, and ORF of selected DNA in real-time. It also reads DNA Strider, FASTA, Genbank and EMBL files. It has no database connectivity or notion of a larger synthetic biology community.
Athena
Athena
Athena is a tool developed at the University of Washington by Deepak Chandran, Frank Bergmann, Herbert Sauro. Here is their description from OpenWetWare's Computational Tool Site
Athena is a tool for building, simulating, and analyzing genetic circuits (as well as metabolic/signaling networks, such as SBML files). It provides a visual interface for building biological modules that can be saved and later connected together. The connection can be achieved using either the PoPS interface or by defining overlapping molecular species (similar to the concept of module in CellML and SBML). In addition to simulation, Athena supports a few other useful features: Database of Ecoli regulatory network from RegulonDB, Graphical view of part sequence, Automated derivation of transcription rate equations, Interface to all Systems Biology Workbench programs, Interface with R statistical language, and an easy plugin architecture.

Biologically Producing Self-Folding Plastics

Introduction
Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics today. As a synthetic polymer of styrene monomers, polystyrene exhibits self-folding properties when heated.  We endeavored to biologically synthesize styrene by genetically engineering E. coli to produce the enzymes required in the pathway from L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid to styrene. Using this pathway we aimed to produce the styrene monomer both in vivo and in vitro from renewable sources.  After producing styrene biologically, we characterized a method for polymerizing styrene into the polymer, polystyrene, which is then ready for folding.
See our BioBricks
Styrene Synthesis:  Engineering E. coli to produce the styrene monomer
The first step in making biologically produced polystyrene is to create the monomer styrene.  After combing through the literature we found a group from Arizona State University that had successfully produced styrene in a cell via a two-step enzymatic pathway from the amino acid phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid to styrene.  The enzymes that catalyzed the first and second step were Phenylalnine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) and Ferulic Acid Decarboxylase (FDC) respectively [4].  However, as we read more papers about styrene synthesis we found that the two-step pathway was actually more complicated than it looked.  The second enzyme FDC, was regulated by a co-factor that was recently found to be a prenylated riboflavin formed from dimethylallyl monophosphate (DMAP) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) by another enzyme known as UbiX [8].  We now had a complete pathway to produce sty"

How can we use the pH drop?
How can we use the pH drop?
How could we measure the pH?
As we’ve built the model predicting the pH change very accurately, we have been thinking about how to use this system change to our advantage. There are two viable options that we’ve considered.
By using a pH indicator that changes colour at a pH of around 6, we could use the same electronics that we’ve developed for detecting the fluorescence of the sfGFP in the biosensor to detect the colour change, and therefore the point at which the pH becomes dangerously low. This has the advantage of making the biosensor very user friendly while keeping the system cheap.  The other option is to use a commercially available digital pH meter to signal a warning when the pH gets too low. This could require occasional maintenance of the pH sensor, but would have the advantage of being more accurate.
How is the pH useful?
The pH in our system is an indirect measure of the amount of DCM that we’ve degraded. It is therefore possible to calculate the required amount of water that has to be added to a certain amount of DCM to ensure the pH remains neutral. If no buffer solution is added, initial calculations (see the graph) indicate that there is a very big difference between the relative volumes of the amount of DCM added and the volume of the aqueous layer. This highlights the importance of using a pH buffer solution in the aqueous layer.
Therefore, the system that detects the amount of DCM that we’ve degraded could link the digital pH read-out to the initial amount of water added.

Schools
This year we visited local schools to introduce pupils to practical biological work. We     decided to do so, because in this lab-workshop we saw the biggest potential for us to be     helpful and make an impact. A few years ago the German school system was reformed     and the former nine years of “Gymnasium” were cut short to just eight years. We, the     Team Franconia, live in Bavaria, a federal state who executed this reform as one of the     first, fourteen years ago. This brought with it a lot of changes in the curricula of all     grades, especially the last two years before graduation. To get most of the important     topics into only eight instead of nine years, practical work experience was nearly     completely withdrawn from curriculum. So, before graduation most pupils in Germany     know the theory behind modern biological work in laboratories, but have never done it     nor seen it in practice. To change that and fascinate soon-to- be university students in     natural sciences we decided to visit local schools and do a small workshop about     biological work. ´
Since we were planning to do the workshop in the school building– not in      our laboratory at the university – almost every experiment was unsuitable because of      safety aspects. After long brainstorming sessions, we found three interesting      experiments, neither demanding too little nor too much from the pupils: a simple DNA-      extraction from strawberries, a gel electrophoresis of a plasmid in different conformations      with a harmless DNA-dye and our “microcakes”, mixing ingredients, usually used to bake      cakes, in Eppendorf tubes by using microliter pipettes, micro scales and vortexers. After      contacting two schools in Erlangen, discussing the possibilities with the responsible      biology teachers, planning the experiments and preparing the workshop, we held our      very first workshop on the 24th of May 2017 at the Marie-Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen.
Marie-Therese-Gymnasium Erlangen
The teachers assembled a group of 13 interested pupils from their 11 th grade biology     courses who were willing to spend their – usually free – Wednesday afternoon learning     about iGEM, synthetic biology and how to work in laboratories. We prepared the DNA     extraction, the gel electrophoresis and a power point presentation about us and the theory of the two experiments, everything being photographed"

What is a Riboswitch?
A riboswitch is a piece of mRNA that regulates gene expression. There are primarily two types of riboswitches: translational and transcriptional riboswitches. The fluoride riboswitch is a transcriptional riboswitch (Figure 2), which means that a terminator is formed when the riboswitch is transcribed that limits the processivity of the RNA polymerase transcribing downstream genes. When the aptamer (ligand-binding) region of the fluoride riboswitch interacts with fluoride, the terminator is not formed allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and transcribe the downstream gene.
Figure 2: Schematic of a transcriptional riboswitch
2015 Exeter iGEM Team, RNA Riboswitches
In our project, we will use the fluoride riboswitch. In Figure 3 you can see a crystal structure of the aptamer domain of the fluoride riboswitch. How can a negatively charged piece of RNA bind to a negatively charged fluoride ion? The fluoride riboswitch encapsulated three Mg2+ ions that can bind to the fluoride ion (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Crystal structure of a fluoride riboswitch
Aiming Ren, Kanagalaghatta R. Rajashankar, Dinshaw J. Patel “Fluoride ion encapsulation by Mg2+ ions and phosphates in a fluoride riboswitch” 2012 Nature 486, 85–89
In nature the riboswitch regulates the expression of genes that help the organism deal with high levels of fluoride. These genes are often pumps that allow fluoride to be exported out of the cell (Figure 4). In E. coli the gene crcB encodes a fluoride efflux channel that removes excess fluoride from the cell so that it is no longer toxic. In E. coli when the crcB gene is genetically deleted (ΔcrcB), the phenotype is increased sensitivity to fluoride and concentrations above 500μM are lethal. In our experiments we needed to utilize the ΔcrcB E. coli strain so that fluoride could accumulate intracellularly.
Figure 4: Crystal structure of a fluoride channel
Our Design
We constructed an operon that would enable us to regulate the expression of the gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase with the fluoride riboswitch, called CHOP (Figure 5). We ordered the synthetic operon from IDT DNA with overhangs that have homology to the pSB1A3 vector so we could clone our operon in with Gibson. We used the pSB1"

This surface expression characteristics could ensure the precise structures and functions of the expressed protein streptavidin, which could lead to desired interaction between streptavidin and biotin. The two systems used in our design go as follows:
AIDA System
In the biobrick pT7-rbs-(sp_eGFP_streptavidin_AIDAc)-Terminators ( BBa_K283001 ), promoter (T7) needs T7 polymerase to promote its function; Signal peptide (SP) could bring the protein to the membrane region of the bacteria; eGFP is integrated within the plasmid for detection; Streptavidin specifically binds to biotin, which mediates the orientated binding of the bacteria and to biotin coated motor; AIDA is a transmembrane protein, which leads to the polar expression of the protein. However, AIDA protein can only be expressed in a LPS complete strain, which is a constraint when choosing the bacteria strains.
Lpp-OmpA System
The other biobrick we used is pTet-rbs-lpp_ompA_eGFP_streptavidin-double Terminators ( BBa_K283000 ), which can be polarly expressed on one side of rod-shaped bacteria. Lpp functions as a signal peptide; OmpA is the player which can achieve the surface expression of specific proteins; GFP-Strp acts the same role as above.
After we successfully constructed two polar expression systems, which bacteria strain and which system to be used became our crucial task.
Strain Selection
For AIDA System
To achieve polar expression, it is essential to screen and select bacteria species and strains equipped with outstanding propelling abilities as well as a complete LPS (lipopolysaccharide) layer. This layer, present in the bacterial cell wall, is required for polar expression of certain proteins(AIDA) The candidates included Escherichia. coli strains: BL21, NCM3722, MG1655, YBE03, and YBE01, and YBS01.
For Lpp-OmpA System
Lpp-OmpA system can only achieve outer membrane surface expression. To select the strain which can polarly express the desired proteins, Lpp-OmpA-GFP-Streptavidin was transformed into the strains above. GFP conferred this system the ability to be detected easily under fluorescent microscope.

However, it would have to be proven that the synthetic palm kernel oil is more environmental friendly that the natural oil.  Further, he mentioned that environmental protection has a huge value for the Austrian society and many companies are using certificated palm oil right now, although the RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) have some niggles. However, better alternatives are currently not available. As a consequence the introduction of stricter inspections in the future will be necessary. Finally, he explained that biotechnology will rather be important in the next decades than in the next years.
Interview with Stefan Thomann (European Candle Association ASBL)
Would you like to introduce your association and yourself?
My name is Stefan Thomann, I am the Managing Director of the of the European Candle Association ASBL, which is the association of the leading candle producers in Europe. Our association interacts quickly and directly with other relevant players, distinguishing us from other associations. We only allow direct membership which helps quick decision making.
Which other associations do exist?
There are a couple of other international associations as well as national associations in some countries. Some of the international associations have national associations as members.
Do your member companies use palm(kernel)oil?
To my knowledge, they do not use palm kernel oil. Some of them use palm oil products however, in various amounts depending on the candle types they produce and on the base material prices. Most candles were made of paraffin wax years ago, but the price has risen significantly and so candle producers had to search for alternatives. Palm can be such alternative for some candle types, but generally, its processing is more demanding. In the meantime, the candle producers know how to process palm products very well however.
Other alternatives are stearin for example or other fats. Most fats have to be hardened first before they can be used in candles. Very often, candle producers do not use only one type of raw material but a mixture.
Which qualities are of interest?
It depends on what kind of candles one would like to produce. Fats typically get rather soft close to the melting point which is the reason why they are mostly used in container candles, e.g. filled glasses or tea lights. If you want to produce free standing candles, you can work with mixtures. But for very small diameters, such as dinner candles for example, you need a lot of stability and have to use raw materials other than palm.
We research on a synthetic alternative for palm kernel oil in E. coli. Would you use in this way produced oil?
It sounds very interesting. The prerequisite for"

Mussel Adhesion Proteins
The ability for mussels to survive the harsh conditions of the intertidal zone is directly related to their capability to bind to both organic and inorganic surfaces that they come in contact with. As a result, these mussels have evolved to secrete “adhesion proteins” that enable formation of powerful bonds in an otherwise deleterious aqueous environment. The quantity known as “work of adhesion (WA)” amongst interfaces in an aqueous environment is significantly less favorable due to the water-surface interactions that must be outcompeted by the adhesive if binding is to occur.10 Therefore, these mussel adhesion proteins offer a promising avenue towards enhanced bioadhesives that retain functionality in aqueous environments.
The structure responsible for the binding of mussels to these surfaces is known as the byssus, which is composed of a well-characterized assembly of approximately 25-30 proteins.20 The byssus manifests itself as an outgrowth from the mussel’s “foot” composed of threads, which terminate in plaques deposited on the surface. Thus far, a total of 5 proteins, known as mussel foot proteins (mfp’s), were shown to be unique to the plaque. Of these 5 plaque proteins, mfp-3 and mfp-5 have elicited the most investigation for adhesive applications, as both are localized at the interface between the plaque and surface. Additionally, it was shown that all such mfp’s have a uniquely high concentration of tyrosine, which is post-translationally modified to 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-Dopa). Atomic force microscopy studies focusing on a single dopa residue showed that its interaction with a metal oxide surface involves a remarkably high strength, reversible coordination bond.21 It has been shown that catechol oxidase enzymes present in mfp secretions are able to convert the catechol groups of L-dopa into reactive orthoquinone functionalities, which undergo irreversible covalent bonding with organic surfaces.21,22 Ultimately, the high degree of surface affinity such dopa-containing peptides possess makes them novel tools in the development of biomimetic adhesive peptides.

Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution and mix. The color of the mix will become yellow.
Optional: Use this step only when DNA fragment is <500 bp or >10 kb long.
If the DNA fragment is <500 bp, add 1:2 volume of 100 % isopropanol to the solubilized gel solution. Mix thoroughly.
If the DNA fragment is >10 kb, add 1:2 volume of water to the solubilized gel solution. Mix thoroughly.
Binding of DNA
Transfer up to 800 µL of the solubilized gel solution (from step 3/4) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge 1 min at 11,000 x g. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube. Note: If the total volume exceeds 800 µL, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After each application, centrifuge the column for 30-60 s and discard the flow through after each spin. Repeat until the entire volume has been applied to the column membrane. Do not exceed 1 g of total agarose gel slice per column.
Add 100 µL of Binding Buffer to the GeneJet purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Washing
Add 700 µL of Wash Buffer to the GeneJet purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube. (We altered the protocol to to wash steps a 350 µL optional)
Centrifuge the empty GeneJet purification column for an additional 1 min to completely remove residual wash buffer
Elution
Transfer the GeneJET purification column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL of Elution Buffer to the center of the purification column membrane. Centrifuge for 1 minute. Note: for low DNA amounts the elution volumes can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An elution volume between 20-50 µL does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution volumes less than 10 µL are not recommended. If DNA fragment is >10 kb, preheat Elution Buffer to 65 °C before applying to column."
