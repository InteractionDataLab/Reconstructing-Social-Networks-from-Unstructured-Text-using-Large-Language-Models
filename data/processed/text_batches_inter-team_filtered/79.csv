The first 4 elution fractions (lane 5-8) contained some low molecular weight contaminating proteins and therefore only elution fraction 6 to 11 (lane 10 to 15) were pooled.

Summarize available information of existing riboregulators into a Feature Page and promote their uses.
Create a Catalog Page for all identifiable regulatory RNAs;
Update the choice of “Categories” when documenting “hard information” of a BioBrick, and;
Write up a guideline for other teams to tag their new regulatory RNAs so they will show up on the catalog page under the relevant sub-category.
Given its size, ""Project Riboregulator"" is expected to take more than just a summer to complete. Thus at the moment of wiki freeze, information available here is bound to be limited. However, the project will continue on well after the Giant Jamboree. Information will be continuously and regularly updated, and because of its nature, ""Project Riboregulator"" is not part of our work for competing awards of any kind or in any year, but rather, a tribute to the Part Registry and iGEM community alone.
CR and TA riboregulator system
Figure 1. Riboregulator Overview Diagram
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by Isaacs in 2005. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system, crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence at the 5' of the RBS, the RBS, and the gene of interest.
The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS to prevent the recognition of RBS by ribosomes. The translation crRNA is also commonly described as a ""lock"" because it ""locks"" the RBS and prevent translation. The ""key"" to this system is the taRNA. taRNA can interact       (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore activate translation (Figure 1.).
The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.'s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent      regulation of multiple genes etc.

For another part of STEP, we proved the effectiveness of our transcription factor tTA and promotor pTight (Figure 3), and constructed a stable cell line with pTight-mCherry in both HEK293T and HeLa.
Figure 3. Transcription Factor Test. (a) Fluorescent images of transfected cell with pTight-mCherry (-) and tTA-EGFP and pTight-mCherry (+). Photos were taken 48 h after transfection. (b) Relative fluorescence intensity in conditions above.
After both two sections of STEP were verified, we carried out experiment to confirm the whole system works and to explore the best condition for it to operate. We successfully figured out a relatively ideal transfection condition of TC/PC = 12 and total quantity of 2.44 μg per ml (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Transcription ratio and quantity test in HEK293T. (a) Relative fluorescence intensity at different PC concentration. The dynamic range increases as TC/PC ratio rises, while the gene expression drops after 14.  (b) The 1.00 indicates the original quantity of 3 μg/ml TC and 0.25 μg/ml PC. . The best dynamic range is found in 0.75-fold, presenting a 4.90-fold of reporter expression level.
The results from our overall tests are confirmed by our model, which also suggests that there could be a certain set of TC/PC ratio and quantity that can lead to a best dynamic range which may be significantly higher than other conditions. Thus we believe that STEP can be further optimised through more subdivided gradients.
Apart from VEGF, we carried out experiments with D-Dimer-STEP, and achieved a larger dynamic range (Figure 5a). The VEGF-STEP was also tested in HeLa and extremely low background noise was observed during experiments (Figure 5b).
Figure 5. STEP system test for D-Dimer and in HeLa. (a) Test of D-Dimer-STEP in HEK293T. 4 paralleled experiments of TC/PC = 12, total quantity = 3.25 μg/ml test were done using the D-Dimer-STEP, and the dynamic range reached"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2013,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,", the research remains there. Though when cancer is taken into consideration, there is an undeniable truth that nearly most of us individuals have encountered a close relative suffering from this heartbreaking disease. Decades have been spent trying to devise a ground breaking treatment for cancer and the obstinate work is still forging. Let’s question the number of cancer contemplators from the window of philosophy. How many have intensely analysed cancers behaviour, to discover its roots to comment on its existence? More substantially go on a journey to identify the connection between human nature and cancer through philosophy?
SynPhilo’s first conference ‘Know your cell, Know yourself’ intended to take the audience on a discovery of the behaviour of cancer and its connection to the humans through our organised activities and an act play scripted by our team members. The play was based on a scientist who looks at cancer from one direction only and a student who looks into the deeper end of the pool. Cancer, once a normally functioning cell, becomes uncontrollable when a slight error of gene replication occurs. From our perspective, we apprehend that cancer cell begins to swirl into a route where it becomes selfish, greedy, anarchistic, wasting and arrogant. It takes other cells’ glucose, deceives the immune system, bypasses its alerts and decides to form its own blood vessels to do metastasis and more. When deeply thought it is inevitable that the behaviour of cancer is somewhat linked to the inner feelings that most of us have whether hidden or not. SynPhilo conference analysed every movement of cancer first scientifically then reasoned its behaviour morally and found the interrelation of cancer with us humans, teaching us how to react through seeing a live example such as cancer that lives within us and slowly pulls the body to death as well as itself.
Let’s imagine the human body as a country’s government and cancer as the villain. The human body naturally attacks the cancer cells as soon as it identifies its invasion.  When observing this process in the body, we can comprehend that there is a unique similarity between the duty of a country’s government and the body itself. So why not learn how to act by reading into ourselves or simply finding the similarities between us and cancer, in some aspects forming a bridge between the two to take lessons?

Future Plan
Atoms Turkiye is planning to continue the SynPhilo conferences, trying its best to evolve and grow nationally and internationally, implementing scientists and the public to not limit its eyesight with the results attained in the laboratory. On a wider aspect train ourselves to look at general situations from different points of view. To begin our future plans"

Emily PCR Rescued the FTV vector using crRNA primers.  The PCR results were gel purified.  More work was done to update the Wiki and brainstorm design ideas for it.  Emily also did some finishing touches on the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools . Ashlee updated the Notebook and Team information on the website. She is slowly learning HTML and CSS.
Sequencing Data arrived, showing that the vectors did not pick up an insert at all, and re-circularized without one. Seems as if inverse PCR was successful. Tail sequence of forward primer shown perfectly, tail sequence of reverse primer shown partially by sequencing. Plan is to re-do the digestion of gblocks and pFTV and then ligate, transform again. Inverse PCR completed again, this time shows extremely faint bands. We know that this was successful at least once because of the sequencing data, but we haven't been able to replicate it. Suspicion that the origional plasmid prep of pFTV may have been faulty due to the low concentration that was gathered makes us want to repeat this process. t

Week 1: May 28 - May 31
Tue, May 28: Today was the first day of work and I'm already so overwhelmed (in a good way). First, we had a general summer research orientation, and then we all met in the Wellesley HCI lab. After a general human-computer interaction overview (what we do in the lab, the general process, personal introductions, etc), we were assigned to projects and then given a list of background research articles to read. We spent most of the day reading the articles. I only have a very vague/basic idea of what I'm supposed to be doing, but I drew up some preliminary designs for the user interface for Eugene DeSyne. That took about 3-4 hours; it's really difficult to try to consolidate and synthesize so much information into one coherent interface. I showed it to Consuelo at the end of the day and she...well, she pretty much destroyed it. It sounds a bit harsh, but I'm actually really happy she did; it felt like a baptism into the church of software development.
Testing the effectiveness of different plasmids
Thur, May 30: We're at the MIT wet labs today, taking a sort of crash course on synthetic biology. The car-less campus-dwellers (myself included) had to take a 7:30 train into Boston with the other commuters; I'm 19 but this was one of the first times I've felt like an adult. In the lab, we met Natalie, the lovely woman behind BioBuilder , and we learned about lab safety procedures, general lab protocols, and famous previous iGEM experiments, like E. coli that alternatively smell like bananas and wintergreen, and bacteria that float when exposed to two types of light. In the wet lab itself, we worked with E. coli to make them turn different colours under light and we also tested the strength/effectiveness of different plasmids."

Education
From Lab For Society
Doing research and explore a new thing which will be useful for society is really important, but, the other thing that also important is the socialization to society. So, we bring synthetic biology to solve society’s problem.
We are visiting Indonesia Child Cancer Care Foundation in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. The foundation is established on the basis of concern for the rise of cancer that occurs in children. By the time we tell the management of the foundation that our focus was cervical cancer, surprisingly the foundation said that there are some children infected with cervical cancer, myom and a cyst ( to fyl further kept secret for the sake of patients ). The foundation also suggested students to socialize more often to society from all age  so cancer prevention can be done.
According to Ms. Novi, as Volunteer Coordinator, many cancer patients due to lack of knowledge about cancer in society. It causes people less careful and many new cancer cases have been detected at late stage. Therefore she really supports our research on early detection of cervical cancer.
We made several visits to the foundation. There, we aided by Gencorp organization from Surabaya in giving encouragement to cancer patients. We also discussed about things that we can do for cancer patients. One thing that we will never forget is that we were invited to visit hospitals and meet cancer patient directly. We are so far, only serves in the scale of laboratory in developing the treatment of cancer, a direct view of how the treatment of cancer research is needed. It gives us spirit in resolving this research. Be closer to patients aforetime and feel how this research has a lot of meaning.
Besides being active in activities at the foundation, we also give the material to friends in the traveling community GAMANANTA, which is a large community of traveler Indonesia, about how to maintain the health of vital organs during travel. This was greeted with great enthusiasm, we even double enthusiastic. We believe that, by sharing, the knowledge that we have will provide a double benefit to the community.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," gene cluster, gRNA is not expressed with any UTRs for proper interaction with Cas9. This leads to a large number of unknown factors in determining these degradation parameters. We decided to just use the average mRNA half-life for C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, and then convert it to the same degradation rate for each chloroplast by the formula
Eqn 10
However, no data on RNA half-lives in C. reinhardtii was found, so we used a value of t1/2 = 5.352 hours, taken by averaging the data for half-lives of several different RNA strands in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts [10], leading to an average RNA degradation rate of 0.129hr-1.
Cas9 translation rate was again very hard to parameterise without wet lab experiments. Translation rate is a highly variable parameter in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, acting as a hotspot for gene regulation. Translation is mediated by factors in the 5’ and 3’ UTRs of C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, however, experiment shows that steady state protein levels for the atpA gene are invariant of mRNA levels, suggesting that only a small portion of mRNA is actually transcribed at any given time [12].
Data exists on steady-state levels of VFP expressed under the atpA promoter (and associated UTRs) in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts [13], and we attempted to use this data, with the previously calculated degradation and transcription rates (VFP is also a highly stable protein in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, likely to “degrade by dilution”), to work backwards and calculate the translation rate. However, this yielded a value 0.00027 min-1, 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than translation rates we had seen elsewhere. This yielded unexpectedly long timescales for homoplasmy (see results section). Because of this, we instead used a value of 0.0057min-1, used by the 2014 Waterloo team for Cas9 production in Streptococcus aureus [14]. This is hopefully a more accurate estimation (having been calculated from peptide elongation and ribosome binding data) given that translational control in chloroplasts bears considerable similarity to its prokaryotic origins.
Based on personal correspondence with Prof. Howard Salis suggesting that Cas9 is a very stable molecule, the Cas9 degradation rate was taken to be the same as the C. reinhardtii cell division rate (“degradation by dilution”), for which"
INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", there are very few aptamers described for STI biomarkers. As an example, we could only find one aptamer well described in the literature to the HIV reverse transcriptase. As we didn’t have the time nor the resources to run a SELEX procedure[10], we wanted to use the software MAWS developed by the 2015 iGEM Heidelberg team Heidelberg. But this software didn’t gave us the expected results because of the inconsistency in the structure of the aptamer in the PDB file result. When we contacted them, they said that it was still under development.
Aptamers structures modeling
For the biomarkers HBsAg, 3 aptamers are described in the literature but we only knew their sequences and secondary structures [10].
Figure 13: Secondary structures of the aptamers A, B and C of HBsAg
But with our homemade software tool , we can predict their tertiary structure.
Figure 14: 3D structures of the HBsAg aptamers A (left), B (middle) and C (right)
These structures will be used for a docking procedure with the target protein to know the interactions.
Docking
Thanks to our webserver, we obtained the 3D structures of the 3 aptamers against the HBsAg. We used them in the docking webserver NPDock [11] to predict the interaction between the protein and the nucleic acid molecule.
Figure 15: Interactions between HBsAg and its 3 aptamers
We can see that aptamers A and B fix to the same domain of the protein but aptamer C is on the opposites side. So we chose aptamers A and C for our device.

We detected two absorption maxima at 505 nm and 590 nm. The absorption maximum at 590 nm was used by Texas to excite the RFP and measure its emission on 605 nm. Here we faced the first challenge. When exciting and measuring at the determined absorption and emission maxima, the received amount of the irradiated light was high, thus the measurement of the RFP-signal was impossible. To solve this problem we decreased the excitation wavelength by 5 nm to 585 nm and increased the emission wavelength by 5 nm to 615 nm. This way, the noise was completely removed and we could proceed the measurements.
To tackle this issue we decided to continue the measurements at the absorption maximum of 505 nm. This also leads to an excitement of the RFP and an emission maximum at 610 nm, but prevents the possibility of measuring the irradiated light.
Figure 1: Relative absorption and emission of RFP. The highest value equals one. The maximal absorption peaks at ~505 nm (grey) and at ~590 nm is another local maximum. The emission maximum lays at ~ 610 nm (red).
Next, we started the characterization of the CFP-unit of our improved part as a component of the aaRS-test system. Here we determined just one clear absorption maximum at 430 nm and one clear emission maximum at 475 nm (Figure 2). The two maxima were 45 nm apart, which allowed an easy excitement and emission process without any noise or measurement of the irradiating light.
Figure 2: Relative absorption and emission of CFP. The highest value equals one. The maximal absorption lays at ~430 nm (grey line). The emission maximum lays at ~475 nm (cyan line).
We then compared the intensity of the emitted light of the two different fluorescent protein units to determine if there were any differences. To do so we took care that the OD600 of the samples was similar and normalized the emitted light after excitation to the protein amount in the cell lysate. To our surprise, the signal we got from the CFP was about six times higher than of the highest RFP-signal (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Emission normalized to the amount of protein in the cell lysate of the two samples. The emisson of CFP after excitation at 430 nm is shown in cyan. RFP emission when excited at 505 nm is shown in red squares, when excited at 585 nm is shown in red triangles. The lower red course is"

In addition, we learned from other studies that bifidobacterium could act as a safe bacteria in human body, which only replicates in anaerobic region. That is to say, it could preferably reproduce in solid tumors in human bodies. It also have an inhibitory effect on the occurrence and development of a variety of tumors. HU promoter was also constructed into our device to up-regulate the expression of apoptin in bifidobacterium. After that, the sequence of PMB1, which has two orf for bifidobacterium, was constructed into the device to make sure the replication of the plasmid.
Once we determined the bacteria and the protein drug to use, we started to construct our device. However, after a long time of experiments, we gradually realized that the protein could not be secreted from the bifidobacterium, since the apoptin formed inclusion bodies in the bacteria. Considering this, we started to investigate the mechanism of secretion in bifidobacterium. We found several signal peptides that could assist secretion. However, the efficiency of these peptides remained unclear in the paper so it was difficult to choose. After long time of discussion, we selected two signal peptides, Tmp1 and Sec2, to add into our device and we decided to test the function of them in our later experiments.The two devices were constructed in the vector, PUC18, for the following steps.

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:
Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.

 September 3rd-6th
Jeff and Paula visited several colleges and gave talks to classes about the opportunities and benefits iGEM had to offer. Over 30 new undergraduates, from Freshmen to Seniors and consisting of dozens of majors showed interest in iGEM. Unfortunately for everyone, this made the application process very competitive! In the lab, We worked on making chemical competent DH5alpha cells and performing a transformation of both pREDKI and the florescent plasmids.
First Friday Art Trail
 September 7th
The Lubbock_TTU team went to the monthly First Friday Art Trail in Lubbock to showcase our research and educate the public about synthetic biology.Thousands of people come to the downtown arts district for live music, food trucks, and of course - spectacular art.   iGEM decided to take our own approach to art - streaking GFP transformed E.Coli onto plates in fantastic shapes! We also painted a few ""traditional"" paintings ourselves! We invited members of the community to view our artwork while we questioned them regarding basic knowledge of synthetic biology. Members of the team educated enthusiastic patrons about the field of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition, the protocols for the artwork, ethical dilemmas associated with biology, and the long term goals and effects of our project. Many people were surprised to find out that bacteria can be little factories for our medicines!

Crowdfunding
For our project, we needed a lot of money. We asked many of big companies to sponsor us; we even sold handmade burgers in front of the cafeteria. Still, in the beginning of our project we could not convince many sponsors to support us, so we decided to start a crowdfunding campaign that we even produced a video for, a video about our roughly sketched project idea.   Big thanks to Max, a student of the Film University Babelsberg, whose help eventually lead to this fantastic result:
Recording the video was quite difficult (for 2 minutes we needed a whole day) but also fun and great for team building. Everyone played a part in it. We also wrote the texts and propagated our campaign. In the end, we collected an unbelievable total of  1.820€.
The Fast Forward Science video competition is conducted annually since 2013. It is a project from science in dialogue and the association for the Promotion of Science and Humanities in Germany, where people from scientist to artist can send in their videos to current research topics with the condition to be entertaining, scientifically established and most of all coherent.
Our team participated in the Fast Forward Science 2017 competition by submitting our crowdfounding video. The winner of the competition was determined by people voting  and  the votes of the judging panel.

The promoter of interest in this matrix is pLas . The graph on top left corner shows the induction of pLas by its corresponding inducer (3OC12-HSL) binding the corresponding LasR . The red line shows the model whereas the datapoints shown in red represent the experimental results. The transition can be observed at a concentration of Las-AHL of about 2 nM. 3OC6-HSL binding RhlR does not induce the pLas . For the binding of 3OC12-HSL to RhlR a minor increase of fluorescence can be observed. The same can be observed for 3OC12-HSL binding to the LuxR as this combination is to a small degree inducing pLas . The most significant case of crosstalk when observing pLas is shown in the graph in the center of the matrix. It is clearly shown that 3OC6-HSL (Lux-AHL) binding to the corresponding LuxR regulator is able to induce pLas , resulting in fluorescence values of about 250 a.u.. This is the most severe case of crosstalk observed as the induction of pLas by the corresponding inducer and regulator molecule is not significantly different measured by fluorescence as induction by Lux-AHL binding the LuxR and subsequently pLas .  For C4-HSL binding the three regulators LasR , LuxR and RhlR and then the pLas no crosstalk can be observed.
Table 3 Crosstalk matrix for the promoter prhl ( BBa_I14017 )
In this set of experiments the promoter pRhl was tested for potential crosstalk. In the top left position we observe the induction of pRhl by C4-HSL bound to the regulator RhlR . The switching behaviour was observed at a C4-HSL concentration of 1 μM.   In the case of 3OC12-HSL binding the RhlR regulator and subsequently the promoter pRhl insignificant crosstalk has been observed. Severe crosstalk was observed in the case of 3OC6-HSL binding the RhlR regulator followed by induction of pRhl . The transition occurred at a concentration of the inducer molecule of 1 μM but compared to the reference curve a lower value of fluorescence per OD was observed (1000 a.u.). Another case of crosstalk with the pRhl was detected with 3OC12-HSL binding to the corresponding LasR regulator followed by inducing the promoter pRhl . Here switching occurred at a concentration 1"

“When I attended the celebration of science, I knew that people could have concerns about genetically engineered organisms (GMOs) as they can ear and read a lot about it in the media. So I tried to start the discussion by a first focus on potential applications. For example, it would be useful to have organisms that could participate to environmental cleanup, drug development or nutrition of populations in developing countries. Then, I presented Synthetic Biology as an emerging technology to get efficient AND safe biological constructs that would fulfil these goals. I specifically insisted on safety and ethic questions. For example, I insisted that for our project, the biological constructs are manipulated in laboratory and can’t spread in nature without control. I also insisted on the fact that as an emerging technology, Synthetic Biology is deeply engaged into the reflexion about safety, as well as the economical and ethical aspects of science.“
Conclusion: our 3 key rules for a successful communication on Synthetic Biology:
After debriefing on both our readings and our experiences of talking to a broad audience about our project, here are the 3 guidelines that appeared essential to us for a successful discussion:
- FIRST, THE MESSENGER:
Identify yourself as a scientist. It is important that the public identify you as trusted source. From different surveys, Academic scientists and researchers are perceived as a trustworthy group of expert that work on maximizing technologic advancement while minimizing the risks.
- SECOND, THE MESSAGE:
The language has to be carefully chosen, with simple and unambiguous words ADAPTED to the audience. Jargon and abbreviations have to be avoided, as they tend to provoke misunderstandings and negative feelings in the audience. Also a metaphor can be useful, but be careful about the context, as it can be rephrased to a more sensationalistic message by media. Credibility is the key, as you want to present as balanced message between risks and benefits.
- THIRD, THE DISCUSSION:
You have to be prepared to have a skeptical audience, tricky questions about ethic, safety and responsibilities for this emerging technology. You may even get very negative feedbacks on your presentation: it’s good to know it before, so you can be prepared! While we communicated on synthetic biology, we tried to stick to the facts. We also prepared some “harsh” questions using the Guide mentioned above (see p°23).
Overall, we felt that it was an amazing experience to be able to share our vision of our project with people, and to get their interest on the emerging field of Synthetic Biology.
It definitely was an interesting part of our"

THE iGEM COMMUNITY
iGEM creates its own world and research community which emphasises sharing of knowledge and helping each other. Even though iGEM is a competition, the teams are in close contact with each other and try to promote their superior goal to communicate synthetic biology to the outside world.
In our case we attended a workshop hosted by the DTU team for all Danish teams in order to learn more about basic biochemical labwork. In addition, we are hosting an ethics workshop for the Danish teams to discuss ethics in relation to synthetic biology and our projects. Click here to read more about our workshop.  These meetings are helpful to gain new contacts, learn something about lab techniques and are serving a social purpose which makes participating in iGEM unique. For teams which are not so close physically it is harder to meet and communication is basically over the internet. For example, we have helped the University of Virginia’s 2014 iGEM team filling in a survey about synthetic biology. This gives them the opportunity to collect data throughout the world with less effort while creating are more complete picture of the situation worldwide.

8. Spectral assay of the crude bilin mixture is performed at this point (use a 1/100 dilution) and a typical yield of 4 umol phycocyanobilin per 6 g dry weight Spirulina can be obtained.
9. This crude phycocyanobilin is quite pure but can be further purified by C18 reverse phase HPLC using a Varian 5000 liquid chromatograph and a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 x 150 mm; 5 um particle diameter).  The solvent system used was ethanol/acetone/water/acetic acid, 19:14:66:1 (v/v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and the column eluate was monitored at 370 nm (Cornejo et al, 1992).
10. HPLC-purified 3E-phycocyanobilin was concentrated using a C18 Sep-Pak as described above, dried in vacuo and stored at -20oC.  Before use, phycocyanobilin was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide to a concentration of 1-1.5 mM.
11. An aliquot of each stock solution was diluted 200-fold into 2% HCl/methanol to estimate the bilin concentration spectrophotometrically.  The molar absorption coefficient of 47,900 M-1 cm-1 at 374 nm for 3E-phycocyanobilin (Cole, WJ, DJ Chapman, and HW Siegelman. 1967. The structure of phycocyanobilin. J. Am. Chem.

Making Molecular Biology Easier
We have designed a novel standardized assembly system, called “Plug 'n' Play with DNA” where ready to use biological parts can be gathered without the use of restriction enzymes and ligase. This will make cloning faster and assembly of expression vectors possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergilli ready to plug 'n' play. You can find more information about how this standard works here .
A Reporter System
As proof of concept we have created a reporter system that can be used for anything from monitoring gene expression to determination of protein localization. We expressed and localized fluorescent proteins in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans and the mammalian cell line U-2 OS with great success.
Flexibility
Standardization entails rigidity. Therefore we have written a guide that allows the researcher to customize the system, so proteins can be assembled seamless, multiple mutations can be introduced in one round of cloning etc. The only limitation to this is your creativity.
Applications
Here you can learn more about the numerous applications of the Plug’n’Play with DNA assembly standard and the research areas, where this system is especially advantageous.
Data Page
You can find an overview of our project on our Data Page . Here you also find our favorite submitted biobricks, and the biobricks we characterized during the summer.
Achievements
Designing a novel assembly standard and creating a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells are our main achievements. You can read more about our accomplishments on this page .

Next to dogs, rats are trained to detect land mines by the company APOPO [15]. Another method in use to detect land mines is the application of mechanical systems that detect and detonate land mines. These machines are usually armored vehicles driving through a SHA/CHA, triggering the mines. These vehicles can be controlled manually or be under remote control. This method is found to be not accurate enough and is therefore only used in combination with manual detection methods. Next to that, this method is extremely expensive and is not suitable for all terrain types [16].
Other, less widely used methods for technical survey include Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR), Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), X-ray backscatter techniques, infrared/hyperspectral systems, acoustic/seismic methods, chemical methods to detect land mine compounds, Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR). Also, bacterial methods based on fluorescence have been developed. These methods are dependent on introducing GMOs into the environment and are therefore met with lots of resistance [17].
Once a suspicious object is discovered, the ground around the object is carefully excavated and, if it appears to be a mine, it is either blown up in situ or defused and destroyed at the end of day [18].

2)the PCR techniques which follow in accordance with the sample preparation.
2.2.1 BROTH-PCR METHOD
This method involves the use of enrichment broth, which will show preference towards nuc-carriers with mecA in the same cell (Milsson, Alexandersson and Ripa, 2005.) Samples from patients would be taken and inoculated into the above-mentioned enrichment broth and incubated overnight. Results could be obtained on the next day using PCR. The nuc-specific primers which have been used in previous trials with the method are (Fang and Hedin, 2003):
a. NUC1 (5-GCG ATT GAT GGT GAT ACG GTT-3)
b. NUC2 (5-AGC CAA GCC TTG ACG AAC TAA AGC-3)
The broth PCR technique has been tested to give 93.3% sensitivity, 89.6% specificity, 31.8% positive predictive value, and 99.6% negative predictive value.  As the percentage reliability of negative results is very high, especially as compared to that of the positive predictive value, the application of the broth-PCR method will be able to report the negative samples on the morning after testing. This will, in the long run, save as much as 84.9% of the cost and labor which is associated with the necessity of further testing (Fang and Hedin, 2003).
2.2.2 IDI-MRSA DETECTION METHOD
The IDI (Infectio Diagnostic Inc) nasal swab method provides an assay, which completely removes the need for inoculation in liquid or solid media. The assay allows for the performance of PCR directly from a nasal swab sample, using reagents and methods provided by the manufacturer (Infectio Diagnostic Inc). While sample preparation differentiates, PCR methodology applied is quite similar to the one described in section 2.2.1 above. There are, however, distinct differences between the results produced by the two methods. For one, the IDI-MRSA detection method can be complete in as little as 1.5hrs post sample collection, versus next day with the above-mentioned method, and at least 24hrs with the plating methods. As well, The IDI-MRSA provides 91.7% sensitivity, 93.5% specificity, 82.5% positive predictive value, and 97.1% negative predictive value when compared to culture-based methods (Warren et al, 2004.)

Funding
In addition to being an information Mecca the internet is its own virtual gold mine. Crowd sourced funding organizations like Kickstarter5 and Indiegogo6 have already enabled numerous DIY technology developments. Along these lines, more conventional solicitation methods could improved by coupling local advertising with a web presence. A good website which displays the lab's initiatives and results gives potential donors a better idea of the cause they are supporting. Additionally, the virtual nature of online transactions enables DIY laboratories to communicate with and accept donations from  interested parties anywhere in the world.
Monetizing the educational component of a synthetic Biology DIY laboratory is another proven successful funding model. BOSSLAB5, Boston's open source science center, exemplifies this approach  by charging a $200 class fee for the safety & techniques training class it administers to potential  volunteers.2 The group also offers weekend workshops for unaffiliated members of the community for a  fee. Alternatively, the membership model similar to a gym service or professional organization has also  proven effective. BUGSS (Baltimore Underground Science Space)7 charges a membership fee of $85 a  month to keep its operations running.2
Regulatory Compliance
The lack of DIY specific legislation is sensible in light of the fact amateur scientists lack the  resources to be capable of harming to the public or the environment. A 2010 report from the  Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues summarized the limitations of amateur  science by recognizing costs are too high to develop a new organism in a home–based lab1. Even if  DIY labs were capable of researching projects with potentially serious complications, the desire to  harm society at large is an exceedingly rare characteristic of members of a generally good natured  community.
Additionally, independent innovation and inventing are part of the fabric of America. A  multitude of Constitutional (Free Speech, Freedom of Expression & Freedom of Association) issues  and practical barriers discourage regulating a dispersed industry akin to home woodworking and  gardening1. In lieu of aggressive, prohibitive regulation, governments have taken an outreach and  education approach. Lawmakers realize harsh policing would push even legitimate, well-intentioned  DIY scientists underground. Alternatively, maintaining a dialogue with scientists promotes disclosure  and puts the government in the best position to respond just in case a benign research project takes a serious turn. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), a subsidiary of the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Biotechnology Activities is federally administering the issue. In their 2011 report, the board promoted this culture of responsibility over regulation. Either way there are"

Twelve chromoproteins that were expressing good color in our cultures were selected for this assay and can be seen below in Figure 9. After this, the glass petri dish was removed from heat and 20 µL of DI water were added to each of the chromoproteins. This was done on the theory that the chromoproteins had not denatured, but rather had lost their color because all of the water molecules which were supporting the structure of their barrel had been driven out by the heat. As can be seen in the image below, some of the chromoproteins regained color when water was added, but this color is different from the starting color. This could be due to the fact that the heating caused the chromoprotein structure to destabilize to a lower energy structure which causes it to have a different color when the water is added to support the barrel.

Figure 10: The glass petri dish above was heated to 85 °C which caused all of the chromoproteins to lose their color as is seen below.
Figure 11: Chromoproteins from figure 10 after being brought back to room temperature.
In order to investigate the role that water molecules play in the color change we were observing in our chromoproteins in response to heat, we used a lyophilizer to remove the water from the chromoproteins without heating them. A lyophilizer is a device that operates at sub freezing temperatures under a vacuum which causes water to move directly from the solid phase to the vapor phase.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Result_-_-_TEXT.html,", the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second worm buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!
The Global Worming Problem and Society
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Figure 7: Some members in the team with our mascot Gromit.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.
Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future of iGEM
In iGEM Uppsala we are worried about the future of iGEM members wellbeing and have seen multiple cases of burnouts. This is something that has to be changed to make iGEM sustainable for the future. To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on"
OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a few presentations to not only educate our community's leaders, but also to help in our fundraising goals. We spoke with our local Rotary Club chapter, including presenting to their members at a breakfast meeting. We received a gracious donation from them for our efforts to solve a community issue, and got some valuable mentorship from them regarding how to approach our ongoing fundraising plan.
We also presented to our Mayor and Town Council for the second year in a row. This presentation allowed us to teach our community leaders about iGEM, to highlight a new avenue to a potential solutions, and to celebrate our educational achievements. These community leaders also encouraged us to apply for a Town grant, which we eventually earned which helped cover costs of equipping the lab.
Picture taken by a Geekstarter/Alberta Innovates representative at the Alberta High School Jamboree.
This year our teachers worked with Dr. Magda Pop (a Geekstarter Mentor) and pushed for the creation of an Alberta curriculum centered around synthetic biology. This curriculum has been approved (LINK HERE) providing what we think is the FIRST opportunity for high school students to earn credits towards graduation while studying synthetic biology and competing in iGEM!
Early this year, one of our students, Talia Dixon presented at the Alberta Teachers’ Association Science Council Conference held in Banff, Alberta, along withmentor Dr. Magda Pop and Mr. Arvisais.  This allowed them to share the learning opportunities in iGEM and show many teachers that their students can truly take part in this amazing competition.
Our 2 teacher advisors also presented at the Alberta Teachers’ Association Annual Teachers’ Convention.  The talk was entitled “E. Coli Happens: Synthetic Biology as a Ticket to MIT”, and was open to high school educations across the province.  They even brought innoculation loops and made teachers practice streaking plates.
Our last outreach mission is still in progress.  One of our teachers,  Ms. Puurunen,  will present a Ted Talk at TedX Canmore in October 2015.  Her presentation will spread the word about iGEM, our team, the project, synthetic biology, and elevating science education in general.  Ideally, her talk will reach a global audience!

Miya Coimbra
I am a junior at Canyon Crest Academy and my interest in bioengineering led me to my involvement in iGEM since sophomore year. Although when we first started the project we had thought it would be mostly wet lab work, it turned into a computational project, which has been a great experience. iGEM has exposed me to another side of bioengineering: the computational aspect. Learning how to use programs such as VMD and NAMD to simulate how molecules interact with one another especially interested me. It was a different way of conducting research that I hadn’t thought of pursuing before. In the future, I would like to continue to study in the STEM field with computational modelling as an important aspect in my research.
Julia Wisnia
I am a rising junior at Canyon Crest Academy.  My passion for biological sciences lead me to iGEM; I was excited to engage in the topics my advisors study.  This year I was introduced to computational methods for performing experiments that I had recently thought to be strictly wet lab.  Our mentors taught us to use programs such as VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) to model glucose and its sensor in a variety of environments.  I hope to continue on to the biomedical engineering field using both classical and computational approaches.  I would like to continue to pursue the construction of new biosensors in my future work.
Olivia Shiah
I am a junior at Canyon Crest Academy. I have always had a passion for biology, and iGEM provided me with a chance to experience the process which researchers go through when developing and testing new biosensors. iGEM also introduced me to the computational aspect of biology, a field I had not been familiar with prior to joining the team. The project allowed me to observe the efficiency in which VMD and NAMD were able to accurately portray molecules in numerous conditions, a part of our project which captured my interest. iGEM has encouraged me to pursue my interest in biology, particularly the computational aspect.

Hao. We decided to take consideration of the structure of complex, which solves problems we encountered when handling reactions with regard to complex molecules.
Liao Chen (7.21): We decided to model the species (either complex or simple species) using two data
structures:
ChainList is used to describe chains of DNA, RNA or Protein molecules. Small molecules are also
of such structure with only one element on one chain.
Tree structure is used to describe binding state of elements of different chains. Children nodes
bind with each other and form their parent node. Thus, other than chains, a species has its binding state forest, which composed of many trees mentioned above.
Liao Chen (7.22): We decided to store data of species and reactions in XML format.
Liao Chen (7.23): To search reactions of species includes, we need powerful support of species and
reactions database. But first, we need a database manager to manage our XML data files, which must provide query operation of data we want.
Liao Chen (7.24): We find it! Oracle Berkeley DB XML! It is a Native XML Database. It is capable of
storing and indexing collections of XML documents in both native and mapped forms for highly efficient querying, transformation, and retrieval.

SynBio Map Entries of South American Countries
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research. It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology around the world.
United States has the greater numbers of entries in SynBio map, having 395 entries by 2014. Otherwise, South America countries together have only 3, all situated in Brazil. This indicates that the United States is an important player on the global synthetic biology stage - ""Synthetic biology project"", and that South America is still a beginner.
Participation in iGEM Competition
Teams all around the world have participated in the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. In this competition, teams apply synthetic biology methods to develop their projects. Because iGEM competition and synthetic biology are closely related, we have searched for information on the number of teams that took part from South America to compare.
According to the numbers of iGEM fellows in the past years, the competition has been known by South America countries lately. Uruguay and Peru have never been in the competition, but Colombia was the first of South America to participate, in the very first year of this competition. Since there, Colombia has been participating every year, the only exception was 2010. Chile started to participate in 2012, just like Argentina. The first year for Brazilians was in 2009, and we had 3 teams in the competition last year. This was the maximum of a South America country. When compared to USA, it’s possible to notice an increasing trend of team number participating in iGEM competition. Brazil is the only country in South America which started to establish an increasing number of teams year by year.
South America Companies related to Synthetic Biology

Introduction to Synthetic Biology
The 2016 Macquarie iGEM team had the incredible opportunity to be a part of the MQ ‘taster day’ for senior high school students who were considering a science degree. We wanted to give them a taste of university science and tell them all about synthetic biology.
The day consisted of two parts: An introduction lecture on synthetic biology and a lab class exploring DNA and scientific lab protocols.  The lecture was presented by four members of the 2016 iGEM team, each enthusiastically selling the wonders of synthetic biology and its limitless potential. The lab class was a chance for the high school students to get a taste of university science and have the opportunity to talk to science students nearing the end of their degrees to get opinions and advice on their own future studies.
The Lab
  
The lab component consisted of a rotation between four activities. These included:
Bacterial artwork – plating colourful bacteria on agar plates to demonstrate how we make cultures in the lab.
Pipetting practice – students got the opportunity to use micropipettes (which they don’t have access to in high school) and even used them to load a gel.

Chlorophyll investigation – students crushed spinach leaves and performed chlorophyll chromatography to investigate the different components. They also viewed chlorophyll under a UV lamp and discussed its fluorescence
Students were surveyed after their experiences with 100% of students who attended the lecture rating it a 4 or 5 out of 5, and 89% of students rated the lab class as a 4 or 5 out of 5 for being enjoyable and informative. They also had some interesting suggestions for applications of synthetic biology, including; solving climate change by creating renewable energy, creating crops to grow in desert conditions, fixing cells damaged in nerve injuries, and increasing the nutrition of food to help poorer communities.   The students really engaged with all the activities we had on over the day and had a lot of questions about synthetic"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

BIOTEC_Dresden,2010,Team:BIOTEC Dresden#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," have already completed my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology in Austria. Currently I am pursuing the Master’s Program “Molecular Bioengineering” at the TU Dresden. Furthermore I enjoy Beachvolleyball, Tennis, Frisbee and basically any sport that can be done outdoors. Even though it might not seem special, for me it is the perfect balance to my studies. Taking part in the iGEM competition is very challenging; yet it allows me to follow the whole pathway of a project from idea to final presentation. Besides the professional experience you gain it also shows one its personal strengths and weaknesses which I think is advantageous to know so early in ones carrier. For my future I hope to someday work in the biotechnological or pharmaceutical industry.
Charanya Sampathkumar
I am currently a first year student in the Masters program of Nanobiophysics at the TU Dresden. I have a Bachelors degree in Biotechnology and I hope to pursue a research career. Working in a couple of labs has helped me hone my lab work skills and has enhanced my knowledge in several interdisciplinary fields of science including biophysics and neurobiology. iGEM has been a great learning experience for me so far and I see it as a fantastic opportunity to get to know the demands of real life research. Besides science, I spend most of my free time listening to music, reading books of non – fiction genre and of late, travelling and exploring new places.
Lucas Schirmer
I am an eighth semester student entering the final year of my diploma degree in Biology at the TU Dresden. When I first heard about iGEM, I was very intrigued. The idea of building a synthetic organism to solve problems in normal life presents itself as a major potential for molecular biology. What I like about iGEM is the idea of abstraction. By reducing informational weight and using common standards, we are able to accelerate the development of new synthetic devices and solutions. I am particularly fond of computers and programming. In the future, I hope to pursue a PhD at an interesting research facility.

I have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Honors Cell Biotechnology at the University of Alberta, Canada. During my degree, I have had the chance to take part in two projects that have greatly piqued my interest in biological research. The first experience was studying macrophage development in the lab of Dr. D. Barreda. The second was my participation in the iGEM competition as a member of the University of Alberta team last year.

University of Virginia’s iGEM team: Collaborative Survey
The University of Virginia’s 2014 iGEM team designed a short online survey in order to learn about prevailing attitudes toward synthetic biology in the general public. Through this survey, they aimed to help future teams develop targeted educational events regarding synthetic biology.
We (the iGEM Calgary team) helped out by surveying over 40 people during our outreach events at the Telus Sparks Centre! Many people we encountered had misconceptions about synthetic biology. We were able to explain to them the significance of synthetic biology in medicine, the food industry and the environment. We are looking forward to hearing about the results of the survey and the University of Virginia’s iGEM teams suggestions for future educational events!
University of Columbia: Low budget iGEM Contest
The University of Columbia’s team  challenged  iGEM teams to figure out a cost effective way to transform bacteria, extract DNA and amplify genes of interest in order to make molecular biology globally available. Of course team Calgary accepted the challenge! We attempted to make competent cells using calcium supplements available at the local pharmacy.
Attempt #1:   There were many types and blends of calcium supplements at the pharmacy. Our first choice was calcium-carbonate.  We soon discovered calcium carbonate has very low solubility which led to unsuccessful transformation.
Attempt #2: Our second choice was to use calcium citrate which is physiologically compatible and has a relatively high solubility. Physiological compatibility was important because we didn't want anything that could potentially harm our bacteria. Unfortunately, the pills contained a lot of filler,"

Some of the activities our students engaged in include building DNA double-helices using Twizzlers (left) and creating their own eukaryotic cell model using dessert treats (center-left). The main highlight of our 3-day course was extracting DNA from bananas (right).
Overall, the students were lots of fun to teach, and consisted of very bright young individuals and budding scientists who asked very advanced and probing questions for their age. We received great reviews from the students on the course and it was a pleasure to teach students so eager to participate and learn!

QGEM Synbio Interview Series
This year, Queen's iGEM directed a two-part interview series to suppliment our project focus on novel drug discovery and optimization, touching on overarching questions related to biosynthetic production, drug design, metabolite reprogramming, and much more. We explored these topics through the perspectives of both research and the industry, integrating themes such as innovation, design, commercialization, and future outlook of drug development and biosynthetic engineering. In addition, we welcome future iGEM teams to utilize this interview series to suppliment related projects!

Once lysed and ultra-filtrated (to remove small molecules), 0.4nM of Rapamycin was added together with TMB substrate solution (with heme supplementation) into the cell lysate for the induction of protein-protein interaction and measurement of HRP activity. The plate was then incubated under 37°C for 5min before adding the Stop solution.
Value of OD450 obtained after adding the Stop Solution showed significant variation between the Rapamycin positive group and the Rapamycin negative group. Thus then validated the function of this part. (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Rapamycin-induced sHRP-N-FRB/sHRP-C-FKBP interaction.
(A) Schematic representation of the rapamycin induced protein-protein interaction. The adding of rapamycin would induce the interaction between FRB and FKBP, thus shortened the range between split-HRP fragments and reconstruct its structure for substrate processing. (B) HRP activity assay showing the fluorescent intensity with/without Rapamycin induction. For Fold change OD450, OD450of the group without Rapamycin induction was set arbitrarily as 1.0, and the levels of the other groups were adjusted correspondingly. The concentration of Rapamycin used in the experiment was 40nM. This experiment was run in three parallel reactions, and the data represent results obtained from at least three independent experiments. **p<0.01.
Collectively, this is an elaborate part for an optimal split-HRP reporting system, which was easy to be edit as a functional protein-protein interaction system.

RE. coli
Team RE. coli is the University of Alberta's 2009 International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team.  We are dedicated to the advancement of Synthetic Biology through the development of a reduced-genome model organism, Escherichia coli, via novel DNA assembly techniques.
Synthetic Biology
Synthetic Biology sits at the interface between biology and engineering.  Its goal is to produce modular biological circuits of increasing sophistication and usefulness.  Its guiding principle is to avoid biochemical complexity in favour of well-understood, well-characterized, and well-behaved molecular components that can be reliably assembled in a variety of ways. Synthetic Biology sits at the interface between biology and engineering.  Its goal is to produce modular biological circuits of increasing sophistication and usefulness.  Its guiding principle is to avoid biochemical complexity in favour of well-understood, well-characterized, and well-behaved molecular components that can be reliably assembled in a variety of ways.
Remarkably, the rapid rise of ""SynBio"" to prominence has been catalysed by an international undergraduate competition held annually at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston called the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) Jamboree.  At iGEM, student teams are evaluated not only on the originality and execution of their projects but also on a variety of other criteria that include: the ability to communicate complicated ideas effectively, adherence to ethical and legal principles, and the relevance of their work to real-world problems.  This year our team will explore the extent to which E. coli can be driven by a simplified artificial chromosome that incorporates features of design that include modularity of gene organization, standardization of gene expression, and simplification of the genetic code.

a The sequence of each pBAD promoter characterized. To use this simply produce a primer with the promoter sequence you wish in a tail. Replace the old promoter in your system e.g. BBa_K808000 with the new and see the change.
b Inducibility = Induced Strength divided by leakiness.
Sequences
We sequenced and aligned the promoters that are shown above.  The sequences show conservation in the -10 and -35 regions by design.  Within the -10 region, we allowed for two random weak (A or T) bases.  We do not see a strong preference for A over T or vice versa.  Within the regions where we allowed any base, we see a preference for C over the other bases.  This could be due to bias during synthesis.
Example of use
The tight inducible pBAD promoter was used in our ""Hello World project"" to regulate the expression of GFP SF, which was tagged with a signal peptide to direct it into the periplasm. Production and folding of GFP SF is faster than the transport system of E. coli, which leads to undesired accumulation of GFP SF in the cytoplasm. Only when using a promoter with low leakiness it is possible to translocate a significant fraction of GFP SF after its production has been switched off. Thereby we get a clear signal from the periplasm with low interference from the cytoplasm.
To incorporate the new promoter sequence, we ordered primers containing the sequence as a tail and used USER cloning to insert it into our construct.
Zoomed in picture of ""Hello World"" transformants, showing a clear separation of green and red fluorescence. GFP is primarily located in the periplasm while RFP is located in the cytoplasm.

As mentioned above, the fed-batch facilitate high yield of dry cells. The experimental data from the research  paper showed that a concentration of 75 [g dry cells/L] was reached after 27 [h]. This was deemed an   appropriate level to start induction. The results also showed that substrate was fed in a rate, where   glucose did not accumulate in the broth, and furthermore that the levels of acetate after an initial rise was non-  existent in the end of the fed-batch phase, see figure 5: Batch fermentation.

The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzed reaction is match with Ping-pong bi-bi mechanism.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
(3)KS Part
The leading role of the KS part is Ketocaylsynthase, KS domain. Its last step is activation of propionyl groups. AT domains in Module 1 or Module 2 activate the propionyl groups in (2S)Methylmalonyl-CoA (details in Loading Part). Afterwards, KS domains combine the extended units anchored on the ACP domains belonging to the Modules which the KS domains belong to with the polyketide chains anchored on the ACP domains belonging to the former Modules (or Loadings). Then new polyketide chains form and are anchored the ACP domains belonging to the Modules which the KS domains belong to.
The function of KS domain is combining the propionyl group with acetyl group at the end of the polyketide chain by forming the C—C bond. In KS domain catalyzed reactions, polyketide chains are transferred from ACP doamains belonging to the former Module (or Loading) onto KS domains, and then occur decarboxylic reaction with the extended units anchored on the ACP domains belonging to the Modules which the KS domains belong to. As a result, the polyketide chains are elongated.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
(4)KR Part
The process of KR domain catalyzed reactions is a little more complex. Its leading role is KR domain. The function of KR domain is deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the β-hydroxyl ester bond. In KR domain catalyzed reactions, the carbonyl groups of polyketide chains anchored on the ACP domains are combined with the specific binding sites of KR domains through weak chemical bonds. Then the electron cloud in the carbonyl groups is  moving towards oxygen atoms so that the carbon atoms have net positive charge. At this time, NADPHs have a chance to bind to the polyketide chains and form instable ternary complexes. In order to reduce the inner energy of this ternary complexes and run towards stable, NADPHs provide hydride ions and KR domains provide protons for the complexes and"

Up to now my work is focused on the trace metal behavior in the environment and their interaction with dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.
Now my work at the LGCIE laboratory is mainly to study trace metals/ organic matter behavior in various waste and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have a working approach angle allowing the improvements of our environment thanks to our complementarity.
Philippe Oger
Also known as the man under pressure because I work on high-pressure adaptation in microorganisms. My research is focussed on adaptation mechanisms in microbes from the deep-biosphere, and mainly in Archaea isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems. Our aim is to identify and quantify what genetic modifications make our favorite model, Pyrococcus yanaosii, require 500 times the atmospheric pressure for growth, when everybody else's favorite lab rat, E. coli, cannot even growth at the same hydrostatic pressure. My teaching activities at the University of Lyon deal with petroleum reservoir microbiology and the use of biosignatures for the study of past and present environments.
Agnès Rodrigue
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering  and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in  bacterial adaptation to a  metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also  the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.

2.1 Growth in mimic physical environment
      Firstly, we prepared                                 competent cells of MC4100 based on TSS                                 method and transformed competent cells with plasmid bearing BBa_J04450 by KCM                                 transformation method.
      Artificial gastral juice and intestinal juice were                                 prepared according to the literature                                 (Table 2). Due to our constructions were in different strains, we tested the growth                                 condition of them respectively. mRFP (BBa_J04450) was used as reporter.
      We first transformed the competent DH5 alpha and                                 MC4100 with plasmid provided in                                 Competent Cell Kit, cultivated them under 37 degrees centigrade overnight. Then single                                 colonies were picked based on colony color. Liquid culture was made and incubated                                 overnight. After incubation for about 12~16h, culture was sampled and original OD600 was                                 measured. Then culture was diluted until OD600 = 0.02, which relied on calculation excel                                 of InterLab measurement offered on official website. 1mL Diluted culture was allocated                                 into a 10mL tube mixed with 1mL artificial gastral juice or intestinal juice. Nine                                 identical tubes were prepared to do the test at an interval of 3 hours from time 0 to                                 time 24 hours. Three biological replicates were made and growth curves were plotted                                 after measurement. A control group cultivated in 2mL LB was manipulated in the same way.                                 Corresponding concentration of Chloromycetin was premixed in the culture medium.
Figure 1. Growth curve in 2mL LB / 10mL Tube                                     Error bars were plotted based on three biological replicants.
Figure 2. Growth Curve in 1ml AG +1ml LB / 10ml Tube                                     AG is short for artificial gastral juice. Error bars were plotted based on three                                     biological replicants.
Figure 3. Growth Curve in 1ml AI +1ml LB / 10ml Tube                                     AI is short for artificial intestinal juice. Error bars were plotted based on three                                     biological replicants.
      According to our results, strain MC4100 grows                                 relatively better than DH5 alpha in pure LB. Compared with culture in pure LB, it is                                 easy to see that the growth of constructed strain will be influenced in either                                 artificial gastral juice or artificial intestinal juice. We can also get the conclusion                                 that MC4100 is more"

endo-beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (BglS) from Bacillus Subtilis 168
BglS This gene encodes an endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (bglS), which is from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis subtilis 168.  The enzyme will hydrolyze and thereby cleave internal 1,4 linkages adjacent to 1,3 linkages.
BglS
Usage and Biology The substrates vulnerable to the bglS encoded enzyme are mixed linked beta-glucans. These glucans would have 1,3 and 1,4 beta linkages within the polysaccharide linking together the glucose monomers. Examples of these glucans can be found in oats, maize, and barley.

beta-galacturonidase (YesZ) from Bacillus Subtilis 168
yesZ The enzyme acts on the terminal end of side chains of Rhamnogalacturonan I Pectin, releasing the free galactose. This gene has been isolated from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis subtilis 168. The enzyme yesZ has beta-galactosidase (beta-galacturonidase) activity, cleaving (1→4)-β-D-galactans to produce single galactose molecules from RG I Pectin.
Usage and Biology Pectin is a component of the primary cell wall of plants. As galactose can be metabolized by the human body and by animals, it is an alternative to the usual target of nutrition/energy boosts in biotechnology, glucose.

Collaborations
This year, we've done a lot of works on human practices with painstaking effort. In addition, we consider seriously and extensively whether our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. Therefore, we designed and carried out numerous human practices around our project, and we integrate a lot of human practices considerations into every part of our project. Besides, we also conduct public engagement and education activities to have conversations with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM.
During this year, we collaborated with so many teams in project design, experiments, human practices and other parts. We got a lot of help, thanks all those amazing teams so much!
SCU_China
As two teams in the same school, we had deep and close cooperation with SCU_China.
RiboJ
At the beginning of our project, SCU_China’s team leader Zhu Junyan privately pointed out to us that to better measure the promoters, we could use the Insulator RiboJ to get different proteins in approximately the same expression level, and her suggestion was adopted.
Sleep center
The project of SCU_China this year is about melatonin and sleep. In order to get first-hand clinical data and advice from doctors about their project, we helped them get into contact with doctors working in Center of sleep, West China Hospital, Sichuan University.
iSWU 2017
SCU_China attended the China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU) this year. We discussed our projects together, shared different opinions and gave each other suggestions to improve our projects.
ACMA 2017
We co-hosted ACMA 2017 with SCU_China.
In the academic salon, we presented to the participants the project of Vilnius - Lithuania 2016 and the project of Groningen 2012, answered questions about these two projects and offered some skills in project design.
Our team leader showed up as a judge of the preliminary contest, grading, reviewing and asking questions about the participating projects.

5/30 - Research topic selected
Group 1
1. Hydrocarbon absorption
Because it is hydrophobic, it will not be difficult for it to diffuse through the membrane and the cell wall.
Other teams for example: used AlnA ptn to increase alkane solubility.
AlkB2 and ladA were used as transporters. We can try to knock-out those genes that enable microorganisms to degrade alcohol to keep the alcohol stored within them.
Suggestion 1) HAE1 gene, AcrAB genes are an option
Suggestion 2) Increasing absorption rate: increase metabolic rate to speed up the rate at which alkane is degraded.
Suggestion 3) Instead of looking for a suitable transporter, focus on increasing efficiency in synthesizing and extracting wax.
2. Determine the types of enzymes in E.coli
3. Study about alkane monooxygenase
4. Using and synthesizing of wax
Directly injecting substrate is meaningless. Find out if we can use various substrates.
Acyl-CoA reductase(AcrM) is the key enzyme.
5. Increasing efficiency
Overexpression of the gene AcrM
Modification of inclusion body
Group 2
1. Microorganism that synthesizes biosurfactants and degrades hydrocarbons
Detection of soil contaminants; Because soil condition is difficult to determine through naked eyes, detection is important. (Removal of contaminant and thereby facilitating soil’s recovery)
Absorbing the contaminant
Surfactant expression: Green Fluorescent Protein; House-keeping gene expression: Red Fluorescent Protein
Because many species of bacteria can synthesize biosurfactant, it may be possible to degrade various contaminants.
Reason for TU Delft’s unsuccessful experiment: injecting too many genes all at once interferes with the regulation system, resulting in non-favorable results.
- Should we insert the genes all in one cell?
Heterogeneous genes, if they are expressed at the same time, may cluster. Furthermore, the organism will not be able to sustain and survive a modification of its membrane.
Facilitation mechanism: Incorporation of a regulation system into TU Delft's mechanism. Insertion of nitrogen fixation gene to bring about a more fertile soil. However, a downside to this method is that a plant must be nearby. Searching for a microorganism that is independent of plants may"

3 g/L sodium acetate.
Do you have enough nitrogen?
In order to characterize our nitrogen-sensitive construction, we carried out an experiment as follows: our E.coli strain carrying the ZsYellow1 gene under the control of the glnA promoter was grown on LBA medium (until an OD of 1.5) in order the bacteria to have sufficient amounts of proteins and nitrogen compounds. Then, cells were pelleted and resuspended in a medium lacking nitrogen. After that, values of OD and fluorescence intensity were measured at different times. As a control, we resuspended one of the aliquots in medium containing 10 g/L of ammonium sulphate.
As expected according to the underlying molecular mechanism , nitrogen starvation induces the expression of the fluorescent protein:
Figure 4. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of the culture. Measures were taken 60 min after the resuspension in a medium containing no nitrogen (pink) or 10 g/L ammonium sulphate (grey).
Figure 5. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of the culture. Measures
were taken 150 min after the resuspension in a medium containing no nitrogen (pink) or 10 g/L ammonium sulphate (grey).
Can you breathe?
In this experiment, our E.coli strain carrying the ZsGreen1 protein under the control of the nirB promoter was grown on LBA under two different conditions: aerobic and anaerobic. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by adding a small volume of sterile oil over the liquid culture (Figure 6), so no oxygen can be taken from the environment. After 2 days of growth, samples were taken from each culture and diluted to an OD of 0.1. After that, fluorescence intensity was measured.
Our results show that ZsGreen1 expression increases (a 20% approx.) under anaerobic conditions, according to the effect of oxygen on the FNR proteins (see the molecular mechanism description ).
Figure 6. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized
by the optical density (OD) of cultures grown under
aerobic (grey) or anaerobic (pink) conditions.
Are you hot?
To test the heat-sensitive construction, an overnight culture of our E.coli strain carrying the AsRed2 gene under the control of groE promoter was set up at 25 ºC. After that, OD was adjusted to 0.15 and several aliquots were transferred to fluorimetry cuvettes. Heat"

The result suggested our detection device worked very well, and overexpression of miR-21 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s and pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-2s.
And we also detected the fluorescence of GFP after transfection pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s or pEGFP- miR-21-sponge-2s with or without pHAGE-pre-miR-21 for 24 h by plate reader (SpectraMax i3), and observed that endogenous miR-21 in cells decreased the fluorescence of GFP (Fig 15). The fluorescence of GFP in cells transfect with pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s was lower in that of pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-2s, because pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s contains six miR-21 binding sites. These results suggested that sponges with six binding sites produced stronger derepressiveeffects than sponges with two binding sites.

In Figure 2, we can see the portion of biosensors of all iGEM projects since 2007. There is a clear linear increase in number of iGEM projects, but the number of biosensors per year varies and doesn’t follow a trend.
How successful Biosensor were in the previous years (Advance to Championship, Awards, Finalists) can be seen in Figure 3. Something that also interested us was to see how many biosensors are in the Track Health and Medicine as we developed a biosensor for that Category (Figure 4). Other facts we wanted get from the database are, how many biosensors already targeted DNA (Figure 5) and what is the distribution of other inputs, sensed by previous biosensors (Figure 6).

Looking toward finals
   Given the similarities between each of our systems in overall function, we have begun development of BioBricks to apply each system to the other team's problem. By testing each system on a different problem, we intend to show how each system can be deployed as a modular, platform technology.
We also intend to further improve our database to more easily get information of the actual sensing system (sensitive/inducible promoter, other targeting methods like CRISPRs, TALEs,…).

Proteins are fused with LVA sequence that provides quick proteolytic degradation by bacteria.
The invasion operon includes lacI – lactose operon repressor, llo – hemolysin from Listeria monocytogenes, inv – inwasin from Yersinia sp., phoQ/phoP two component system that detects endosomal conditions from Salmonella typhimurium, GFP – green fluorescent protein. (Fig.2.). These genes are under the control of bacteriophage promoter (PR) that is repressed by CL protein. The second part of the operon is gene clts that codes for thermosensitive version of the CI repressor protein from phage . It is under control of lactose promoter (Plac). This λ system of promoters and regulatory genes creates two mutually exclusive negative feedback loops and is called bistable switch[19]. It has two states depending on conditions within the cell. Cl protein binds the PR promoter inhibiting its activity and expression of the invasion operon genes. Cl protein is inactivated by high temperature 42°C it allows the expression of invasion operon that codes for LacI. LacI stops gene expression from the Plac promoter ( the expression of Cl protein). IPTG that binds and inactivates LacI can be used to switch on the expression from Plac promoter. Another way to control the operon is in trans expression of CL or LacI genes. Activated invasion operon causes internalisation of bacteria by mammalian cells. It also detects endosomal localisation using phoP/phoQ system. Expression of green fluorescence protein allows observation of the process using confocal microscopy.

The low"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," is to find a reliable source to prove the abundance of our precursor Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) in yeast peroxisomes. So far there is no proof of existence of FPP inside yeast peroxisomes yet. However it is predicted to be present, as it was detected in mammalian and plant peroxisomes Olivier et al. (2000) .
Figure 7.1: The structure of FPP the precursor for nootkatone.
The precursor FPP is converted into valencene by a valencene synthase (ValS). We chose the one from Callitropsis nootkatensis because of its comparably high efficiency in microorganisms. It achieves greater yields in yeast than the citrus valencene synthase. Furthermore, the product specificity is relatively high, while production of byproducts is low Beekwilder et al. (2014) .  The valencene synthase was also chosen because of its robustness towards pH and temperature changes Beekwilder et al. (2014) .   Our modelling approach revealed that for optimal yields an overexpression of valencene synthase is necessary because of its slow conversion rate (Model) . This is why we chose the strongest promoter of the yeast toolbox (Dueber Toolbox) for this attempt.
Figure 7.2:ValS lvl.1 PTS1 plasmid
Figure 7.3: The structure of valencene, an intermediate of nootkatone
The intermediate valencene is then converted into nootkatol by a P450 monooxygenase as well as into small amounts of our desired product nootkatone.  The P450 monooxygenase we chose for this project was taken from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium. In this  case it is not only a simple P450 monooxygenase, but an entire P450 system, consisting of a soluble P450 fused to a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) enzyme, making an additional reductase obsolete De Mot et al. (2002) .     Unlike eukaryotic P450s, which are mostly membrane bound, this prokaryotic BM3-P450 is located in the cytosol facilitating an easier transport into the peroxisome, as membrane integration of proteins is a more difficult task to achieve than import of cytosolic proteins Girvan et al. (2006) .   BM3 normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of long chain fatty acids Narhi et al. (1986)"

NITROGEN-REGULATED PROMOTER
This construction contains two parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (yellow) protein. We chose as the promoter sequence the one of the glnA gene.      There is long evidence that this promoter is regulated by nitrogen concentration [1]. Moreover, the promoter is not the canonical one (sigma70) but an alternative one (sigma54) [2,3].
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the yellow fluorescent protein a condition should to be met. That condition is related to nitrogen-starvation. The less nitrogen there is, the more expression you get!
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: in gram-negative bacteria, transcriptional activation in response to some external stimuli (absence of nitrogen, high UV-dosis, for example) often involves the alternative sigma factor, sigma54. This factor, also called RpoN or sigma N, was originally identified as the sigma factor for nitrogen-controlled genes. sigma54 works in conjunction with members of the"
OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to be dealt with elsewhere. Because feathers are all handled with in a similar way, it was quite easy to foresee and plan the integration of the project in this industry. Since the feathers remain in the bioreactor to be degraded, we concluded that our keratinase expressing bacteria could be added to these feather holding containers. Not only would it be easy to pour in, but it would also have a lower environmental impact in comparison to the current incineration, burial, and mechanical degradation methods. In order to ensure the easy implementation of our project, our team came in contact with the Chicken Farmers of Canada, where they informed us about the lack of GMO regulations and that the implementation of our construct would not come in conflict with any bylaws.
After, we revisited the wastewater treatment facilities in order to learn about their processes. There, we noticed that both wastewater treatment facilities used bacteria somewhere within their processes. As a result, we believe that our project can be easily included in their system and strictly have positive effects. Due to conversations with our local wastewater treatment facility we were made aware that the particular part of the system that our project would be most effective in the early screening processes. This would be the best integration site for our project because it is where most of the keratin build up occurs. Whilst touring the various wastewater treatment plants within our community, we noticed that many of them utilized bioreactors or systems that worked very similarly.
As a result, we decided to design and construct our own prototype bioreactor as a way of demonstrating how our project can be implemented in both the poultry and wastewater treatment centres. Our prototype is a bubble column bioreactor that has been optimized to the specific conditions of E. coli, however we may need to consider a different chassis for implementation in the wastewater treatment industry. The bioreactor would be designed to contain our construct, as well as maintain the optimal conditions for effective growth and expression. This means that the prototype will allow our bacteria to survive at a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius and in media of a ph between 7 and 8. These conditions also align with the local wastewater treatment plants bioreactor, thus increasing the ease of application (see the page 'Demonstrate' for more information). For further development, we plan to create a sustainable business plan that can be used to distribute our construct to make it easier for companies to introduce our project within their facilities.
Benefits of Our Project
From all the research we have done, we believe that the use of a keratinase-expressing bacterial system will be a more effective way of dealing with keratin waste, as well"

Test of multiple quadratic regression model
We test the quadratic regression model with the residual standard deviation. The regression residual ei=Yi-Y×i helps us to measure the degree of the regression model fitting the sample data. In order to use linear regression analysis, the regression residual standard deviation needs to be calculated. The regression residual standard deviation is the accuracy index used by the regression equation to do some predictions, an it can be used to test the reliability of the model prediction.The regression residual standard deviation (recorded as
):
If
is close to 0, indicating the deviation of the model of the sample data is small,and the reliability (accuracy) of the prediction is higher.The larger the value of
,the larger the model deviates from the sample data,and the worse the reliability of the prediction is. In practical problems,
tends to be large. To evaluate the pros and cons of the model, the index S/Y is usually used. When S/Y < 15%, the prediction model can be considered better. According to the results, we can calculate that the regression residual standard deviation RMSE= 1.65062261369908, S/Y=0.02821577117, and the prediction model is very good. Moreover, it can be seen from the residual value that the model fitting effect is very good. The original data is not eliminated, which ensures the integrity of the data,and the inadequacy should be the complexity of the equation.

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Blue light sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"activated state (B → C) and then returning to the stable state (D → A). In the dark state, the shared helix contacts the Lov2 domain, and the inactivated TrpR dissociates from the DNA; in the light state, the Lov2 domains absorb the blue light proton and form a covalent adduct between the FMN cofactor and a conserved cysteine residue, destroying the shared helix in the Lov domain and binding / populating an active formation of the TrpR domain. This in turn leads to LovTAP binding the DNA and repressing lambda-cI. However, this binding is not stable, and thus it will eventually return to the initial state.
Strategy
Our original plan was to obtain and revive EPF-Lausanne 2009 's BBa_K191009 . Once we had done so, we aimed to use it to create a blue light sensing system, and to transform cells for characterisation of the system and for analysis of their compatibility with the mutated blue luciferases. Further characterization of LovTAP would include investigation of the influence of tryptophan on the system, and therefore a TrpR mutant strain of E. coli was also transformed with the LovTAP-reporter construct.
Problems
We were unable to successfully characterise the LovTAP that we initially received from Lausanne due to a frameshift mutation. Eventually, we received a new version of LovTAP from our collaborators at Mexico UNAM-Genomics , so that we could perform characterisation tests on it for them. Unfortunately, we were again unable to elicit a clear response from our sensor.
Our major problem was that transformants often grew the wrong colour. LovTAP controls the production of RFP in the cells; when LovTAP is inactive (i.e. in the dark), the cells should be producing RFP and hence should be growing red. When LovTAP is active (i.e. in white or blue light), the cells stop producing RFP and hence should produce white colonies. At the moment some cells in the light are still growing red, although some are definitely growing white, and vice versa in the dark. One suggestion was that the plasmids are unstable and dividing randomly, altering the intensity of the colour in some cells. Attempts to stabilise the colours of the colonies are ongoing (see the video in the gallery which demonstrates one of the innovative methods of providing proper culture conditions).
BioBricks
As stated above, our blue light sensor is based on a modified version of Lausanne 2009"

In the Bacillus subtilis, ammonium assimilation occurs via the glutamine synthetase - glutamate synthase pathway. Bacillus subtilis faces nitrogen- limiting conditions when it consumes glutamate as a prior nitrogen source,   while glutamine is the secondly preferred nitrogen source [3].
Two transcription factors, TnrA and GlnR, and one enzyme, the Glutamine Synthase, are the major players in the B. Subtilis nitrogen regulatory network [3]. We use TnrA transcription factor in our system.
Under nitrogen-limited conditions, TnrA works as an activator and a repressor both. TnrA represses expression of glnRA (Glutamine Synthase) [4], gltAB (Glutamate Synthase) [5] and other genes. Also the form of Glutamine Synthase which is feedback inhibited by excess glutamine, directly interacts with and unbinds from TnrA, thus blocks its DNA-binding activity [6]. Based on all this information, if the amount of NH3 is not sufficient, glutamine synthase will not work properly, glutamine will be produced in a low amount, TnrA will bind to promoter and Toehold production will be repressed. But if there is a sufficient amount of NH3, glutamine will be produced in a high level, TnrA will not repress the promoter as previous and Toehold – Tev Protease will be produced in a high amount.
Figure 3: If there is a sufficient amount of NH3, Toehold and TEV protease will be produced. If there isn’t a sufficient amount of NH3, Toehold and TEV Protease will not be produced.
Seventeen TnrA targets were detected by a combination of DNA microarray hybridization, a genome-wide search for TnrA boxes, and gel retardation assays [7]. The TnrA box consensus delimited in this study to a 17- bp interrupted, inverted repeat sequence, TGTNANAWWWTNTNACA.

ATTRIBUTION
The eNOSE project has been in motion for several months now, and would not have gained as much momentum as it has without the generous help and mentoring from several individuals. In particular, the USMA-West Point team would like to formally thank:
DR. ALEX MITROPOULOS
PRIMARY PI
Dr. Mitropoulos has served as a crucial mentor to the team throughout the research process. He is truly the backbone of our group, and helps us balance time in the lab with our other Cadet activities. He continually goes above and beyond to explain to us the second and third order effects of our research. Without him, we could not be successful as a team.
DR. J.KEN WICKISER
PRIMARY PI
Dr. Wickiser was essential in getting USMA-West Point involved in the iGEM competition. Because of him, we are able to communicate the importance of our project on an international scale.
DR. RUSSEL K. PIRLO
sECONDARY PI
Dr. Pirlo was essential in designing one of the devices for the USMA-West Point iGEM team. He took on 4 Cadets who learned about interdisciplinary research at NRL for 3 weeks over the summer. He helped solidify parts of the project to enhance the device phase for this team.
DR. KAMIL WORONOWICZ
sECONDARY pi
Dr. Woronowicz was essential for the transformation of the first plasmid. He established the protocols for transfection and amplification of the plasmids.
