Where is the boundary between natural and artificial? Can we afford to create everything from the living? Evolution can be ""diverged""?
50% people tend to reject this possibility of free manipulation with therapy pretext, however, 31% would consider it and 19% of persons are wondering. As for a drift of evolution, 50% of persons are quite convinced that evolution cannot be compromised by synthetic biology, however, 31% people disagreed.
As part of a therapeutic application, can we afford to create everything from the living?
Do we risk diverging the evolution?
Researchers must ask themselves these questions and be aware of unethical uses that could  be made of such technologies, even for the purpose of curing diseases; this fear of a student speaks to the questions raised by the living instrumentalization facing synthetic biology.
Indeed, each advanced biological research contains a lot of questions on the health implications, environmental, social and ethical implications of possible applications of these discoveries. Are we able to control the living? Are we able to control the spread of systems that we built? While they are a majority think that researchers are capable of manipulating life, we remain skeptical with control its spread.
Can we control the living?
Do you think we should be able to control the spread of systems that we built?
Faced with theses questions, how the company will position itself and how it will respect the ethics rules. Because of the life control, the public is faced with a control by research area while having the feeling of being dispossessed of research results. How the company is going to express their wishes on these issues?
In the context of synthetic biology, is global governance feasible?
Given the stakes, the debate should be pluralist and collective, we have to know  who will control and how? Do we need  new regulations, while those for existing GMOs are already far from perfection and  unaccepted? Can we aspire to global governance? 46% of persons believe that such governance is possible, while 31% think otherwise. However, how can we adapt these regulations?
Conclusion of the survey
The survey draws the attention of politicians, researchers and lawyers, reminding them that the innovation and therapeutic goal arguments are often wrongly used by supporters of a world where everything is protected and patented. A public debate is necessary to decide together how to maximize the positive applications of these technologies while minimizing the abusive risks.

It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and"

We made efforts to collaborate with other teams and foster mutual development in both their projects and our own. We spoke to several teams and assisted many others in their project by filling out their surveys. In addition, we created our own survey about biocontainment to distribute to iGEM teams and provided a collaboration badge for teams that responded (for the results of our survey and list of teams that participated in the survey click on the collaboration badge to the right).
We would like to acknowledge the following teams for collaborating with us throughout the course of iGEM 2016.
Broad Run High School
We discussed kill switch mechanisms at length with the Broad Run team. We also aided their team by providing advice regarding modeling techniques with Matlab software. We helped them successfully model their project by sharing our Matlab expertise.
CGU Taiwan
One of our team members, Sarah, spoke to Bill and Justine from the CGU Taiwan team. Sarah explained our biocontainment project to Bill and Justine, and they in turn presented their Leijuvant project to her. They had a great follow up discussion about biocontainment and whether or not it is needed for Leijuvant. It was determined that physical containment would best serve their purposes.
UMaryland
We had an excellent time visiting UMaryland for the the Mid-Atlantic iGEM conference. We presented our project and heard ideas from not just the UMaryland team, but also the UPitt, William and Mary, and Naval Academy iGEM teams. This was a great opportunity for all teams to share ideas and advice. Members of our team also hosted a dialogue regarding biocontainment. This gave other teams the opportunity to learn about biocontainment and ask questions about the different methods available.
Trinity College Dublin
Trinity College developed a unique and exciting website called “iGEM Academy”. The academy allows teams to share their work using video media. We submitted an animated short about our project and the more general concept of biocontainment.

Survey
Throughout the course of the What is Natural? storyline, the UCSC iGEM learned an incredible amount about the complex, multi-layered nature of the seemingly simple question, “What is Natural?” We had the opportunity to pursue the exploration of this question from a diverse set of viewpoints, ranging from the social, the legal, and the moral. The interplay of genetic engineering constantly weaved in and out of the discussion, and it appears public discussion over this topic will only continue to grow. The foundation of this storyline was intertwined with our feeling of both passion and responsibility to spread awareness of these discussions, and to educate the public on how to view these questions from a scientific standpoint. However, for our final event, we decided we wanted to expand our reach even further. In collaboration with the UC Davis iGEM team, we have conducted a research study on public opinion for the definition of ‘Natural’, and its relationship to GMOs. Each team traveled to the local farmer markets in our respective cities to interview the key demographic that we hoped had the greatest connection towards ‘all-natural’ movement, and could provide the best insight into these questions. This intervention collected valuable information on public opinion, in addition to cultivating internal discussion within the participants as they were forced to question their own beliefs—and to what extent those beliefs were held.
Santa Cruz Farmers Market
The UC Davis iGEM team and our iGEM team had remarkable similarity for the societal considerations of our projects. Both of our projects centered upon producing a food compound via a genetically modified microbe; erythritol in our case and a blue dye used in food coloring in the case of the UC Davis team. Therefore, we were both very interested in the term: Nature-identical. Nature-identical, having potential to grow in its use and importance, is a term given to compounds that exist in nature but are produced in a different source than is considered natural; such as a blue dye from blueberries being produced in yeast.  Our research survey questions thus focused heavily upon how far our participants’ comfortability with genetically modified compounds could stretch. Using blue food dye as our driving example, we explored how the term ‘nature-identical’ and ‘GMO’ affected their concern with the compound. Perhaps most interesting to us was the question we crafted to determine how participants"

She suspected that her families’ persistent nausea, migraines, and dizziness came as a result of toxic air and water pollution. Although the Aruba insisted that toxicologists and medical professionals supported that their operations posed no harm, the jury voted and awarded Parr a $2.9 million settlement. This case a need for the general public to have access to practical methods to measure of contamination, and that there may be demand for sensors outside of just private companies or regulatory agencies.

Network Installation of Permanent Fracking Sensors Proposed at AMS Conference
Michael van den Bossche from the University of Virginia proposed a network of sensors to track methane pollution in the air as a result of increased fracking use in the natural gas industry. This was among the first designs of a full-scale network of sensors that could run continuously as a large-scale operation. Because  it can run continuously and is not dependent on instantaneous measurement from a sample or a single source, it can produce significant information with very low system maintenance following installation.
The Naphthalene Recorder project by CU Boulder iGEM incorporates the whole-cell concept for simplicity of processing and production and extends OptiEnz concept of measuring untreated samples from bodies of water by introducing a stake that can maintain homeostatic conditions wherever it’s placed. The concept of a low-maintenance network with contaminant “memory” extends the concept proposed for methane sensors, and its use can allow the public to run their own tests, avoiding lawsuits and not being strictly dependent upon the law requiring a company to run a test themselves.

The parts in the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit are based on the excellent set of miniTn7 derivatives developed by Choi et al. ( 2005 ). All our derivatives contain the Tn7-L and Tn7-R ends, an antibiotic resistance gene flanked by FRTs and the prefix/suffix BioBrick-compatible multi-cloning site (Figure 1a). Constructs will be available in derivatives of pUC18-Sfi, (high copy number, replicative in any E. coli strain), or derivatives of pUC18-R6KT (medium copy number, replicative only in E. coli strains expressing the pir gene). Specialized miniTn7 vectors containing promoters for gene expression or reporters for expression measurement will also be constructed (Figure 1b, 1c and 1d). In addition, we will provide a portable attTn7 (Tn7 attachment site) to allow using the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit in any organism as well as in plasmids.

T7 promoter in vitro assay
The samples labeled ""#xi"" were treated with RNA secure to inhibit potentially present RNase. The gel photo shows blurry signals in all of these lanes which aren't visible in lanes ""#x"" and ""#xa"". This proves that RNase is present in the DNA samples used in the assay. Also, the fact that the RNA signals are quite large and strong shows leads us to the conclusion that the examined plasmids all contain a T7 promoter. Sample 1 contains two plasmids (about 6.6 kb and 3.5 kb) which is the reason for the bad sequencing data. Samples 2, 3, 5 and 6 contain one 6.6 kb plasmid each. This should be our correct reporter plasmid, part 2b, containing T7 promoter and lacZ. To verify this, a sample shall be sequenced.

This handbook is addressed, but not limited, to multicultural society like Indonesia and/or other countries so that in the future, other team can use this handbook as a guidance and example benchmark to conduct human practice projects they are willing to make.
We are going to extra mile by visit Cikidang Village, high risk population living in rural areas, Sukabumi, Indonesia. Poor sanitation which make them vulnerable to diphtheria, isolated from other area (the only way to reach this village only by truck). We start teach them about the right steps to wash hands in keeping their hands free from bad-bacteria, build some lavatories and any sanitary facilitation. Moreover, not only reach Cikidang Villagers we also have community Visit to Pondok Cina, community who lives near railway. We also create campus campaign, A day with Diphthy, Poster Competiton, whole this effort created because we really hope it will enhance awareness to academic society, which this segmented still could be affected, as diphtheria could attack anyone.

We will place this plates overnight on the bench and hope to see color on the 4 plates that had colonies
●
We want to re do the Gibson of the 4 plates that did not work. We think the meffRed backbone was not inserted in high enough concentrations so we will try and get higher concentrations by redoing the meffRed PCR and gel/gel extraction. We re did the PCR of the meffRed backbone and then ran a gel of it to perform a gel extraction. When we imaged the gel the bands were not at the correct length and were instead around 700 base pairs which is where the chromoprotein should be. Because meffRed has been not correctly getting amplified many of the times we run PCR on it we decided to re miniprep and PCR the meffRed backbone.

We then connected the two aptamers with different length of poly-T linkers, namely short and long linkers, to their 5’ end. At last, all aptamers were modified with 5’ biotin in order that they can bind to streptavidin.
We then built inner-membrane scaffolds consisted of three fusion parts. The split proteins were linked to the periplasmic ends of scaffolds and streptavidin to the cytoplasmic ends. We chose phosphatidylglycerol:: prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) as our transmembrane protein because its function has been well identified by 2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team. ssDsbA is the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent signaling sequence of DsbA. ssDsbA-tagged proteins are exported to the periplasm through the SRP pathway. With ssDsbA fused to the periplasmic terminal, fusion proteins with Lgt are expected to be anchored onto inner membrane of E.coli.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," be speculated that this helps to protect the sponge from pathogenic microbes that then find it harder to colonize its surface.
Metabolism
A diverse, well-balanced metabolism allows a bacterium to grow in many conditions, while simultaneously making it interesting for biotechnological applications. V. natriegens can utilize a wide range of substrates (Hoffart et al. 2017), as well as grow in the absence of oxygen while being faster than other bacteria under the same conditions.
For many applications in which a modern laboratory work horse is expected to be useful, a high-resolution map of its metabolism is a prerequisite. One recent study generated just that (Long et al. 2017). By tracking 13C labeled carbon through the intricate network that constitutes V. natriegens metabolism, they were able to gain insight. Fore one, they found the it to be very similar to the well-studied E. coli metabolism. It has at the major catabolic and anabolic pathways, the same canonical amino acids and building blocks. Some notable differences between the two were the RNA content being 29% in V. natriegens compared to only 21% in E. coli, the presence of an enzyme for the decarboxylation of oxalate (Long et al 2017).
The specific uptake of many carbon sources per gram dry weight per time was shown to be significantly higher than in other comparable species of bacteria (Hoffart et al. 2017). Many commercially interesting compounds are already produced by unmodified V. natriegens. In the case of alanine production, only four deletions resulted in a strain that outperformed highly specialized E. coli and C. glutamicum production-strains by a factor of 9 to 13 times (Hoffart et al. 2017). Bioreactor based production on a large scale is expensive, therefore a strain generating similar or even higher yield per gram carbon source is highly desirable, improving temporal yield per fermentation unit.
When growing anaerobically, acids are produced that lead to an acidification of the medium but when grown under strong aeration, the pH can, depending on the medium, rise. This is most likely due to formation of ammonia (Eagon 1962).
The dependence on Na+ ions for its metabolic activity conveys a form of natural biocontainment, inhibiting growth in accidentally released V. natriegens (Webb and Payne 1971). The high salt content of the LBv2 media also presents possible contaminants with a barrier, reducing the"

SOX was selected to be an example of a possible solution to one of the 5 problems in biosensor production that we identified - unconventional substrates. We defined an unconventional substrate as a substrate that we have little prior knowledge of but that can be adapted into something with an existing biosensor. SOX was specifically chosen to demonstrate that glyphosate, an unconventional substrate which there is not a lot information on, can be converted into formaldehyde which there are existing biosensors for (Ling and Heng 2010). As part of our project, SOX was designed to be an ‘adaptor’ that could link glyphosate into our framework via a formaldehyde detector module. This concept could then be applied to other molecules that have easily detectable substrates in their degradation pathways. The aim of this part of the project was to demonstrate that SOX can be expressed by E. coli cells and that when glyphosate is added SOX can convert it to formaldehyde to be detected via a biosensor.
Figure 1: Biochemical pathway of the degradation of glyphosate to glycine and formaldehyde.
Design Stage
This construct was designed to have 30 bp overhangs with the pSB1C3 plasmid, so that it could be Gibson assembled into a pSB1C3 plasmid digested with XbaI and SpeI. Extra bases were added between the overhangs and the construct so that once the part was assembled into the plasmid, the XbaI and SpeI sites could be regenerated and the biobrick prefix and suffix restored. A T7 promoter was added to enable expression to be under the control of IPTG. This construct was then submitted to IDT for synthesis as a gBlock.
To ensure the codon usage of our SOX protein was not differing significantly from the average codon usage of E. coli, rare codons were removed from the sequence using the IDT codon optimisation tool to produce high protein expression.

Figure 3: Expression vector pSB1C3 with BBa_K2205004.
Implementation
After assembly, SOX was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and then into BL21-DE3 cells. This was done because DH5α cells are better for transformation, while BL21-DE3 cells are better for protein expression. This led to the expression of SOX being placed under the control of"

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to connect the ChatterBox to the user, a human - machine interface was developed, this opens the communication between both agents. Having this is possible to monitorize the inner environment of the device and control it to obtain the desired conditions.
FINELY DESIGN
A proper graphic design was proposed to bring our main stakeholders a more friendly and attractive project, This work is aimed at a wide public that includes not only people interested in Science and Synthetic Biology, but people from all study areas. In order to easy spreading, a fancy graphic design was developed with the aim of bringing closer the new agriculture to urban environment.
For instance, the design of Chatterplant’s logo combines three main concepts: plants, red light and hardware. The resulting image represents a geometric device inspired by our hardware Chatterbox combined with the idea of integrating SynBio technology. Likewise digital illustration has been one of the techniques used in the graphic representation of the project. This highly visual way of expressing concepts has made the project more opened and easily understandable to the general public. Therefore, an innovative design was applied to help in developing a SynBio-based solution.
Gathering both proper graphic design and controlling external factors as regulating plant’s features allow us increasing plant versatility and adaptative capacity. With those plenty possibilities our group had the chance to study current and future practices.
CHATTERPLANT APPLICATIONS
Every competent project aims to overcome real problems with a suitable solution. ChatterPlant studied numerous opportunities to introduce the project in our society. It has been considered both actual as future applications.
SCALE-UP STUDY
As the real aspiration of our project is food production, scalability is an essential element, therefore current studies main objective is to estimate the average implementation cost of Chatterbox. Two different scenarios are proposed: Chatterbox implanted in cities at consumer level (100-1000 m2); and a large-scale adaptation for great productions (1000-10.000 m2). To scaling Chatterbox, all costs were measured per square meter.
The data managed in this study, attached to this section, should be taken as an approximation and never as fixed and unquestionable values. With the previous data it’s deduced that, in spite of the difference of cost existing in both models, the execution cost respect to a current greenhouse do not differ so much, converting Chatterbox like a reality in the short term, accessible and with different applicability.
ORNAMENTAL
With ChatterPlant, we can modify plant metabolism to fit our needs. Starting a regular type of plant, we can achieve different final phenotypes. For example, we can have plants with differ"

Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A kill switch in Bacillus should be designed as engineering a kill switch into standardized plasmids could be useful for future iGEM competitions. Additionally, integrating BBI in multiple sites would give more auxotrophic sites, increasing the safety of using B.subtilis in the device.

Due to the incapaility of 2009.igem.org to interpret formula in Latex form to elligible expressions, we have to relink this page HERE . This has been authorized by the organizers of iGEM. If you don't mind the formula part, you may still work with this page.
Mathematical Formulation
High dimensional model representation(HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional IO system behavior. As the impact of the multiple input variables on the output can be independent and cooperative, it is natural to express the model output ()fx as a finite hierarchical correlated function expansion in terms of the input variables:
<math> f(x) = f_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(x_{i}, x_{j})+ </math>
<math>\sum_{1\leq i<j<k\leq
n}f_{ijk}(x_{i},x_{j},x_{k})+...+ </math>
<math>
\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il})+...+f_{12...n}(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}) </math>
where the zeroth-order component function <math>f_{0}</math> is a constant representing the mean response to <math>f(x)</math>, and the first order component function <math> f_{i}(x_{i})</math> gives the independent contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the ith input variable acting alone, the second order component function <math>f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j})</math> gives the pair correlated contribution to <math>f(x)</math> by the input variables <math>x_{i}</math> and <math>x_{j}</math>, etc. The last term contains any residual <math>n</math>th order correlated contribution of all input variables.

UCL_London,2010,Team:UCL London#Genetic Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterium E.coli, was to be independent of the application of a chemical signal, such as IPTG, that would induce the cells to start producing the protein. The bacterium, when the switch is on, is predicted to make red fluorescent protein; when the switch is off, the protein is no longer made and any remaining protein decays.
Video Simulations
The BCCS-Bristol have created the video simulations of the genetic circuit which is a visual representation of the protein expression. The BSim simulation was on Gene Regulatory Network model and the video shows first the Linear system, which is what it is currently in the biopharmaceutical industry. The system is normalized, with zero initial conditions. The 2nd part of the video shows that bacterial RFP expression based on the hypoxia promoter and the positive feedback loop , which is much quicker than the normal linear one. Click on the BSim_BCCS-Bristol collaboration for UCL iGEM 2010 to watch the video simulation!
As in with our case, the numerical simulation of all the biochemical reactions identified, was to describe the system, and specific values such as the rate constant, are unknown, leading to the simulation exploring a wide variety of possible values from literature. A 4-fold increase was shown, over 10s, given normalized parameters. Despite the timescale, and in a different set of parameters, still the positive feedback loop yields quicker protein expression than the conventional, standard IPTG method.
Even if we did have particular values for the variables appearing in the model, it would still be impossible to make accurate predictions about its behaviour in real life. According to Carslon (2010), the line between model and simulation becomes blurred when the only way to assess a particular model is depending upon the simulation of the model. However, again the design stage with the simulation differs significantly from the actual model. This is where the difficulty lays, as scientists and engineers, work on projects together by repeatedly comparing simulation and measurement through experiments. The BCCS-Bristol team for this year iGEM competition, has assisted us, in the production of a standard simulation, with the potential to run multiple simulations using their BSim programme, to explore the behaviour of the model, over a range of conditions.
Modelling Animation
The fundamental that the genetic circuit works on, is that a signal from outside the cell, that is when the oxygen spike appears, declaring the low oxygen concentration present, induces the cell to begin producing the proteins. Traditionally, this was done with the manual addition by the operator of IPTG to the cells. The employment"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of BOL1 glycerol stock to grow an overnight culture (37°C, 220 rpm).
Colony PCR for:
A7 - 3 colonies (few colonies because we picked non red coloured colonies)
A8 - 8 colonies (important ligation!)
A9 - 12 colonies (important ligation!)
A10 - 3 colonies (it's quite unuseful to screen this ligation, because probably we are not able to discriminate the positive and the negative transformants)
The picked colonies used in the PCR were inoculated in 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubated at 37°C, 220 rpm, waiting for the gel results.
We performed two different PCR programs:
one for A7 (expected size of positive plasmid: ~1 Kb) and A10 (expected size of positive plasmid: ~600 bp), with 3 min elongation time
and a different one for A8 and A9 (expected size of positive plasmids: ~2 Kb for both).
Electrophoresis for the resulting reactions.
Colony PCR on A7, A8, A9, A10: we chose the 1st screened colony for A7 (A7-1), while we did not choose any colony for the other ligations because they did not look correct.
Gel results:
A7 - all colonies were good, we kept A7-1 to store a glycerol stock.
A8, A9 and A10 unfortunately showed extra bands. So, we didn't keep any colony for them.
Blank reaction also showed a contaminant band.
We planned:
not to care about A10 at the moment because the priority was to test aTc sensing device with A8 and A9;
to re-examinate the gel results to explain the lengths of the extra bands (on Monday);
to re-transform the ligations (stored at -20°C) because probably more than one plasmid had been incorporated in the screened colonies...

Das Aufgabenfeld des ABC-Abwehrregiments erweist sich jedoch vielfältiger als gedacht, denn auch die Wasseraufbereitung, Hygienemaßnahmen, Wetterbeobachtung oder Maßnahmen zur Rettung,  Bergung oder Brandbekämpfung fallen in das Aufgabenspektrum.
Zum Einsatzgebiet des Regiments zählen neben Einsätzen in militärischen Konflikten auch humanitäre Einsätze oder die Unterstützung bei Großereignissen (z.B. G8 oder Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft in Deutschland), oder der Eindämmung von Pathogenen (z.B. Influenza A/H5N1 (2006)).
Neben allerhand anderer spannender Erlebnisse, wie einem Hindernisparkour im Dunkeln mit Nachtsichtgeräten, kamen wir mit einigen Personen über Biosicherheit ins Gespräch. Leider können wir an dieser Stelle keine offizielle Stellungnahme präsentieren, empfehlen jedoch das Buch  “Biologische Gefahren I” und “Biologische Gefahren II” des Bundesamts für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe sowie des Robert Koch-Instituts im Bezug auf biologische Gefahrenlagen.
Der Tag in der Kaserne war eine sehr spannende Abwechslung und zog reges Interesse der Bevölkerung auf sich. Die Bundeswehr präsentierte sich als ein Team von Spezialisten bemüht um Abwendung von Schaden unter Einsatz ihres Lebens. Möchtegern-Einzelkämpfer waren hier nicht zu finden.

Creating a Multivariate PLS-model for estimating ethanol concentrations
Why?
The purpose of measuring ethanol concentrations in this way using a spectrophotometer, was to evaluate ethanol production and in the same time explore some unknown territory. The easiest way to measure ethanol concentrations in our cultures would probably be to use a GC, but this seemed much more fun.
Creating the model
PLS stands for Partial Least Squares and is a method to find patterns in complex sets of data by reducing and tweaking the variable space. In this way instead of looking at a few variables/peaks we can simultaneously consider thousands of wavelengths and extract the common information.
We started out by setting the limits for our model by creating a calibration-set of samples with as diverse properties as possible; ethanol concentration (by adding a known amount), growth phase etc, and at the same time set the procedure for measuring so that all samples are treated in the same way.
We used the Varian Cary 50 broad scan spectrophotometer and scanned near IR from 850nm to 1050nm with a resolution of 1 wavelength and a scan rate of 0.1nm/sec. We chose this part of the spectrum as we had determined that ethanol here has a distinct absorption pattern with low background interference from sugars and other complex contaminants.
Using the spectra from all the samples in the calibration-set we constructed a PLS model using UNSCRAMBLER software. This model can then be used to make predictions on the ethanol concentration in the samples with unknown ethanol concentrations.
Results
Calibration/Validation plot
This plot show the calibration set in blue and the validation set in red. The validation is of the type Cross validation where each sample is taken out of the model and the model is recalculated to fit the remaining samples, and the residual is calculated. This is repeated with each sample and the combined residuals are plotted as the validation curve. In a perfect model the validation"
Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Phage Display_-_-_TEXT.html," the phage, different fusions can be created and all of them expressed on the plasmid.
We would need to tune expression levels of the fusions versus the wildtype protein.
The F plasmid
M13 can only infect E. coli if it has a sex pilus. This is coded for by the F plasmid. However, such plasmids are quickly lost from cultures in a laboratory setting, as they confer a fitness cost. The JM109 strain has proline synthesis genes (proAB) absent from its main chromosome, but present on the F plasmid, and so when it is grown on minimal media, the plasmid will not be lost, as it is needed to keep the bacteria alive.
Genetic instability
In order to display several different proteins on one phage, it will be necessary to have several copies of the pVIII gene fused to different enzymes. The presence of repeated sequences on a plasmid can lead to genetic instability.
This will not be a problem in the JM109 lab strain, which lacks an important recombination enzyme. As for the use of this technology in industry, it will be possible to overcome this problem simply by synthesising coding sequences with as many altered (but synonymous) codons as possible. We have written a software tool for designing such sequences... see the genetic instability page.
Bead reactors
Maurice Gallagher, one of our university's phage experts, suggests a different approach: make several strains of bacteria each producing phage with just one type of pVIII-fusion. But also make each phage have a pIII-fusion with a protein which could bind some sort of bead. The bead now becomes the complete ""reactor"". Since each bacteria codes for only one pVIII fusion, there is no repeated sequence problem.
Detail of M13 attached to a bead. We would link multiple phages to the bead; each phage would carry one enzyme type only.
Problems
The question is how efficiently fusions to pVIII can get onto the phage. There are some dire warnings in the literature:
In our experience, most large proteins display well below one copy per phage particle. — Sidhu et al (2000)
A large 20 kDa protein (human growth hormone, hGH) is not displayed at detectable levels. — Weiss and Sidhu (2000)
The properties of the pIV channel may be one of the factors that limit the size of polypeptides that can be displayed on pVIII. — Karlsson (2004)

Eline van Zutphen represented MIMETAS - The Organ on a Chip Company at the networking market. She showed what they do and why single cell sequencing can be very applicable.
In 2010, Paul Vulto and Jos Joore came together and started brainstorming on creating a device that could be used for massive parallel testing of individual therapies. The same day Paul Vulto called Prof. Thomas Hankemeier to discuss the potential of starting a new Organ-on-a-Chip Company, now known as MIMETAS. The Organ-on-a-Chip Company offers OrganoPlates® and develops human tissue and disease models for tomorrow's medicines, chemicals and food. MIMETAS’ vision is to develop an easy-to-use 3D device that will help the development for better medicines. With the OrganoPlate®, that vision is now here. OrganoPlate® is the future for 3D tissue models! MIMETAS has currently three offices, with its headquarters located in Leiden. In Leiden, The Netherlands, they perform most of the biological model development work, as well as development of novel hardware and assays. Their manufacturing site is located in Enschede, in the eastern part of The Netherlands. Here they produce OrganoPlates® under strictly controlled clean room conditions. In Gaithersburg ("

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Bioluminescence#Bacterial Codon optimisation_-_-_TEXT.html," al. 1989 describe positive complementation test using components from V. fisheri and Xenorhabdus luminescens. To use foreign genes from two very different donor species in one pathway in E.coli is an exciting test of our understanding of the processes involved in bacterial bioluminescence and of the power of synthetic biology in general. In this construct, LuxC, D, E and G are codon optimised, but LuxA and B are not. In order to adjust the ratio of gene expression between these genes to the state found in nature, we chose to put LuxA and B under a very strong, phage derived promoter (plambda) to be constitutively expressed. The other genes can now be put under any promoter to create a PoPS-to-light device. In conjunction with an inducible or repressible promoter, this could be used as a reporter device. To test the system, we placed the LuxCDEG under an arabinose induced pbad promoter (BBa_i0500).
Parts submitted to the registry
Ideally we would have submitted a codon-optimised version of the entire Lux operon. Unfortunately Mr Gene, the company we employed for synthesis, still had not completed the order two months after placing, and at the point of the wiki-freeze we still have not received the optimised versions of LuxA and B. In order to complete our aim of creating a PoPs->light device that can be placed under any promoter, we combined the optimised Vibrio LuxCDEG genes with the Edinburgh 2009 Xenorhabdus LuxAB. The assembly was achieved using the Gibson method . Since we only received LuxCD and LuxEG from Mr Gene two weeks before the documentation deadline, we could not properly characterise these parts. For a complete list of the BioBricks we submitted see the BioBricks section .
Codon optimised bacterial luminescence parts:
luxCD (BBa_K325902) derived from V. fischeri, but optimised for E.coli

S314: the last PBS step pumped air into the chamber because the PBS-falcon ran dry during the measurement. The Strep-Cy5 incubation prior to it worked fine though. (The machine still did not work as it should have → too little BSA/StrepCy5 were sucked in by the syringe, rack had some problems before measurement). Fluorescence shows that the binding worked, the stamp was therefor flooded correctly. iRIf results are hard to obtain due to the air entering the chamber in the last step.
S303: was accidentally touched while it was put into the chamber → no binding occured, fluorescence shows that the stamp was completely smeared.
Conclusion: the problem might be our stamp, since the „grill“ stamps are flooded correctly.
Additional hydrophobicity tests
After measurement PBS was put on the slide 314 (the whole slide was blocked with BSA prior to measureing). The buffer took the shape of the flow chamber, showing that PDMS is hydrophobic and that the PDMS remains on the slide. This behaviour persisted, even after washing with SDS, EtOH, Aceton, Water. After adding NP40 or dish washing soap to lower surface tension, the water remained in the shape of the PDMS flow chamber on the slide, even when inclinating the slide. The PDMS shape disappeared after plasma activation of the slide
Slide 314 after measuring in iRIF. PBS was put on slide and takes the shape of the flow chamber
24.05.2015 Stamping „the grill“ on plasmaactivated slides without preblocking them after stamping.  Results: The flooding appears to be worse in unblocked slides than in BSA blocked ones. We see bubbles around the stamps, mostly in the „Windschatten“(n=3)
Testing whether blocking changes the hydrophobicity of the PDMS diamonds We observed that in slides without preblocking, the flow-cell diamonds were surrounded by bubbles. To see whether this still occurs in blocked slides, we used a diamond-flowcell on a blocked, plasmaactivated slide.
⇒ Conclusion: The bubbles showed up on the blocked slide. When the flow cell is changed into a flowcell without diamonds, the bubbles will still adhere to the spots where the diamonds touched the slide. Blocking therefore does not reduce PDMS induced hydrophobicity.

A digestion over night is possible. If you digest over night use only 0.1 µl restriction enzyme.
It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with a PCR clean-up kit . This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.

WashU_StLouis,2017,Team:WashU StLouis#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Monsanto, we were fortunate to have a group of scientists listen to our project and give advice. Our original project design used GFP as a reporter gene, to indicate whether the gene was being transcribed. However, one of the scientists pointed out that GFP also absorbs in the UV range, which would probably make our results suspect. After this, we switched our reporter gene to a blue chromoprotein that had been characterized by a previous iGEM team, which would not absorb in the UV range. Also one of the other scientists suggested that we look into the use of cyanobacteria for biofuels. One of the scientists, Dr. Larry Gilbertson, offered to connect us with Austin Burns from their legal team and also to come talk to us himself about the process of genetically engineering plants.
The Legality of it All
A little bit later, we had a phone interview with Austin Burns to ask him about what the next steps could be if we were able to successfully transform our genes into cyanobacteria. Specifically, we were wondering what channels we would have to go through to safely start testing UV-B radiation in the wild. Mr. Burns did not have a specific answer for us, and he explained that that was because there is no precedent for releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment on such a large scale like the ocean, which has sections that many countries control. So each country would need to agree, based on international treaties and so many other agreements.
He also walked us through how we might be able to go about testing in controlled environments. First, we would have to answer questions about the organism itself. Where did it come from and how did we obtain it? The USDA can regulate what they want in the environment and will bar certain organisms if they think there is a risk to endangered species or agriculture. Mr. Burns also suggested that we build failsafes into our constructs so that if something were to go wrong, there is a way for the organism to shut itself down, since most organizations would be more willing to work with the organism if they knew there was a backup if something went wrong. In addition, we might need to get permission from the EPA because of the clean air and clean water act which overlaps with the endangered species act of the USDA.
Mr. Burns continued to talk about how we would go about testing in the environment, but his main point that he repeated was that there is no specific avenue to achieve what we wanted to with our genes. He walked us through the process of hypothetically getting a meeting with the USDA or EPA, and things we would need in order to prepare; the main thing being a"

Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"  The part is contained in the plasmid psB1AK3 which has markers for ampicillin and kanamycin resistance. It contains the LasR receptor (C0079) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a GFP reporter (E0040). In this part, GFP expression is under the control of the LasR+PAI promoter (R0079). The part should produce LasR which receives the PAI. Binding of LasR to the PAI should be reported by GFP expression. lasR is reported to be under the control of the PLlac 0-1 promoter (R0011) in the part. The PLlac 0-1 promoter is a hybrid consisting of the lambda phage promoter P(L) with the cI binding sites replaced with lacO1. In nature, LasR bound to the PAI is the activator for the expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase gene (lasB).
Methods and Results
Transformation and Selection
psB1AK3[BBa_K091134] was transformed into chemically competent (DH5α). Transformed cells were plated on LB agar plates containing either ampicillin, kanamycin, or ampicillin and kanamycin. Colonies were observed on the kan plates and the amp plates but never on the amp and kan plates. Characterization was continued using a colony from the LB/kan plate.
Response to Autoinducer
In the presence of N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  at various concentrations alone (100 μM, 10 μM, 1μM, 0.1 μM, 0.01 μM, 1 nm, 0.1 nm) and N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  (same concentrations) + IPTG, DH5α/psB1AK3[BBa_K091134] did not produce a detectable fluorescent signal. However,the data are less than clear as our positive control showed no fluorescence either.
Sequencing
The psB1AK3/BBa_K091134 plasmid was extracted from the transformed cells for sequencing. Standard primers for sequencing/amplifying BioBrick parts were used: VF2 (tgccacctgacgtctaagaa) and VR (attaccgcctttgagtgagc). The sequencing was successful for both primers. EMBOSS Needle was used to align sequencing results to the expected sequence for the part (see attached sequencing data).

A restriction digest was carried out to determine the length of the pOT2 plasmid and insert. protocol was followed to point, using miniprep as template dna. XhoI was used as cutting enzyme, and digest was allowed to run for 30 mins.There were problems with the first gells, so a second gel was run.
results: Gel showed a band between 3.5K and 4k markers, consistent with earlier results, indicating that the plasmid and insert have correct length. Strangely the cut segment has traveled further through the gell than the un-cut control.
analysis: There realy is something fishy going on, or as we say in Denmark, there are owls in the marsh. At least the plasmid seems correct.
PCR on RD products from above experiments
Date: 29/7
Done by: Christian
Methods: Gradient taq pcr
protocos: CP1.3 (using gradient program)
Notes: 7 small eppendorff tubes were loaded of each product. Protocol for 25ul taq reaction was followed, with out changes other than the gradient programme. One tube (XE7) was tipped and might have spilled a bit of the mix. The gradient temperatures were the same for each corresponding tube in the three series: E cut with ecoRI, XE cut with both, and X cut with XhoI. Temperatures were from 45-65 degrees. The rest of the program was identical to protocol, with a 2 minute runtime. Custom ninaB primers were used.
Results: PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel, with hyperladder II. A band was expected at 1920BP. A weak bands showed at the correct location in almost all wells (Except the spilled tube). Smears showed in E2 and 3. The clearest bands were at temperatures around 60-65 degrees.
We have succesfully shown that our primers will generate a band at our expected length, albeit a very weak one. Perhaps it takes some luck for the reaction to get started. We hope to repeat the experiment with pfu, to get a good product for ligation. We don't know if the cutting has made the difference between this round of pcr and the one performed a couple of days earlier, or if other factors, like the gradient have played in.

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video. After proposing the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, the Peshawar team created a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques that may aid them in their scientific endeavors.

Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:
-Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Market#_-_-_TEXT.html,", water soluble toxins. This system is composed of microporous polyethersulfone membranes, between which a solid absorbent compound is held. These systems would be deployed in a similar fashion to the SPMD technologies, and often used in consort with the SPMD. Examples of both of these technologies are detailed below:
Figure 10: Environmental Sampling Technology's SPMD and POCIS systems for long-term monitoring of organic and water-soluble toxic chemicals in water samples.  The systems use membrane technologies to trap a variety of toxic molecules and allows for long-term monitoring of a particular site.
Both these technologies are very innovative, however can only be used for sample capture over time. They must still be retrieved and brought to a lab for sample extraction and analysis on traditional analytical machinery. As opposed to on-site spot testing or continuous active monitoring, these methods are also unable to indicate at what point in a given sample collection timeframe that a perturbing event occurred, only that one had occurred during that given time frame. On-site and continuous monitoring provides the ability to not only detect the time frame within which a change occurs, but also monitor the levels that a given condition changes over that time frame.
Using Competitive Analysis To Select Price Point
Below, is a table summarizing our competitive advantage against many of these competitive products:
Figure 11: Competitive technology comparison chart, detailing our technology platform (FRED) versus other prominent toxin monitoring methods presently in the market.  Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a highly analytical, sensitive measurement technique while being expensive, highly technical, and non-portable.  The new SPMD/POCIS systems (detailed below in emerging technologies) offer new strategies at long term monitoring and are therefore not direct competitors of our technology.  Finally, the Microtox system is a direct competitor which we hope to gain advantage to by being faster, more portable, and more reliable of a measurement system.
Pricing will be determined based on cost associated with the development of the technology. While conducting our assessment of the market, we found that the single-use based general sensing technologies of our competitors involve detectors (lab grade or portable devices) between $10,000-$25,000. Each sample test costs approximately $150-$250 depending on the specifics of the technology and the complexity of the sample to be tested. Therefore, it is our objective to reach a market pricing that would be competitive to these technologies. Our initial price point that we hope to achieve is $100 per sampling, and $5,000 per detector system.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"t University of Technology, Serge Donkers, revealed that laboratory education is highly expensive, partly due to the extra laboratory space and equipment that is required. Therefore, often this type of education is kept to a minimum to reduce costs. VR could change this to prepare young researchers better for the future that is awaiting them.
Less waste
Students learn laboratory skills by practice, which means many petri dishes, pipet points, but also chemicals are wasted. With VR, power is used, but much plastic as well as chemical and biological waste is saved.
Teachers can easily and on the spot observe their students’ progress
In VR, teachers can track individual progress and add personal challenges from a distance for optimal learning curves.
Students could practice at home, if they like
Students could have their lab at home in VR for their laboratory practice, given their computers have the right specifics.
Zooming in
Students could zoom in on their samples, giving them a better idea of what they are actually doing.
Figure 2. Pitching our VR lab to the study program coordinators at TU Delft.
Delft University of Technology is currently thinking about opening a VR learning center, which we hopefully brought a little closer with this idea. We pitched our VR laboratory to all study program coordinators of our faculty and have collected great interest. Hopefully, in this way, we will soon have safer, less expensive and more encompassing laboratory training. We would like to thank Arno Freeken, Luuk Goossen and Arend-Jan Krooneman from the Department of Architecture at Delft University of Technology for aiding in the development of our VR laboratory.

EurAsian Meetup Bioethics Workshop
Apart from developing a tool to teach students how to work in the laboratory as we did with our VR, we believe (young) scientists should also be taught about their ethical responsibilities that stretch beyond the laboratory. Therefore, we organized a workshop during the iGEM EurAsian Meetup with the topic: Bioethical dilemma’s across borders. The goal of this workshop was to increase the awareness of bioethics in the participants and to trigger reflection on the bioethical questions of their own projects.

SCUT,2013,Team:SCUT#Project#Odorant sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," odr-10 and the sequence of flag-tagged into the position between our rho and odr-10 respectively.
In the endogenous MAP-kinase pathway in S.cerevisiae, third messenger will stimulate fus1 promoter, which results in mating of the yeast. In like manner, we create the signal reporter device as “fus1+BFP+ADH1 terminator”. However the sequence of fus1 contains Pst1 restrict enzyme site, we use the method of overlap extension to achieve the purpose of site-directed mutagenesis (""CTGCAG"" to ""CTGGAG"").
Pathway optimization
There is no doubt that signal sensing part and signal reporter part are prerequisite, however, things cannot be that simple because the poor affinity between the  Gα(Gpa1) and heterogeneous GPCRs will slash the intensity and sensibility of our signal pathway. Similarly, transforming the yeast with full-length odr-3, which is the Gα in the caenorhabditis elegans, also has limited affinity for Gβγ of yeast.
A preferential method is that we can create a chimera of Gpa1/odr-3 and only the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of Gpa1 are replaced with corresponding residues from odr-3subunit. This design is owing to the following two detections: first of all, the principal receptor specificity determinants reside at the very carboxy-terminus of Gαsubunits; secondly, The last eight amino acids of Gα are not resolved on the Gαβγ crystal structures, meaning that the exchanged regions have an undefined conformation extending from the end of the 5α helix Figure 2.
Figure 2. Gprotein heterotrimer. G-proteins are signaling molecules found on the inner side of cell membranes. This structure shows a complete complex of three chains with GDP bound.
In order to achieve the communication between E.coli and S.cerevisiae, we need the heterologous receptor, odr-10, successfully express in the S.cerevisiae to detect the diacetyl produced by E.coli. The functional coupling of GPCRs has been achieved typically by modifications to the G protein alpha subunit, Gpa1p and Gβγ signals to a MAP kinase cascade to induce cell-cycle arrest by expressing FAR1 gene and transcription of mating genes. Therefore, successful coupling of foreign GPCRs need to only express chimeric Gαsubunit by deletion of Gpa1 and disable the cell-cycle arrest mechanism by deletion of FAR1. This year"
Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Sustainability#Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," we shared our survey with an ex- iGEMer (Alice LEBOEDEC  from the 2014 INSA­Lyon team) who went in the end of July in South India. She helped us gather information by assissting people to fill it so our team would benefit from this survey and shape our project along with people preferences.  Not only Alice brought few survey filled by inhabitant of a small village, but she also took for us few samples of idli batter, curd (fermented milk), rice, lentils and condiments for us to analyze.
Among the farmers that filled the survey, we could see that everyone eats rice daily with vegetables as a side dish, while fish and meat are eaten once or twice a week. The people she interviewed were really enthusiatic towards our project and they would try the modified microorganisms that make food more nutritious. You can see below the photos of the Idli preparation and the batter.
Online survey :
The same survey was designed online to allow us to have more point of view and information about Indian Citizen food habits. We also made a video explaining the project, that we showed people before giving them the survey. You can see the video here:
Download Video
With the help of the different Indian iGEM teams (IIT_Madras, ISER_Pune, IIT_Delhi, IIT_Kharagpur, SVCE_Chennai) that shared our online survey trough India, we could extract interesting information quite important for us (most of the person that answered this survey are students).
For example, we could see that almost every person that filled the survey eats Idli daily (see Graphic 1). This information is crucial, since Idli is one of the dishe we selected for the addition of the vitamin-producing bacteria. Because a large amount of people eat this dishe daily, it is certainly the best to chose to reduce deficiencies and show our proof of concept for selecting this dishe.
Graphic 1 : Graphic showing the number of Idli eaten per person and per day
This graphic shows that the most eaten ingredient are definitely rice and dal (Graphic 2), the two basic elements we find in most dishes in India (Curd rice, Sambar rice, Lemon rice, Idli, Dosa, etc). On their own, they are not sufficient to meet the needs of the human body in vitamins, it is important to have a balanced diet, but not everyone has access to a variety of food.
Fermented dishes such as Idli or Dosa are not always eaten because it is the only"

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack June_-_-_TEXT.html,"37 C overnight.
6/18/14
We started by looking at the HSP+pACYC184 plates and the pUC19 control plates that we made using the DH5α I and DH5α II cells. There were weird colonies on the DH5α I plate that had the HSP+pACYC184 and 4 colonies on the plate with pUC19 and DH5α II. The other two had no colonies and were left in the incubator.
We also re-ligated the HSP+pACYC184 with Dionne's method of combining all of the usual ingredients in the usual amount but instead of ligating overnight at 16°C we ligated for an hour at room temperature (left it on the bench).
We transformed that ligation following the transformation protocol except that we heat shocked for 50 sec as opposed to 40 sec and put on on a chlor 150 plate and in the incubator.
We then looked at the eight plates that were streaked yesterday: DH5α control, DH5α UV shocked, UV+pACYC184 control, UV+pACYC184 UV shocked, GFP+pBR322 control, GFP+pBR322 UV shocked, UV/GFP+pACYC184/pBR322 control (3 colonies), UV/GFP+pACYC184/pBR322 UV shocked (3 colonies). We took 500μL of PBS and added some cells from each plate/colony to the PBS. This was vortexed, centrifuged, liquid was taken out, 500μL PBS added, and vortexed. Then, we put 200μL in the plate reader and measured fluorescence and concentration. Normalized fluorescence was calculated. BASICALLY, WE ROCK!!!!
As another way of checking that everything was working as we planned in our system, we had sent our primered G-blocks from within the plasmids that we ligated them into to Genewiz to get in sequenced. The sequences came back today!! !! !! From comparing the sequences that Genewiz gave is to the sequences that we had from originally ordering our G-block, it was seen through putting them in the Blast 2 sequences aligner (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgiPAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&BLAST_SPEC=blast2seq&LINK_LOC=align2seq) that GFP's sequences was 98% accurate just from the forward primer reading and that UV's sequence was 100% accurate from the forward primer reading and 99% accurat from the reverse primer reading. We were not able to open the traces of the sequences because Java"

8. Final eluent 1 with DH5-alpha as negative control
9. Final eluent 2 with DH5-alpha as negative control
10. Stage 3 eluent with promoter J23106
A in the appendix 1 is pointing towards the 50 kDa band on the ladder. B is pointing towards the band that can be seen and that likely is the colicin Fy while C is another eluent with the same promoter also showing the colicin Fy existence. This shows that the promotor J23106 can be used to produce the colicin, while CP 11 and J23113 can not.
We did manage to get some indication that the CP11 promoter might have worked but the band was not strong enough to guarantee that it was actually there. There can be quite a few reasons to why the band is not stronger than it is. There is a possibility that the protein was eluted out of the system too early which also seems to be the case to some extent. Appendix 1 lane 3 shows a band in the right position. This was not observed for the other tests but since that eluent is in a falcon tube containing about 40 ml of liquid it was probably very diluted and weak. It could also be some leakage from the well next to it.
The IMAC and SDS-page managed to provide a strong indication that we did produce the colicin Fy. There existed bands at the right places and the negative control did not have any bands at all. All experiments were conducted in the same manner and if it was another protein that by chance bonds to the IMAC gel it should have been in the negative control as well.   Most bacteriocins are not fully studied so there might always be unknown problems with them. One possibility is that they somehow hurt the bacteria in which they are produced. Since the colicin described here is supposed to only react to a specific receptor that some Yersinia species have on the cell surface the probability for the colicin to hurt the producing bacteria is very low. A bigger problem could be that many bacteriocins are short lived in certain conditions and"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food.

Dresden University of Technology
This year, TU Dresden made an excellent effort in promoting environmental sustainability through the introduction of the iGEM Goes Green initiative. The initiative takes on the challenge of presenting a comprehensive set of guidelines and recommendations on how best to approach the iGEM journey through a green lens. As we had decided to work with microplastics for much the same reasons - to promote and encourage a more ecoconscious attitude - we happily incorporated many of the suggestions put forward. For a more elaborate discussion on the iGEM Goes Green concept and our efforts, see GoGreen .
Uppsala University
Embracing a more contemporary take on scientific communication, Uppsala University hosted a series of webinars in which they discussed ethical and legal considerations in synthetic biology with iGEM teams from all over the world. We partook in the seminar concerning biosafety and the potential risks associated with the Open Synthetic Biology concept.

The Nordic iGEM Conference
In June, the University of Copenhagen hosted the annual Nordic iGEM Conference, a weekend intended to bring the nordic iGEM teams together and give them a hint of what they might come to expect of the Giant-Jamboree in Boston. A total of nine different iGEM teams participated in three days of activities, ranging from seminars on synthetic biology and team organizational tools to more informal festivities. During the second day of the event, the teams were presented with the opportunity to elaborate on their project ideas in a mini-jamboree. The presentations were evaluated by a panel of professional scientists and friendly suggestions and feedback were given on the project design and delivery respectively. A winner was determined and we are proud to say that not only were we the judges’ choice and consequently the winners of the mini-jamboree, our presentation was voted the favorite among the NiC participants. We were awarded with a golden pipette and will be the hosts of the 2018 Nordic iGEM conference.
We want to extend our sincerest congratulations to the University of Copenhagen team for hosting such a spectacular weekend.

Biofilm Assay Protocol
Biofilm Prep
Overnight culture of V. cholerae grown in SSW LB at 30 °C for 72 hrs.
20 ml of culture added to 180 ml of SSW LB for dilution
Fill each well of a 96-well plate with 200 ul of SSW LB
To inoculate wells, immerse replicator pins in the diluted bacterial suspension for 30 seconds, then lower replicator pins into wells and agitate for 15 seconds.
Plates are covered and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 24 hrs.
Every 10-12 hrs during the incubation period, spent nutrients are pipetted from wells and replaced with fresh SSW LB
Enzyme Treatment
At 24 hrs, planktonic suspensions and nutrient solutions are aspirated and wells are rinsed by carefully removing and adding liquid from the side of the well using a micropipette. Wells are washed four times.
Enzymes are added to wells immediately after rinsing and allowed to sit for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, wells are washed again and the stains are applied:
0.16% filter-sterilized CTC incubated at room temperature for 2 hr, CTC solutions are prepared directly prior to staining
0.3% CV solution incubated at room temperature for 5 min
After incubation times, absorbed stain is eluted from attached cells with 95% ethanol
Wells are rinsed four times to remove excess stain
Wells then filled with 200 ul ethanol and incubated
CTC incubated for 15 min at room temp
CV incubated for 5 min at room temp
Absorbance Readings
Plates are vigorously shaken for 10 seconds, then light absorbances are read with BioTek FL600 plate reader
CTC absorbance is read at 450 nm
CV absorbance is read at 540 nm
Each raw absorbance value is then corrected by subtracting the mean of absorbance readings for the blank wells prior"

Vigar added that the iGEM team has previously worked on many related projects, which gives them a significant advantage when facing this new challenge as the only iGEM group currently working on this unique approach to environmental cleanup.
“Our iGEM teams have designed a variety of synthetic biology components that all relate to this new project. One year, the team created a biological ‘switch’ that directed bacteria to move toward certain types of contaminants. The next year, we refined that to make the bacteria consume a specific chemical compound, then stop reproducing – we called it a ‘bacuum cleaner.’ Last year, we designed what we called ‘bio-batteries’ that use bacteria with photosynthetic properties to generate electrical currents.”
Vigar said that the group hopes to accomplish several things with their research. “We intend to create and characterize biological parts that can be used in the efforts of cleaning the tailings ponds, and those parts will be available to the general public for use in the future through the Registry of Standard Biological Parts housed at MIT.
The other benefit will be to the team members as they progress in their academic and post-university careers. “This experience will be extremely beneficial to enhance team members independent and critical thinking,“ Vigar said.
“As well, we learn how classroom knowledge can be directly applied in helping to solve everyday issues - specifically the application of Synthetic biology to ‘engineer’ solutions. There is also the potential to contribute to scientific papers -- which is rewarding and especially advantageous when applying for graduate studies, medical school, or jobs in the pharmaceutical industry.”
Vigar said the iGEM competition and running an independent research lab with undergraduate students in particular has given him and his team members a glimpse of what science can accomplish and how there are additional, and infinite possibilities through scientific advancement.
“iGEM has spurred our scientific creativity in what we can and cannot do, and has opened our eyes to not only the field of synthetic biology, but made us more aware of the research community in general.”

Through our collaboration, we can not only produce bioenergy, but have another powerful application in CO2 emission problem. NCKU-Tainan also provided us a valuable application way and helped us design a draft of device. Meanwhile, the xylose source from straw was really important to their E. coli CO2 utilization system which changed the positive carbon footprint into negative carbon footprint. This collaboration solved both the energy problem and environment problem. Click here to see them: https://2018.igem.org/Team:NCKU_Tainan/Collaborations
Click here to see details!
Through UESTC system, xylose will be produced in their fermentation broth as well as other three raw material. In order to calculate the amount of xylose production, we tested the ferulic acid which yield by gas chromatography (GC) after 12 hours. Basically, ferulic acid cover for 1.15% of straw. Then, the enzyme activity of ferulic acid degradation can be calculated. Next, they assume that the rate of xylan decomposition is the same as that of ferulic acid while 30% of xylan composed of straw. Finally, through derivation, we can get 0.0348 kg xylose from 1 kg straw. The detail progress of calculation was listed below.
Sample: 20ml, positive control and 0.3g corn straw was added, Abs600 was not certain because we had added straw.
-Ferulic acid by GC: 0.53 mg / L
-Ferulic acid in straw: 0.3g * 1.15% = 0.345 mg
-Ferulic acid degradation rate: (0.53 * 20*10^-3)/0.345 = 10.6%
-Xylose in 1kg straw: 1kg * 30% * 10.6% = 0.0348 kg
With NCKU system, E. coli consumed xylose to uptake CO2.
The xylose consumption was 23.864 kg to uptake 1kg of CO2. In conclusion, every 685 kg straw can be used to capture 1 kg CO2. In other words, capturing 1% annual CO2 emission of Small and medium enterprise, which is 20 tons CO2 require 16 tons straw.

Attributions
The UQ-Australia iGEM team has been involved in a number of human practices and outreach activities throughout the year. In particular, we have presented synthetic biology to high school students at the BioFutures camp and to undergraduate physics students . Additionally, we have reviewed the issue of patented parts present to iGEM, and have been involved in the collaborative effort to create CommunityBricks and AlumniGEM. All these activities are summarised below.
Patenting
In a dynamic field such as synthetic biology, discovery moves at an astounding pace and is driven by the findings of groups from all around the world. However, conflict often arises when the choice between collaboration and commercialisation arises, and consequently patents have become commonplace in the scientific world. In the last 5 years, 34% of respondents had applied for or received a patent on their findings. Additionally, 68% stated that they had sent research tools to others in academia [1]. This is especially relevant in iGEM, a competition whose explicit aim is to remain open source and collaborative. We examine whether this is a realistic or achievable goal within the framework of patents in the scientific world.
Within iGEM, the stipulation that all BioBricks must remain open source and redistributable means that patented material is inherently excluded from submission. This sort of restriction differs somewhat from the usual research experience, where 91% of scientists have not checked for patents on the material they used in the last 5 years [1]. However, iGEM falls in a unique `grey area’, which effectively prevents the use of any patented materials by participating teams with the requirement to submit their parts to the Registry to be redistributed. Although teams are using parts solely for research purposes, the nature of the registry and iGEM’s distribution kits means that by redistributing parts iGEM would be infringing on the patent holder. The UQ-Australia iGEM team is limited in their project due to patents on key components.
In the past, the issue of patenting has been less significant on iGEM with"

Out of curiosity we started a cultivation of E. coli KRX carrying <bbpart>BBa_K1172588</bbpart> at the last possible minute to see if the we would achieve a riboflavin production or if the combination with oprF led to diminishing or vanishing riboflavin concentrations.
We were delighted to see a distinct yellow coloration after two days of cultivation in M9 medium :
Figure 14: Photograph of a shaking flask in which E. coli KRX with <bbpart>BBa_K1172588</bbpart> was cultivated for three days.
We took samples after 48 and 72 hours and carried out a fluorescent measurement.
Therefore we diluted riboflavin of a known concentration (5.31*10^-5 M) to generate a calibration curve. It´s equation is:
Y = 8*10^-8X – 3898,9
If we insert the measured values for Y and multiplie the result with the the molar mass of riboflavin (376.37 g/mol) we are able to evaluate the amount of riboflavin in the supernatant.
48 h
72 h
2473.97 µg/L
2669.92 µg/L
This means, after 72 hours the amount of riboflavin produced by E. coli KRX with <bbpart>BBa_K1172588</bbpart> is only 5/8 compared to the values we gathered before the Regional . Probably because of higher stress the bacteria are exposed to.

Human Practices
Our HP projects this year were diverse and palpably profound. All team members engaged in those      projects with great enthusiasm and we think that we did some great work presenting the field of      synthetic biology and the iGEM competition in general to the public.
Integrated Human Practice
Throughout our Human Practice projects starting from lab courses at school to presentation of our     work to a broad community at the “Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften” we received a strong feedback     from the people, what we must consider and how we can improve our project. Overall, visualization     of our project was challenging in the first place. Here the school children showed us multiple ways,     how people can understand our project better, without using to complex terms, which can only be     understood by scientists. The Lego brick concept was convenient to demonstrate the working     principle of our catcher tag system as well as the formation of our polymer and was further well-     understood by non-scientists.     Out trip to the “Bionicum” gave us an impression how nature fulfills motion and how we have to     adjust our system to work as a muscle. Here, we realized that our attempt of a light-driven muscle is     inferior to our electric device as the thickness of our muscle system limits the transmitting light.     Hence, we focused more on the development and the pattern how we can fold the DEAs to reach     high strength with low amounts of material.     Finally, we have demonstrated the principle of our work at the “Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften” to     a broad community. We could apply, what we have learnt during our Human Practice and our work     in the lab. We were faced with many questions and bright ideas how to scale up the process and the     purification by secretion of the protein instead of lyses to create a continuous supply. It was a     crucial     factor for the evaluation of our gaming app, where we benefited from the enthusiastic crowd of     people.

In our experiment, HepG2 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. After one day incubation gradient concentration of sodium palmitate from 0 mM to 1.0mM, and 2.0mM were added into each row. After adding the sodium palmitate, we have incubated the cells for 24 hours and 48 hours. MTT reagent was added and formazan formation was observed and measured.
Results
From the MTT assay, we can conclude that after 24 hours of incubation with palmitic acid, around 45% of cell viability can be maintained even at 2.0mM. For 48 hours incubation, cell viability is very different. To maintain 50% cell viability after 48 hours incubation with palmitic acid, we cannot exceed 0.32 mM of palmitic acid.
Transfection and Fatty Acid Uptake Rate
The ACE proteins for glyoxylate shunt were fused with fatty acid-induced promoters. The promoters were induced by introducing variable concentrations of sodium palmitate to trigger greater expression. To observe the difference in fatty acid uptake rate for constitutive and inducible system where enzymes expression were triggered, we also did a parallel transfection of BioBrick containing constitutive promoter to see the variations of FA uptake rate.
To get the uptake rate of FA, we decided to quantify FA concentration in medium time by time. We are right now making our determination to use FA quantification assay kit, Sigma Fatty Acid Quantification Kit from TIN HANG TECHNOLOGY LIMITED.

RBS-EmR-CP29-RBS-aeBlue/pLBA169 (BBa_K2230004)
pLBA169 was designed as vector for transforming Lactobacillus acidophilus thru chromosome homologous recombination. The gene cassette will be inserted to the location at the downstream of slpA (LBA0169) which encodes a surface layer protein. EmR (erythromycin resistance gene) is driven by the upstream promoter of slpA and acts as a selection marker. Promoter CP29 drives gene expression of aeBlue in Lactobacillus.
4    Acid-resistant Pill Design
Our products will be encapsulated into the pill. Microencapsulation process combines sodium alginate and calcium chloride to form microspheres. This tiny spheres are acid resistant and don’t release probiotics in gastric fluid until passing into higher pH (pH=7~9) in the environment of the intestinal tract.
DEMONSTRATION
Glucose is transported into the small intestine and from there into the blood. Na+-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 is involved in intestinal sugar absorption, and Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) facilitate glucose transportation from intestine to blood stream.
Which glucose transporter should we use?
In order to compete the absorption of glucose with intestine, we need a better transporter for glucose uptake with higher efficiency. The value of Km of an enzyme was utilized as a parameter to select our target. Km (Michaelis constant) is determined by the concentration of substrate which permits the enzyme to achieve half Vmax. The lower Km means a higher substrate affinity.
As you can see in the right table, based on our research, the glucose transporter of Salmonella typhimurium has lowest Km, meaning the highest affinity of glucose bound to the transporter. So we decided to choose glucose transporter system of Salmonella as our target.
FACT
Interestingly, Salmonella is an intracellular intestinal pathogen. To survive in the small intestine epithelial cells, Salmonella has to utilize and metabolize available and limited glucose in a multiple and efficient way. Not surprisingly, Salmonella has higher affinity of glucose transporter compared to human"

    2. Compare the growth performance of acid-tolerant strains
    According to the 2% inoculation rate, the original strain L. lactis NZ9000, three mutant strains L. lactis WH101, WH102, WH103 were inoculated into 10 ml of liquid medium under the conditions of pH 4.5, 5.0, and 7.0, respectively. The OD value of the strains were measured every 0.5 hours, and the growth curve of the strains are shown as Fig 2.
Fig 2 (A) The growth curve of the four strains at pH 7.0; (B) The growth curve of the four strains at pH 5.0; (C) The growth curve of the four strains at pH 4.5; (D)The survival rate of the four strains at pH 4.0.
    Results analysis
1)  The growth of acid-resistant strains under normal pH 7.0 conditions was not significantly affected.
2)  The growth performance of acid-resistant strains at pH 5.0 and pH 4.5 was significantly improved compared to the original strain.
3)  At pH 5.0, the biomass of the acid-tolerant strains WH101, WH102, WH103 was 7.0, 4.8 and 5.6 times that of the original strain, respectively.
4)  At pH 4.5, they were 5.5, 3.6, and 4.3 times the original strain, respectively.
5)  Under the condition of pH 4.0, the survival rate of L. lactis WH101, L. lactis WH102 and L. lactis WH103 was significantly higher than that of the original strain. And the survival rate increased gradually with the prolongation of stress time and acid resistance after 5 hours of stress. The strains were 16000, 351.4 and 264.3 times the original strain, respectively.
    Finally, through genomic mutation and high-throughput screening, we obtained a strain L. lactis WH101 with good acid resistance from 35,000 strains. Next, we will compare the NZ9000 and WH101 by transcriptomics analysis and mathematical model to obtain key acid resistant components.

Introduction
In order to effectively model genetic circuits, databases of parts with known characteristics are essential. Without such databases, computationally designed circuits may not be feasible to implement in vivo. Unfortunately, parameters such as promoter strength, RBS affinity, transcription, translation and decay rates are hard to find in the literature, and those which do exist are rarely measured under standardised conditions.
Several efforts to produce parts libraries are currently underway. As part of our contribution to synthetic biology, we decided to create a promoter library for B. subtilis.
Novelty in this sub-project
The novelty in this sub-project lies in the generation of a large number of B. subtilis promoters, based upon carefully considered variations to an existing promoter region. We chose the promoter region of the transcription factor SigmaA, since it is the most widely-used promoter in B. subtilis. Over 300 genes are controlled by SigA. Their promoter regions have highly conserved -10 and -35 regions, surrounded by variable sequences.

Team Activity Tests:
Negative control for the experimental setup with different pHs of the Britton-Robinson buffer. Effect of 5 mM ABTS was determined.
Today was all about finding a comfy environment for our laccases. We thought of determining the right pH before going on with substrate saturation experiments since we could not be sure, that the activity was influenced by the pH. We chose a range from pH 4 to pH 9, applied 616 ng laccase and 5 mM ABTS. Our results revealed the following results:
optimal pH of ECOL: pH 5
optimal pH of BPUL: pH 4 and pH 5
optimal pH of BHAL: pH 5
optimal pH of TTHL: pH 5
BHAL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.
TTHL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.
ECOL activity measured under different pH conditions (pH 4 to pH 9) to determine the pH optimum. 616 ng Laccase and 5 mM ABTS were used.

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consist of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help from our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most out of our time. We learned, grew and bonded over the (most of the times) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people whom we celebrated with when we found out the digestion release bands with right length. These are also the people who patted us in the back when we saw no GFP expression under the fluorescence microscope. We wanted YOU to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knew, maybe we could end up doing research together in the future!

Interview & Consultation
Environmental Protection Bureau
    This year, we aim to tackle real-life environmental problems, hoping to apply our PLA and 2-PE to address urgent human needs. Therefore, we went on a visit to Environmental Protection Bureau for getting more information about infectious bacteria and unpleasant smell in daily life. In the external environment, where is the most enriched area of bacteria, and often accompanied by unpleasant odors? What firstly comes to our mind is the trash can surrounding us. We exchanged our idea with the environmental specialist, which we planned to apply our rose-scented bacteriostat to the trash can. The specialist thought tackling real-life environmental problems with our PLA and 2-PE is an innovative and interesting method, but pointed out that the environment of the trash may be more complicated than we think. Through the conversation to the specialist, and inspired by laboratory routine, we finally narrowed our scope to the beakers in the lab, which are always full of bacteria and give off unpleasant smells(More details on our Design page).
    After determining our main focus, we interviewed the environmental specialist again to seek advice for our applied design. The specialist suggested that we could design a lid for beaker that can be used to achieve the goal of persistent bacteriostatic.  (More details on our Applied Design page)
JCI Accredited Academic Medical Center Hospital
    Except for focusing on external environment trash can, we also threw great attention to internal environment axilla, where are abundant varieties of microbes and is the culprit of unpleasant smell. Such unpleasant smell brings great trouble to the public. To speak to stakeholders and evaluate our project, we went to JCI Accredited Academic Medical Center Hospital and further understood that, the current solution for bromhidrosis is generally divided two parts. The one is sterilized with alcohol, aluminum salt antiperspirant, which way may clog pores, and have some influence on the environment. Also, some people may be more sensitive to alcohol. The other is surgical therapy, which could cause some adverse reactions to the skin and leave unsightly scars. In comparison, our 2-PE and PLA are food grade substance, which are absolutely safe and more friendly to people and the environment.     Besides, we communicated with dermatologist Dr. Zhang, deputy chief physician about our project. The doctor said our project sounds interesting and antibacterial substance PLA can be applied in other clinical aspects. About the impact of broad-spectrum antibacterial, the doctor pointed that our armpit area is small, and sterilization is only local sterilization"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium.
