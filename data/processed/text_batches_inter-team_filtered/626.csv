Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," several days until reaching hypersaturation. Thus, the cultures would experience saturate mismatch repair.
Furthermore, we corresponded with Mr. Camps about the determination of the mutation rate and our idea to use high-throughput sequencing for this issue. He said that next generation sequencing would be a good experiment, especially to show where the mutational hotspots of the EP-Pol I lies. Therefore, we designed our high-throughput sequencing experiment.
We were also interested in the exact functionality of the chromosomal temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase I from E. coli JS200. We wanted to know whether he already tested if and how many mutations occur at the permissive temperature while still containing the plasmid encodes error-prone polymerase I. Mr. Camps estimates the mutagenesis rate under these conditions to be about 25% of the mutagenesis performance at 37°C.
At last, we wanted to know Mr. Camps opinion of our idea to change the expression rate of the EP-Pol I. He responded that after reaching a certain threshold the mutagenesis rate would not be improved anymore. This means that raising the expression strength would not change the mutagenesis rate.
Upscaling, Process Development and Business Plan
As the future prospects of our project were of great interest to us we consulted several experts (Prof. Dr. Karl Friehs, Dr. Joe Max Risse, Prof. Dr. Thomas Noll, Dr. Martin Schleef) on the topic to effectively upscale our project. Together we discussed what has to be done to implement our system into a market environment especially which aspects had to be considered in detail. The result was a business plan that in detail describes the measurements to be taken to found and effectively run a company. This also involves a summary of factors we decided on after carefully discussing different possibilities and methods with the consulted experts. Thus we collected all information considered vital for a company to be competitive on the market.

At the same time, most reviewers are aware of the clash between the scientist and the public, manifested by the dismissal of novel technologies by the public, for example, the abundance of protests in Europe against genetically modified crops. Hence, some claim that a new form of communication needs to be sought to inform the public about new scientific technologies that may clash with the opinions and beliefs of the public. One phrase that is often mentioned in the literature is that the public thinks that the scientist is “playing for God” by creating new life forms (Caplan, 2009)(Kaebnick, 2009)(Douglas & Savalescu, 2010). Yet, even though some people might indeed be of this opinion, this phrase runs the risk of making all criticism against the creation of new life forms appear as religious or dogmatic. It seems that in relatively secular societies the religious argument does not have a strong base, especially not when it is voiced in the public realm. Moreover, making every argument against the creation of new life forms appear as dogmatic or religious runs the risk of disqualifying the public before one has properly considered the arguments that are at stake.
In order to investigate the relation between scientific innovations-or may one say revolutions?-and the judgment of the public it seems imperative to investigate the actual process of opinion-formation. Next to that, it is important to investigate how this relates to the transparency of the scientific process and supplying the public with more information as was proposed by the Heidelberg iGEM-team mentioned in the introduction. Hannah Arendt in her lectures on the political philosophy of Immanuel Kant develops an understanding of what it means to judge something, and how this is intrinsically linked to issues as publicity and popularization. In these lectures Arendt stresses the need for publicity and popularization in order to enable the public to judge something properly. Moreover, Arendt's lectures stresses the importance of separating ethics, understood in a Kantian sense, and judgment. For Kant, there cannot be such a thing as a moral opinion, that is, something is good, or it is bad, there is no matter of taste. The attractiveness of Arendt's effort of investigating the Kantian judgment lies for iGEM in the fact that it moves beyond an ethics which in our times would be called dogmatic and turns to a way of judging that is related to taste and is grounded in a political community. Hence, even though Arend"

In return, the iGEM Team Tec-Monterrey shared their opinion about phage therapy in other countries like Mexico, which helped us set a clear focus on our project. They also provided us with a lot of inspiration regarding the optimization of our cell extract and possible human practices projects. All in all, we had a great time collaborating, and we are looking forward to meeting our new friends from Mexico in person at the Giant Jamboree.

Assembling Genetically Engineered Phages From Grenoble
A class-average of TEM images of T5 bacteriophages
Plaque assay proved that the assembled T5 bacteriophages are fully functional.
The iGEM Team Grenoble-Alpes is creating a diagnostic tool for pathogenic bacteria. Adding upon the accomplishments of this project, we collaborated on expanding Phactory as a universally employable platform for production of  therapeutic bacteriophages. iGEM Grenoble supplied the necessary bacteria and their phage (T5). We then isolated the DNA from the samples and tested the assembly of this phage in our cell-extract.
The phage was produced successfully and is fully functional. We verified the assembly by plaque assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We were very happy to work together with iGEM Grenoble on advancing phage therapy and are looking forward so see their final results during the Giant Jamboree."

After induction those 5 Erlenmeyer flasks are cultured for another 8 hours, during which 3 samples are taken into a 96-well plates from each flask every hours and their OD are measured with microplate reader.
Western blot to further prove the lysis effect of E7
Besides OD measurement, we also do Western blot. Taken from each Erlenmeyer flasks at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 hours after induction, those samples are centrifuged ,the supernatant and sediment are used to run a SDS-PAGE, then the antibody of DnaK(which is an endogenous protein expressed constitutively in E.coli) is used to conduct a western blot.
Function Test of The Enzymes
To test whether formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH) work or not, we developed this system. In this system, when PADH oxidize formaldehyde, electrons lost by formaldehyde are transferred to nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Gaining electrons, the NAD+ are reduced to reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH). By measuring the absorbance of NADH under light of 340nm, we can know the concentration of NADH, and finally know the activity of PADH.
Culture
Experimental group (E.coli with PADH gene) and control group (E.coli without PADH gene) are both cultured under 37&#8451, overnight
Lysis
Collect cells by centrifugation, and wash them with Tris-HCl (PH 7.5) twice
Resuspend cells with Tris-HCl (PH 7.5)

The original Idea (Around June to July of 2011)
Traditional engineering fields such as electrical, mechanical, civil, agricultural, etc., have been working for the last two centuries separately from biological developments (life sciences). The UTP-Panama team has decided to break this paradigm in the Republic of Panama. To accomplish this goal, the UTP-Panama Team is working in the development of what we call a ""SynBio Engineering Tool Kit"", the construction of engineering tools, obtained from biological resources. At this moment, engineering groups are designing projects in different fields, using biological devices to improve and solve traditional engineering issues.
In this sense the proposed lines are:
Agricultural, Food & Civil-Environmental Engineering
Nitrogen area: introduce chemotaxis to BioBrick BBa_K381001 develop by the Bristol 2010 iGEM Team, to make a dynamics nitrate-nitrite sensor. The main goal of this area (in the future) is to express LegHemoglobine and other nitrogen fixation molecules in E.Coli.
Phosphates sensing: BBa_K116401 & BBa_K116404.
pH sensing: Taiwan BacToKidney pH sensors BBa_K116001 & BBa_K116002.
Mechanical and Material Sciences Engineering
Biopolymer area: continue the Virgina (2008), Utah State (2009) and Insa-Lyon 2010 develop in the field of bioplastic-biopolymers through expression genes for PHA, PHB, and PHC.
Heat Production: uses and improvement of Gatech 2010, Biobrick BBa_K410000, in mechanical engineering.
Electrical & Computational Engineering
Biosensing: Light Sensitive proteins,  work with BBa_K191003.
Creation of Bioelectrical & Bioelectronics circuits.

Bay Area Maker Faire
On the weekend of May 20-22, the Stanford half of our team designed and presented a booth at the 2016 Bay Area Maker Faire. Every year, the Maker Faire brings together self-identified ""makers"" - whether hobbyists, professional designers, student science teams, scientists, artists and/or performers - to share their work and inspire one another. We worked one of over one thousand booths presenting to many thousands of visitors.
Biosensors Team Member Amy explaining synthetic biology concepts to the broader public.
We developed an educational program for our booth primarily directed at kids without previous background in synthetic biology. We led kids and their parents through strawberry and banana DNA extractions, explaining the mechanisms at work and giving kids ""DNA necklaces"" - PCR tubes with fruit DNA threaded on multi-colored string - to take home as souvenirs.  We put together a ""DNA Origami"" station where kids could fold colored paper into DNA double helices.  We used this activity as an opportunity to explain DNA structure and provide a simplified explanation of the central dogma.  We also had a Bloony station at which kids could blow up balloons.  At this station we explained our iGEM project and challenged people to rethink the definition of a balloon.  Finally, we put together a crowdsourcing activity: we took a blank styrofoam board and wrote at the top,  ""WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH A BIOBALLOON?""  We left out Post-It notes and markers, and passersby contributed to an ever-expanding brainstorming map.

TA system
Background
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been abundantly found on plasmids and chromosomes of free-living prokaryotes and genes encoding a toxin and its cognate antitoxin are generally contiguous. Toxins are stable proteins that inhibit one of essential cellular processes, such as DNA replication, translation, peptidoglycan synthesis or cell division.
To date, TA systems are classified into five types according to the nature and the function of antitoxins.
In type I and type III TA systems, the antitoxins are small noncoding RNAs. Type I antitoxins bind to the cognate toxin mRNAs to inhibit their translation initiation or to induce their degradation, while type III antitoxin inactivate their cognate toxins through protein-RNA interactions.
Type II, IV, and V antitoxins are proteins. Type II is the best-characterized TA systems where antitoxins neutralize the harmful effects of the cognate toxins through direct binding. In type IV and V TA systems, only one example has been identified, respectively. The type IV antitoxin, CbeA, antagonizes the activity of CbtA toxin by interfering with the binding of CbtA to its target cytoskeleton proteins, MreB and FtsZ. In type V TA system, GhoS antitoxin itself is an endoribonuclease, which specifically cleaves GhoT toxin mRNA to block its expression.
Our study has focused on the lethal efficiency of different toxin proteins.
Mechanism
Regulations of MazF toxin in E. coli MazF-MazE TA system
Escherichia coli MazF, which belongs to the MazEF family with its cognate antitoxin MazE, is one of the best-characterized toxins. Under stressful environments, MazF specifically cleaves cellular RNAs at ACA sites irrespective of the ribosome, serving as a post-transcriptional regulator.
Interestingly, MazF homologues are well-conserved in the prokaryotic domain. Additionally, they cleave discrete RNA sites based on recognition length and sequences. Therefore, MazF homologues are thought to play diverse biological roles; indeed, they"
Nagahama,2014,Team:Nagahama Policy & Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," and invited general public, iGEM Teams, researchers and instructors of synthetic biology there, because we wanted to know and learn relation of synthetic biology and society. iGEM Teams conducted a presentation and did a poster session about synthetic biology. We had instructors of synthetic biology give us a lecture about the acts of recombining genes and producing organisms which have new abilities. We discussed the theme with audiences. We got different ideas. Synthetic biology had been strange for audiences who had had a negative image by its name. They understood our work and took interest in synthetic biology. Through this experiment, we really felt synthetic biology is not known widely. People wanted to know and to learn synthetic biology. We felt we have to consider bringing a new way. We set our question as below; how should we have interaction with people who are not part of scientific society as an organization of college student? We thought we should do various workshops and lecture young people synthetic biology.

iGEM Japan
We discussed iGEM JAPAN’s future initiative at this meeting. Setting up iGEM JAPAN was committed to making it easier for iGEM teams to communicate with each other. However, the interactions between the iGEM teams have been decreasing recently, and the only event that iGEM teams gather together this year is the meetup held at Tokyo Metropolitan University in August. We had to seek a solution for this problem. At this meeting in Nagahama, iGEM JAPAN created a Facebook page and a group of LINE. Our future plan is to make a website directed toward the outside.
School festival at the Universtiy of Tokyo
We took part in School festival at the Universtiy of Tokyo on May 18th.  We did a poster session about synthetic biology. People doesn’t have accurate knowledge about Syntheticbiology. Synthetic biology had been strange for audiences who had had a negative image by its name Though this event, we wanted audiences to know synthetic biology. They heard us a lot of questions of synthetic biology. Audiences were interested in synthetic biology.

Kyoto,2013,Team:Kyoto#Sponsors_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM teams. We have helped this new team in the ways listed below.
Explaining what is important to establish new iGEM team
We explained what is important in order to establish new iGEM team to Biwako Nagahama.
First, we stated what is necessary for managing their laboratory.
Second, we taught them what Synthetic biology is like, and gave them some technical knowledge required for iGEM.
Finally, we instructed them about BioBrick, which is one of the most important purposes in iGEM. By increasing gene registry, their research may lead to developing biology.
Holding study meeting to manage iGEM team
We taught them our knowledge from our experience, such as how to construct their project and to edit the wiki homepage, which is important in order to manage their iGEM team.  Furthermore, we discussed our projects with each other and exchanged advices. By lecturing them, we attained some new viewpoints on our project, and thanks to this discussion, we got a new point of view about our own project. So, this study meeting was meaningful not only for Nagahama, but also for ourselves.
Editing wiki
Even if you have done some experiments and got a positive result, this does not make any sense, unless you express the results to the world. However, the way to express your achievements in iGEM is quite unique and difficult for a green hand. In order to express our achievements in iGEM, we have to make our own homepage. Therefore, we helped making the most basic wiki design frames for Nagahama. We understood what they wanted to edit, and showed them the methods. We also left some comments of the method to edit the page in their source. Thus, we helped the establishments and developments of a new team. Throughout this activity, we contributed to spreading Synthesis Biology.
We helped a newly established team, Biwako Nagahama!!

iGEM JAPAN
iGEM teams in Japan have made efforts to connect with each other by establishing an organization called “iGEM Japan.” iGEM Japan is composed of several iGEM teams around Japan, and is closely connected with each other. iGEM Japan holds the All-Japan meeting twice a year, and a regional meeting once a year. This year, iGEM Japan held the All-Japan meeting in order to deepen our friendship and mutual understanding. In these meetings, we exchange opinions about our own projects and how to manage the teams. Moreover, in addition to these face to face meetings, we connected with other iGEM"

Note there’s just one LED - if you solder both the optical density and fluorescence LEDs seperately and use pin headers you can very quickly swap between them.
If you want to be able to switch quickly (and for increased durability) you could implement a toggle switch into the design. We decided against this due to the added cost, however the if you want to do this click here to view the circuit diagram.

In the cuvette holder the LEDs should be laid out as they were in the Aachen design; the fluorescence LED in the bottom, the optical density LED on one side and the light sensor opposite the optical density LED.
Once it’s all soldered, you’ll need to upload the code to the Digispark (you can actually do this before you solder, it doesn’t matter when). Follow the instructions on the Digistump wiki to get set up. We didn’t write them here too as it’s likely to go out of date quickly. In the unlikely event that the wiki does go down, we’ve made a save on the Wayback Machine here .
Do make sure you follow the steps exactly, don’t just skim them and assume it’ll be alright! Although Digisparks are generally pretty hardy, messing up could still fry them, making it harder to troubleshoot and wasting your time and money.
Once you’ve got your environment set up, simply copy our code into the Arduino window, click upload and plug in the Digispark when prompted. It’s just a one time set up, if you’re uploading to multiple chips at once it’s very quick - just repeat the upload step for each Digispark.
Now you should be able to use it on any device. Simply open the hardware interpreter page on your computer, laptop or phone and plug the Digispark in. It will take at least 5 seconds to start - up to 15 seconds on some devices.
Some devices might require adapters to connect to the Digispark, especially phones and tablets. If you’re not sure where to start, try searching for an 'OTG' (on the go) female USB adapter for the port"

Biobricks
The following biobricks were designed, sent to the registry and characterized:
Bba_K1223002 – P.A.S.E 2 cassette
Bba_K1223003 - KanR (promoter+CDS)
Bba_K1223005 - cI translational unit
Bba_K1223006 - HisTag + stop codon
Bba_K1223007 - cI translational unit with His-tag
Bba_K1223011 - ampR translational unit (ampicilin resistance CDS+promoter)
The following biobricks were designed, characterized, and we currently work on sending them to the registry:
Bba_K1223001 – P.A.S.E 1 cassette
Bba_K1223013 - Pyrolysyl-tRNA synthetase CDS
Bba_K1223014 - tRNA-Pyl (pylT) gene from Methanosarcina barkeri str. Fusaro
In addition, we work on removing illegal restriction sites from pkd46 functional unit (Bba_K1223014). The biobrick itself works and was characterized.
P.A.S.E 1
The system’s parts have been designed and synthesized.
All the systems parts have been assembled into e. coli including chromosomal            recombination.
Since we haven’t succeeded yet in proving the recombination system works, an alternative design was conceived for purposes of proof of concept, relying on the same principles as the original design. Instead of using a linear DNA with recombination sites for the toxin cassette, we used a plasmid as a cloning vector. The completed system was assembled and it is comprised of an e. coli transformed with pUC57 cI and pUC57 Toxin (toxin regulated by cI binding promoter). Characterizing the system is undergoing.

Introduction
A nickel-dependant enzyme1, urease is effectively produced by many organisms using urea as a waste product.2 Animals, plants, bacteria, fungi and some algs alike synthesize urease, which is also a present as a soil enzyme.3 The breakdown of urea by urease is as follows:
(NH2)2CO + H2O+heat → CO2 + 2NH34
More specifically, urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia and carbamate; the carbamate produced is subsequently degraded by spontaneous hydrolysis to produce another ammonia and carbonic acid.5
The significance of urease is that the reaction it catalyses has very high endothermic properties, meaning that there will be a significant heat intake in the conduction of the process, making the enzyme ideal to conduct a cooling process. Aside from its relatively high endothermic function, the enzyme has been historically important in major scientific establishments in respective fields and has been under the scope of many researchers worldwide, making urease one of the most identified enzymes in the world.6
Background Information
Both, urea and ureases, represent important milestones in modern Biochemistry. Urea, isolated from human urine in 1773, was the first organic molecule synthetized in laboratory from inorganic compounds, by Wöhler in 1828.  In 1926, James B. Sumner crystallized urease from jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis), the first protein crystal ever obtained, and his work was fundamental to prove that enzymes are indeed proteins.
Urease was purified at the year of 1828. Being the enzyme to breakdown the major nitrogenous waste product, urea, the enzyme reached the glory of being the first enzyme to purified. It was with the purification of urease that it was understood that enzymes were functional outside of the cell. Also, many groundbreaking discoveries were made after this discovery, making urease one of the most commonly known and investigated enzymes of today. Since 1828,"

The concept of light dependent resistors was also discussed, however after further research it was discovered that the level of sensitivity of these components may not be at the level necessary for the device.  Although we do not yet have specific numbers on how luminescence the reporter is, we are not currently pursuing this proposed option.  We are planning on purchasing an Arduino Uno and several light sensors to begin testing and quantifying the effectiveness of the different components.  In the next week we are hoping that the proposed reporter will be ready to test that aspect of the system and determine which sensor and process will be the most effective to determine if the signal is present.  Additionally the modelling team prepared a presentation on light emission and importance that it could have on our project and how we are planning on designing the higher level device with a light sensor and a digitized device.  In parallel to ourresearch regarding the reporter and the light sensors, we have been continuing to explore Maya and Matlab ensuring our skills will be ready in time for when data from our system becomes available to model.
Week 8: June 23rd - June 27th
This week we continued extensive research regarding filters and light sensors along with any other necessary components we need to purchase such as the Arduino microcontroller.  We have also begun designing experimental conditions for testing the brightness of the chosen reporter and the sensitivity of the light sensor itself.  After this testing occurs to determine the ideal brightness of the reporter and the sensitivity is determined, we will be able to optimize the device and the amount of reporter that is necessary to trigger the light sensor and consequential voltage.  We continued to research different options of sensors, and what we would additionally need for our device circuit including resistors and other circuit elements.  The option of using light filters was also explored and we looked into the three main types (used in robots): the coloured gel filter, interference filter, and dichroic filter.
Coloured gel filter is made by mixing dyes into a plastic base. Depending on what dye is used, only a certain band of wavelengths can pass through the filter. It is the cheapest out of the three, but the least accurate one. Interference filter is made of several chemical layers. Each layer blocks a certain range of wavelengths so only a very small range of wavelengths can pass through. It is more accurate than gel filter (because the range of wavelengths allowed through can be made really small), but expensive. Dichroic filter is made of organic dyes and other chemicals. It absorbs light at certain wavelength. Again, it is more accurate than the coloured"

A combination of bacteriocins and technologies, such as pulsed electric fields, enables us to disrupt the cellular membrane for penetration of the cell and have been suggested to be highly effective Dan, Y., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria a Review Article."" APCBEE Procedia 2: 50-56. . This method could be a way for us to give the hybrid bacteriocin Laterosporulin-ThuricinS access to cross the cell membrane of P. aeruginosa. This technology can also be a way for us to optimize the effectiveness of the bacteriocins generally.
Bacteriocins as probiotics ( Top )
Probiotics are living microorganisms that when consumed in modest amounts, it confer to health benefits for the host. Studies have demonstrated the impact of bacteriocin-producing strains’ ability to compete within complex microbial communities and thereby influence the health of the host. It was shown that bacteriocins are able to directly inhibit the invasion of competing strains or pathogens, or modulate the composition of the microbiota. This can have an influence on the host immune system Dobson, A., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Bacteriocin production: a probiotic trait?"" Appl Environ Microbiol, 78, 1-6. . However, when using bacteriocins as probiotics it is important to make a thorough evaluation of the ethical aspects of it, as well as a risk assessment.
It is suggested that probiotics producing bacteriocins could lead to positive probiotic functionality in a number of ways:
Bacteriocins could function as colonizing peptides, facilitating the introduction and dominance of a producer into an already occupied niche, thereby facilitating the competition of probiotic bacteria with the unfavourable resident bacteria.
Bacteriocins could act as antimicrobial peptides that directly inhibits competing strains or pathogens.
Bacteriocins could function as signalling peptides that either 1) signals other bacteria through quorum sensing and bacterial cross talk within microbial communities, or 2) through signalling cells of the host’s immune system Dobson, A., et al. (2012). ""Bacteriocins Bacteriocin production: a probiotic trait?"" Appl Environ Microbiol, 78, 1-6. .

Matt Copeland, PhD
I grew up in a van down by the river, sustaining myself primarily on a diet of government cheese. When I wasn't reeling from diet-induced vitamin deficiencies I managed to complete college and get a B.A. in Biochemistry from McDaniel College (Westminster, MD). I then moved to Wisconsin to get closer to the source of my government cheese and attend graduate school in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For my thesis, I studied the swarming motility of enteric bacteria, completing my PhD under the guidance of Dr. Douglas Weibel in February 2012. I thought these little microbes were pretty gnarly and wanted to engineer them to do novel things, like save the planet or make a bigger, better cheese, so I pursued a post-doctoral position with Dr. Brian Pfleger in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. I began my postdoc in May 2012 and eagerly agreed to be one of the iGEM advisors for this year's UW team. When I'm not mentoring or seeking my next morsel of cheesy sustenance, I'm working on developing novel transcription factors for the regulation of metabolic pathways in E. coli.
Brian F. Pfleger, PhD is Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering of University of Wisconsin Madison. His lab's current interest is using synthetic biology to engineer sustainable chemical processes and to improve human health. He believes synthetic biology is an emerging biotechnology field that combines elements of engineering, mathematics, biochemistry, and biology to synthesize novel systems from characterized biological components. His research lab integrates these scientific disciplines to engineer chemical production platforms in microorganisms. The lab’s work strives to characterize new biological components, synthesize novel activities and novel molecules from cataloged components, and provide tools to analyze biological systems. His long term vision of the chemical industry involves the use of modern biotechnology, and specifically synthetic biology, to engineer systems where the spectrum"

Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," reporter gene, and pregnancy tests are usually used to determine pregnancy. We open-endedly describe potential uses for our parts in the Registry.
Accompanying rapid advancements in graphic-computational power, a number of visualization and animation projects have aimed to capture in increasing depth the bewildering world of the cell (cf. Maya molecular movies http://www.molecularmovies.com/learning/, Cornell’s 2011 iGEM Team’s animation project https://2011.igem.org/Team:Cornell/Video). The language used to describe such projects often entails some variant of “draw pictures to dumb things down for the general public” (e.g. Cornell iGEM: “Bringing up ""Synthetic Biology"" in a conversation with anyone outside the field will elicit question marks. Anything muttered after those words will be forever lost to the public. … We seek to communicate our ideas with the public via effective animation … designed to entice our audience, draw them in, and enable them to attach our explanations to physical phenomena.”). It's not just the public who needs careful representations, though. In the face of bewildering biological complexity, likely unmanageable uncertainty, simultaneous conflicting value frameworks, overlapping imaginaries of fantastic promise and doomsday scenarios, and especially as synthetic biology’s de-skilling agenda results in increased diffusion to lower-expertise practitioners, visceral mental models of how biology works and can be rebuilt will be increasingly influential in determining the products of synbio design.
In the sphere of ethical reflection, using inorganic metaphors (information, computer, machine) may lead to different normative conclusions about objects of genetic engineering than more conventional language used to describe life. Given that everything we know about life supports an exclusively mechanistic understanding of its biochemical/biophysical underpinnings, such metaphors are likely more precise descriptions of reality, but they can also clash with and provoke strong opposition from those who are operating in incompatible frames. Additionally, ethical thinking about emerging technologies is strongly conditioned by culturally embedded arch-narratives despite unprecedented and counter-intuitive technical realities (http://www.springerlink.com/content/c910r5n055614585/). Further, ideologically-laden vocabularies are used by opposition groups to frame debates, and conversely public proponents of synthetic biology may espouse optimistic unbalanced vocabularies in describing the future.
Careful conceptual vocabulary design can also be an important strategy as synthetic biology seeks distributed mechanisms for promoting biosafety. Ensuring safe practices among increasingly diffuse practitioners of synthetic biology is a complex challenge that is not feasibly amenable to conventional models of centralized regulatory oversight"

In a meeting with Georgia State University’s IGEM team, they informed us of their project to express the gene Mambalgin-1 in E.coli. Mambalgin is a powerful and non-addictive analgeasic isolated from black mamba venom; given it's eukaryotic origins, GSU has gone through the hoops to create a single functional Yeast expression vector for Mambalgin. In this year's project they aimed to both optimize and characterize the production of Mambalgin in E.coli. It was evident that they planned to spend much of the summer creating new varied strength expression vectors for Mambalgin. Having already seen promising results from our new insertion primers, we informed them that, using our revolutionary RBS and Promoter Primer PCR, we could add a ribosome binding site and a promoter to the Mambalgin gene both cheaper and faster. Their interest in our proposal thus led to the creation of a new RBS insertion primer specifically for their sequence.
First, the gene was put in Biobrick format using 5’ Extension PCR, using the two primers shown below to add the Biobrick prefix and suffix to either side of the gene.
Forward Primer sequence(Adds Biobrick Prefix)
Reverse Primer sequence(Adds Biobrick Suffix)
PCR Product using the above two primers with the Mambalgin-1 template DNA
Together the primers amplified a 225 bp long segment of DNA as predicted. This PCR product was subsequently ligated into a backbone and transformed into E.coli; it was later confirmed successful by sequencing. Next, the ribosome binding site was inserted using the RBS Primer PCR method that was developed here at Georgia Tech. Since the start  codon in this case was 'CTG', a new RBS primer was designed with the same structure and components ( prefix, RBS, scar and start codon) as our universal primers, but with ‘CTG’ as the ending base pairs. Success of this PCR ultimately confirmed the adaptability of the RBS insertion method.

Queens_Canada,2012,Team:Queens Canada#ChimeriQ_-_-_TEXT.html," PCR overlap extension we would incorporate GFP and RFP into our constructs. To prove that it PCR overlap extension would worked, we would incorporate this PCR product containing the full fliC construct with no linkers with the GFP replacing the D3 domain (this was labelled nFFGFP - no linker Full Flic GFP construct) into the T7 promotor J04500 vector that contained the chloramphenicol resistance through digestion/ligation processes. We grew these ligations overnight and expected colonies.
As expected there were several colonies on each plate, to prove that the ligations worked only the colonies with green fluorescence were used for liquid colonies. Unfortunately we did not have access to an electron microscope, therefore we could not visually see the proteins on the flagella. Researching various flagellar isolation protocols , we developed two tested protocols to isolate the flagella containing GFP, which can be found in the protocols section. We also had a batch of J04500 controlled bacteria made to act as the control that would not contain protein infusions.
Essentially these two protocols would shear the flagella off of the cells using blender and heat techniques. The cell debris would be removed by centrifuge, and the sheared flagella would be collected as pellets. These isolated pellets when observed under the fluorescent microscope did glow green. Since there is a possibility that some cell debris would be present in the flagella pellets, we decided to run SDS-PAGE to see if there was a different between the controlled bacteria that would only contain flagella but not protein infusions. What we predicted was that at there should be a protein band at 70 kDa, which would be due to the GFP protein infused on the full fliC construct which would not be found on the control bacteria. Through running a few SDS- pages and comparing the control vs. fluorescent flagella bacteria, there was a distinct darker band at 70 kDa that was not found in the control. This means that it is likely that the flagella pellets in our nFFGFP (no linker Full Flic GFP construct) contained GFP proteins, which the J04500 bacteria did not.
Catalysis
A potential application of this project would be to externally catalyze useful chemical reactions. The only real practical limitation would be the size of the amino acid insert.

KIT-Kyoto,2010,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"awa Lab Group >>Inoue Lab Group >>KIT Applied Biology Section
Kyoto Institute of Technology iGEM team ""KIT - Kyoto"" is the first participation this year. We got interested in the poster presented in iGEM by Tokyo Institute of Technology at summer school of biological science held in Japan. And decided to participate in iGEM 2010. It was started on March 17, 2010, and the team member was five people in those days. To make our iGEM team KIT-Kyoto, We got contact with some iGEM team in Japan and collected many information of iGEM 2010. Philosophy in making our team is a combination of biology and design.And now we have 2 students from design engineering department and 11 students from applied biology department in our iGEM team.
Our expectations and hope for iGEM 2010 are 3 points.
(1)We would like to promote better understanding and interest for biology through activity in iGEM 2010.
(2)We would like to discuss with many students all over the world, and we would like to make friends with all around the world.
(3)Our University, Kyoto Institute of Technology, KIT is not so large and famous enough, so we wanna make it world wide famous by achievement of brilliant results at iGEM 2010.
Details concerning the design of the team logo are links below. >>DesignNote Week1

In addition to financial support, these meetings assured less bureaucracy to use this support. An annual edict to form the iGEM team will be annually provided by the University and even the donation of physical space to build a bio hacker space where iGEM could take place is under analysis. Dra.Macedo and Dra.Reis are committed to help us to give iGEM more visibility in the scientific community.
Having the full support of our University to participate and develop iGEM is a great achievement for us!
State action: FAPEMIG
.
FAPEMIG is a funding agency that support science projects developed in the state of Minas Gerais, where UFMG team is. In the beginning of this year, we wrote them asking for support to our team to participate in iGEM. In September, we received the news that they would support us, however the money could come only in December, which would not help us anymore. Not surprisingly, this exact same situation happened last year as well, and UFMG 2013 team also did not get the FAPEMIG support on time.
Thinking on solving this recurrent problem, we managed to meet with FAPEMIG Director Dr.Evaldo Vilela (Fig 20). We explained him our situation. He was very attentive and is making efforts to extend the deadline for using the funding we received this year in 2015.  A scholarship specifically directed to student participation on iGEM, granted by FAPEMIG, was also debated and Dr.Vilela thinks it will be a reality for next year. In addition, he promised to take actions to facilitate funding for all scientific competitions. He also demanded that we wrote a project to further discuss our ideas.
National action: Minister of Science
.
The former rector of UFMG, Dr.Clélio Campolina (Fig 21) in now National minister of Science and Technology. We had the honour to meet with him during a visit to UFMG. We presented him iGEM and all the difficulties we have been through to take part in it.  He was very excited with our achievements and compassionate with the problems we faced. He gave us some tips on how to pursue funding and promised to help with everything in his power.
Continental action: Latin network
.
When we began our Human Practices, we wanted to count on the latin teams that had previously participated on iGEM. However, we got very few answers from them.
This indicates a lack"

Spinning disk
Several samples were created in the same manner as 28/08/2015 for imaging with the spinning disk microscope.
Additionally a plasma cleaned coverslip was prepared with two lines containing RFP, CaCl2 (100 μL), GFP, CaCl2 (100 μL). This was stored in the freezer to be measured on 02/09/2015.
07/09/2015
A comparison experiment of alginate from Groningen vs Delft was started. Observation: their powder is brown and dissolves to a clear solution. No further info available. Our powder is white and forms a milky emulsion. No solids are dispersed. 1% w/v solutions were used.
150 μL alginate was added from bottom to top into 1 mL 0.1M CaCl2. For visualisation purposes, 4 μL of brilliant blue was added to 400 μL alginate. Both formed a gel strut instantly. The CaCl2 was removed by pipet and 1 mL of 0.1M sodium citrate (monobasic) was added. A second sample was added  mL of LB. Samples were incubated at 37 oC.
08/09/2015
No sample is completely dissolved. Temperature is raised to 50 oC and shaking at 300 rpm is started.
09/09/2015
Samples are still not dissolved.
Samples for spinning disk are prepared.
0.5 w/v Rhamnose was used. Samples 2 % 4 are useless, since the GFP is only expressed after rhamnose induction, so only RFP will be visible.
Survival study
BBa_I13521 was used to make bio-ink (RFP). The hydrogel (100 μL) was made in 1 mL CaCl2 (0.1M) and then incubated in 1 mL 0.1M sodium citrate + 1 μl CAM. Incubation was carried out at 37 oC with shaking at 300 rpm.
After 36 hours, the samples were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 4000 rpm to remove the supernatant sodium citrate. It was replaced with 1 mL of LB and the sample incubated again at 37 oC with shaking at 300 rpm.
After 24 hours the sample was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 13’500 rpm. A small, red pellet was observed indicating survival of the"

Welcome to the Wiki of USTC iGEM 2009 Wet Lab Team!
We sincerely appreciate your visit. From this wiki, you'll step into the mystical world of our explorations in synthetic biology this year!
Team USTC
University of Science and Technology of China ( USTC ), located in the beautiful city Hefei in Anhui province, is one of the most famous universities in China. This is the 3rd year for USTC to participate in iGEM. This year we have two teams, the wet lab team USTC and the dry lab team USTC_Software . The two teams are readily collaborating with each other to solve interdisciplinary problems.
The wet lab team consists of 7 undergraduate students, 3 graduate students, 2 PhD student instructors, 2 faculty instructors and 2 faculty advisors. We are from different departments of USTC: Department of Systems Biology, Department of Molecular Biology and Cell Biology, Department of Chemical Physics, Department of Chemistry, and Department of Polymer Science and Engineering. However, we are with the same enthusiasm and confidence to do some things both fundamental and original.

Project E.ADEM
Evolution is more powerful than the God, as Charles Darwin told us 150 years ago. This year, our team is trying to manage the power of evolution, the power of creating everything from biomolecules to ecosystems, by engineering an E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM).
The ultimate goal is to make E.ADEM a universal framework for evolutionary approaches in synthetic biology. Anything we want in synthetic biology can be automatically created, from promoters, RBS, regulators, receptors, binding partners, aptamers, enzymes and ribozymes, to sensors, logic devices, reporters, metabolic pathways, entire genomes, and even solutions of mathematic problems.
To each evolution object you want it to evolve, a scoring function can be designed to output PoPS as the fitness score to your demand"

Yesenia Lopez
My name is Yesenia Lopez. I am a student attending City college of San Francisco majoring in Molecular and cell Biology. I had a great Biology teacher my sophomore year at Burton high school. One of the greatest impacts that made sciences so interesting to me is that, I was amazed by the complexity of nature. I couldn't believe tall living organism were composed of cells, I thought it was incredible and very unbelievable. From those years on I have been interested in research and I am glad to be part of the iGem 2012 team. Through this program I was able to see how working in a team with other students for a common goal can prove to worth wild.

ITB_Indonesia,2014,Team:ITB Indonesia#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," turned in to oxaloacetate, a metabolic intermediate in our device.
The device that we use in this project are Escherichia coli DH5 Alpha and BL21(DE3). According to Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), the wild-type strain of E. coli may irritate the skin, eyes, respiratory tract, blood circulation, and kidney.  To minimize the risk, same as the protect needs from ethylene glycol our team and the researchers in our lab always working safely by using gloves, lab coats, mask, and goggles (if necessary).
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
Our project would not impact the environment in a harmful way. To guarantee the safety and health of general public, we deal with experimental waste and DNA. We also dispose the experimental bacteria, medium, and disposable goods through destruction stages by autoclaving to avoid potential safety hazard.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
Ethylene glycol is a clear, colorless, syrupy liquid with a sweet taste but no odor. It has low volatility and miscible with water and some other solvents, slightly soluble in ether, but practically insoluble in benzene, chlorinated hydrocarbons, petroleum ethers, and oils. Ethylene glycol released to the atmosphere will be degraded by reaction with hydroxyl radicals. Ethylene glycol is readily biodegradable in standard tests using sewage sludge. However, ethylene glycol can potentially be toxic within waterways so to ensure environmental safety the team has taken extra precautions to dispose of ethylene glycol safely. In addition all of the hazard waste from our lab is not released directly to the environment.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
The hazard posed not only by lab workers as well as the design in our devices but also determined by abuse committed by malicious people. The bacteria we use have special requirements for life. Therefore, these bacteria can not be used freely, especially if somebody want to activate the system that we have designed.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
As detailed above to reduce this risks we have to wears laboratory protector such as gloves, mask, goggles and lab coats. For device that we used is Escherichia coli that very common bacteria for use in the biological experiment, so we have been trained to handle it.

The swarming circle of aspartic acid (L) was larger than that of ddH2O (R), and the swarming area around aspartate acid (L) was more larger than that of ddH2O (R), suggesting that E. coli swarming to aspartate acid. This experiment indicate that E. coli might have positive chemotaxis toward aspartic acid.

New Protocols This Year
Since it seemed like an overly complicated procedure for diluting something, I wrote up a procedure for diluting primers. As an added bonus, contains a protocol for PCR purification! Check it out .
Of course, the ever-so-useful modified hole-punching procedure . Or is it?

Bacterial Transformation
return to top
Thaw 100 μL of competent cells (per transformation) on ice just before they are needed
Add DNA (max 20ul) thawed cells and mix by flicking the side of the tube. Leave on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock for 2 minutes at 42 degrees Celsius or 5 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius
Place on Ice for 5 minutes
Add 250ul SOC medium to each tube
Incubate for 30 to 60 minutes with shaking at 37 degrees Celsius. (Note that for Kanamycin containing plasmides always use one hour)
Spin down to remove all supernatant except approximately 100 μL
Plate approximately 30 μL on each of two antibiotic plates
Grow overnight at 37 degrees Celsius
For this protocol we used a couple of controls
Positive Control - pBluescript in TOP10 cells on ampicillin plates
Negative Control - TOP10 cells grown on ampcillin plates
Rehydration
return to top
Biobrick parts are shipped from the registry in a dehydrated from. As such they must be rehydrated before they can be used.
Puncture a hole through the foil with a pipette tip into the well that corresponds to the Biobrick - standard part that you want
Add 15 μL of diH20 (deionized water)
Let the water sit for 5 minutes
Take 2 μL DNA and transform into your desired competent cells, plate out onto a plate with the correct antibiotic and grow overnight. Your goal here is to obtain single colonies

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated HP_-_-_TEXT.html," management of the condition should be optimized in health-care providers prior to participation in the screening programme.
There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"
HUST-China,2015,Team:HUST-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Fishery were cooperative to our investigation. However, most of them were not well-educated due to poor economic condition. Therefore, when asked questions about technology, some fishermen admitted that they knew little about it and failed to give a certain answer to the question. In addition, most fishermen spoke local dialect, which raised the difficulties in the interview.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Overview
After researching in some industries such as paper making factory, we found that traditional methods in these areas were not very effective and environmental friendly. To make a difference, Alkaline cellulase can be used to replace some chemical substances, there are two examples:
In papermaking industry
Alkaline cellulase is widely used in papermaking industry. One of the important fibrous materials is daily waste papers. Compared with chemical methods, enzymatic process has many advantages, for example, the drainage properties of pulp is improved a lot and the whiteness of paper is significantly enhanced.
In textile industry
Through enzymatic hydrolysis, cellulase can open nodules in cloth to make cloth more fluffy and comfortable. The surface can be made more smooth and colorful. Experience tells that alkaline cellulase is environment friendly, since it could reduce the sewage disposal and improve the washing efficiency.
Since the benefits mentioned above and the low production of Alkaline cellulase in nature, we decided to create a machine which can churn out Alkaline cellulase. The alkaline cellulase gene was introduced into the Escherichia coli and the target enzyme can be highly produced with the help of Kil, which is one of the core elements of our project. What’s more, MdfA, a proton pump across the cell membrane, was added to transport the proton into the cytoplasma, and release Na+/K+ at the same time, resulting in cell survival in alkaline industry wastewaters as high as pH 9.5. Another highlight of our project is that we also added a ccdB suicide system to our e-machine, by this we could remove the biological machine whenever we need for biological safety.
Basing on the alkaline cellulase in suffering at present technology application and considering its beautiful and broad application prospects , we design a super Escherichia coli alkaline cellulase machine.The image on the right is the super Escherichia coli machine's kernel - Super plasmid.

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#project#biological construction#input_-_-_TEXT.html," In the presence of a 480 nm wavelength light, YF1 can no longer phosphorylate FixJ leading to extinction of the PfixK2 promoter.
Blue light module characterization
To characterize the blue light sensor, a modified RFP was used as the output instead of the recombinase Bxb1. In darkness, RFP is supposed to be expressed whereas in the presence of blue light, no RFP should be produced. Results are described on this page .
Red light system
General principle
The red light sensor uses CpH8, a chimeric receptor interacting with the promoter OmpC. CpH8 is the fusion of the PCB photoreceptor with the EnvZ histidine kinase. It is therefore essential to use a wild-type EnvZ deficient E. coli. The biosynthesis of PCB requires also two other genes : ho1 and PcyA. In the absence of light, Cph8 is phosphylated and can activate the OmpC promoter. In the presence of a 660 nm wavelength light, CpH8 is no longer phosphorylated and can not activate the OmpC promoter. ( Levskaya A. and al. 2005. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. )
Red light system characterization
The system is similar to the blue light sensor and a modified RFP was used as the output instead of the recombinase TP901. In darkness, RFP is supposed to be expressed whereas in presence of red light, no RFP is produced. We obtained the final construction but had not enough time to characterize it.

Experimental method: Mix different concentrations and proportions of algae, and carry out the speed gradient treatment, compare the OD value of the mixture at 680 nm and before mixing, the OD value of 1/2 of the supernatant and the original bacteria solution. If they are similar, the concentration of bacteria can be measuring
Experimental result:
Conclusion:
550-600rcf 1min centrifugation can separate the algae, but there are certain errors. This method need to be improved.
2. Small amount of CFU method Experimental principle: After diluting multiple gradients, a small amount of diluted 5-10 μL bacteria algae solution was added dropwise to the medium plate, and the bacteria algae density was calculated by the average number of colonies of a certain gradient.
Since the common plate is inconvenient to mark, there is a risk of mixing between different drops. In this experiment, a 96-well plate is used to prepare a medium plate and it works well.
Small amount of algae CFU method (Algae cannot grow as colonies on BG11 solid medium, failed)
Small amount of CFU method：
Single colonies can be obtained, which can be counted, but the accuracy cannot meet the requirements of our test for measuring the shedding rate. This method can be used for rough estimation of bacterial concentration and works well on solid plates that are added to the dish.
3.CFU method
The traditional CFU method is not suitable for large-scale measurement such as this experiment.
4. Chlorophyll method
Experimental principle: Chlorophyll in algae can be extracted with methanol, and the chlorophyll content is proportional to the number of algae.
This method works well. The first three groups in the experimental ""speed gradient and time gradient exploration"" are the detachment rate measured by the chlorophyll method.
5. Blood cell counting plate counting method
Experimental principle: The concentration of bacteria or algae is proportional to the number of algae in the blood cell counting plate, and the concentration can be calculated by the blood cell counting plate specification.
This method is too time consuming to count.
Experimental results: (This experiment is carried out simultaneously with the algae growth curve experiment).
Experimental conclusion: By using the blood cell counting plate method we can accurately obtain the growth trend of algae, but the error is slightly larger and needs to be repeated many times.
6. Photographing blood cell counting plate method
The blood cell counting plate is photographed to obtain photos, and image processing is performed by image J or MATLAB to obtain the density of algae.

Refreshment of PACO in M9 + Kn
23/09/16
Since this day we did not have a multiplate reader available, we did a DIY version with a cuvette spectrophotometer. We studied the growth of basid DH5&alpha cells with respecto to our PACO cells at different polyamine concentrations (2, 0.2, 0.02 and 0 mM). Besides the abosrbance at 660 nm, we also measured 190 nm since we identified that this wavelength could correspond to polyamine absorbance, and we wanted to track the level of polyamines in the sample. We prepared two stocks of cells with M9 so as to start at 0.1 ODE with respect to plain M9:
Stock DH5&alpha: 13 ml M9 + 1.5 ml cells
Stock PACO: 12.5 ml M9 + 2 ml cells
We concluded that something besides polyamines absorbs at 190 nm, since we obtained increasing responses as time passed, which was not possible since polyamines should be degrading. Also we did not obtain coherent growth results, since PACO without polyamines were growing faster than PACO with polyamines, and these cells should be polyamine-auxotrophs.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," July 5
The overnight cultures produced on the weekend were successfully miniprepped producing DNA stocks of the LacI promoter BBa_J04500 (in pSB1C3 ). Restriction digests of this part confirmed a successful transformation and miniprep. An initial attempt was made to make a construct composed of the LacI promoter BBa_J04500 followed by the RFC25 fusion standard GFP (BBa_K648013). This construction produced few viable colonies. One colony appeared to have the expected band size after colony PCR (Figure 3) however this result could not be replicated. This construction will be attempted again in the future.
Figure 3. A colony PCR of potential colonies containing the part J04500 + K648013. Standard BioBrick primers were used. The band about 1100-bp in size indicates the successful amplification of this part. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1300-bp when using BioBrick primers. No contamination is observed in the NTC (no template control). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Also received this week were the synthesized coil genes ordered from BioBasic . These genes are the K coil, E coil, K coil with a His-tag, and E coil with a His-tag. These genes were successfully transformed into our E. coli cells and were miniprepped successfully. These genes are in the pUC57 ( pUC57 PDF Information Sheet ) vector and will have to be plasmid switched into pSB1C3 for submission to the registry.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
Confirmation digests were performed upon the coil parts miniprepped last week in order to confirm the presence of the coils (Figures 5). These coils can be seen as the faint bands at approximately 100-bp in size on the gel. Digestions like these could be performed as the synthesized genes contain the RFC 25 prefix and suffix. These digestions revealed that the coil genes are indeed present in the minipreps produced. Glycerol stocks were made of our transformed cells for organized long term storage.
Figure 4. Confirmation digests of the K coil, E coil with His-tag and the E coil parts within the pUC57 vector using the NotI enzyme. Bands are all expected to be approximately 100-bp and are indicated by the orange arrows due to their faintness. The –C lane is a negative control."

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#index_-_-_TEXT.html," The team members at Pennsylvania State will use high level computational modeling to optimize metabolic pathways within E. Coli, which will relieve the strain of nitrogen fixation. The team members at Washington University will create a minimal nif cluster of only those genes necessary for nitrogenase production and activation. In addition, they will silence and overexpress several genes in order to maximize nitrogenase activity.
In doing such, we hope to create a system for nitrogen fixation for transformation into a photosynthetic system. After we come to a greater understanding of how the system works and perfect it, we can move on to working in a more complex organism, such as a cyanobacteria like Synecosystisspp. 6803.
The end goal is to create plants that can fix their own nitrogen by moving from the cyanobacteria into the chloroplast of the plant. Endosymbiotic theory postulates that cyanobacteria are the ancestors to chloroplasts, so this is the natural progression.
Close Project
The Big Picture
Haber-Bosch is so 1909
Why are we doing this project
Synthetic biology is an exciting area of research that aims to genetically improve organisms to make them more efficient and hopefully more useful to us as well. The human population in 1950 was 2.5 billion, yet it is predicted to surpass 9 billion by 2050. Even with population growth slowing, increasing life spans and standards of living will soon tax our natural resources. One of the most concerning is our food supply. The agriculture industry needs a revolution in order to keep up with our expected growth rates. Currently about 80% of chemically fixated nitrogen is used as agricultural fertilizers, the majority in developed lands [1]. Intracellular nitrogen fixation in crops could help to sustain the burgeoning world population, especially in areas with less fertile soil without taxing the planet’s waterways. The exponential increase in nitrogen fertilizer has led to more runoff into rivers and oceans. Fertilizers then provide nutrition for algal blooms that result in hypoxia and form oceanic dead zones. These dead zones lead to the death of marine species and have potentially large economic consequences.                              The ramifications of nitrogen fertilizer runoff can be averted by genetically engineering plant crops to fix their own nitrogen. Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen for nutritional needs, while most organisms can only acquire it from the food it consumes. Synthetic biology allows us to transfer this ability to fix nitrogen to a heterologous host that has many genetic tools, Escherichia coli, so that we can learn how to give single cell organisms, and eventually chloroplasts the"

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," all increased, but the sucrose group and fructose group increased faster than control group, which meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in yeast cells in our system.
In other words, our system can be sensitive to sweeteners. Besides, the red fluorescence intensity increasing rate of fructose group was higher than sucrose group’s, which means that the sweetness of fructose is higher than sucrose’s. This result also conforms to the result measured through people tastes.
In order to confirm this result, we repeated this experiment three times.  The all results showed the similar tendency. These results demonstrate that the system can work as our expectation.
Though the fluorescence intensity is still at a low level, the distinction between each group can be observed obviously. The reason may be that natural signal pathway in yeast can’t adapt well with the human sweet taste receptor. The improvements of this work are continuing. (Fig. 16)
Fig. 16 The schematic diagram of Gα mutation
Summary
1. We had the optimized codon and synthesized human receptor gene T1R2,T1R3 successfully by using OE-PCR.
2.The heterologous receptor was expressed and located on the cell membrane successfully in yeast, which has been confirmed by immunofluorescence.
3.Our system can sense sucrose, fructose as our expectation.
>
Fig. 17 The red fluorescence intensity of different sweeteners
To confirm whether our yeast can respond to different sweeteners, we selected fructose, sucrose and glycyrrhizic acid as sweetener candidates. The result showed that the red fluorescence intensity sucrose induced was the lowest among these three sweeteners and it was the highest induced by glycyrrhizic acid. It suggested that our engineered yeast system could respond to different sweeteners indeed. More importantly, we found that the fluorescence intensity is positively correlated with sweetness.
Fig. 18 The red fluorescence intensity of different concentrations of glycyrrhizic acid
We also found that fluorescence intensity induced by 1 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid and 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid was greatly increased than the control group. This result showed that when the concentration of the glycyrrhizic acid reached 1 g/L the fluorescence intensity was higher than 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid, which meant that 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid might exceed the detection limit of the system. The result also indicates if sweetness is beyond the detection limit, the result may not be accurate. Just like that,"
Nevada,2010,Team:Nevada#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"afety group think about your project?
- Yes. The University of Nevada, Reno Institutional Biosafety Committee supports our project, especially with regard to the fact every member of the iGEM team completed training on NIH Guidelines on Recombinant Organisms. An additional safety course conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno Environmental Health & Safety Department trained each member in the certified Lab Safety Workshop on chemical safety, biological safety, chemical hygiene, ventilation, and waste management. Therefore, all iGEM members have been trained in the handling and disposal of transgenic bacteria.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
The steps previously and currently taken by iGEM teams to design systems where modified organisms can be screened or terminated under certain conditions are excellent ways of providing safety. Certainly, controlling where and how organisms can grow helps to ensure modified organisms do not unintentionally interact with the environment. These are all internal controls, and while 99.9% reliable, we believe the risk of unforeseen mutation cannot be overlooked. Several systems of control will have a few layers of regulation, but there could likely be one nexus of vulnerability that the whole system hinges upon, and the question must be asked what happens if that node of control fails? A dysfunctional fluorescent protein may not deserve attention, but genes regulating proliferation, reproduction, or repressors could cause bacteria, fungi, or plants to escape containment. Adding layers of regulation do help, but ultimately they affect the quality of the plasmids or genes used and may ultimately hinder the goals set for the project.
Therefore, we propose one additional way of providing safety in an iGEM doomsday scenario to help in the event of some future iGEM bacteria that infects humans or plants, affecting public health or crops. Perhaps, as iGEM grows and commercial applications become apparent, for plant projects, iGEM could require a constitutively expressed fluorescent protein alongside any novel gene to track the plants. iGEM-compatible internal controls have been designed, for example Harvard’s project, but in the rare event those mechanisms fail, a constitutively expressed fluorescent protein would be an easily identifiable way of tracking iGEM plants.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#parameters_-_-_TEXT.html,"R promoter/GFP construct was on a ‘15 copies per cell’ plasmid, thus there were 15 copies of the LuxR promoter.  The actual PoPS =  6.6/15 = 0.44 PoPS   i.e. consistent with known E.coli promoters.
An estimate for the strength of different E.coli promoters, including lambda P(L) is in the following paper:
Journal of Molecular Biology Volume 292, Issue 1,  Activities of constitutive promoters in Escherichia coli1

It states the PoPs values for several promoters as:
Pspc,  26 polymerase initiations per minute  P(L), 17 polymerase initiations per minute  Pbla   1.7 polymerase initiations per minute  PRNAI, 17 polymerase initiations per minute
Using the P(L) strength of 17 polymerase initiations per minute we can easily calculate the PoPs value.

Pittsburgh,2016,Team:Pittsburgh#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," switch in reaction without inducing background expression of LacZ, we tried a range of concentrations of DNAzyme in the reaction. Preliminary results suggest that a concentration of 100 nM is too high, but we did not have time to pursue these results.
Lead Titration
To determine the detection limit of our system and to see if lead interfered with our circuit, we tried adding a range of concentrations of lead to the reaction. Preliminary results suggest that concentrations as low as 50 nM can be detected (the EPA MCL is 72.4 nM), but we did not have time to pursue these results.

Toehold Switch
Our initial experiments were performed with the D and G LacZ switches from the paper from the Collins group, ""Paper-Based Synthetic Gene Networks"" . However, because G switch activity was neater in some experiments, we switched to using exclusively G.
RNA Trigger
Using plasmids from the Collins group that contained the switch and trigger for the two LacZ switches, we expressed lacZ in cell-free reactions. The two triggers were switch-specific, and the switch did not produce LacZ in the absence of a trigger.
DNA Trigger
Because our genetic circuit relies on the activation of the toehold switch by the cleavage product of a DNAzyme, we needed to make sure a DNA oligonucleotide could also trigger the toehold switch. When we added the DNA oligo trigger to a cell-free reaction with the switch, lacZ was expressed. DNA triggers toehold switches.
Sequestered DNA Trigger
The DNA oligo should not activate the toehold switch if it is bound to another DNA strand. In our system, the trigger should be sequestered by the catalytic DNAzyme strand as part of the DNAzyme's substrate strand. We added the hybridized DNAzyme duplex in a cell-free reaction with the toehold switch. When hybridized to another DNA strand, the trigger does not activate the switch.

Therefore, it is really important to control the recombinases expression with a well-locked promoter. You can look at our specially designed regulation sequence (riboregulator) to get as low as possible any undesired expression and production of the recombinases ( BBa_K1132005 , BBa_K1132006 , BBa_K1132007 , BBa_K1132008 , BBa_K1132042 ).
In the present design, the strength of the promoter does not allow high level expression of the controlled output. However, change to stronger promoter than P7 should potentially lead to better expression levels.
Resetting the gate to its basal state requires a series of excisases capable of switching back the sequences to their native state.
The same type of design was used to build a AND gate ( BBa_K1132001 ).
Design of the gate :
For this gate, restrcition sites have been add between the promoter to change it esaly if necessary. Effectively, as shown during the caracterisation, the P7 promoter does not allow high level expression of the output. It could be interesting to change the promoter by a stronger one.

BBa_K1132003: AND gate with recombinases switching gene regulatory sequences and ORF
This AND gate was built with one promoter surrounded by the PhiC31 integrase sites and one coding sequence surrounded by the FimE sites. To transcript a gene, a promoter has to be in front of the coding sequence, we need to have the promoter AND the coding sequence in the same way. It is an AND gate. In the basic state, the promoter and the gene are in the wrong way. The transcription of the output gene will occur in presence of the both recombinases, when the promoter and the gene are in the right way.
The input signals for this gate are the production of either one or both recombinases PhiC31 and FimE. The output can be choosen at will by insering between the recombinases sites of FimE  any ORF containing an RBS site.  To insert the reading fram, two restriction sites have been placed between the both FimE recombinases sites, BamHI and ClaI. We also designed a test Biobrick of the gate ( BBa_K1132034 ) with an inverted RFP protein as output.
This gate can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements. For"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

It was difficult to remember reasons behind you're doing the protocols you're doing especially if, like me, one is a beginner in the subject who's more immediately concerned with what the lab procedures mean by using a certain instrument or machine to complete a protocol. It was helpful that Natalie had led us into a discussions after the lab to reflect on what we just did and sort of touch upon the big picture, but I definitely felt like, by the end of the day, I learned more about lab processes rather than the material that motivated the experiments in the first place. Natalie highlighted how difficult it is to look for information when the researcher does not know what to look for--something that hopefully we'll be able to facilitate using the applications we'll be developing for iGEM and semantic search.
Day 7: June 6, 2012 - Day 9: June 8, 2012
Veronica, Casey, and I discussed our individual findings from the research we had done until this point and decided what we'd be presenting -- the basics of semantic search, ways we can implement semantic search in surface applications, and challenges of implementing semantic search. We also tried finding an already made API we could customize because creating our own semantic search engine is definitely not a feasible job for a few people in one summer.
We spoke with Consuelo and Orit about our current material for our presentation this coming Monday and found that we needed to research more on the feasibility of implementing a customized semantic search engine using databases like PubMed, iGEM, and the Parts Registry. We then finalized our presentation.
On Friday, we were able to speak with Professor Eni Mustafaraj. She went over a brief explanation of semantic search and how it is implemented. She gave us suggestions on ways we could have our own customized semantic search engine. Initially, we had thought of using the commercially-made engines that enabled users to modify it based on the databases they want the engine to use. Eni warned us however that we should search for semantic search engines that had been written about in a research/academic paper, and instead pointed us towards an open source project called Apache Jena. What we would have to do is somehow convert what we want into RDF format and from there figure out how we could implement the engine using Jena.

What We Demonstrated
The team started this project with the aim of expressing and purifying human proinsulin as well as our own novel open-source single chain insulin, Winsulin in a cost-effective, efficient and simple manner. We aimed to do this using three expression systems: the E. coli cytoplasm, E. coli periplasm, and secreted into the surrounding medium by B. subtilis.  Based on this aim, what we set out to demonstrate what we believe was achievable over the course of the year. This was:
- To demonstrate that we set up a system which was favourable for protein expression.
- That we were able to design and express our own open-source single chain insulin, Winsulin, along with human proinsulin that will be correctly folded.
- That we could target expression to the cytoplasm, periplasm, as well as the extracellular medium (secreted) and that we could easily purify these.
- That our insulins will be biologically functional when tested with glucose uptake assays.
BL21 E. coli and SHUFFLE E. coli are well-characterised commercial strains of E. coli. These were used to express insulin in the periplasm and cytoplasm respectively. The WB800 strain of Bacillus subtilis was used for insulin secretion. This strain is a non-commercial strain, and it was donated to us from Professor Sui-Lam Wong’s laboratory at the University of Calgary, Canada. This strain was appealing to use in our project due as 8 proteases had been knocked out of the genome, eliminating the chance that these proteases could degrade insulin within B. subtilis. In order to demonstrate that these 8 proteases were knocked out, we plated this strain alongside wild-type B. subtilis 168 on an LB+milk plate. In the wild-type B. subtilis 168 strain, these proteases proteolysed the milk on the plate, forming a clear area around the colonies. If the WB800 strain was in fact a protease knockout, no proteolysis would"

•The OR operator gives an output when one, or both, of the inputs recognized by the operator are present. Our OR works with the A3 and LasB promoter, that need the P4 and LasR TF, respectively. When they are active, they transcribe GFP, and we can notice it is working because of the fluorescence that GFP produces..
•LasB: Promoter regulated positively by LasR in P. aeruginosa[21].
•A3: Promoter regulated positively by P4 from phi29 phage[4,16,17].
•GFP: The GFP reporter gene encodes green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish Aequeora victoria wild-type GFP[22].
•Omega cassette: The Omega Cassette provides resistance to Spectinomycin and Streptomycin; it was obtained from plasmid pHP45omega[7,8]. Specifically, the resistance is provided by the aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance gene (aadA +) originally carried on a 1.7-kb PvuII-HindIII fragment from the R100.1 plasmid[8].
•AmyE: Integration sequences allow DNA to be incorporated into the chromosome of a host cell at a specific locus. This is achieved by using leading (5') and trailing (3') DNA sequences that are the same as those at a specific locus of the chromosome. The 5' integration sequence( BBa_K143001 ) can be added to the front of a BioBrick construct and the 3' integration sequence specific for this locus ( BBa_K143002 ) to the rear of the Biobrick construct to allow integration of the BioBrick construct into the chromosome of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis at the amyE locus [18,19].
