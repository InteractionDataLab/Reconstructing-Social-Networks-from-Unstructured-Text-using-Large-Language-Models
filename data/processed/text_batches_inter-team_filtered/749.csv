Minipreps were made from the crtY plates, from which a digest screen was prepared using NotI to see if the ligation worked.  The digestions were run on a gel. Samples with XbaI, PstI, and SpeI; XbaI, PstI, and ApaLI numbers 2 and 3; and XbaI, PstI, SpeI, and ApaLI numbers 2 and 3 all worked.  A miniprep of nptIIBB was performed. The concentration was extremely low, so an overnight culture was made from the glycerol stock to be miniprepped tomorrow.  Another transformation was done using remaining previous minipreps of nptII BB.  Cultures were made of the third Gibson attempt, and a colony PCR performed. When run on a gel, the non-GC fragments were too small, but some GC colonies looked good.  Finally, nptII BB was digested with XbaI and PstI, then column purified. PtrpC was digested with SpeI and PstI and gel purified.
Digest screens of previous crtY ligations showed promising results. Gibson cloning was continued, and further cloning of nptIIBB, to place it in front of PtrpC, was prepared.

Abstract: Calgary 2007 wanted to design and build a biomechanical printer. The printer composed of a two dimensional plotter equipped with a red laser. The plotter would receive instruction from a software that can translate computer images into instructions. E. coli would respond to the laser light. The red laser light would trigger the expression of beta-agarase enzyme which can degrade the agar polymer that cell rest on. This would produce “bacterial lithography”, where the E. coli exposed to red laser light would dissolved that agar and form a picture.
For Calgary 2007’s project to work, they needed a precise control of the gene of interest. To have such control, they decided to use the riboregulator system to prevent accidental expression of gene of interest.

Abstract: Caltech 2007 wanted to engineer viruses to selectively kill or modify specific subpopulation of target cells, based on their RNA or protein expression profiles. To prove the concept, they decided to use bacteriophage λ and E. coli. Caltech 2007 tried to engineer a bacteriophage λ to target and lyse specific subpopulations of E. coli. In their design, the developmental genes of the virus essential for virus infection and survival are regulated by cis-repressing RNA (lock). Only the target E.coli contain the trans-activating RNA (key) to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes. Once the genes are activated, the target cells will go through the lysis process. Meanwhile, non-target cells won’t be affected by the virus because the non-target cells lack the key to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes.

Country Profile
Colombia
SYNBIO PROFILE
Colombia activity in the synthetic biology field expands at great pace. Universidad de los Andes is the main player spreading the word of SynBio applying it in agricultural and mining areas due to economic importance for the country. Besides, professors and students are participating in iGEM competition since its early years, back in 2006.
PARTICIPATION IN THE iGEM COMPETITION
Since the start of the competition in 2006, Colombia has had some teams participating and earning their space on the competition. However, the first medal-bronze-came with the Colombia-Israel. In 2008 and 2009 there was a participation from the teams IPOC1-Colombia and IPOC2-Colombia.The team has participated in the competition in the years of 2011, 2012 and 2013.  They won prizes for two years including a gold medal. Since then, the group is in their fourth participation in a row, working on iGEM projects, they will participate in 2014, when the competition completes its 10th anniversary.
BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS
In the country, Conciencias is the governmental institution in charge of organizing public policies for scientific awareness, technology and innovation (CTI) in Colombia to promote a knowledge production, CTI capacitating and promote the circulation and the use of each for the development and well-being of Colombians.
The country has a strong tradition and a basic research infrastructure especially in the fields of agriculture and human health. The research in biotechnology gave a big push when the National Biotechnology (Program Nacional de Biotecnologia - PNB) was created in 1991, through this program a monitoring system has been implemented to help guide, monitor and finance the formation for human resources and investigation projects related to this new technology. This way, Colombia has nowadays 138 biotechnology research groups, most of them associated with universities (Pena 2008).
Since PNB was founded, Colciencias has been working"

Human Practices
We carried out human practices from the perspectives of the public, doctors and researchers, and get                     different feedback to promote our projects further.
Interview with the public
The team members conducted a social survey. We found that many people are too busy to go to the                         hospital for regular medical examinations. People pay less attention to the health of the                         kidneys. We want to change this situation by using our portable urine testing equipment.                         According to the practical data, we have found that more than 80% of respondents are willing to                         use our products. Considering about the binding time of antigen and antibody and the                         corresponding time of liquid crystal, the acceptable waiting time for respondents is about 40                         minutes. We will shorten the waiting time under the condition of ensuring the accuracy of                         measurement in the subsequent experiments.
This interview and sample survey enriched our project background data. We analyzed and processed                         the data obtained from the survey and found that our project does have certain market demand.                         This also laid the foundation for our subsequent optimization of experimental conditions.

Interviews with doctors
In August 2018, the team members went to Linyi City People's Hospital of Shandong Province to                         interview Dr. Liu Haijun, a specialist in nephrology. We knew that early diagnosis and treatment                         are extremely important in delaying the development of kidney disease. Only when the patient has                         obvious symptoms will he go to the hospital for an examination. But they may already have                         entered the dominant diabetic nephropathy (overtDN).
Blood test is the most common diagnosis method of the hospital currently. It takes ¥48 to test                         the blood β2-microglobulin. However, Dr.Liu said that if a portable urine test method can be                         developed, it can not only alleviate the pain of blood drawing, but also greatly improve the                         awareness of diabetes patients and the rate of early visits.
In this interview we exchanged ideas with doctors, and we have learned that from a clinical                         perspective, our project is more suitable for use at home. It can greatly arouse the awareness                         of early patients, which can indirectly improve the diagnosis rate and provide the best time for                         treatment.

Binding Array
Past iGEM teams have managed to create a dizzying number of unique transfer functions from their genetic circuits, and while altering the maximal expression level through ribosome binding sites (RBS) HYPERLINK is common among the iGEM community, there is oftentimes a need to change the threshold of a transfer function. That is, to move a transfer function horizontally. For the Circuit Control Toolbox to reach the stated goal of having orthogonal control over transfer functions we needed to find a way to orthogonally shift the threshold of a given arbitrary genetic circuit. In the end we managed to accomplish this by using molecular titration.
Molecular titration as the name implies is the process of titrating out molecules of transcription factor. That means, for some amount of transcription factor, a constant amount is taken away, such that for any given amount of transcription factor concentration, we are actually working with functionally less of said transcription factor (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Diagram showing the interactions between an activator transcription factor and decoy binding array, which as a molecular titrator. Note that the number of decoy binding sites impacts the equilibrium of free transcription factor, which in turn impacts the equilibrium of the amount bound to the promoter. Diagram adapted from Lee et al. 2012 (“A regulatory role for repeated decoy transcription factor binding sites in target gene expression”)
To accomplish this shift in E. coli we used decoy binding arrays, which are plasmids containing many repeated sequences of transcription factor binding sites, these repeated binding sites cause a large number of transcription factors to be bound to sites which produce no product, thus titrating them out, see Brewster et al. 2014 (“The Transcription Factor Titration Effect Dictates Levels of Gene Expression”). This causes a rightward shift in graph of transcription factor vs gene product. If we then graph a that same gene product versus a small molecule inducer for said transcription factor, then depending on the type of transcription factor we will either get a shift to the right (activator) or the the left (repressor). (See in depth example)
Say you have a transcription factor TetR, which binds to some promoter, say pTet, which effects the production of some gene, GFP then the concentration of that repressor is related to the production of that gene product. That is to say, for our circuit that you can go from [Tet"

The graphs above are our four constructs on unlysed E.coli under the spectrophotometer. We knew the mCherry was secreted by the E.coli through the absorbance at 587 nm. All constructs that had mCherry had a high absorbance at 587 nm; 0.72 for the BslA mCherry and 0.8975 for the PET-ase mCherry. When compared to the absorbance of pure mCherry at 587 nm, 1.011, we can tell it is secreting but not entirely as it is a little bit lower than 1.011.
The next step was to run the lysed cells, that we had from our lysis protocol, under the spectrophotometer with the same procedure of testing every construct through wavelengths of 557 nm to 617 nm. For the full description of this procedure, see “Spectrophotometer Readings - Lysed Supernatants” under the protocols page.

The graphs above are our four constructs on lysed E. coli under the spectrophotometer. We saw little evidence of mCherry on the lysed cells because of the low absorbance of  the constructs at 587 nm. Compared to the pure mCherry’s 1.011 absorbance at 587 nm, the lysed cells with mCherry in their construct only had an absorbance range of 0.2 - 0.4, which is significantly lower. This may be due to our lack of equipment that would allow for the proper purification of our proteins. Experimenting with the proteins in their unpurified state may be preventing the expression of the mCherry. Future plans will address this deficiency.

Experiment: Gibson assembly of basic toolkit
After reviewing the available literature for troubleshooting Gibson assembly we have come to the conclusion that the problem probably arises from trying to assemble more than 5 fragments at once. Thus, we have decided to assemble the plasmid sequentially. Thus, Gibson assembly were performed of the TS1 homology regions, the pTrpC promoter and hph, the Hygromycin B resistance gene (This product referred to as TH) Additionally assembly of TS2 homology region and the CaMV terminator were performed (this product referred to as CT).  The assembly were performed according to the Hi-Fi assembly protocol .

Experiment: Gibson assembly of basic toolkit
Another round of Gibson were performed according to the specifications given 13/8. The resulting products from both rounds of assembly were amplified by PCR, utilizing primers a forward gibson-primer matching on end of the product and a reverse primer matching the other end, I.E. D0008, the forward primer for TS1 and D0009 the reverse primer for hph were used.
The gibson assembled fragments were then run on a 1% agarose gel (the first number specifies round and the second number specifies duplicate):

Experiment: Geleletrophoresis of PCR produts of Gibson assembly
After yesterdays nice looking gelelectrophoresis, we wanted to do a new electrophoresis (replicate): This time we loaded 20 uL instead of 5 uL to get a sufficient amount of DNA for gel purification
PCR products have been inserted following the headline.
Given how vague the ladder is and how smeared the bands are, we assume the gel to be bad (given that is was also the very last drops of the gel bottle.
The second gel electrophoresis was run on machine RunOne #8. We loaded 25 uL of DNA.  Based on online discussion we have identified overloading as the most likely problem
After the unsuccessful gelelectrophoresis, we realised that we would run out of PCR product of the 14/8 gibson assembly product after the next gel. For this reason we decided to make another 50 μL of TH1, TH2, CT1 and CT2. Due to the double banding the product, we decided to increased the cycle time to 5 min and"

”To infinity, and beyond!” – Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story
The future aspects of our project, the Edible coli, mainly comprise the question: “Would people ever accept microorganisms as a comestible?”
Through synthetic biology, the list of possibilities for changing the characteristics of different microorganisms is endless. To modify a strain of E. coli to become an edible and nutritional bacteria by converting non-edible material would be an advantageous food supply, since E. coli and many microorganisms in general have a rapid growth and, in most cases, easy cultivation. Source: GMO Compass, 2006: GM Microorganisms Taking the Place of Chemical Factories.

As mentioned in the section; “Facts and statistics”, many people currently suffer from hunger and undernourishment. Along with this, humanity consume 1.5 of the Earth’s total biocapacity every year, which means that the biocapacity will decrease, like it already has been decreasing.

Figure 3.7 – System components test
First, to check the efficacy of the ssRA tag to destabilize the CFP, the intensity of fluorescence of two BB have been confronted: BBa_I13600 (Figure 3.9) and BBa_I13602 (Figure 3.10). Both are CFP under control of a Tet promoter, but only the BBa_I13602 has a ssRA tag. Through fluorescence microscopy we can see that the bacteria transformed with CFP (BBa_I13600) are more fluorescent than the bacteria transformed with CFP-ssRA (BBa_I13602). Our negative control, DH5α bacteria (Figure 3.8 ) don’t show significant fluorescence. In conclusion the ssRA tag seems to permit a destabilization of the CFP protein, reducing its lifetime. This experiments allowed the first characterization of the BBa_I13602.

In order to test the strength of two other promoters used in our system, a CFP-ssRA has been introduced downstream a constitutive promoter (BBa_K1707026 Figure 3.11) and a cI promoter (BBa_K1707028 Figure 3.12). Under fluorescence microcopy, the intensity of fluorescence visualized for these two new BB seems to be equivalent to the results obtained with the BBa_I13602. In conclusion, we observed a minor intensity of fluorescence for these two strong promoters with a ssRA tagged CFP, in comparison to a medium promoter (Ptet promoter) with classic CFP (see Figure 3.9).

Christoph Gäbelein
Christoph (“Gabi”) is not only our barbecue expert ; he also manages to work on several projects at once and still stays relaxed and easygoing. He has a high success rate at Gibson cloning and knows everything about light-inducible systems and their potential role in our project. Besides his wet lab activities, he was involved in our successful sponsoring.
Ilona Blank
Short time after Ilona joined us in the lab, our coordination increased by 200%: Suddenly and all over the lab, plans and calendars appeared. But she did not only push the efficiency of our team, she also has a talent for photography as you can see at all the pictures here! This talent appears especially, when she's capturing our lab time !
Lisa Schmunk
Lisa managed to work on several projects at the same time. She’s so committed that she will get bacteria plates out of the incubator at 2 am. Almost every project she works on is a success, not only because she works very diligently, but she has great knowledge. While it’s always nice to work with Lisa, she’s fun to hang out with, too! Besides, she gained another famous title: Lady Minigolf , Duchess of Frankfurt.
Manuel Scheidmann
If you hear a loud WOOTWOOT, Manu can´t be too far away. Always working at the front line when it comes to activation systems and partying. Besides wet lab, he was involved in our successful sponsoring. If Manu is not in the lab, you will probably find him on the beach-volleyball court. NICE!
Maximilian Stammnitz
If Max could choose his personal hero, it would probably be a mixture of Steven Spielberg, George Church, John F. Kennedy and Michael Jackson. Also called “The Robocop”, Max is our Film Director, idealist and has got fine dancing moves while wearing fancy hats. He is also committed in politics and met with local parties . His main research focus lies on KRAB-mediated gene repression with Cas9 - naming him after Mr. KRABs.
Michael Agne
Michi is the most organized and tidiest person in our team. If something has to be handled with great care, Michi is the man for it. He manages our money and is Master of Finances. During the lab work he gained another titel: Lord van Gibson (He also achieved the biggest DNA yield after gel extraction.). Without him, we would permanently run out of buffers, working stocks and competent cells. Furthermore, he turned out to be a highly gifted"

YES-gate
The ribozyme which loses its activity for secondary structure is set in front of a GFP, promoted by a continuous promoter, while a short RNA, the key of yes, is promoted by a Plac. When lac is added, the short RNA is expressed and activate the ribozyme. The cleavage is induced and the expression of protein declines.

NO-gate
The ribozyme is activated while the short RNA, key of no is no added. When lac is added, the short RNA combines with the ribozyme and restrains the cleavage, thus the level of GFP increases.

Future
The RNA logic gates are expected to replaces some passage ways in our logic gates. In the future, improved programmes will be developed and every lab will be able to create parts that they need. For the arrangement of the sequence is varying, the limit of varieties of logic gates parts will be overcome and more categories of RNA elements will be developed.

Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies, the cost of drugs needs to be abridged if we expect to apply the updating research to clinical treatment, which may indicate the direction of our future work.
At the same time, we are very moved to see that, Ms. Guo, who was suffering from cancer, still concerned about the promotion of cancer therapy. Indeed, there exists criminals who exaggerate the new therapies with excessive or false propaganda, thus hampered the promotion of new therapies. We should also keep working to support the promotion of tumor therapy and the elimination of false advertising.

Team NJU-China tried to introduce synthetic biology to people through various ways. This year, NJU-China planned to arouse adolescents’ interest towards this new field of science by organizing lectures for high school students. After the discussion, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory. Through these activities, we successfully presented the basic information about iGEM and synthetic biology to the youth.
Figure 13. Our instructor is introducing our lab to high school students
On Aug 20th, we held a lecture to the participants of a biology summer camp held by Nanjing University, who were high school students from all over China. The presentation consisted of an introduction of iGEM, synthetic biology and our project. Most students showed strong interests in our project and iGEM. The aim of the lecture was to let students have better understanding of the applications and benefits of synthetic biology. We believe that giving presentation about iGEM to high school students, we, college students as well as iGEMers, can inspire them to think deeper about how synthetic biology can change our lives. After the talk, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory where our experiments were taken.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," We investigated their waste streams with the perception that glycerol was an abundant waste product from their productions and thereby a by-product, they would be more than happy to get of their hands. Talking to the Biodiesel producers, we were suprised to find that they do not percieve glycerol as being a waste, but actually already is a valuable byproduct used in the chemical, pharmaceutical and tobacco industry.                                        After realizing this we went back to the drawing board in search of a ""true waste product"", which did not have any competing uses. After researching less classical waste streams and talking to even more industry, we got into contact with a local canola oil producer who had a promissing substrate for our project. His process of producing cold pressed canola oil produced around 1 - 1.6% of a lipid- and carbohydrate rich sediment, which he could not recycle in the process or use in animal feed, due to its high content of polyols. Instead the sediment was more an annoyance for him, as he was forced to burn it to dispose of it. He was excited about our project, as this would allow his by-product to be transformed into something useful for society. Talking to him we learned a lot about canola oil production and waste handling, and quickly realised that this by-product was ideal for our project. We integrated this in our project by investigating the growth characterstics of Y. lipolytica on the sediment and finally settling for it as a proof of concept substrate for the biorefineries of tomorrow.
Visit to the local canola oil producer, Grønninggaard. Klaudia, Mikkel, Nicolai and Isabella learned all about the process of extracting oil from the plants and how a sediment consisting of complex carbohydrates is left over from the production.

Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.
Reddit Synthetic Biology Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange . Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". We believe this is important, as there is a move within the education system to encourage flexible teaching and learning approaches and it is therefore necessary to have a package that is similarly able to adapt to the needs of teachers.
Outcomes and Analysis
The overall feedback from the distribution of the package to educators was positive. We were also able to collect several constructive critiques, which we have carefully and creatively considered in order to help us develop the package into the future.
Christine Fira (Maclean High School, NSW):
“I am highly impressed with the package as it covers a range of syllabus outcomes and ties them together in a very interesting way. The segue sections are most interesting. The powerpoint was clear and succinct and the simpler experiment could be easily achieved by all students in a typical class with a wide range of abilities. Thank you for the opportunity to view this. Your team has produced and interesting and quality package that I look forward to using.”
It was interesting to learn that teachers noticed and valued our attempts to link together components of the syllabus in a succinct manner, such as connecting the enzyme experiments to the topic of nutritional requirements. The reception of the PowerPoint was also appreciated, as it validated the hard work that had gone into improving the PowerPoint used for the school workshop.
The range of responses we got regarding the difficulty of the practicals somewhat reflects the variety of practicals we provided to teachers. Whereas the ‘Lipase Experiment’ was reviewed as simple and easy to achieve by all students, the ‘Quantitative Assay’ brought up issues with accessibility.
Anonymous:
“While I can see that the educational package is great, it seems like it would only be possible to perform the experiments in well-funded schools. Just as a constructive criticism, I think you guys should do more research on what is readily available in schools in NSW, especially public schools. A lot of public schools don’t have access to things like spectrophotometers and microcentrifuge tubes. I can see this package working well in a selective school/private school setting, but not in the classrooms of regular public schools in NSW. Criticisms aside, I think that it’s great you guys are thinking about the future generation of scientists by providing teachers with such resources!”
On review of the package, we realised that the disparity in views could have been caused by the lack of clarity as to which experiments teachers should start with. Although it is clearly outlined in the “How to Use this Package” document, it appears the second reviewer assessed the level of difficulty of the “Quantitative Assay” practical only, which was only included as extension for schools that"

Color Q
Color Q is a free mobile application developed in Java for the Google Play Store. The app was developed in the Android Studio v3.2.1 integrated development environment. It works alongside the Chrome Q hardware also developed by Lambert iGEM in order to effectively quantify the result of a biological reporter, similar to the function of a plate reader. The app is able to use circle detection in order to find the samples on the base of the Chrome Q hardware and then detect the red, green, and blue values (RGB) of the center of each circle. The way the circles are arranged allow for a range of values to be generated. The first row contains 4 circles. The average RGB values of the first two circles are calculated as the negative control and the average RGB values of the second pair of circles are calculated as the positive control. The distance between the positive and negative control is calculated in the 3D-coordinate plane using the following formula:
The Hough Circle Transform is used as the method of circle detection found in the app. Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) is a library that can be imported into Android Studio in order to perform image analysis-based methods. The image taken by the smartphone camera is converted into a grayscale photo. This essentially makes the image more readable in terms of edge detection and ""round"" estimation. There are several parameters that can be modified and calibrated in order to detect an accurate amount of circles:
Maximum Radius: The smallest value for the radius of a detected circle
Minimum Radius: The largest value for the radius of a detected circle
Minimum Distance: The smallest distance between the centers of any two detected circles
Edge Gradient Value: The roundness of each detected circle
Threshold Value: The amount of memory the system has to store the detected circles

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp shows that only three domain border combinations can be  used for exchanging the indC T-domain with the T-domain of bpsA. These are the  combinations A1, A2 and C1. We applied combination A2 for further T-domain exchanges.
Fig. 7 depicts the success of this boundary desgin as two additional native T-domains derived from delH4 and bpsA (indigoidine synthetase) led to functional indCs and the production of indigoidine. In addition, the native T-domain from plu2642 which was already shown to be functional (compare Fig. 3b ) showed faster and increased indigoidine production (deep blue agar plate, lower right panel on Fig. 7 ). The results obtained from this experiments proofed two concepts: First, domain shuffling is possible across different species as the T-domains of delH4 and bpsA were derived from D. acidovorans and S. lavendulae lavendulae, respectively and were functional in E. coli. Also, shuffling of domains from modules of different substrate specificity has been proofen herein. Second,  manually adjusting the boundaries predicted by Pfam based on MSA is a functional method to predict functional T-domain boundaries.
Figure 7: Applying optimized domain border combinations by T-domain exchange of native NRPS T-domains As described above, we determined an optimized domain border combination for the exchange of the native indC T-domain with the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase bpsA. We applied this border combination (previously referred to as A2) to the T-domains of the NRPS modules entF, delH4, delH5, tycA1, tycC6, plu2642 and plu2670, replacing the indC T-domain with the respective fragments of those modules. This figure shows three transformants with a blue phenotype in which the indC T-domain was exchanged by the T-domain of the respective NRPS module. The pictures were taken after 60 hours of incubation at room temperature. Once more one can see the differences in growth kinetics due to the production of indigoidine: Cells expressing the indC variant with the T-domain of bpsA  grow very slow and form small and dark blue colonies, whereas cells expressing other variants grow faster. Comparing the images on the very right, we suggest that cells expressing indC with the T-domain of plu2642 produce the most indigoid"

Feedback
This high school education program aims to share our project with high school students.We want to spark light in their minds that there are lots of knowledge beyond textbooks, and maybe they can join iGEM next year. Further more, high school students           have learned ‘’Nitrogen cycle’’, so they can gave us some feedback from different prospect. Students asked us about our device, and wondered how does it work in water? and why we choose E.coli instead of other bacteria in our design? And some           students also asked us how to introduce iGEM to NEHS.

On 2017/06/09 afternoon, we have a small talk in Kaohsiung Girls Senior High School. Maybe they can't understand all the technical details yet, but we hope to buried a seed deep in their heart. Perhaps one day, it will rise as the prettiest flower in           the world.
Why We Choose Kaohsiung Girls Senior High School?
Being the first and only iGEM team in south Taiwan, we desperately want to be the motivation for many students who are talented and have a passion in science, we want to let them know that there are thousands of young students are working as a team outside           Taiwan, trying their best to make the world a little bit better.

June 4th 2009
I play with Kepler without success, the database connection actor somehow didn't work for me. I'm still confused about the director & actor relationship in Kepler. I'm also fixing the help file on Clotho Part Navigator, and try to find bugs.
June 5th 2009
We decided to still add oligos design tool as a plug-in to Clotho, so I will learn how to make a Clotho plug-in. Next week I will learn and ""take over"" the Clotho's Part Manager from Nade. For today I will read about Clotho plug-in and connect Christ's oligo design tool. This tool already provides output as multiple construction files, assembly file for the robot and other files, so it can stand on it own. Ideally, it really improve as a plug-in for Clotho if we can connect the tool to the database connection, and use the tool's output to add new parts to the database. However, what we concern now is the way Clotho handle temporary information and features, since the current datamodel may not fully support what we need, and the implementation of the tool is not very modular also. At least Clotho will only launch the tool like Notepad plug-in and the tool run separately.    -- Thien.nguyen 19:26, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
Week 2
Task for this week
. Learn and manage Cotho's Part Manager, including improving the helper file
. Finish making the oligos design plugin
. Write basic Kepler actors
. Have fun working
June 8th
I learn the details of Clotho's Part Manager from Nade, since I will take over the role of managing this part of Clotho from him. This also helps me understand more about Clotho's inner structure. I will improve the Part Manager's help file this week, along with finishing the oligos design plug in.

Only 0.02% of the model's changes cannot be explained by the model. Moreover, accuracy is used to describe the signal-to-noise ratio of the model [4]. The signal-to-noise ratio is 359.0217. Usually, the ratio is greater than 4, and the model can be applied to guide the experimental design and also to indicate an accurate signal. From the significant coefficients of the regression model, it was found that each factor has a significant effect on the yield of butanol.
2.3  Optimal solution
The optimization of the model makes the partial derivative of the equation, and the derivative is 0, which constitutes a ternary equation system. By solving the equations, the optimal fermentation conditions are obtained [5]. The optimal results of the model: the temperature was 33.685 ° C, the initial OD was 12.932, the initial pH was 7.993, and the maximum yield of butanol was 0.334 g / L.
The kinetic response surface of butanol synthesis, the three-dimensional response surface and the corresponding two-dimensional contour map are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows the effects of these three influcing factors on the synthesis of butanol in a certain range. It can be seen from the figure that each response surface has a distinct peak, indicating that the optimal fermentation conditions for butanol are within the selected experimental design range.
Figure(a) and (b) show the effect of initial OD and temperature on butanol fermentation. Butanol production first increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature. And it increased with the increase of initial OD. The amount of butanol biosynthesis is more affected by the temperature than the initial OD. Figure(c) and Figure(d) show the effect of initial pH and temperature on butanol fermentation. Butanol production increased with the increase of initial pH. The amount of butanol biosynthesis is more affected by the initial pH than the temperature. Figure(e) and (f) show the effect of initial OD and initial pH on butanol fermentation. The amount of butanol biosynthesis is more affected by the initial pH than the initial OD.
In summary, the three independent factors that affect the yield of butanol are: initial pH > temperature > initial OD. If the temperature is too high or too low, the initial pH is too acidic or too alkaline, and the initial OD is too high or to low, the yield of butanol"

Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there are local biosafety groups at our institution, Environmental Health and Safety department at Penn State. This department is responsible for all safety aspects relating to environmental protection, occupational Healthy and Safety, and Radiation Protection. All researchers were required to attend a safety training program that informed us of lab safety procedures with regards to chemicals and biological hazards. The session was very helpful in providing safety information to our team.
Additionally, our team was required to submit a research proposal to a review committee called the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC. This committee is responsible for research approval, advocating research safety, and promoting University research for commercial application. Our project idea was submitted to the committee for approval.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices, and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To further enhance safety practices in the lab, all iGEM participants should be required to fulfill a safety requirement that is common to everyone. That way, standards to safety education can be determined and implemented that would ensure safe practices of all teams. A video lecture, developed by iGEM, should be made for all iGEM teams to watch. Then, once the video has been finished, a short quiz assessment should be filled to make sure that all researcher are knowledgeable on the procedures that video discusses.
Environmental Health and Safety has done a similar type of safety education program for our  researchers. Certificate of completion is available for all of the iGEM the team members.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Modeling#bacterial Growth_-_-_TEXT.html," a large extent by biological factors such as over what length of time the (actual) birth and death rates can be expected to remain reasonably constant and how large $N(t)$ may become before organisms can no longer be assumed to develop independently of each other. Clearly, whenever a biological process is being modelled, no matter how innocently simple it may first appear, the underlying assumption used in the construction of the model must be constantly questioned. The feasibly and predictable future may be well quickly disapointing.
Probability of extinction $\star$
Last part but not least : we will study the probability of extinction of our bacteria population.
Intuitively, this probability will depend on $\lambda$ and $\mu$ : if $\lambda\ll\mu$, then it is reasonable to suppose that since death predominate the population will eventually die out, and since we have not considered immigration phenomenon, this implies extinction. On the contrary, if $\lambda\gg\mu$ then birth predominate. Either an initial downward surge leads to extinction of the population, or else $N(t)$ avoids becoming zero and the population grows indefinitely.
The probability that extinction occur at or before $t$ is the coefficient before $z^0$ in $(\star)$, i.e, \[ \left(\frac{\mu-\mu e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}{\lambda-\mu e^{-(\lambda-\mu)t}}\right)^{N_0} \] where $N_0$ still refer to $N(0)$.
In particular, this value for $N_0=1$ is the probability that a single bacterium and all his clones are extinct at or before time $t$.
To obtain the probability of ultimate extinction, $p_0(\infty)$, we have to let $t$ tend to infinity and
If $\lambda\lneq\mu$,
\[ p_0(\infty)~\sim~\left(\frac{-\mu e^{\mu t}}{-\mu e^{\mu t}}\right)^{N_0}~=~1~\longrightarrow 1 \] Ultimate extinction is therefore certain.
On the contrary, if $\lambda\gneq\mu$, then the exponential terms vanish, so
\[ p_0(\infty)~\sim~\left(\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\right)^{N_0}\longrightarrow\left(\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\right)^{N_0} \]  In particular, even though $\lambda$ is greater"

Figure 7 shows  intervals of time in which the students believe SB will change our lives. During the talk, emphasis was made that SB technology will probably make a revolution on the way we live now, and that this revolution was about to happen. All this was supported by the various examples of iGEM technological, health-related and environmental ideas. Given this, the vast majority of people expect this change to happen  within the next 5 to 10 years; moreover, 5 and 10 years correspond to the peaks with most votes.  The next peak is around 20 years, where the accumulation of votes accumulates and forms a second peak in this interval. Thus, the students surveyed either believe that advances in SB are happening fast enough, or that delays are bound to occur  because of the technological transition, commercialization, etc.
In short, the majority of  high school students surveyed have a positive attitude towards SB and its consequences in our lives. This can be explained because the problems they think the most about (Figure 2) could be given a solution by this technology. Also encouraging is the potential improvement of life quality and human capabilities that SB promises (Figure 5).
Discussion
Several potentially influential variables were not taken into consideration during the whole process. First, the different subpopulations of students and talk times due to the institutions' decisions; second, the non-equal populations of individuals taking each survey; third, the lack of a measure of consistency throughout the surveys (i.e., to discard inconsistent ones). Figure 8 shows that the distribution ages of individuals remains practically equal in both surveys, which suggests that the population composition  is not subject to tremendous change. Despite these and perhaps more intrinsic drawbacks of such a work, the data have been collected and therefore can be exhaustively mined in search for patterns and trends. However, we believe that trends detected for high school students here will have little change because of the size of our sample from different regions, and that adding more groups of people by the application of this methodology will surely let us elucidate  those trends in the population.
Conclusions and Perspectives
Since the social objectives  of Synthetic Biology  involve making people in the world aware of the upcoming revolution, our team's  survey-talk-survey strategy succeeded in a) designing and applying a controllable strategy to provide a practical definition for Synthetic Biology based on biological engineering, b) starting diffusion about Synthetic Biology in Mexican high school students so they are prepared for the future, and c) setting grounds to expand"

4 Background
Motivation
The rational, forward engineering of genetically-encoded biological systems relies partly on 1) the generation of a multitude of genetic parts and 2) the sufficient characterization of these parts.  This project aims to contribute to the advancement of synthetic biology by 1) generating and sharing a library of transcriptional enhancers called UP-elements (a new class of BioBrick parts), 2) characterizing strength of transcription initiation by measuring both mRNA and protein levels (by RT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively) and 3) elucidating UP-element design principles.  We propose our characterization methodology as a minimal measurement standard and hope that the results of this project will be useful to the community.
Project Overview
We designed a variety of UP-element BioBrick parts to serve as transcriptional enhancers and characterized them with our proposed minimal measurement standard .
Figure 1: UP-element in context
Figure 2: UP-element as an enhancer for transcription initiation
In addition to designing and characterizing UP elements, we were also able to further characterize existing constitutive promoters in the registry.
Safety
The nature of this project does not raise any unusual safety concerns.
The local biosafety committee is the VCU School of Engineering Safety Committee.
One of our advisors, Cindy Lovelace, serves on the committee and makes sure that our team followed all safety guidelines.
Our new BioBrick parts should not raise any unusual safety concerns.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"th and 22th of January 2017, we organized our own literature workshop to facilitate in depth discussions about synthetic biology projects. The entire iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2017 as well as additional students with a strong interest in synthetic biology attended the workshop.  Participants presented former iGEM projects realized in Bielefeld to provide information, possibilities, and features about the iGEM competition. Additionally, presentations about current research were given to enhance discussions about novel projects. By analyzing and discussing former iGEM projects we gained great insight in the structure and the requirements of iGEM. “The Transformers – from Carbon Dioxide to Biofuel” from the iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2014 and “MARSS - Modulated Acetosyringon Receptor Sensor System” from the iGEM Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2010 have been presented among other projects. The projects demonstrated that neither the fixation of carbon dioxide, producing the biofuel isobutanol from carbon dioxide nor a sensor for capsaicin have an innovative character anymore, which is a crucial criterion for any successful iGEM project.  Already at the beginning of our project phase, we kept the giant jamboree and our final presentation in mind. Each team member prepared two presentations in english and held them in front of a big audience, thereby improving presentation and communication skills.  Several scientific discussions had a great impact on our project. The presentation about the minimal genome promoted the work on our biosafety report. One talk described the application of a FRET system to investigate quorum sensing. This inspired us to utilize FRET for one application in our project.  During the entire weekend, there was one topic that always recurred: CRISPR/Cas9. Due to the very broad range of applications, we identified its huge benefit for our own project. CRISPR/Cas9 is critical for our retention system, to ensure that the unnatural bases are preserved in the genome. Since this literature workshop contributed significantly to the development of our project, we recommend it to other teams. Looking at previous projects is very helpful to identify a novel topic for the next iGEM competition. We already planned a second Literature Workshop with the upcoming iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2018. This will provide an exchange of experience, enabling great start for the new team.

However, the traditional gas collection technology featured by high energy consumption and low efficiency is not yet mature enough. Meanwhile, it is these characteristics that have limited the development of itself.Our project is to obtain carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) with high thermal stability through computer simulation of the protein molecules expressed by carbonic anhydrase gene locus mutation, and import it into escherichia coli cells to achieve efficient collection of CO2.
We are honored to participate in this cooperation, and hope that through this channel we can reduce the misunderstanding of genetic engineering.

    9 . Cooperation with Nanjing University
With the shortening of the time, our iGEM team encountered difficulties. The plasmid solution used in an experiment procedure in interlab was not effective after many times of cultivation, so the next experiment could not be carried out. We communicated the results with other iGEM teams. Nanjing-China of Nanjing university knew about it and then provided the bacteria liquid we needed. Our team members went to the school of life science of Nanjing university to obtain the bacteria liquid .
With the help of Nanjing-China, we successfully carried out the next experiment of Interlab, and finally achieved the success of it. We would like to express our hearty thanks to Nanjing-China for their help!

We contacted the iGEM team of Northeast Forestry University (NEFU-China) on August 2018, and our two teams gave each other some detailed descriptions of our projects.
NEFU modeling:
NEFU modeling: They store information in a yeast, and the time of information storage is the key to the case. The information storage time (a yeast growth time) needs to consider some parameters ,such as the initial inputs of α yeast and a yeast, the concentration of a-factor, and the expression efficiency of Bax gene. Firstly, partial correlation analysis is used to analyze the local sensitivity of the complex relationship between parameters and results, which provides a basis for accurate and efficient modeling and reliability analysis of simulation results. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the secretion amount of α-factor and the growth time of a yeast had a higher sensitivity .

We simulated the binding kinetics of the AND gate, created folding path videos which nicely show how the gate is working and applied the results from our signal sequence optimization.

First we considered the case that only one signal sequence is present, that is at most one terminator gets destroyed, which one can see in the picture below.
AND gate, only one signal present.
As the picture below displays both of the signals successfully bound to the terminators, thus as both input signals are present (that it both inputs are '1') the AND gate also returns the value '1' as both terminators are destroyed.
AND gate, both signals present.
We also tried to model an AND gate with the optimized signals which were sufficient to destroy a single terminator above, but didn't work out for the AND gate as the picture below shows. The signal sequences were to short to bind to the terminator probably due to hindering by other structures, e.g. by the linker.
AND gate and the minimal signal length
RNA folding path videos
We created folding path videos for the AND gate. For only one signal present the video shows how the Trp-terminator is not destroyed.
On the other hand, when both signals are present, one can see how both signal sequences bind to the terminator sequences as those are synthesized and none of the terminators can fold.
Close
Results
We were able to model a logic gate consisting of two of our switches we introduced above. We proved this logic AND gate to work well, that is if the two input sequences are present the terminators are destroyed and if only one or none signal is present termination occurs.
Outlook
So far there is no RNA folding program that is specialized on modeling the interaction of two sequences not to speak of a whole network consisting of RNA based switches and signaling sequences. Combining the concepts of Kinefold [10] and Vienna [11] and using sets of secondary structures that are adjusted to having two sequences instead of only one sequence one could get rid of the bulky linkers. The linkers we used did not play a significant role for our simulation as we were just handling small RNA devices, but for larger networks they are likely to be sterically hindering. This obstacle has to be overcome to allow reliable in silcio modeling of RNA devices.
With appropriate software RNA devices like our switches could in future be used to interconnect BioBricks, as demonstrated on our Software page, and to simulate those interconnections at elementary step resolution.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"roas are numerous and weaken the new bees, the colony will weaken and will not be able to gather a lot of pollen to make honey.
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that most beekeepers told us they would be interested in a treatment against varroa that is efficient, ecological and respectful of the bees.
Turkey
All the beekeepers who answered our questions were informed about our project and the logic of synthetic biology.  Our participants were Prof. Dr. Ender Yarsan, Mehmet Erdogan, Kaan Keskin, Kursad Ceseroglu, Kursat Zeynel Utlu, Turabi Guney and Yasar Tekin. All of our seven beekeepers experienced the parasite: varroa. However, the beekeepers were mistrustful and thought that our project could be more  dangerous than useful and said that the drugs they use are enough to treat the hives.
We asked the beekeepers about the bee illnesses they knew and here is their answers: lime, nosema, American foulbrood, European  foulbrood, paralysis, septicemia, gravel and environmental illnesses.  Being prepared and having reserves against varroa is an important issue for them, too.
Measures against varroa and their efficiency
The measures the beekeepers took as prevention against  varroas were mostly of a chemical or biological kind, ranging from  drug applications (organic or not), to chemical sprays and treatments.
Still they said that the preventions are not really enough.  They prefer to use treatments such as Apivar, Bayvarol,  Perizin and Checkmite+. However, the drugs used against  varroa are imported  and thus they are very expensive  and difficult to acquire, beekeepers say.  For instance the drug called APIGUARD is €28 and  APILIFE is €40, which is quite expensive and  difficult to reach for a beekeeper. Also the beekeepers complain about the drugs being inefficient.

Economics and time
Ultimately, however, when businesses consider new approaches for production, the primary focus is on the bottom line, of which the predominant factor is time. All the reactions depicted in the tables below are linearly sequential, meaning reactions cannot run in parallel, and as a result the shortest reaction sequence yields the lowest overhead. Production time is always potentially affected by machine maintenance, warming up, waiting in the machine cycle, breakdown repairs, lack of materials and hygiene [10].
Table 7 Timescale of the Hoffmann La-Roche process (100 kg of L-DOPA)[1]
Table 8 Timescale of the Monsanto process (100 kg of L-DOPA)[1]
Table 9 Timescale of the Ajinomoto process (100 kg of L-DOPA)[1]
Table 10 Timescale of the Sankyo process (7.3 g of L-DOPA)[1]
Despite the Sankyo process producing three times the amount of MeBr, it is by far the fastest way to produce L-DOPA, making it a favorite for companies and producing better margins.
Law, regulation and comparison
Another factor that cannot be overlooked when considering future prospects of our method as a business opportunity is legislation concerning GMO’s and intellectual property rights. Despite the fact that our project is now in the open domain and involved in an open source library of parts (i.e., the iGEM registry), our pathway and genetic engineering of bacteria to produce regulated levels of L-DOPA in the gut had a hypothetical possibility of patenting in the UK and USA [11,12]. Under UK patenting law, the project fits under the class of patentable inventions, with the method of administering L-DOPA being novel and having potential medical applications [13]. In the US, the technology is also eligible for a utility patent according to the classifications described under US patenting law, having to be applied for within 12 months of the UK request as a foreign application [14]. As of the time of writing, no patent currently exists for the use of probiotics for the dispensing of L-DOPA in the gut.
The governments of both the US and the UK currently consider the use and development of synthetic biology in a positive light. In the UK there exist a number of well-established academic and industrial institutions for research on synthetic biology, with many sources of funding available through agencies such as BBSRC, EPSRC, MRC and ERA-NET, as well as many industry-based initiatives being set up to build synthetic biology infrastructure [15].

However, the project will continue on well after the Giant Jamboree. Information will be continuously and regularly updated, and because of its nature, ""Project Riboregulator"" is not part of our work for competing awards of any kind or in any year, but rather, a tribute to the Part Registry and iGEM community alone.
CR and TA riboregulator system
Figure 1. Riboregulator Overview Diagram
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by Isaacs in 2005. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system, crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence at the 5' of the RBS, the RBS, and the gene of interest.
The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS to prevent the recognition of RBS by ribosomes. The translation crRNA is also commonly described as a ""lock"" because it ""locks"" the RBS and prevent translation. The ""key"" to this system is the taRNA. taRNA can interact       (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore activate translation (Figure 1.).
The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.'s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent      regulation of multiple genes etc.

Overview
We believe to develop products or applications responsibly, your idea has to be positioned into the real world. Therefore, the potential benefits and risks of our project were determined in an extensive product and application analysis. To analyse the risks in a systematic way, we have developed a hands-on tool, which can be used by other iGEM teams as well.
Furthermore, to specify the desires of companies and the public, we have interacted with these stakeholders and have adapted our design. The experts have mentioned that for multiple industrial applications it is important that the biolenses are all uniform and spherical. To make our project more suited for industrial applications, we have done research into possibilities to make the cells spherical. We have succeeded to make spherical cells that can be used to produce spherical biolenses.
Moreover, our team greatly values being part of the diverse and international iGEM community. We believe that iGEM strongly contributes in the development of synthetic biology, and have studied how its influence, potential and practice could be expanded . Therefore"

ETH_Zurich,2011,Team:ETH Zurich#Biology#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," and more arabinose entering the cell. This positive feedback loop leads to an all or nothing response of arabinose in the cells.
How we used it
Figure 6: Circuit operations of SmoColi with arabinose sensor
To show that our system can be activated by different signals, we introduced a arabinose sensor. Due to the fact that AraC s well established in contract AlcR and XlyR, the arabinose system can be seen as proof of principle for the bandpass and the alarm system for our smoke sensors. The LacIM1 and the CI regulators were under the control of the PBAD promoter, enhancing their expression in the presence of arabinose and the absence of glucose.  The all or nothing response of the arabinose system makes the natural system unusable for our bandpass, because we need an intermediate input signal. In order that we can still use the arabinose system we use the BW27783 (BW25113 DE(araFGH) Φ(∆araEp) (PCP8-araE)) E.coli strain [9] . This strain has a knock-out of the araBAD (degradation), araFGH (low capacity, high affinity transporter) and the promoter of the araE gene (high capacity, low affinity transporter) has been exchanged from PBAD to PCP8, which is a constitutive promoter. The elimination of the positive feedback loop within this strains leads to a titratable response on arabinose, allowingintermediate input concentrations for the bandpass filter. By inactivation of the kanamycin casette, we created the BW27783 from the BW27749, which was provided to us by Khlebnikov et al. (Done according to the method of: [10] )
Bandpass
Where it comes from...
Figure 7: A Bandpassfilter, is a combination of a high pass filter and a low pass filter.
In 2005 Ron Weiss et al. constructed the first band-pass filter device in synthetic biology. This was done by using the combination of a high-pass and a low-pass filter. An input signal is transmitted by cell to cell communication while the signal processing is done using an intracellular feed-forward loop. Filters are created by using different transcriptional regulator proteins with different repression efficiencies and binding affinities for corresponding promoters.

We established a screening system based on antibiotic concentration gradients to screen the newly generated receptors. In our E. coli acetosyringone sensing system several parts derived from different organisms were assembled. The readout system taken from firefly, luciferase, the receptor sensing system derived from A. tumefaciens and sensitivity tuners consist of phage DNA.
Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Figure 1: Image by Martha Hawe
The model organism A. tumefaciens is a soil bacterium and can be found at nearly every place in the world. Agrobacteria became known as a phyto-pathogen leading to the crown gall disease in dicotyledonous species ( DeCleene M and DeLay J, 1976 ). The infection is caused by a gene transfer system located on an extrachromosomal element, the Ti-plasmid. Furthermore, the infection can be divided into several steps: The first step is the localisation of the hurt plant by the bacteria. Predominantely A. tumefaciens senses phenolic compunds from hurt plants, but also aldose monosaccharides, low pH and low phosphate ( Palmer AG. et al.2004 ; Brencic A and Winans SC, 2005 ). When A. tumefaciens recognizes phenols with the VirA receptor, a signal transduction cascade is initiated leading to the expression of virulence genes. The next step is a physical interaction with the host plant. A type three secretion system is responsible for the DNA transfer of the Ti-plasmid from the bacterium into the host. The DNA is translocated to the nucleus, leading to the gene expression and the production of opin. A. tumefaciens uses the reprogrammed plant cells for metabolite production and therefore as a nutrient supplier.
For biotechnological purposes the Ti-plasmid was disharmed. Instead of the native transfer region (T-region) and a gene of interest could be easily introduced into the Ti-plasmid. Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer is one of the most commonly used techniques of plant transformation ( Ziemienowicz A, 2001 ).
Native receptor
A. tumefaciens needs a precise recognition system for potential hosts to gain an evolutionary advance. The native sensing system is a two-component phospho-relay system in which VirA is a transmembrane-bound sensor while VirG is the intracellular response regulator ( Wolanin PM et al., 2002 ). The two genes for the sensing system are"
British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," no colonies grow on plates with cells transformed with PCR products ligated into vectors.  One possible cause is the transformation itself.  All of Joe's transformation resulted in a spark.  He had added 5 uL ligated to competent cells.  The high salt concentration may have heavily influenced the sparking.  So, I redid some of the transformations in a smaller volume of ligate.  I transformed Joe's ligated 3:3 dszB, 3:3 dszC, and 3:1 dszB plasmids into EPI300 cells.  Added 0.5 uL ligate to 40 uL competent cells and electroporated them.  The 3:1 dszB cells sparked during electroporation.  The cells were left to recover undisturbed at 37C for an hour before plating 50 uL transformants onto Chlor plates.

Made competent Pseudomonas putida cells using the Competent Cell Production protocol.
We had trouble getting the cells transformed with the ligated amino acid pathway genes to grow when plated.  We're unsure if the problem lies in the digest, the ligation, or the transformation.  Thus, we decided to redo all these steps.
Re-digested the ""M,"" ""TA,"" ""TB,"" ""TyrA,"" and ""ArgC"" PCR products provided by Jacob.  Made a master mix of 5 uL NEB buffer 2, 0.5 uL BSA, 0.5 uL EcoRI HF, 0.5 uL PstI, and 18.5 uL dH2O.  Incubated each of the mixtures of 4 uL master mix plus 4 uL PCR product in a Thermocycler for ____.

""TOUR DES SCIENCES""
Date: March 8th to April 16th
Speakers: iGEM Toulouse team
Audience: French researchers and the general public
What is the Science Tour (Tour des Sciences)?
The Science Tour, which took place from March the 8th to April the 16th in eleven French cities, aims to introduce sciences to the general public in a new way, through the involvement of students and assistant professors on the theme: ""The sciences of tomorrow"". This event involves 18 science associations (researchers and various universities from all over France) in the organization of conferences and excursions to arouse interest and discussions around various scientific disciplines.           This year, the Science Tour took place in the University Paul Sabatier of Toulouse with the help of the “Corpo science”, a student organization.
Why were we at this event?
We were at this event in order to promote science culture to a diverse audience of students, researchers, and non-scientists, and to encourage students to be involved in the popularization of science. The activities offered during the Science Tour are intended to be diverse enough to promote Science as widely as possible, as well as the specificities of the different cities in terms of research. We also presented our project and iGEM to a very diverse population from many countries.
What did we do?
In correlation with the theme ""The sciences of tomorrow"", we presented our subject and iGEM to the participants. Furthermore, we showed the diversity of microorganisms with our card game Microbioworld.
Conclusion
This experience was very rewarding for the entire team. We were able to attend very interesting scientific conferences. In addition, we met a very wide audience that was very interested in our project. It was with pleasure that we participated in this event.

Cell Density
Efficient sporulation requires high cell density, as when cell density is low, the Rap (response regulator aspartyl phosphatase) proteins RapA, RapB, and RapE dephosphorylate Spo0F-PO4, prevents Spo0A activation.  The rapA and rapE genes are cotranscribed with a downstream open reading frame encoding the signaling peptide precursors PhrA and PhrE, respectively, which are processed and exported out of the cell. As cell density increases, the processed peptides are imported by the oligopeptide permease (Opp) and inhibit the activity of RapA and RapE; similarly, the processed product of PhrC (CSF [competence- and sporulation-stimulating factor])inhibits RapB. Inhibition of the Rap proteins prevents dephosphorylation of Spo0F-PO4 and allows phosphorylation of Spo0A and the initiation of sporulation when cell density is high.[1]

Gallery: Visiting La Paillasse in Paris
Size of community
MadLab does not have a normal fee membership model, which makes it difficult to assess the size of the core group. However there are ca. 20 people per event. La Paillasse is similarly sized with a core group of ca. 20 people, with up to 40 people at events. They also run a mailing list to which 150 people are signed up.
Approach to GM
Both La Paillasse and MadLab currently don’t engage in genetic modification and don’t have a licensed lab. However MadLab is currently moving into a new space with the desire to apply for a GM license by November.
How to initiate new members and pass on safety awareness and skills?
MadLab’s founder Asa Calow remarked the no-frills attitude of BioCurious during the FBI meet-up. MadLab thinks the content for initiation can be separated into three roles:
Safety
“This is how we do it”
Education / Knowledge of subject / specific skills
It is clear to MadLab that there must be a balance between text book learning and hands-on learning, but it is difficult to find this “happy balance”. Biology makes this balance more challenging, as the “trial and error cycle” takes a considerably longer time.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," protein sequence-to-structure mystery one inevitably needs to summon the power of neural networks due to the aforementioned complexity and data volume. To fully exploit the generalization power of neural networks, we need to design a concise yet unabridged representation for our data, the protein sequences and their corresponding tertiary structures.
To make use of the primary and secondary structure sequence information we map the one-letter Amino acid codes to integers in range 1-20 and we use 0 to signify unknown encountered residues. We have now a vocabulary of 21 words that we project to a high-dimensional vector through the use of word embeddings [ 1 ], a technique widely used in natural language processing. Similarly, regarding the secondary structure, we have a vocabulary of 8 words that is mapped to high-dimensional vectors through embedding.
A common representation of a protein's tertiary structure is the contact map. This N x N matrix (N the number of residues in the chain) encompasses all the required information to reconstruct the 3-dimensional structure. Every (x,y) point on the map is interpreted as a contact probability between the residues x and y.
The fimH contact map with distance cutoff 9 Å recreated from chain A of PDB id 2VCO
We can see that the majority of contacts span around the diagonal and that is only natural as it means that residues which are at a closer distance have a higher probability of forming a contact than distant ones. In general, secondary structures form patterns on the contact map, e.g. helices are adjacent to the diagonal, and provide a foundation for the prediction of the most difficult long-range contacts. That being said, we first need to obtain information about the secondary structure and subsequently use that to assist in contact prediction.
Since, we have access to ground truth for every protein sequence in our dataset we can employ supervised learning approaches. Secondary structure prediction is a classification problem of 8 classes, where we need to predict the secondary structure class of every residue, while providing context information for residues of the same sequence. Contact map prediction can be interpreted as a regression problem, where one needs to predict the contact probabilities for every pair of residues in the chain.
Gaining local structural insight - SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION MODEL
The first step, given the protein's primary structure is to make an educated guess about its secondary structure. In 2017, we don't even need to do that. We can have machine learning models do that for us.
Although secondary structure provides valuable information for the local structural entities along the chain, it is not enough on its own to produce the contact map. Therefore, we can interpret"

We transferred it to a 15 mL tube and added 10 uL of nuclease mix, 5 uL of 1 M MgCl2, and 2 mL of chloroform. We mixed it gently and let it incubate for 30 minutes. Then, we centrifuged it at 2700 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a new 15 mL tube.

The resulting low crop yields cause many people to go hungry every year, and if climate change magnifies these problems, we could be facing a major food shortage. We decided to give back to those in our community who are already dealing with hunger by volunteering at a local food bank. Five team members sorted radishes for the food bank for four hours to show our dedication to ending hunger around the world.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the metabolite in heterogenous environments, and synthetic auxotrophy systems rely on extensive genome-wide engineering that may be impractical for many industrial production and biotherapeutic microbes. Furthermore, they are intrinsically difficult to reprogram for different environmental conditions, potentially limiting their application.
An alternative approach to biocontainment is to use gene circuits to maintain essential gene expression or block toxin gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions. Upon loss of the biocontainment signal, the circuit blocks essential gene expression or induces toxin gene expression to kill the cell.
Here we present a synthetic biosafety degradation system based on the Gram-positive M. florum tmRNA system that does not rely on host degradation systems and can function in a wide range of bacteria. Researchers showed that the M. florum ssrA tag (mf-ssrA) is degraded by its endogenous Lon protease (mf-Lon) but not by E. coli Lon or ClpXP, and mf-Lon does not recognize or degrade ec-ssrA, providing a protease and cognate degradation tag with orthogonal functionality in E. coli.
In our biosafety system, firstly, we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to add mf-lon ssrA tag into 5 essential genes. Then by applying gene circuits to control mf-lon protease expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can blocks essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
Scheme 4. Panel (A) depicts that the kill switch which controls the expression of mf-Lon gene. Without IPTG, the promoter Pgrac is inhibited by suppressor LacI and the supreessor XylR will not synthesized, thus the promoter Pxyl is active and mf-Lon gene is expressed. When IPTG is added, the xylR gene is expressed and the suppressor XylR is synthesized thereafter inhibited the expression of mf-Lon genes. Panel (B) depicts tive essential gene was targeted to add the the mf-ssrA tag. Panel (C) illustrates schematic of biosafety system in which IPTG-induced mf-Lon expression allows the mf-Lonprotease to degrade essential proteins in a mf-ssrA-dependent manner. We use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to add mf-lon ssrA tag into 5 essential genes.

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
Note
This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Must not forget the human practices   Should characterize existing biobricks   Should delimit and focus our projects: the time and resources are limited.   Have to consider that protein modeling is a complex task that usually takes a long time to develop.

And finally our primers arrived!! (after 3 weeks). We did PCR of the different parts that we need to build our first construct (the Working Plasmid). For that we:
a) Obtained the parts necessary to make the Working Plasmid and transformed e. coli with them.
b) Did minipreps of all the constructs to purify the DNA from the transformed bacteria.
c) Amplified the constructs in the thermocycler.
d) Did electrophoresis of the PCR amplicons.
We had several problems with the electrophoresis, but after some attempts it worked. 5 of the 7 PCR were successfully amplified. The two parts that didn´t work are HIV cleavage site (2kb) and vector backbone pSB1K3 (42kb).
April 16-22, 2012
We did electrophoresis with HIV cleavage site and pSB1K3. This time, we added more of them (4 μL template in PCR) to ensure that they were present in our tubes.  We had now all the parts that we need to proceed! We made our first Gibson Assembly to build the working plasmid (see constructs). We need this plasmid to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid. But unluckily our colonies resulted to be red. This is not what we expected… later we did an analytical digestion to the DNA of those colonies, but we obtained strange results. Something went wrong.
This week we had the great opportunity to assist to a lecture of Dr. Aldo Leal. He is a Chilean biochemist that currently works in Germany studying the interactions between cells and biomaterials made of spider silk proteins. We learnt a lot of information about the production of recombinant spider silk proteins and the possibility to easily create films. Then, it’s not necessary to utilize other sophisticated spun methods like electrospinning. Later we met with Dr. Leal, and he recommended us the following very important paper: Cooper et al.  2009 – “A protocol for the production of recombinant spider silk-like"

Digit  Display:
 Still  encountered the same problems on circuits.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PBAD-RLT and PcI-RLT  separately.
Preserved  at 4 degree centigrade in sterilized distilled water.
Results:  The capsules were not spherical and some droplets stuck together.
Sunday,  September 2nd
Digit  Display:
After  discussion with Mrs. Wu, we thought that it is inappropriate to use BL21 during  the whole construction process. Strains should first be in DH5α and assemble  together.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Transferred  the PBAD-RLT and PcI-RLT capsules into 20mL LB medium  separately and cultivated them for 12 hours. Put 200uL 500mM Arabinose solution  into the PBAD-RLT culture medium  at the second hour. 
Results:  Both  capsules embedding the bacteria with PBAD-RLT  and with PcI-RLT  were not fluorescent, and the culture medium were turbid, telling that some  bacteria had leaked from the capsules.
Prepared intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with E.coli with plasmid PBAD-RLT .
Results:  The capsules were trailing, not as spherical as we supposed them to be. After  observation and analysis, we considered that the 1.2% w/v CMC solution and 2%  w/v CaCl2 solution mixture had changed its structure after autoclaving,  and the viscosity and density of the cationic mixture had decreased. So  the way of sterilization should be modified.
Fluorescence  Test:
We chose  certain levels of Arabinose concentration after analyzing the data we had  gotten from experiments before to set a new gradient. In this time, we used a "

Sequencing Results for M1-15(T7)
Both sequences are incorrect.
Both have the prefix, but the suffix only has PstI.
Decided to BLAST the insert.
The results have almost exact similarity to E. coli K-12 genome.
Due to lack of time, we will not finish cloning the M1-15 construct.
Digestion Gel Image
Digest every unique ICA construct that we have made so far using EcoRI and PstI for a final gel image.
Digest 1 ug of each (1C3) construct plasmid in a 50 uL reaction using 1 uL of each enzyme in NEBuffer 2.1
Visualize on a 1% TAE gel using 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 E,P digestion of MaSp constructs made using ICA this summer. The expected sizes are indicated on the right hand side. The expected size for the backbone is 2070 bp.
The result for M1-9 is slightly anomalous,The band at ~3 kb may be due to incomplete digestion. Will repeat tomorrow.
Also, there is a smear for M2-9 digestion. Will also repeat tomorrow."

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"50 mL of media was pipetted into a square plate using a serological pipette. Four 50 mL plates were prepared for each concentration of IAA.
Plates were labelled, sealed with parafilm and stored wrapped in foil at 4°C until further use.
Liquid Culture Media Preparation
MS media was prepared using M5519 MS basal powdered medium purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
In an autoclavable Schott bottle, 500 mL 1/2 MS media was prepared using 1.1 g of MS basal salts and 500 ml of Milli-Q purified water (4.4 g salts equivalent to 1 L MS media per manufacturer’s instructions).
Media was supplemented with sucrose (1 % w/v) and adjusted to pH 5.7 using KOH.
Media was autoclaved and stored at room temperature until further use.
Arabidopsis thaliana Growth on Agar Plates
Surface sterilised seeds were added to a flask containing an autoclaved solution of Milli-Q water with 1 % w/v sucrose in a laminar flow hood.
This flask was covered with foil and seeds were stratified at 4°C for two days.
Stratified seeds were then allowed to germinate under light at room temperature for 2 days.
In a dark laminar flow hood, seedlings were transplanted to MS media plates with varying concentrations of IAA. Approximately five seedlings were transplanted per plate using sterile tweezers and loops. Seedlings were arranged in a line, 2 cm from the top of each plate. Three plates with seedlings were prepared for each concentration.
Plates were sealed with parafilm and covered with foil leaving only the top 2 cm exposed in order to limit IAA photodegradation and simulate the natural growth conditions of higher plants whereby only shoots are exposed to illumination5. Plates were stored upright at an approximately 90° angle. The plated seedlings were grown under light at room temperature for 20 days.
Primary root length and lateral root numbers were measured at 4, 6, 11 and 20 days following the initial seedling transplant.
Arabidopsis thaliana Liquid Culture
In a laminar flow hood, 25 mL of 1/2 MS media with 1 % sucrose was aliquoted into twelve 50 mL foil wrapped falcon tubes.
Filter sterilised IAA was added to prepare duplicate tubes at 0 nM, 1nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM and 10 µM concentrations of IAA"

Additionally, she has helped to liaise with the administration. She has also promoted the iGEM initiative inside the University and helped us to organize every event related to this matter.
Maria Teresa Villaba Diaz has kindly donated all the protein needed to perform the experiments and answered all our doubts regarding her expertise: the proteins. She was always available for us and wanted to stay updated with our progress, cheering us.
Victor Manuel González Muñoz and Maria Elena Martín Palma: have shared with the team their vast experience in the field of aptamers. They have actively collaborated with the team during all the SELEX and aptamer characterization experiments (even sharing their protocols) and generously lent us their own space at the Ramon y Cajal Institute to conduct two assays alongside them.
Jose Ignacio Klett selflessly spent two days to help the team in the realization of the experiments at the Ramon y Cajal Institute.
Susana Campuzano Ruiz has provided us with knowledgeable advise on the aptamer measurement, leading us to understand the technique and suggesting the best material and equipment to perform the electrode binding.
Victor de Lorenzo he has always shown a good disposition to talk with us and help in the plasmid binding and cloning of biobricks, and making time to give a lecture during the meetup that we hosted.
Tomas Aparicio has helped the team to sketch all the plasmid binding and cloning of the biobricks.
Esther Lantero Bringas has taught us how to clone (the Interlab section would not have been possible without her) and she has supported us all year long.
Helping hands
Marcos Hernandez Cifuentes has helped to develop the final app.
Elena Benito Peña kindly lent us some PDMS, when we run out of it, to continue with our experiments.
Maria del Carmen Moreno Ortiz has been helping us all year long and became essential to our survival in the department.
Pilar Arana always showed interest in our progress and helped us with her"

 Collaborations
Science is no longer a work for isolated individuals, it has transformed profoundly. It’s now teams and collaborations that drive high-impact science.       Therefore, we tried to connect with other teams who participate in iGEM competitions during our work. This led us to participation in interviews and skype meetings, which resulted      in formation of both friendship and professional bonds across the world. With synthetic biology being quite a specific area of expertise one who deals with it can      sometimes feel quite isolated, therefore it was incredibly exciting for us to be able to meet other young people with the same love and passion for science as our own.       We can't wait to meet in Boston!
We consider collaboration or providing helpful information a very important part of this project and science in general. It is the base for future projects even those beyond iGEM.
We had skype meetings with many teams, but would specifically like to point out those we were particularly fond of.
Collaboration with the Graz team
We talked to iGEM Team Graz (
1
) and shared with each other our concerns and project development as well as tackling practical problems which occur       after spending a lot of time in the lab. We talked about different methods and protocols we were using and how those could be improved.      We exchange suggestions with the other team in terms of what else they could try to implement in their work. The project team Graz, whose project idea is       bacterial evolution and finding new selection markers, was, at the time, dealing with slow or even nonexistent bacterial growth in liquid media. Based on our       experience we made some suggestions, such as testing different concentrations of antibiotic. We also suggested they might do some mathematical modeling to predict       the outcome of their bacterial fights and thus improve their project. They helped us with suggestions on how to handle our bacteria, which we use for plasmid multiplication,      even though we generally worked on mammalian cells in general.
Furthermore, we participated in surveys for other teams, notably for iGEMnews , News       from EPFL iGEM team which  was a fun way to share our project with the community. We were interviewed ,  about our team and project which we found to be an       entertaining way to connect various iGEM teams and allow us to get to know each other.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," we are not the first one to introduce VEGF-scFv to iGEM. Team NCTU-Formosa did this work in the year 2015 (BBa_K1694003). Nevertheless, to our regret, we find that there is no experimental structure in PDB (Protein Data Base), which may decrease the reliability of the outcome if we optimize VEGF-scFv based on this part. Thus, this year we introduced a new type of VEGF-scFv (BBa_K2886002) that has accepted structure in PDB, enabling us to work out a much more credible improvement. And, we also simulate the structure of BBa_K1694003 to help us learn about our improvements.
Figure 1. The structure of VEGF-scFv and the interface score of modified version of BBa_K2886002 compared with original version and BBa_K1694003. (a) VEGF-scFv is two outermost Ig-like domains of the antibody of VEGF joined together with a GS linker. (b) According to the interface scores which indicate the affinity of VEGF-scFv to VEGF of revised BBa_K2886002, original BBa_K2886002 and BBa_K1694003, we can draw the conclusion that revised BBa_K2886002 probably has a higher affinity to VEGF after our modification.
As is vividly depicted in the Figure 1, we can find that compared to the binding surface of their original version of BBa_K2886002, the mutant version has a lower interface score, which indicates that our work does make sense.

Summary
What we do has set a good example for iGEM teams. Using similar tool and strategy, you can make improvements to your target protein to make it more practical or we can even endow new functions to a protein theoretically, which is definitely promising in the field of synthetic biology.

Today was an exciting day as we prepared our DNA for shipment for the iGEM Registry. We prepared our samples according to the iGEM protocol and dried them overnight. We also miniprepped samples containing RBS + GFP, from 2013 and 2016 distribution kits, in order to analyse them using a restriction digest. This was done for future experiments with our pH sensitive promoter GadA. We also prepared glycerol stocks for GFP samples prior to performing minipreps.
