Genome Scale Modeling
What medium should I use to grow my Yarrowia? Which genes should I mutate to make it produce more beta-carotene? Let genome scale modeling(GSM) help you design your dream organism. Using a GSM of Yarrowia Lipolytica (Y.lipolytica), we explored how Y.lipolytica grows on different substrates and found out what genes need to be manipulated to optimize beta-carotene production.

Overview
""I've always seen modeling as a stepping stone.""
Tyra Banks
Yarrowia lipolytica is a versatile organism. At the start of our project, there are two main production projects in the wetlab. We aimed to produce proinsulin as well as beta-carotene. The beta-carotene project was later shelved, due to problems with the biobricks and cloning. The modeling team, however, saw this as a challenge and adopted genome scale modeling to investigate Y. lipolytica.
A genome-scale-model (GSM) is a representation of the metabolic network in a form that computers can understand and use to calculate the fluxes (rates of reactions) of the system.
The GSM effort is motivated by future wetlab engineering promises. So if our team, or another, reinitiates the beta-carotene project, the computational support is already in place to guide the wetlab teams towards more optimal growth environment and strain design.
We used GSM for two purposes:
Explore how Y. lipolytica grows in different environments and identify optimal conditions for growth.
Predict what genes can be amplified to enhance beta-carotene yield.
Results
We used the most recently published GSM for Y. lipolytica 5 , solved using Cameo 9 and Cobra Matlab.
We  fulfilled purpose 1: using Phenotype Phase Planes (PHPP). We investigated different Carbon sources as substrates and identified lines of optimality (the optimal relationship between substrate and oxygen uptake rates). The simulation results are supported by the substrate screening experiments, adding"

4) Spot Test of Gradient Samples (9.18)
The small phage and large phage gradients were divided into 15 2ml eppendorf tubes each.
We created a -1, -2, and -4 dilution series for each tube.
We then spotted 5uL from each tube onto plates that had 1x top agar.
5) Plating to Check for Plaque Size (9.20)
Create a -2, -4, -5 dilution series for 9 tubes (Small 10-15 and Large 2-4). For the Large 5 tube, make a -2 and -3 dilution series.
Place 0.5mL of E. coli B into 20 test tubes. Add 20uL of phage from the -4 and -5 tubes of each dilution series (-2 and -3 for Large 5 series) and allow them to incubate for 10-20 minutes.
Add 5mL of x2 top agar to each test tube and plate the solution on top of LB plates.
Incubate at 37 Celsius for 24 hours.
6) Plating to Check for Plaque Size 2 (9.23)
We redid the plating from step 5, but this time added a -3 dilution for some tubes (Small 11-13 and Large 3) because no plaques had formed at -4 for them. We also used x4 agar while plating.
7) Checking for Plaque Viability from Step 5 (9.23)
We selected 4 plaques (looked bigger than normal) from the small phage plates and 6 plaques from the large phage plates (looked smaller than normal) from the plates in step 5.
We picked each plaque with a pipet tip and placed them each in eppendorf tubes with 100mL of LB.
We created a -1 and -2 dilution series for each plaque.
We then put 0.5mL of E. coli B into 18 test tubes and infected each tube with 20uL of phage from the -1 and -2 dilution series tubes for about 10 minutes.
We then added 6mL of x4 top agar to each tube and plated it.
Allowed them to incubate for 19 hours at 37 Celsius.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," we have decided to plot out some experiments that will help us characterize our coils. We plan make use of a Ni-NTA column and His-tags on our coils to characterize our coils. The idea is that we can have a His-tag located on one of the coils and this coil will bind to the column via the His-tag. The second coil will be fused to protein such as GFP ( BBa_K648013 ). This second coil will not have a His-tag and when passed through the column it ideally should bind to the other coil already immobilized via a His-tag. By varying the conditions within the column we should be able to characterize the binding of the coils. If the coil fused to GFP falls off of the other coil it should be located in the collected fluid. The presence of the GFP can be detected by both fluorescence and SDS-PAGE.
Three proposed experiments that we have making use of this are detailed below:
The first test will just test the binding of the coils to each other under standard coil binding conditions (pH = 7). A K-coil will be bound to a drip Ni-NTA column via a 6x His-tag C-terminus fusion.  An E-coil with an N-terminus GFP fusion can then interact with the K-coil that is bound to the column. If the interaction is successful the GFP will not be found in high quantities in the wash steps. The GFP fusion should elute when imidazole is added to the column. The levels of GFP can be verified using both emission measurements and SDS-PAGE.
The second test will make use of this column but will measure the effect of pH on the binding of the coils. Different columns will be set up with different pH washes (3, 5, 7 and 9). It has been previously reported that the coils begin to dissociate at a pH of 5 (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008).
The third test will make use of a spin Ni-NTA column. This test will testthe ability of the heterodimer coiled-coils to resist shearing due to applied forces. The columns will undergo centrifugation at different steps after the proteins have been bound to determine if the forces present have any effect on the binding of the coils.
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
This week involved transforming the part BBa_K648013 received by request from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This part is a GFP reporter that contains the RFC 25 standard prefix and suffix. This prefix and suffix will allow us to create a fusion protein"

Human Practices
In order to develop a successful iGEM project, it is very important to engage with the community and present them the work we do at the lab. Synthetic biology is a field that is evolving very fast and we need to efficiently communicate with people. Since our project deals with detection of bacterial and viral infections, we think it is important for the general public to know how synthetic biology can change the way we detect such infections. For this reason, we attended as many different events as possible and we made sure that we not only focused on the students and the scientific community but also on the general public.
Make Munich (6th and 7th May 2017)
Make Munich is the south Germany´s biggest maker and do-it-yourself tech festival. This was a 2-day event where many innovative, technology loving makers had the opportunity to show their skills in their booths, in talks and in various workshops. This year there were a huge variety of booths and workshops from different categories. Also, the audience who visited the event included young kids, students, and seniors. This event was a perfect event for all kinds of audiences fascinated with technological advances.
We are very thankful to the Make Munich team for inviting us to this fascinating tech event. This was our very first public event where we did our first poster presentation and our first public interaction. We got many encouraging comments and ideas on how we could proceed in future. Plus, we also met many tech and synbio geeks who were very kind to give their views on our project development. We also had the opportunity to meet many startups which were based on synthetic biology as well. Plus, we also met some old iGEMers from different countries who gave us more tips on handling our iGEM project.

Open letter concerning “Biotechnology in our day’s society“
Dear members of parliament, dear Dr. Schavan,
Dear members of the country council, dear Mrs. Wanka,
We are 12 junior scientists attending the master program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” at the University of Göttingen. We take part in this year’s iGEM competition and as part of our work we interviewed people about their perception and opinion of Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering in general. To this end, we generated a survey that has been answered by over 300 participants. The survey’s results were later presented and discussed at an information evening together with experts from science, journalism, bioethics and industry.
Firstly, we wanted to know how well the public is acquainted with the fields Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering. Furthermore, we were interested in society’s attitude towards these topics and trust in science. Through asking selective questions we aimed to assess the amount of previous knowledge. Thereupon we were able to evaluate our further questions in relation to the corresponding level of information.
The survey shows that the majority of interviewees can place biological terms correctly. However, most of them felt like they were not informed on scientific topics as well as they could have been. The results suggested that the internet represent the primary source of information. As a neutral source, the internet platform “biotechnologie.de” (Initiative of “Federal Ministry of Education and Research”) is already established; however our experience shows that it is widely unknown. Introducing impartial information sources that are accessible throughout the general public would possibly take the edge off of current topics like “Danger from genes” in the food industry. We discussed at length whether the responsibility of spreading info on the subject lies with politics, the industry or even educational institutions like universities or schools. We came to the conclusion that scientists and students, which are arguably at the primary stage of information generation, may be able to inform the public with governmental support in an objective way. One could, for example, organize information booths and meetings as all German iGEM teams have done on the “Synthetic Biology Day”. Financial support and a central organization could help realize those projects.
Now coming to the next big issue, trust in science, which is generally there, but there are differences concerning genetic engineering in food, dependent on age groups. As may have been expected there is a significant difference between the younger and older generations with respect to dealing with genetic engineering"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design1_-_-_TEXT.html," used in previous research, ChR2 and C1V1, have large overlap which indicates the large risk of cross-activation . CoChR is chosen because it is ﬁve times more sensitive to blue light than the commonly used ChR2, so low blue light intensities can be used without producing cross-activation of Chrimson.These two channelrhodopsins are sensitive to light of certain wavelength(Blue stimuli corresponded to ~400- to 520-nm band and the red stimuli to ~600- to 725-nm band).
In order to express the functional components in specific neurons (Pairs of olfactory neurons: AWA and AWB in our project ),  we use the promoter of ODR-10, which is a protein specifically expressed in AWA and Str-1 (promoter of a protein specifically expressed in AWB ) respectively in AWA and AWB. The reason why the promoter from cell-specific protein enables expression of target components is demonstrated by the published paper. Thus if we express the channelrhodopsin in specific cells of organisms and shed specific light, we are capable of activating or suppressing the specific ion channel to manipulate the condition of the target cell.
In practice, by making a plasmid containing original receptor’s promoter, channelrhodopsins, Ca2+ indicators and fluorescence proteins, the light-sensing receptors and other proteins can be expressed in C.elegans. Artificial introns are inserted in the genetic sequence of the plasmid, to enhance their expression inside the nematodes. For the sake of ensuring efﬁcient concomitant and equivalent expression of more than two polypeptides from a single promoter, viral 2A peptides are used, which trigger a “ribosomal-skip” or “STOP&GO” mechanism during translation, to express multiple proteins from a single vector in C.elegans .
Why Caenorhabditis elegans?
Caenorhabditis elegans, a classic model organism, is widely used in scientific researches. In our project, we also choose it because its whole genome has been sequenced, and it has its own connectome(neuronal ‘wiring diagram’) completed by 2012 [1] [2] . Adault C.elegans is about 1mm in length, 45μm in width and it is easily to observe and manipulate under stereomicroscope [3] [4] . What's more, C.elegans has fixed ‘genetically determined number of cells’ [5] .These characteristics are of great help to accomplish"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#asoMain#Project#Background-Problem_-_-_TEXT.html," that lure macrophages and neutrophils. Due to the involvement of white blood cells, plaques can become thicker making it further solid and rigid.
These rigid plaques can damage and rupture the vessel walls as a result of the high surface tension of the bloodstream. Subsequently, the rupture induces the vessel cells to secrete pro-coagulative factors which initiate the activation of clotting. The impairment of the conveyance of blood supply gradually results in the death of the tissue. This state is broadly described as hypoxia.
The Importance of Ischemia
The scientific description above may not reflect the importance of this topic; yet the reality is different. Ischemia is related to the most serious conditions of today's medical problems. The well-known heart attack, which is responsible for most of the deaths worldwide, is actually an ischemic condition. In addition to this, the loss of a specific region of the brain because of poor blood perfusion is highly associated with ischemia too and is famously known as stroke.
In fact, every year, about 1.5 million Americans have heart attack causing 500,000 deaths. A heart attack occurs every 20 seconds which results in a death approximately every minute. (1) Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in most Western countries and a major cause of hospital admissions. In 2011, heart attack was one of the top five most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the U.S., with an aggregate cost of about $11.5 billion for 612,000 hospital stays.
The phrase ""heart attack"" is often used non-specifically to refer to a myocardial infarction and to sudden cardiac death. An MI is different form, but can cause cardiac arrest, which is the stopping of the heartbeat. It is also distinct from heart failure, in which the pumping action of the heart is impaired. However, an MI may lead to heart failure.
Heart attack is known in medical literature as coronary heart disease, or coronary artery disease, due to atherosclerosis, or the buildup of fatty acid as a plaque on the inner lining of coronary arteries. The plaque and resulting blood clots block the artery partially or completely, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through the artery to the heart. This cuts off the oxygen supply to part of the heart muscle.(2) If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the ischemic cascade; the heart cells in the territory of the occluded coronary artery die (chiefly through necrosis) and do not grow back. A collagen scar forms"

Summary
It was necessary for us to choose promoters that expressed the constructs we were cloning into yeast cells. We wanted to characterize promoter expression with GFP before we decided which promoter to use in our system with the CFP-Hsp104 construct. Furthermore, we needed to induce a [PSI+] state by overexpression of Sup35 in the cell by inserting another copy of Sup35 into the system via a plasmid. Overall, we had two plasmids that we wanted to easily induce at any time.
We chose to characterize four main promoters that are commonly found in yeast: Gal1, Adh1, Met25, and Cup1. We cloned all of these into the pXP218 plasmid and then transformed them into yeast to test their strength with and without the presence of inducers. All of the promoters we picked are inducible except for Adh1, which acts constitutively. We made the promoter constructs by the traditional restriction digest cloning method after order the synthesized promoters with a GFP fluorescent marker and doing PCR amplification with appropriate primers.
Specifically, The promoters were added into the"

Our collaborations
In scientific research, exchanging with other research groups is crucial. This is not only to broaden one’s horizon, but also to support each other’s work with the motivation of togetherness instead of competition. To get this spirit of mutual success also to our iGEM project, we collaborated with other teams from different countries on different topics. We not only worked together on a scientific questioning with the team from Tübingen, but also on human practice projects with many different teams. We really enjoyed every one of these, as they all had a very positive outcome. Therefore, we again want to thank all of our collaboration partners!
Pathomon Collaboration
During the development process of our Games app ""Pathomon"" , we faced many minor and major problems.             But through collaboration with other teams we managed to turn at least some of them into advantages.
We always wanted the social aspect of the game to be a key feature of the application and so we decided to realize             it as a game, everybody can play during the Giant Jamboree.
As the whole game is based on the distribution of QR-codes, which you have to scan to play the game,             it was essential to us to find a place where we can put them.             At first, we thought this would be no problem and asked the convention center for permission, just to receive the answer, that there is a strict no             sticker policy around the center. Our whole idea seemed to fall apart and started to look useless, because nobody could play the game.
But we knew we still have a chance, we just had to collaborate with other teams!
We contacted almost every team and asked for their permission to attach our QR-codes to their poster in Boston.             The feedback was overwhelming and everybody who answered was willing to help and supported our idea.             What has been a workaround in the first place, turned out to be an improvement for our app and the Giant"

Timeline - Ideation
[June - August]
OUR PROGRESS: Just from preliminary interviewing, we realized that there was a dire need for the prevention and detection of bovine mastitis. Our wet lab team started work on a bacteriocin treatment, choosing genes based on Dr. Nydam's advice. Our product development team concentrated on prevention, and narrowed their ideas down to a multi-purpose milking shell with different modules: an automatic post-dip disinfectant, a flow rate sensor, a cold shock, a temperature sensor, and a UV sterilizer. Our CS/ECE subteam focused on the detection of mastitis and created an app with several features including: a resource for symptoms, a somatic cell counter with a microscope attachment, a data analysis section, and a cost calculator. We brought these concepts to experts in the ideation phase to get feedback and constantly improve our designs. QUESTION: What do you like and what would you change about our product? FINDINGS: Experts were receptive to bacteriocins and had no problem with the safety of it. The temperature sensor, UV light, iodine spray, and cold shock were all seen as important modules, but not all farmers wanted all of the modules. The flow sensor was not needed, and the app was most useful on big farms that use traditional milking processes.

Milkrite
Johnson Creek, WI
Milkrite , a division of Avon Rubber and Plastics, is the world’s largest provider of dairy rubber wear. We reached out to Tom Votny. During our conversation, we learned about the current state of the milking machine market, what technologies had already been developed for shells and liners, how products were typically tested, and how large companies conduct their market research. Tom emphasized that farmer feedback is essential to making sure that our project as a whole succeeds in the marketplace. We began contacting as many farms as we could to gather that feedback.

Design of uric acid response system
We used transcriptional regulator HucR[3] to sense uric acid concentration. Transcriptional regulator HucR is from d. radiodurans strain, belonging to MarR family of transcriptional regulator. This transcription factor binds a single binding site in the promoter region Shared by both genes through high affinity, inhibiting its own expression and the expression of adjacent uric acid enzyme [4]. The transcription regulator HucR binding site is called hucO. HucO is the common sequence of HucR and uric acid oxidase promoter in radioluccus resistant coccus. When uric acid was not present, HucR protein bound to hucO and blocked the binding of RNA polymerase to block the expression of related genes. In the presence of uric acid, the binding of HucR protein to hucO was inhibited by uric acid molecules, so that HucR protein could not interact with hucO, thereby activating the expression of related genes.
We also added Uric Acid Transporter (ygfU) after HucR sequences, making our sequences more sensitive to Uric Acid concentration.
Figure 1 We used HucR to control uric acid oxidase expression when uric acid concentration was lower than that of the system.At the threshold value, HucR inhibited the expression of the system. When the uric acid concentration was higher than the threshold value, HucR inhibition of the system was removed by uric acid molecules, and uric acid oxidase was normally expressed by the system.
Cell osmotic peptide selection:
We decided to use 4 kinds of cell osmotic peptides (TAT, cyclopeptides [5], HIV osmotic peptides, R8) to carry out the experiment of urea oxidase penetrating intestinal wall cells, and use caco-2 human colon cancer cell lines to carry out the experiment of cell osmotic peptides, and culture caco-2 cells on transwell membrane.

13. Use our app to measure the concentration of mercury ions.
Result
        After we use smart phone application we made to detect its mercury concentration, the result showed that the positive control’s concentration is 0.0160mg/L, when the imitate sample is 0.0158mg/L. The result is close to the real concentration 0.01mg/L. The error may cause by the environmental element.
        What’s important is that this devise can work in the reality water sample while the performance is similar to Mercury standard solution. This demonstrate strongly proved that the devices designed by SCUT-China_A can work in the real world and perform a good performance.

Expert Discussion with a Pharmacy Employee
The gut flora is a very important network of organisms in our bodies. Itie has a big impact on our overall health, wellbeing and recovery. Just like other microbial consortia, these networks have not yet been extensively studied. Even though it is such a significant aspect of our health affecting drug absorption we try to establish synthetic co-cultures with our toolbox that can be used in many diverse fields. We thought it would be a great idea to talk to an expert about it. Hence, we invited Mrs. Küpper, an employee of the Paracelsus pharmacy.
After quickly introducing us and iGEM we gave her a presentation about our project and our goals with it for society.
Just like others Mrs. Küpper was very interested and asked many questions about our co-culture. Especially impressive to her was the fact that the co-culture toolbox can be used in many possible ways - either for production, the cultivation of different organisms, simple research or as probiotics.
She informed us that probiotics currently arouse not only the interest of companies but also of her customers. Every week new products emerge on the market and are sent to the drug store. A lot more people also come to the pharmacy and ask for probiotics against diarrhea or stomach trouble even without being sent by their physicians. A lot of doctors still prescribe antibiotics even for minor illnesses which could be treated otherwise, thus accepting the damage of their patients’ gut flora. Some customers use probiotics to counter the side effects. Some physicians - unfortunately not all - recommend probiotics to their patients.
Mrs. Küpper also noted that most of her customers are aware that probiotics are living organisms which is why they often ask for the correct storage of the medicine. Dead organisms are used as a sort of vaccine to start the immune system - but then they are not called probiotics anymore. Since they are not subject to medical prescription the customers need to pay for them themselves. German health insurance doesn’t cover the costs.
In the end she also suggested other applications of our toolbox. The differently built, but similar functioning networks of organisms also exist on the skin or in the mouth that - being impaired - can also cause illnesses. According to her our toolbox could provide important research for those as well.

Performance of PSO
In contrast with simulated annealing, another method we used to optimize parameters, PSO performs much better both on the efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, PSO is good at dealing with very large parameters because it is a global optimization algorithm.

Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)
A general objective in our modeling process is an exploration of the high-dimensional input variable space as thoroughly as possible for its impact on observable system behavior, often with either optimization in mind or simply for achieving a better understanding of the phenomena involved. Since the system input->output behavior is typically a nonlinear relationship, simple logic suggests that the number of runs could grow exponentially with the number of input variables. However, an emerging family of high dimensional model representation concepts and techniques capable of dealing with such input->output problems in a practical fashion. RS-HDMR is a global sensitivity analysis technique that can decompose the high-dimensional, nonlinear contributions of each parameter to the network properties(represented by their total sensitivity) into a hierarchy of low-dimensional terms. Calculations by RS-HDMR require only the ODE model, an estimate of the initial conditions and an estimate of the dynamic range to explore for each parameter.
Introduction to GSA
What's Sensitivity Analysis? The sensitivity of a system to its parameters may be determined using either global or local methods. We implement both of them into our code. Specifically, the global sensitivity analysis employed Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation(RS-HDMR) algorithm to estimate the sensitivities of the circuit properties with respect to the circuit model parameters, such as rate constants, without knowing the precise parameter values.

We altogether used two sets of inner-membrane scaffolds, one was based on split GFP and the other split β-lactamase. Our inner-membrane scaffolds consisted of three fusion parts. The split proteins were linked to the periplasmic ends of scaffolds and streptavidin to the cytoplasmic ends. We chose phosphatidylglycerol:: prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) as our transmembrane protein because its function has been well identified by 2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team. ssDsbA is the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent signaling sequence of DsbA. ssDsbA-tagged proteins are exported to the periplasm through the SRP pathway. With ssDsbA fused to the periplasmic terminal, fusion proteins with Lgt are expected to be anchored onto inner membrane of E.coli.
For the first set of membrane scaffolds, two residuals of GFP (BBa_K738006, BBa_K738007) were fused to the periplasmic ends and streptavidin were fused to the cytoplasmic ends. When 19-mer and 25-mer biotin-modified aptamers are added to the solution and thrombin is present, aptamers act like a bridge linking streptavidin-fused membrane scaffolds and thrombin. In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are dragged together and the two residuals of GFP will approach each other in close proximity to become an integrity part capable of giving green fluorescence. With this design, it is believed that we can detect the existence of any protein through fluorescence.
(The upper figure illustrates the construction of the second set of membrane scaffold. We cloned the FA- and FB-scaffold genes into pCDFDuet-1 vector to obtain optimal expression. )
For the second set of membrane scaffolds, we want to see the results with naked eyes instead of fluorescence to expand its application in everyday life. So we fused two residuals of TEM-1 β-lactamase (BBa_K1054010, BBa_K1054011) to the periplasmic ends. Likewise, when 19-mer and 25-mer biotin-modified aptamers are added to the solution and thrombin is present, aptamers act like a bridge linking streptavidin-fused membrane scaffolds and thrombin. In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are pulled together and the two"

Q2.2: How S-Din make real-time safe surveillance in design platform happen?
A: This safe surveillance system also divided into three safe level: low risk(1), moderate risk(2), high risk(3). These are displayed in the up-right of the interface, and highlight with Green, Yellow, and Red. Simple assessment rule is used: the highest safety level among Parts on the canvas will be set as the general safety level. Once user adds or removes Parts, the safety level will change in real time. Simple but effective.
If high-risk Parts are added, the safety level of surveillance system will be set as High risk(3), Warning will be given as the design might contain potential risk.
Figure 4: Warning will be given if a part of High Risk (3) is added to the design.
Q2.3: Will there be ‘conversation’ between S-Din and user for potential Biosafety risk?
A: Yes! In the CORE (2015 SYSU-Software), an attempt was made that a safety tip was added after the end of design. This improvement is suggested by Prof. Yang Jianhua. We decided to inherit this idea so that we designed a more comprehensive User interaction.
The user will be informed of a basic Biosafety statement at their first Log In. Terms of Use will be given in the link. Special thanks to Prof. He Zhumei on this improvement.
For more detail, see our statements page
Once 3-stars high-risk Part is added in the design circuits, S-Din will suggest user remove the Part besides the Warning from the surveillance system. (as Figure 4)
Meanwhile, the safety tip in CORE is inherited to S-Din to become the last protection to guide the user to design ‘safe genetic circuits’.
Generally, we did anything we could to keep users from Biosafety problems. But the users still need to responsible for their own design.

Degradation of TNT
Pak et al. (2000)14 reported the purification of the NADH-dependent flavoprotein oxidoreductase xenobiotic reductase B (XenB) from Pseudomonas fluorescens.
These authors provide a guide to some of the degradative reactions of XenB from P. fluorescens. This indicates that XenB may catalysed the reduction of TNT, either by adding a hydride to the aromatic ring and forming a dihydride Meisenheimer complex15 or by catalysing the reduction of nitro groups directly (Figure 1).  However several unidentified products and proposed intermediates indicate that this process is yet to be fully elucidated.
Figure 1: Diagram depicting the potential reductive steps catalysed by XenB. (Adapted from Pak et al.)14
 
XenB from Pseudomonas fluorescens is not the only XenB enzyme that exists. A more commonly studied XenB enzyme is found in Pseudomonas putida. This XenB shares 88% identity to our chosen XenB from P. fluorescens.16
XenB from P. putida (as well as other xenobiotic reductases) demonstrate type II hydride transferase activity against TNT. Research into these xenobiotic reductases provided a greater understanding of the potential products and intermediates generated in the reactions with TNT (Figure 2).  Using figure 1 as a model,  in the mechanisms suggested by Pak et al. (2000) (above) it seems likely that the unknown m/z 196 compound was 4ADNT and that the proposed bridge product (m/z= 376) is instead linked by an amine group bridge (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Diagram depicting the known reductive steps catalysed by XenB. (Adapted from van Dillewijn et al.)17
 
We were unable to find more recent attempts to characterise the mechanism of XenB from P. fluorescens. However, given that these mechanisms for P. putida Xenobiotic reductase proteins are similar to the mechanisms of the type II hydride transferase family18 it suggests we are more likely to find the amine-bridged products in Figure 2.

XenB also displays an apparent capacity to denitrify Nitroglycerin (NG).  It has been demonstrated that XenB catalyses the"

Experimental reproducibility is hindered by current protocols. So we fixed it!
Project
ProtoCat 2.0 is a free, open-source online catalog of laboratory protocols with improvements upon last year’s project including a larger protocol database and a website with more advanced features.  By using ProtoCat 2.0, users can find tested, reliable protocols from across the globe all in one place.
Outreach
In order to create the most helpful, effective protocol catalog possible, we created a survey asking other labs and other iGEM teams what struggles they have had with using protocols in the past, how ProtoCat 2.0 could address these problems, and what they would like to see in ProtoCat 2.0.

Jan Kampf
Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Göttingen as well. For my bachelor thesis ""Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response"" I worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen. During my time as a bachelor's student in the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of young students as well as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM project of the other teams.

Leonhard Nagel
Hello, my name is Leo and I am also a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters program at the University of Göttingen. I chose this Master program because I liked the combination and variety of the special emphasis. In 2011, I finished my Bachelor with a special focus on Genomic and Applied Microbiology at the University of Göttingen. I am very proud to be a part of the first iGEM team of Göttingen. I think the participation in the iGEM competition will improve my lab skills and will prepare me also for my following scientific career. Furthermore, I hope our project will be successful and enables us to take part in the regional and international jamboree.

Figure 1. A helical wheel representation of the IAAL E3/K3 coiled-coil heterodimer viewed as a cross-section based off of a similar figure created by Litowski and Hodges (2002). The peptide chain propagates into the page from the N to the C terminus. Hydrophobic interactions between the coils are indicated by the clear wide arrows. The intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the coils are displayed by the thin curved arrow (eg. Between Glu15 and Lys20).
Based off of results from previous ferritin fusions (Kim et al., 2011) it was decided that a linker sequence was needed between the coils and their respective proteins to prevent any steric hindrance due to the size of the ferritin and TALE proteins. A flexible glycine rich linker lacking protease cut sites was selected from the registry ( BBa_K157013 )
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
We continued to perform literature searches this week for our project. This week our main focus was on determining ways we could characterize our coils and finding additional useful properties of coils. Many papers make use of circular dichroism in order to detect if the coils are able to bind to each other.  This technique requires the use of a spectropolarimeter and a fair amount of knowledge to complete so it may not be the most ideal technique in our situation given the timelines we are working on. Another option consists of using FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) to measure the binding of the coils. The idea is to have an individual fluorophore attached to each coil so that when the coils are bound the process of FRET can occur and light emission will be observed from the fluorescent protein that is having energy being transferred to it from the other fluorescent protein (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008). This technique can be difficult to perform however so it will likely be maintained as a backup characterization technique.
One interesting properties of coils is that they are sensitive to acidic pH levels (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008). This warrants examination once we have our coils complete and purified as a protein as this pH sensitivity could be problematic for our system or it may act as a benefit.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.
Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied"
RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"After iGEM
As our experiments progressed, we took significant consideration in biosafety, one of the major global issues related to synthetic biology. According to the interview with Jianwen Ye, Chief Engineer of Bluepha, we realized that bacterial strain leakage from fermenter was merely a tip of the iceberg, and kill switch was one of the various anti-leakage systems. Therefore, our journey does not end with Giant Jamboree. We will continue to adjust our kill switch in response to the current demands in medical or industrial fields. Furthermore, from those social researches mentioned above, it is revealed that not only do civilians possess inadequate awareness of biosafety, but some of the doctors and nurses in local clinics also lack of understanding of biosafety. So, we decide to popularize biosafety-related knowledge in the future time, targeting upon a great variety of audience, ranging from schools to communities and eventually to the society."

We spent the week-end from friday to sunday together to finish writing all the pages and coding the wiki before the freeze. Oh, and we also had to spend tuesday evening too. Everything is now hopefully ready. Let the Jamboree begin!
ETHICAL MATRIX
As young scientists, it is important that we take into account that science is not a game but could be life changing for the society, for the better, hopefully, but it could be for the worse. It is therefore mandatory to any project to foresee its possible consequences, especially for one that claims to offer endless possibilities. To do that, we chose an ethical matrix approach. An ethical matrix is the descriptive analysis of ethical stakes. It is a convenient way to systematically synthesize all the stakes associated to a specific problematic1;2. This is done through a two dimensional table combining all the actors concerned by the technology and three ethical principles:
Well-being: the technology should contribute to the improving well-being
Autonomy: the technology should respect people freedom
Fairness: the technology should be accessible to all and evenly distributed.
The issued matrix is dynamic and change all along the project evolutions. We decided to develop a generic matrix, in opposition to a matrix dedicated to a single application. Here, you can find the lastest version we did before the end of the iGEM 2018 competition (Table 1). We used a color code to highlight the positive aspects (in green) and the points that require careful attention (in red).

BNDS_China,2017,Team:BNDS China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," monosodium glutamate (MSG) was added as substrate. After 12 hours’ induction, the bacterial supernatant was processed and tested. Fig. 4 shows the result of the GABA yield by E. coli Nissle with the constructed plasmid. However, there was no peak during 48 min to 49 min, indicating that GABA was not produced.
Fig. 4 yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle with part Bba_K2326003
Problems
There were three problems in our construction causing the inability to produce GABA. First, since we were unable to know which genes the transcriptional regulator (gadR) regulates in Lactobacillus brevis NCL912, gadR might not function well in E. coli Nissle because of the absence of genes it regulates. Also, we could not locate the glutamate gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter (gadC) in E. coli Nissle cell membrane, so gadC might not function. There were two genes between the pTac promoter and gadA, so gadA might not be fully expressed due to increased plasmid and gene lenth. Based on the analysis of these problems, we constructed the part Bba_K2326004.
LacI-pTac-gadA-GFP ( Bba_K2326004 )
Cloning
Same as the first approach, we constructed the part on RPG and transformed the plasmid to E. coli Nissle. Fig. 5 shows the sequencing result of colony PCR. It shows that the targeted plasmid was assembled correctly.
Fig. 5 Sequencing result of construction of RPG- BBa_K2326004. Derived from Snapegene.
Plate Reader
The part contains green fluoresce protein (GFP). We measured the relative concentration of GFP in bacterial suspension to determine the expression of gadA. The concentrations of GFP in M9 broth are represented by `""Relative Fluorescence Intensity""=log⁡(""Fluorescence Intensity"")/(""OD""_600)` in Fig. 6. Positive control was tested on E. coli Nissle with PSB1C3-GFP plasmid, and the negative control was tested on the endogenous, wild-type E. coli Nissle. The same induction process was used.
Results suggest the concentrations of GFP expressed by E. coli Nissle with the constructed plasmid was higher than the positive control and negative control. Since gadA was closer to the promoter compared to GFP, it was expected"
LA_Biohackers,2014,Team:LA Biohackers#Practice and Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," convert the host organism into a  functioning bio-machine with the ability to produce the target protein. These target proteins can then be  mass produced, combined or otherwise modified using similarly engineered bio-machines.  Once the technology is developed at the DIY level, it can be expanded and optimized in more  established, strictly regulated commercial and university laboratories to produce remarkable results.  Synthetic biology allows for the expansion of conventional uses of bio-machines, like breaking down  organic matter at your local water treatment plant, to encompass a multitude of other specific functions.  Biochemical processes like molecular sensing to detect toxins/disease, selectively delivering  drugs/nutrients, metabolizing oil, or producing ethanol from excess plant matter are just a few of the  potential applications.
The People
DIY organizations can utilize people across the entire spectrum of skill and experience. High  school students, weekend hobbyists, and retired persons all have a place in DIY science. As a result,  these laboratories function as arenas of interpersonal education and community development in  addition to their primary scientific initiatives. DIY laboratories are also a useful educational vehicle for  giving volunteers access to basic safety training, professional laboratory equipment and reagents, and  hands on experience performing lab techniques commonly used in biotechnology. In short, in exchange  for their time and attention, volunteers given a new skill set and the opportunity to work on a project  with tremendously beneficial social implications.  Despite these incentives, finding ample volunteer time is often a challenge. As a result, DIY  research projects are most likely to succeed in large metropolitan areas or specialized academic settings  (Ann Arbor, MI or Charlottesville, VA for example) where a critical mass of scientifically minded  people is often present.
Even if an sufficient number of motivated volunteers can be found, some projects still struggle  to become functional. Seattle DIYbio group, for example, had the required critical mass of volunteers  and the initial spark to begin research, but eventually folded2 due to a leadership vacuum. Finding a  structuring and organizing force is often challenging in the start up sphere where freedom and creativity  typically reign supreme. Someone, however, needs to ultimately be responsible for the organization in  order for it to sustain its existence. Whether it be a charismatic champion (Robert Carlson, author of  Biology is Technology & founder of Biodesic3; Corey Tobin, founder of LA Biohackers4) or a board of  directors, some entity needs to be in place to make decisions. This kind of effective leadership ensures  lab resources are efficiently allocated towards a common direction. Principled guidance is also  instrumental in maintaining"

He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.
Heli Viskari was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - so important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the FACS instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project.
Merja Penttilä (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer, who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten, helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
Jussi Jäntti (VTT) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of yeast strain and provided us with protocols for some of the yeast lab work.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

The measurement was made approximately 4h after 100 fold dilution in M9 in a 5 min interval. For details of our characterisation, refer to our protocol .
Figure 1. Measurement of nrd Promoter Activity.
The fluorescence from the Pnrd promoter is compared with that from the standard promoter BBa_J23101, 3 samples were measured every 9 minutes for each construct. Although there seems to be a slight sudden rise in the promoter activity from the 10-20th minute after the start of measurement, since the change in cell concentration could not be measured simultaneously with fluorescence, it is not certain whether the rise is influenced by the cell cycle/division.
SIGMA 35
In addition to the cell division dependent promoter, extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors are required in our device to coordinate between the cell division dependent promoter and Toehold Switch.
The figure below shows the result of our characterisation. Experiments were done according to methods described in our protocol .
Figure 2. Measurement of ECF sigma35 and sigma30 promoter activity.
Fluorescence/OD600 of a construct containing both an ECF sigma35 generating device and ECF sigma 35 inducible GFP generating device BBa_K2070005 was compared to that containing only either one of the devices. *** for P> 0.001 indicates an extremely significant difference between the induced and uninduced state.
As can be seen from the above figure, the ECF sigma30 promoter is only activated in presence of ECF sigma35, suggesting that that the parts and devices constructed worked as expected. The ON state, measured in Fluorescence/OD600, was up to more than 10 fold of the OFF state. However, it should be noted that there is a leak in the promoter in its OFF state as indicated by the significance difference in Fluorescence/OD600 when compared to the construct expressing only sigma 35.
Once the functionality of the promoter and its cognate pair was confirmed, the part was ligated in pSB3K3 to measure its strength relative to the standard promoter BBa_J23101. The strength of the ECF30 promoter in its induced state was measured to be of RPU 3.2 units.

For the Redoxilator, the growth solely on Glucose showed a longer lag phase compared to the mixed substrate, probably due to a lower initial OD.
Growth profile (OD) of the Redoxilator for the different carbon sources
Growth profile (OD) of the Leaky for the different carbon sources
Regarding the GFP signal, all substrates showed different profiles. Nevertheless, the fermentative substrates, Glucose and Galactose, showed higher values of GFP than the respirative substrate, Ethanol.
GFP signal of the Redoxilator for the different carbon sources
GFP signal of the Leaky for the different carbon sources
Although these results are accordingly to what was expected, it is important to mention that these cultures didn’t have comparable growths, so, in order to subtract this variability of the growth, one should normalize the GFP expression with OD. Additionally, to the GFP values, the residual values for each case were subtracted.
GFP signal corrected from the residual signal, normalized with growth of the Redoxilator for the different carbon sources
GFP signal corrected from the residual signal, normalized with growth of the Leaky for the different carbon sources
One other aspect that is worth instigating is the variation of the GFP signal with growth. In other words, if growth is correlated with GFP signal.

This makes sure that the processes used by a plant are meeting quality standards and product specifications. These generally cost around US$100M for a manufacturing plant to receive. This barrier is restricting a considerable amount of small businesses from entering the biosimilar insulin market.
Team DISCO
Wow! That’s a high market-entry expense that we really need to consider! We must consider how we would raise those kind of funds, if we were to eventually  build a manufacturing plant  in the future!
Len Mancini
But hold on, you guys have something that could be considered a ‘new to market’ drug, which means you could patent this yourselves and raise money through investors who are comfortable that your company will function to produce profits, rather than a single insulin.
Anothony Di Franco
We just raised $16, 656 through some crowd funding though, which is 227% of what we needed to kick start our lab work. If anything, this shows that when moneys needed to be raised, we can raise what we need and more!
Team DISCO
And I guess we wouldn’t really need to ‘build’ a large manufacturing plant. We’d be providing the methods and cells ready to go, so really all a manufacturing plant would need would be the GMP.
Biofoundry
Yeah, you guys really are the proof of concept the industry needs to start seriously looking into insulin production.
Team DISCO
Our YNCM tagged insulins in Bacillus should also provide a much simpler purification process that could be turned into a continuous system with the right optimisations. We should make sure that we spend a little more time making sure that we can compare methodologies between protein extraction when we get up to this stage.
Team DISCO
But wait, hold on. Why are we even pursing to produce an open source insulin, when there might be other alternatives to enter into the market that aren’t the more traditional routes? Could we potentially make an open insulin pump?
Biofoundry
you could, but because of the way that the current pumps are made for a specific insulin analogue, you’d have a hard time selling it without your own insulin. It also wouldn’t really aid the issue of inaccessibility that are currently felt in many places in the world.
Edwina Wang
Hi everyone! As a diabetic myself, I am quite accustomed to injecting myself with insulin, so I wouldn’t worry too much about not having a pump, especially in dire circumstances.

UB_Indonesia,2014,Team:UB Indonesia_-_-_TEXT.html,", we learn from Freiburg Team 2012 to constructing a new specific TALEs that can bind to our target sequences and we called it TALE 1 and TALE 2.
TALEs or Transcription Activator-Like Effectors comes from natural bacterial effector proteins used by Xanthomonas sp. to modulate gene transcription in host plants to facilitate bacterial colonization (Boch J and Bogdanove, 2010).The central region of theprotein contains tandem repeats of 34 amino acids sequences (termed monomers) that arerequired for DNA recognition and binding (Kay, 2009). Here is the natural structure of TALE from Xanthomonas sp. :
Figure 1. Structure of TALEs derived from Xanthomonas sp. (Sanjana et al, 2013)
2. What did We Do ?
As explained before in the Background, we try to make a prototype based on the concept of Calgary Team 2013 . So we construct a new TALEs that can bind with our target sequences, especially in HPV 18 and HPV 16. For building the detector, we received help from Freiburg Team 2012 to construct two new TALEs. First, we search the target sequences with the alignment of whole genome of HPV 18 and HPV 16 via NCBI and MEGA5. We search two target sequences in left side and right side. Here are some works that we’ve done:
Left side: site 7106 until 7119
Right side: site 7851 until 7864
3. CONSTRUCTING TALEs
Based on Freiburg Team 2012 method , we designed our TALE into 2, TALE 1 and TALE 2.
For TALE 1, we use:
(1) BBa_K747012,
(2) BBa_K747016,
(3) BBa_K747042,
(4) BBa_K747048,
(5) BBa_K747064,
(6) BBa_K747091
For TALE 2, we use:
(1) BBa_K747012,
(2) BBa_K747026,
(3) BBa_K747036,
(4) BBa_K747052,

We have thought of this project by ourselves, so it was not an assignment from one of our supervisors. The supervisors and advisors main role was providing consultancy. All the design, labwork and modeling was done by the team itself and started in June. We also took care of the sponsoring, other organizational issues and made our own presentations and poster.
The silk that we have developed was based on the article of Brooks et al. [1], but the codon optimization was executed by the team itself using software written by one of the team members. We improved the backbone made by the iGEM team from Munich in 2012 and used this backbone for our constructs. Also, we validated that biobrick BBa_E0840 works in Bacillus subtilis (Figure 1).
The coating mechanism was developed by the team using article [2][3][4]. The knockout strains were shipped from the university of Illinois and Buenos Aires .
Figure 1: The intensity in of ~40 cells in the GFP-channel, were analyzed from two pictures. The average intensity (AU) from the cells are plotted above with the standard deviation. A GFP from our group is shown and in a biobricked GFP (BBa_E0840) is shown in a plot. wt=wildtype, T0= before induction, T1,2,3=#h of induction with IPTG.

This year, our team is committed to produce useful prodrug 3-succinoylpyridine using tobacco waste by using a more environmentally friendly approach. We previously planned to produce the prodrug with pure nicotine. China has the largest group of smokers in the world, with its tobacco production and sales ranking first in the world. With a nicotine high content in tobacco, we are thinking about trying to take advantage of tobacco waste. This is related to tobacco industry and thus it is why we planed to go to the factories to find out the actual situations. The most amazing work of Human Practices this year is that we have truly been to the tobacco factories in three places, researching our project, and make a great success eventually.
The three tobacco factories are: Hefei Cigarette Factory, Zhangzhou Cigarette Factory and Wuhu Cigarette Factory. We visited the tobacco production workshop to learn the whole process of tobacco production, and make clear every step that may produce tobacco waste. Under the introduction of experts, we carefully distinguish the terminology about the tobacco waste: tabacoo scraps, cut tobacco, tobacco stems and tobacco dusts, etc..
We are harvesting so much surprisingly in three cigarette factorys! Therefore, we have a totally new understanding of the subject! The tobacco waste used in our project is specifically referred to as tobacco dusts. The following is a detailed explanation of the unique position of tobacco dusts in general tobacco waste, and currentl treatment system of tobacco waste industria. In the end, we shifted the focus from dealing with pollution problems to deal with tobacco dusts only.We decided to give up using pure nicotine instead of tobacco waste and redesign our project to develop a production chain downstream of the tobacco industry to tobacco waste, which is not being made good use of, to produce the prodrug, by using a more environmentally friendly approach.
1. Professional terms relating to tobacco waste needed to be distinguished.
To fully understand our work, it’s necessary to distinguish the following concepts correctly.

Methods
Cloning and Expression
We ordered the nodB gene via IDT sequencing and inserted this gene into the pSB1C3 vector through a  BioBrick system and verified this via sequencing. The nodB was fused to an Anderson-promoter with defined cleavage sites  (BBa_K2380025) . The vector includes the RBS  BBa_K2380024 .
Figure 3. Plasmid card of NodB without a promoter. The nodB gene (in green) is located on the pSB1C3 vector without a promoter system. It is a basic part and can be used in combination with other parts. Biobrick (BB) prefix and suffix are shown in light blue.  [BBa_K2380041]
Figure 4. Plasmid card of NodB with Anderson promoter.The nodB gene (in green) is located on the pSB1C3 vector with an Anderson promoter (red) and a RBS (grey). This part is used for expression studies without the necessity of an induction. Biobrick (BB) prefix and suffix are shown in light blue.  [BBa_K2380042]
Before cloning the nodB gene on pSB1C3, the gene was cloned in a pUPD-vector containing a T7-promoter. nodB gene was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 after induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and analysed via SDS-Page. NodB is known to aggregate inclusion bodies within E. coli cells  [7] . Inclusion bodies are non-functional, insoluble aggregates that occur during overexpression  [7] .
There are many advantages with the occurrence of inclusion bodies. On one hand they yield a very high protein expression level, on the other, they are easy to isolation from cells because of their difference in size and density in comparison to cellular organelles. Inclusion body proteins also degrade slower and resist"

The Fourth International Meeting on Synthetic Biology (SB4.0) was held from 10th to 12th October 2008 at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Researchers in the field of synthetic biology from all around the world gathered in Hong Kong to discuss legal, ethical and social issues involving synthetic biology. They also shared their experiences with each other.
Host of iGEM Asia Jamboree
iGEM competition is a premiere undergraduate synthetic biology competition founded in MIT. It provides platform for high school and university students to gain experience on synthetic biology. Because of the growing number of teams, regional jamboree was established. In 2011 and 2012, the iGEM Asia Jamboree was held in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The 2013 iGEM Asia Jamboree will take place in the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
In previous iGEM Asia Jamborees, there were participants from various countries and regions including China, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, Hong Kong, India and Kazakhstan. Students from all around Asia gathered to share their projects to other students and instructors. A judge panel evaluated each project and selected the outstanding projects to be shared in the iGEM Championship that took place in MIT.

UNAM_Genomics_Mexico,2012,Team:UNAM Genomics Mexico#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," that summer according to his father and which can be inferred from the epistolary exchange, was to withdraw from the moral constrains of his community.
Victor Frankenstein is egotistical and he does not allow himself to respond to the needs and bonds of people around him. This egotistical search on Victor's case for Science ruptures community; that rupture and the consequences are embodied in the monstrous creation, which ultimately turns its back on his very creator.
While the election of Frankenstein as our cautionary tale may be seen as the most commonly used cliché to describe the work genetic engineers and synthetic biologists do, in this particular occasion we are focusing not on the unnamed monster and the analogy between our disciplines and the creation of new life, but on the doctor himself, his context and the results of his actions. Could this fictional story serve as a cautionary tale for us in the 21st century?
We believe it does. Right now, there is a breach between scientists and society that needs our most urgent attention. Perception of Science and scientists is suffering nowadays a crisis that might be considered of ""public relations"". The overall failure of the scientific community as a whole in its outreach duty and the perceived ostracism with which many of them carry their research have generated a gap between the general public and the scientific community within this paradigmatic deficit model. Despite the fact that we’ve got many great science communicators and Non-Profit Organizations devoted to this endeavor, the level of involvement of the society at large with the scientific community has been less than frugal.
The symptoms of this “public relations” failure can be observed in the last National Survey of Perception of Science carried out by the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico, which found that Mexican citizens consider scientists dangerous because they allegedly possess a great power because of the knowledge they have. While the media and the scientific community pointed against the usual suspects (pseudosciences, religion) to explain this aversion, we wondered if there might be another variable playing part in this phenomenon.
Bernard Rollin, a bioethicist from the Colorado State University, states in his book “Science and Ethics” [3] an interesting alternate hypothesis to explain this: there’s a scientific ideology that permeates the scientific community, which has driven scientists away from the community they are part of. This hypothesis, outlined in detail on the second chapter of his book, relies on a logical positivist true in which an ethical claim cannot be made from science, an endeavor focused on providing facts about the world and nothing else. In this view, according to Rollin, scientists have forgotten"

Pre-culture of erforRed expression cassette in E. coli Top10F' in 50 ml 2xYT containing chloramphenicol was inoculated from the  agar plate and grown at 37°C and 250 rpm overnight.
For the reproduction of the growth curve a pre-culture of the Prhl inducible construct in E. coli Top10F' in 30 mL 2xYT containing chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C overnight.
To test the production of homoserine lactones (HSL) by our final constructs we prepared a pre-culture of each reporter strain in 30 ml 2xYT containing ampicillin and incubated them overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm. We also made glycerol cell stocks of the reporter strains for further use.
Cells containing the finale constructs were grown in 30 ml 2xYT containing ampicillin as well at 37°C and 250 rpm. We inoculated these cultures with a high cell density as growth depends on the leakiness of the inducible promoters. These cultures were grown over 24 h in order to reach a high HSL concentration in the culture broth. As negative controls strains bearing constructs with the inducible promoters but not the HSL synthesis were grown in 30 ml 2xYT over night at 37°C as well.
The first attempt to cultivate regulated and unregulated mixed cultures in continuous culture was made today. For regulated growth ampicllin was added to the medium, for unregulated growth chloramphenicol was used as selection marker. Samples of each culture were taken at several time points. OD520 was measured and dilutions of samples were plated on 2xYT agar plates containing chloramphenicol.  We had problems to find the right dilution of cell suspension for the agar plates (too many or too little colonies on plates). The results of these cultivations were therefore not statistically relevant and no conclusions about the regulation of growth by our constructs could be drawn.

Week 5: 1st August to 7th August
Monday, 1st August
Seeing the month change from July to August has made us realize how much time   has passed. It has been four weeks since we started this endeavour and we are   still nowhere near where we want to be. Time is ticking away, as cliché as that   may sound.
The day started off with the absence of two of our members   that had fallen ill over the weekend. We missed them dearly but had no time to   stop working! Nic has booked a session on Thursday to use the wide-field   microscope. Operation fancy GFP chemotaxis stuff is a go. On the Arabidopsis   team, Ming did what he does best (in the lab that is).
Nina and Si   continued to plow through the modelling of chemotaxis. Si has also arranged a   meeting with a PhD student on Thursday to discuss modelling root architecture.   Finally Nikki and Yuanwei put their heads together for the good of the wiki.
Tuesday, 2nd August
Today was a good day. Chris and Nikki had a succesfull restriction digest of   the backbone vectors. Chris got to do Nick's dirty work while he was in Silwood   with Rebekka talking to ecology expert Alex Milku. When Nick got back he had the   unfortunate finding that the bacteria he was going to use done have flagella,   but its all good in tha hood because James found some GFP bacteria that move!
The modellers are in their dungeon modelling. Wiki man is making great   progress.
Ming loves his Arabidopsis"

LED panel
We designed and constructed a multifunctional LED panel in a 96-well microtiter plate format through multiple rounds of optimization. This device enables the sophisticated irradiation of samples with a high resolution of light of different wavelengths and intensities. Using our self-written Android application, complex illumination protocols can be programmed and send to the device via bluetooth. We demonstrated and evaluated the functionality by exciting and bleaching GFP and inducing conformational and structural changes of non-canonical amino acids by irradiation at 367 nm and 465 nm. After initial testing, the panel was applied for various crucial experiments. Full documentation and utilization of low cost components enable easy rebuilding, customization and application by other teams. We envision several applications like mutagenesis, surface decontamination, fluorescence studies, opto-genetics, opto-proteomics and photo-biochemistry.

Human Practices Overview
Our project encompassed three areas within human practices: research, impact, and outreach. Each allowed us to better understand our project as well as help the community become a part of our experiments. We met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lawyers, conventional farmers, professors, environmental scientists, global agriculture specialists, bioethicists, organic farmers, biotechnology companies, and entrepreneurs to change our project based on regulations and professional opinions. We then gathered the thoughts, opinions, and concerns of community members, raised awareness of GMO foods, and invited the community to engage in conversation on a hot topic.
Engaging Experts: GMOs, food, water, drought, and salinity affect much of humanity. Such a far-reaching project required discussions with professionals, ethicists, farmers, and more. Click here to check out our site visit and click here to read interviews from professionals who assisted our endeavors.
Responsibility: Developing our science requires responsibility, listening to the farmers, and hearing public concerns. We spoke with hundreds of community members through surveys, discovering their fears and investigating mitigation of public disapproval of GMOs. Click here to learn more about our surveys.
Public Engagement: iGEM values and goals led us to reaching out, holding public meetings, and creating a video explaining our project and its importance. Click here to learn more about our public engagement.
Education: The next generation of scientists must be interested. We held science days at museums and libraries, allowing children to learn more about our project, plants, and synthetic biology. Click here to learn more about how we educated the community.
Collaborations: We collaborated with many teams throughout the course of the project, creating exchanges of information, ideas, and time. We participated in meetups, provided ideas for Human Practices, and even had troubleshooting sessions. Click here to learn more about our collaborations."

Cloning
Ligation
Three ligations in total were conducted. K238013 (S,P) was quick-ligated with lacZ (X,P), rbs (S,P) with T7Pol (X,P) and T7Prom (S,P) with lacZ (X,P).
Transformation
The ligations were transformed into DH5alpha. Additionally, K238013 (from23-08-2011) was transformed into DH5alpha. The ligation of K238013 with lacZ is plated onto Amp and Cm, rbs with T7pol is plated onto Amp, T7Prom with lacZ onto Kan and K238013 is plated onto Amp and Cm.
Testing
The two cultures of K322127 in DH5alpha incubated over night with red light (ca. 630 nm) were split. One half was further incubated with red light, while the other half was incubated with sun light and  light from a table-lamp over night.
Test of negative controls on S-Gal: T7prom (Kan) transformed into DH5alpha and K322127 (Cm) transformed into BL21 were inoculated onto S-Gal plates with the respective antibiotics. The are incubated over night, and should not yield black colonies, as they both should not be able to express functional lacZ.
Results
Expression test of reporter plasmid: The cultures with ligation of T7prom and lacZ transformed into BL21 and induced with IPTG showed black colonies on the S-Gal plates. However, the cultures, which were NOT induced also showed black colonies of the same intensity. At the current point, we cannot sufficiently explain this.
Red light sensor assembly (Bea and Thorsten)
aim:
Ligation of red light sensor didn't work, yet. Therefore we ligated PCR product of BBa_K322127(X and P cut) into pSB3C5(S and P cut) to verify correct sites. Subsequent amplification and recutting of this part should lead to correct ligation with SupD.
In parallel, PCR was performed again in case of failed ligations with existent PCR-products.

Phyllis Fehr
— July 12th, 2018; Alzheimer Society of Canada (Community stakeholder)
We had the amazing opportunity of speaking to and learning from Phyllis Fehr. Phyllis was able to tell us about her experiences with lewy-body dementia and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. When she was referred to a neurologist, Phyllis was told to bring a family member to the follow-up appointment. She brought her husband to the second appointment and upon walking in the door, the neurologist spoke only to her husband. Throughout the entire appointment, including the diagnosis, Phyllis was ignored and made to feel as though she didn’t exist. At that point, Phyllis argues that she was “prescribed disengagement”. This was a phrase that came up often in our discussion with her, and she uses it to demonstrate that when someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, they are told that they cannot do the same things that they used to do, and that they should essentially give up. By telling patient this, Phyllis believes that it causes them to withdraw from activities and society, which only fuels the progression of the disease. This was understandably frustrating for Phyllis, who feels as though people with Alzheimer’s should be encouraged to remain active in their community and to keep doing things that they enjoy. She argues that we need to stop labelling these individuals as disabled and start seeing them for the individuals that they are, who still have things to offer.
Dr. Paul Fraser
— July 13th, 2018; Tanz Centre, University of Toronto (Research stakeholder)
Dr. Fraser believes that current communication between researchers and the public is sufficient. He also described the difficulties that the research community has faced in finding a cause for Alzheimer's disease - if it is even possible to isolate a single cause. Dr. Fraser echoed what we have heard from other stakeholders; unfortunately, research into Alzheimer's disease was side-tracked by the amyloid-B hypothesis, which is now being questioned regarding its relation to the disease. More specifically, misfolding of amyloid-beta causes it to fold into fibrous structures known as neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles directly interfere with normal brain functioning and eventually lead to Alzheimer’s Disease. Contrary to our first hypothesis where the amyloid beta directly causes AD, the misfolded protein instead causes a chain of events to occur -- and only at the end of these events would a person develop AD."

iGEM UPO Sevilla Collaboration
From our modelling and computational work came the wonderful opportunity to colaborate with another iGem team, UPOSevilla.  Both teams were working on metabolic analysis, and had developed a tool to facilitate analysis of complex enzymatic pathways. However, our two aproaches were quite diferent. Sevilla’s team focused on velocity and straight-forwardness with a C script that took the input as text files and displayed the output as another text file, a log of the different concentrations of the different compounds over time. Visualitzation or post-processing of the data was left to the user, which made the program more modular, albeit less user friendly. Our approach, Polyenzime, was a bit widder in scope, incorporating inhibition reactions and source/sink nodes, and consisted on a GUI where the user could intuitively create and run the pathways, obtaining the evolution of the system in handy graphics without further ado.
Comparing the two prespectives on the same problem gave us the opportunity to further develop our approach, strengthing its downsides (implementation of a runge-kuta algorithm to make the integration more robust), and reinforcing the advantages (improving the user experience in a variety of ways). We could also interchange valuable feedback that lead to some bug-fixes and improvements. This would not have been possible without intensive comunication between the teams, and we thank the collegues at Sevilla for the patience and support trough our programming endavours.
With the wide array of topics iGEM comprises, finding another team with a common front to collaborate with may be difficult. We were lucky to have that opportunity, and we belive that the project has improved and gained context as a consequence.
In the image we can see a model of UPO-Sevilla’s team represented in our software.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Express_-_-_TEXT.html,"PCR). EP-PCR involves the addition of Mn2+, which increases the error rate of Taq DNA polymerase. This creates random mutations within the region defined by the primers, the number of which can be controlled by the number of doublings.
For shorter sequences (<100bp), chemical synthesis of the sequences is preferred. However, in our case, we were unable to use this for two reasons: firstly, amilCP, at 669bp, is too large to be chemically synthesised. Secondly, we were looking for random mutations rather than targeted mutations, as it was unknown what mutations would be needed to create different colour mutants.
A high throughput method is also needed to screen the large number of mutants produced by EP-PCR.  In our case, this involved scoring the colonies that had been transformed with the EP-PCR products based on colour. Mutants that appeared to be dark blue in colour, as well as other coloured mutants, such as purple and pink, were then selected for sequencing.
The concentration of Mn2+ plays a large role in the mutation rate. 0.1mM MnCl2 was the optimum concentration for the EP-PCR, as it resulted in roughly half the colonies remaining blue after being transformed, while the other half were white or other colours. It was found that the use of concentrations above 0.6mM MnCl2 resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of product (Figure 1). This was likely because at such concentrations the Mn2+ had decreased the fidelity of Taq to the point that it was unable to continue amplifying along the entire sequence.
Figure 1. Increasing concentrations of MnCl2 decreases the amount of amilCP product. Products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel in 1X TAE at 100V for 1h, and post stained in Gel Green for 1h.
                                                                       
Results: Number of Mutants
Following transformation, the colours of the colonies on the plates were scored and counted to assess the EP-PCR efficiency. Using 0.1mM of Mn2+, the majority of colonies (55%) were white, indicating that the amilCP coding region had experienced loss of function mutations. Subsequent sequencing indicated that these were most deletions resulting in frameshifts. A large proportion of colonies (34%) were scored as ‘blue’, indicating that they were of a similar shade to the wild type. A small number of mutants appeared to be darker blue or purple/pink (1.5% and 1."

Enzyme Kinetics and Diffusion
Why Make a Mathematical Model?
Previous experiments involving enzyme scaffolding have shown various yields, ranging from fractional improvement to 77-fold increases in product titre 2,7. The exact improvements on reaction efficiency made via scaffolding enzymes vary across experiments. Notably, different scaffolds, enzymes, and substrates may result in significantly different yields 2. We are employing the enzymes used in Indole Acetic Acid synthesis in our system, utilizing their kinetic parameters to dictate the model. Additionally we model the taxol synthesis pathway as it is a potential commercial application of our scaffold. We consider the diffusion of the intermediary substrate when the enzymes are placed various distances apart. We believe the model was able to assist in our understanding of how scaffolding enzymes can alter reaction efficiency.
Aim of Modeling
We aimed to model the effect of distance between enzymes on reaction efficiency, hypothesizing that co-localising enzymes would increase reaction efficiency by decreasing intermediary loss to diffusion. Under this model, we assumed that intermediary loss to diffusion is significant enough to limit rates of product formation. We further aimed to incorporate the specific kinetics of enzymes in our system, and create an adaptable model that could generate data for other enzyme reaction pathways.
Boundary Conditions
To define the scope of the model, some initial boundary conditions were required. The boundary conditions are as follows, with justification following:
The first enzyme produces the second substrate at a constant rate.
The enzymes are some distance 0 < R < ∞ apart (they are not touching, nor are they infinitely far apart).
The rate of production of the final product is dependent on the concentration of the second substrate that diffuses to enzyme B.
The enzymes are not points, but rather small spheres given the size of the enzymes relative to the distance between them.
The reactant can escape to infinity.
Condition (1) creates a linear diffusion gradient for the second substrate’s diffusion to enzyme B. This follows Fick’s Law of diffusion 4. In order to meet this condition the concentration of the first substrate must be"
