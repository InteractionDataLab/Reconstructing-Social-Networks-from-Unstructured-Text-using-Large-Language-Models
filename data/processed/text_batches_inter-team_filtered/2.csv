Overview
still needs work
The goal of the Large Phage Project is to make a mutant phage that has a capsid much larger than the normal ~200nm T4 capsid. Our intent is to create a protocol where large phage with stable phenotypes will form making it possible to ""pick a size"" when using phage as a delivery system. The impact of these large phage could mean the difference in making a drug treatment effective and efficient.
Through the use of our mutagen 5'bromodeoxyuridine, a good mutagenesis protocol and the use of a sensitive cesium chloride gradient. We were able to mutagenize and isolate giant mutant t4 phage.

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#Experiment-LB media preperation (500mL;25 plates)_-_-_TEXT.html," a circular motion to distribume the media evenly on the plate.
If you pour too much LB, you will only be able to produce <25 plates. If you don't pour enough media, it may minimize bacterial growth.
After pouring, set the plates to cool in stacks of 4-5, as this takes up less space. Dont stack plates too high - we want to minimize the risk of spills.
Rinse the pyrex bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.
Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified. Flip the plates to prevent condensation forming on the agar. The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags (ideally re-use the plastic bags that the plates came in.)
The LB agar plates should be stored in a 4oC freezer, should be good for 1-2 months.
Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
- Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual. - Wipe down your workspace. - Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

Figure 4: Construction of Biobricks.
Targeting to the Sphereactor
Once the empty BMC is expressed and characterised, we would like to take the project in a number of different directions, as we feel the microcompartment has broad potential. One issue which was addressed early on was how other proteins could be localised to the interior of the BMC. For example, if the BMC was to be utilised as a microbial factory to manufacture a useful product, how could enzymes and substrate molecules be directed into the empty microcompartment? Studies of the Pdu operon have shown that some proteins, such as PduD, are recruited to the interior of the BMC with the help of an N-terminal signal sequence. Targeting of other proteins to the inside of the microcompartment can be achieved by incorporation of this N-terminal sequence into the N-terminus of the target protein7. We aim to construct biobricks of two PduD N-terminal sequences: The first, PduD40, will encode 40 amino acids from PduD’s N-terminus, and the second, Pdu20, will code for only the first 20 amino acids.
PduD20: MEINEKLLRQIIEDVLRDMK
PduD40: MEINEKLLRQIIEDVLRDMKGSDKPVSFNAPAASTAPQTA
Individually fusing PduD20 and PduD40 to a reporter gene, for example GFP, will hopefully allow us to show whether the essential sequence for targeting proteins to the microcompartment is in the first 20 amino acids or the first 40 amino acids.
Figure 5: PduD signal sequence.
Packing the Sphereactor
One idea we would like to explore is that of making the compartments magnetic by targeting iron-rich proteins into them. This would allow us to collect the bacteria and/or compartments using a magnet after they have carried out their task, which could be a very useful attribute (e.g. in bioremediation).  Ferritin is a large globular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled manner; HybA is another such protein. By fusing the PduD targeting sequence to Ferritin and HybA we will hopefully succeed in packing the BMC with the iron-rich proteins,"

Abstract
We produced poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] as a substrate to fold biOrigami. P(3HB) is a biopolymer with thermoplastic properties, meaning that it contracts in heat. Unlike polystyrene, P(3HB) is biodegradable. Building on previous iGEM teams’ work on P(3HB), we have contributed BioBricks that increase P(3HB) production and facilitate its extraction from Escherichia coli, and have processed the polymer into useful sheets.  See our biobricks here:
See our BioBricks
Introduction and Background
We are using recombinant E. coli to produce P(3HB) for folding biOrigami.
Since plastics on earth have deleterious environmental impacts, we wanted to focus on producing one biodegradable plastic that could be synthesized for use on the moon or on Mars.
P(3HB) is the most common polyhydroxyalkanoate, which is a group of fully biodegradable polymers with properties similar to those of petroleum-based plastics. It can be produced in a variety of microorganisms, and its synthesis as a compound for energy storage in vivo has been extensively studied [1]. P(3HB) accumulates inside cells, and has been reported to occupy up to 90% (w/w) of the dry cell mass in certain species [2]. However, P(3HB) has yet to become integrated into the plastics market on Earth due to high costs of both fermentation and purification [3]. This summer, we focused on making the production, extraction, and use of P(3HB) more feasible on a lunar or Martian base. The main project was increasing P(3HB) yield; preliminary data was obtained for"

Besides waiting for the lab computer to process 22GB of RAM, I take pride in eating well, exercising regularly, sleeping in, and picking flowers for my Mom. I two-strap my backpack, have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, technology, and medicine, and love anything with an engine to the point that I consider myself obsessed.
Su Wang
Chemical Engineering (4th Year)
I am a chemical engineering student with a specialization in biomedical engineering. Prior to join iGEM I have been doing researches in chemical engineering labs for thermodynamics or in-situ oil upgrading. Those were professor-driven research projects where even though I had good experiences, there was little I could do to test my own hypothesis. That's why I came for iGEM; for the student driven research aspect. Here I wish to combine with what I have learned from system biology class, with my training in modelling, to work on things that interest me!
Sharon Feng
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This summer was my first year being involved in iGEM and a wet lab setting. I was fortunate to be a member of the TALEs team where I have learned so much about synthetic biology, bacterial genetics, and general lab practices. Last year, I was involved with clinical studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease at the Alberta Children's Hospital. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.
Amanda Zucoloto
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year on iGEM and I have been working with TALEs, which involved alternative cloning strategies and lots of fun time doing protein work over the Summer. When I am not pippeting in the lab to the sound of Backstreet Boys, I spend my time working out, exploring Canada and catching up with family and friends who are all the way back in Brazil. Even though I still have a couple months here in Calgary, I can't wait to come back as a graduate student!
Julie Osgood
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM and I have spent my summer focusing on the TALE aspect of our project. I devoted my time to designing the E. coli target sequences and putting together our TALE constructs. When I’m not redoing all my experiments that didn’t work, I enjoy dancing, reading, and watching Battestar Galactica. I have spent my past couple summers working in research labs, but I loved having the opportunity to join a student driven research team."

Open seminar
One of the purposes of synthetic biology is to interact with the public and make an effort to think of the solution for social problem in these days. In order to accomplish the objective, we tried to provide a chance to the public to be familiar with synthetic biology, although the field is promising that as technology develops, awareness is relatively very low even to the bio-undergraduates. This year we had an open seminar targeting undergraduates in Korea regardless of majors. Throughout the seminar, we looked over from its history to applied cases to help participants deeply understand synthetic biology.
At the beginning, we illustrated the concepts of synthetic biology. First, we explained the idea of standardization and modularization, the most important and fundamental concepts of synthetic biology. The explanation of synthetic biology is followed by a presentation about iGEM competition. To help participants understand this area, the history of genetic engineering and synthetic biology and some examples of its study results were briefly descripted. After the introduction, we had illustrated some detailed parts of synthetic biology; diagnostics and environment part.
In diagnostics, we discussed detecting method for screening toxicity using synthetic biology regardless of the kind of toxins. In the aspects of disease control, early diagnosis is vital issue for the field of the preservation of health because invention of easier and cheaper diagnosis methods enables official health services to prevent and reduce deaths from certain diseases before patients suffer for deteriorated pains. To improve this area, synthetic biologists made microbeads containing different sorts of recombinant luminescent bacterium, which express unique luminescence when each of the bacterium detects specific toxins. This method has huge advantage in a respect of having the capacity to test whether someone has several diseases at the same time. Moreover, it can be used for other area like examination of water. This relates with the environmental application part.
In environment, synthetic biology was applied to making biofuels, sensing pollutants, and refining contamination. Biofuel is renewable energy (such as ethanol, diesel oil etc.) produced by using eco-friendly biomass such as sugarcanes, CAM plant, whey and even waste sulfite liquors. The process of manufacturing biofuels goes on by culturing recombinant strains like yeast with these biomasses. And the recombinant microbes can be used not only for prevention and detection of a pollution, but for purification of polluted spaces by a series of designed mechanisms which metabolizes pollutants to another harmless substances.
Last but not least, we suggested the outlook of synthetic biology in a developmental and ethical aspects. The way to develop synthetic biology can be told it is on an extension of its history"

Collaboration
The emphasis that iGEM places on collaboration allowed us to improve our project and connect with other young scientists. We appreciated the opportunities this provided us and understand that it is a reflection of how the scientific process works in the real world. Over the course of the summer, we collaborated with four different teams: Missouri S&T, WashU/Penn State, The University of Virginia, and the University of Georgia. As this was our first year as an iGEM team, we also received assistance from the WashU/Penn State team, who quickly became our good friends and mentor team.
In July, we attended the Heartland Synthetic Biology Meetup, hosted by Missouri S&T. We helped Missouri S&T and Washington University host a public forum discussion on synthetic biology and host an educational event for children.
Our collaboration with the Virginia iGEM team consisted of us assisting them with a survey about biocontainment. This survey will be used to create a pamphlet for future iGEM teams that provides them with information about biocontainment and help make informed decisions in order to improve their practices. Improved biocontainment also serves the dual purpose of inspiring more trust from the public. The team created a badge that is now proudly displayed at the bottom of this webpage.
Finally, we helped to characterize the expression of an mCherry gene from the University of Georgia iGEM team. They sent us cells that had already been prepared to express the gene and we used our plate reader to take measurements of the fluorescence of their cells. This was all part of a larger multi-team collaboration effort meant to gather measurements from multiple sources in order to standardize their results.
Additionally, the Washington University St. Louis / Penn State iGEM Team  provided us with water samples. We plan to use these samples to test base nitrate levels and to potentially simulate a real-world environment for the testing of our system. They also provided us numerous contacts for potential sponsorship and mentored us throughout the summer. Our teams had similar project backgrounds, and so we were able to discuss our results and exchange ideas.

Basic fermentation
Our basic fermentation part derives from our local environmental problem, the outbreak of Enteromorpha along the coastline in Qingdao, so it is natural that we would eventually go back to the origin and try to solve the real world problem after validation of design concept in the lab. We aim to make use of Enteromorpha residue, where there is no trehalose left because it is easiest to extract. Therefore, all we need to do is to deal with the cellulose and hemicellulose left in the residue.
We do treat our Enteromorpha powder with enzymes first and yeast later.(the Enteromorpha powder serves as the stimulation of Enteromorpha residue in real-world situation) The successful survival of the recombinant yeast strains that can use either xylose or cellubiose as the only carbon source can fully prove the feasibility of our designed pathway.
Along with the proof of our concept, we validate the upstream pathway from real algae powder, which has exactly the same constituent as Enteromorpha residue, and we can say that our idea can apply to real-world problems!
Enteromorpha pretreatment
We treat the Enteromorpha powder (residue) with 0.2% H2O2 to remove the lignin then cellulase and xylanase to produce xylose & cellubiose.
Figure 1.1 Enteromorpha Powder
Figure 1.2 Treat the residue with 0.2% H2O2.
Figure 1.3 Enzymatic hydrolysis solution of Enteromorpha fiber
Pretreatment validation
After that we detect the existence of xylose & cellubiose with HPLC. The peak appears at the same point, suggesting that they are the same substance. In other words, we successfully proved that the downstream product of Enteromorpha powder after pretreatment contains mainly xylose and cellubiose.

Now, it's time to introduce why we need to package CACCI.
Because CACCI has been engineered in an integrated way, it contains both chemotaxis improvement and permeability modification. If you want to construct CACCI with strategy II, it requires one more plasmid in CACCI, which is obviously quite difficult for other iGEM team to extract plasmids from parts and transform them again. Consequently, we USTC decided to package our CACCI and share to everyone who need them.
Mechanism of packaging CACCI is quite simple, we firstly culture CACCI in LB liquid medium. (Attention: the LB liquid medium should contain glycerol which is used for cryopreservation. When bacteria grow in exponential phase. Get CACCI and culture them in skim milk containing sodium chloride. And we preserve those CACCI in refrigerator at minus 80 degree celcius for about 8 hours. Then put the CACCI into vacuum dryer, we would get CACCI in powder, ready for your recovery.
More details on how to package CACCI please visit: Protocol-Package your CACCI . See our results at Achievements-Package your CACCI

What's SPRING ?
Spring, which is named after its inventor, is CACCI's sidekick. He helps CACCI in three                                 aspects, which are the optical aspect, the hardware aspect and the software aspect.                                 Using Michelson Interferometer, the optical part, Spring transforms the shape change of                                 CACCI's membrane into the change of interference fringe. Spring's hardware, based on                                 Raspberry–Pi, allows spring to take photos or videos of the fringe. At last, the                                 software analyses them and transmits the results to PC. CACCI depends on Spring.
Actually, SPRING is a measurement system which is designed to detect antibiotics in                                 natural water bodies."

Collaborations with BNU-China team
It's essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it. 
Moreover, BNU- China team wanted to detect paclitaxel by utilizing microtubule which expressed in E. Coli. Microtubule is assembled by α-subunit and β-subunit in eukaryotes. But E. Coli is a genus of prokaryote. So it is essential to justify whether microtubule assembled successfully or not in E. Coli. If microtubule assembled successfully, α-subunit and β-subunit will have interaction in E. Coli. To prove it, we used Co-Immunoprecipitation (CoIp) to confirm their interaction. If you are interested in the details, you can visit this link:

To provide a positive control, the CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted downstream and in frame with the CDS of the MLS in the commercial plasmid pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). Our negative control construct was the same as our experimental construct, but minus the MLS CDS. ( BBa_K1119008 ).
The detailed protocols employed for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Cell Culture and Transfection
The three constructs were transfected separately into different batches of HEK293FT cells. The protocol for culturing HEK293FT cells was based on American Type Culture Collection resources. The culture medium used was DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For the transfection, we followed the general procedure outlined by Invitrogen LipofectamineTM 2000. Serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM was used to form DNA-lipofectamine complexes.
Stain with MitoTracker® Dye
In order to test the efficiency of MLS, we need to identify the location of mitochondria. Therefore, rosamine-based MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA), a red-fluorescent dye, was used to stain the mitochondria in live cells. It can accumulate due to the membrane potential of mitochondria. According to the manual, this dye can be well resolved from the green fluorescence of other probes so it won’t affect the observation of the expression of green fluorescence protein. The protocol we used for staining is from MitoTracker® Mitochondrion-Selective Probes. The working concentration of staining solution made was 0.2μM and the incubation time after staining was 15 minutes.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Since the EGFP, GFP and MitoTracker® Red CMXRos can all be observed under fluorescent microscope, we did fluorescent microscopy in order to obtain results. We observed the transfected cells under confocal microscope.
Data Processing
To quantify the amount of signal overlapped between the GFP signal and the MitoTracker® dye, we adopted the method described by A.P. French et al. in “Colocalization of fluorescent markers in confocal microscope images of plant cells” (French et al., 2008). With the use of the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin for ImageJ image processing, scatter plots of the green intensities (y-axis) and red intensities"

Discussion
Due to some restrictions in wetlab, we only finished the above-mentioned experiment. We found that the number of Hela cells who possesses high copy number is   comparatively low. We also noticed the circuit C’s output is higher than expected in Figure 1.This may cause wrong judge when use the design to detect miR-21. Some measures will be taken to solve this question. Besides, we are going to endeavor to construct the other networks mentioned in modeling work.

Introduction of MoDeL based Automatic Modeling Algorithm
Development of Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) aims to provide a platform that enables separation of work between modeling and data constructing. Users could obtain dynamic behaviors of various quantities and other properties of a biological system as the output of iGame while they know nothing about details of modeling and the reaction network. Previous modeling and simulation tools require users to construct the network themselves, which is very hard even for professional researchers. iGame has no such requirements and users are only required to input data about the initial environmental condition of system. Hence, modeling is a task that is performed to find all reactions and species in the system.
To complete the final network from initial environment conditions, we first break up the task to several parts:
(1) Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file.
(2) Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species.
(3) For each template species we found, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both.
(4) For each template reaction found, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction.
(5) For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
(6) Go to step 2 until the end of the species list.
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require"

Thus, presentations about the principles, current applications and perspectives of these fields were given. In order to paint the whole picture, we made sure to inform the scholars about the possible risks, ethical issues and other difficulties that scientists face. The team members discussed with the children common fears related to GMOs and other concerns that the children had about genetic modification. Moreover, as students were very eager to learn more about this year's idea, team members introduced them with the basic concepts of SynORI.
After the lessons the students approached us with various questions in groups or individually. This clearly demonstrated that we successfully managed to excite them with the rapidly developing field of synthetic biology and encouraged to take part in science more actively, possibly, even joining iGEM in the future.
Biotech Sessions
Several major events for scholars to gain in-depth knowledge about various scientific fields take place annually in Lithuania. This year our team hosted national biotech sessions. Extensive lectures on the principles of synbio, as well as discussions about bioethics and biosafety were held. During the workshops students extracted DNA from fruit, learned pipetting and even used CRISPR-Cas9 system.
""Student For One Day"" and ""Students for scholars, scholars for students""
""Student For One Day"" and ""Students for scholars, scholars for students"" are annual events, that invite high school students to experience advanced learning by attending various lectures and workshops at the Vilnius University.
During these events our team members organised workshops, where school students were introduced to the structure of DNA, gene technology and synthetic biology. Not only did we provide the scholars with deeper perception of DNA, but they were also able to extract and precipitate it.
Participants demonstrated great interest in life sciences and the creation of new organisms with desired features. Being responsible scientists and participants of the iGEM competition, we brought this discussion further by acquainting the school children with bioethical issues and addressing possible outcomes and the impact of GMOs on the environment.
This was a part of our face-to-face interactions with highly motivated students, and we received valuable insights which helped us to improve our future educational activities.
National Student Academy (NSA)
NSA is a unique institution of supplementary education intended for gifted children. The Academy aims to strengthen intellectual potential of Lithuania by organising various sessions with the best lecturers and professionals from Lithuania and other countries.

Image 4 shows the manner in which the comb should be inserted into the electrophoresis tray - the groove near the edge of the tray should be used. This edge is where the DNA will be placed into the formed wells.

Image 5: Bottle of Ethidium Bromide
Image 6: Pouring the 0.8%agarose gel plus ethidium bromide into the tray
Image 7: This is what the prepared tray should look like once the gel has been left to set - apply lid immediately after adding buffer and gel!
Place the buffer into the electrophoresis apparatus first (which should be the 1x TAE). Place lid over tray.
When the gel is cool enough but still in liquid form, pour it into a flask (up to 100ml) and to it add 8 microlitres of ethidium bromide. After that, place the 100ml of agarose gel (which should still be in complete liquid form) plus ethidium bromide into the tray, making sure the comb is still in the tray. Make sure that there are no bubbles in the solution – use a pipette end to remove bubbles.
After 10 minutes, check to see whether the gel has set (don’t disturb the gel near the comb end – this is where the DNA will be inserted)
It may be an idea to get the DNA samples prepared whilst waiting for the gel to set – this can be seen in section 5 – “Preparing the DNA samples”
When the gel has set completely, transfer the tray to the electrophoresis apparatus and remove the comb gently – a series of wells should be created. Place lid on tray once completed
Image 5 shows what the bottle of ethidium bromide looks like. Use with care and remember to dispose of gloves before walking around lab and after finishing using the ethidium bromide!
Image 6 shows the buffer solution + ethidium bromide being added to the tray. The gel should be added afterwards. Notice the comb has been placed in first before the solution is added.
Image 7 shows what we mean by the lid of the electrophoresis tray. It should be placed over the electrophoresis machine as soon as the buffers and the gels have been applied.

Synthetic Biology Introduction
Fig 1. An iGEMer is introducing synthetic biology to students
Our team members went to high schools to introduce the concept of synthetic biology and popularize our project. We were fascinated by their curiosity and passionate feedback which inspired us to finish our project.
We gave a seminar to students of “Innovate Class” in No 2 High school attached to ECNU. Although the students never heard of synthetic biology, they understood the concept quickly, and generated fantastic ideas using synthetic biology. The philosophy of our Magic Blocks brings infinite possibilities to them whose curiosity never get satisfied.
Another activity has taken place in the High School attached to Fudan University, where we gave another seminar on modern synthetic biology to senior students. Most of them never thought of get things done in synthetic biology before, and our project in lowering the barrier for the public to participate synthetic biology kindled their interest. We got a lot of questions even after the seminar.

Overview
Background
Nitrogen takes up almost 4/5 in earth’s atmosphere, but it cannot be assimilated the similar way plants fix carbon dioxide. Plant productivity has thus been largely circumscribed, which is among major concerns in contemporary agriculture. To ensure plants' growth, chemical nitrogen fertilizers are widely applied with the advances in ammonia synthesis technology. The industrial chemical reduction of nitrogen is considerably energy-consuming, while also leading to greenhouse emissions, and widespread eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. (Rogers & Oldroyd, 2014) Moreover, applying nitrogen fertilizer, such as carbamide, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate will also destablize the soil micro-structure, and make it hard to sow. (Alvarez, 2005) Chemical fertilizers abuse would eventually lead to low agricultural productivity and malnutrition. (Rogers & Oldroyd, 2014) Biological fixation of nitrogen, on the other hand, is free of above drawbacks, and is a promising eco-friendly way to replace the traditional industrial chemical method.
Azotobacter, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, plays an important role in symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  Some archaea can also fix nitrogen, but they contribute little to overall global biological nitrogen fixation. Therefore, most of the research works are focusing on azotobacter, and can be further divided into three sub-areas (Shen & Jing, 2003): the study of factors affecting fixation efficiency, the study to enlarge azotobacter’s symbiosis range, and the study of azotase. Here, our Prometheus program aims to improve the fixation efficiency.
Metals are key elements of all living organisms, including bacteria and plants (Silava & Williams, 1991) and they are integral parts of 30-50% of a typical cell (Waldrom & Robinson, 2009). Metal, such as Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni involves"

Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

All of the methods provide similar levels of accuracy (depending on the size of the compartments used in the Gillespie model) and so we choose based on the simplicity of implementation. The random walk method is generally the fastest and easiest to code, so we choose this one.

Since we are modelling diffusion in the catheter, the topology of the system is a ring, neglecting edge effects of the cylinder our bacteria will be placed in. To do this we use a random walk model in two dimensions. We confine our particles to a ring of a fixed radius and initially coat the ring with particles.
Modeling Tutorial
Deterministic
Our goal is to model a system of reactions such as the reversible reaction
\[A \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{k_{+}}}_{\mathrm{k_{-}}}} B\]
Where \(A\) and \(B\) are our two species and \(k_{+}\) and \(k_{-}\) will be determined shortly. To do this, we make the intuitive assumption that the rate at which something reacts is proportional to how much of it we've got. That is, the rate of change of \(B\) with time is
\[\dfrac{dB}{dt}=k_{+}A\]
where \(k_{+}\) is simply a proportionality constant. This assumption is called the law of mass action. This of course is not the complete picture, as we forgot to include the fact that \(B\) can react back to form \(A\). So the complete system of equations to solve is
\[\dfrac{dA}{dt}=k_{-}B-k_{+}A\]                             \[\dfrac{dB}{dt}=k_{+}A-k_{-}B\]
At this point, you can type these into your favourite computing program and solve them.
Stochastic
The simplest way to add an element of 'randomness' into an equation is to add a random term into the differential equation. This turns it into a stochastic differential equation, such as:
\[\dfrac{dx}{dt}=c+r\]
which determines the evolution of a particle travelling at a speed \(c\), with a random number \(r\) added into the mix just for fun. We choose \(r\) to be normally distributed with a mean value of 0 and a variance of, say, 1. We"

iGEM Meetup in Marburg
Getting to know Marburg and its iGEM Team
At the beginning of August, for the second year in a row the iGEM Team Marburg invited other European iGEM Teams to meet up in their lovely town. Gladly three members of our team accepted the invitation. After all the lab work for the day was done, we rode north and arrived at our campsite in Marburg in the evening hours.
The plan for the first night was getting to know each other and the city during a pub crawl while working through a task list. Finding landmarks and enjoying local specialties were among the challenges. The atmosphere and people were great, and Marburg's old town was simply gorgeous. We learned a lot about the members of the other groups and their projects.
Socializing luckily is an important part of iGEM
Learning and having fun with others goes well together.
After not quite enough sleep the whole meetup went to a university building, where each group held a presentation to introduce their projects. We were astounded by the ingenuity behind some of the projects. Traci Haddock-Angelli from iGEM-Headquarters also held a presentation, and it was fascinating to get a deeper insight into the organization behind iGEM.

After the work had been done, we set out to a park to have an excellent barbecue and play a round of bubble soccer. For everyone who doesn't know what bubble soccer is, just google it, you won't be disappointed.
Steak and Bratwurst after a concussive round of bubble soccer
In the second night, Team Marburg had rented a club where we partied and danced until dawn. The following day, after a hearty breakfast and lunch we rode home with a whole new set of ideas after we learned a lot and made plenty of new friends."
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html,",1-dicarboxylic acid, and benzo[b]thiophene-3-acetic acid. A mini-prep was completed on the overnight cultures prepared earlier in the week, according to protocol obtained from the wiki. The DNA concentration in the resulting samples was measured by nanodrop to confirm successful plasmid extraction, and the resulting DNA concentrations were as follows:
Tube 1: 44.9 ng/mL
Tube 2: 54.2 ng/mL
Tube 3: 54.4 ng/mL
Tube 4: 41.6 ng/mL
Tube 5: 34.3 ng/mL
Because tube 3 (prepared from Colony 3, Plate 3) had the highest concentration, it was to be used for the eventual sequencing of the plasmid. The restriction digest was completed also, but it was not run on a gel this week; this was left for Week 5.
Week 5 (May 28 - June 1)
On Tuesday (May 29), a gel was run on the restriction digests of the extracted plasmids from Week 4, which appeared to confirm the successful transformation of the PetroBrick , showing clear bands at the pertinent locations. The gel is as follows:
Lane 1 contained the 1 kb plus ladder, while lanes 2-6 contained the restriction digest results, which had used the five different miniprep tubes with plasmids isolated from five different colonies. As can be observed in the gel, the upper row of bands corresponds to 2392bp, indicating the PetroBrick part. The lower set of bands corresponds to the PetroBrick pSB1C3 vector at 2070 bp.
These results suggest that the PetroBrick plasmid had been successfully purified. The black circle indicates undigested plasmid in lane 3. There simply means that not all of the plasmid was digested into two separate DNA strands. It indicates the entire size of our PetroBrick plasmid.
Based on the apparent success of the gel, the products were sent away for sequencing. Long-term stocks were prepared for the alkane production medium outlined in University of Washington's PetroBrick protocols from 2011 (see https://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/alkanebiosynthesis). These stocks are as follows:
1 L of 1M Tris (pH = 7.25)
10 mL of 1 mg/mL Thiamine
10 mL of 10% Triton x-100

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample."
Exeter,2014,Team:Exeter#iLOVCharacterisation_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 ms scans each taken as a fraction of the first. The measuring conditions of the scans was repeated from the detailed scans used in the previous section. This was done to expose the cause of the striation seen in the results. It is clear to see that the fluorescence drops after the first scan then remains constant between the second and third scan. This drop is caused by photo-bleaching of the iLOV protein.
The rate of photo-bleaching across the scans is constant. This is shown by the slope of the trend lines being close to zero. It is interesting that there is no drop in fluorescence between scans two and three despite the rate of photo-bleaching during scan two being the same as scan one. The lack of a drop suggests that the rate of photo bleaching during each scan is zero and that any drop in fluorescence occurs after exposure. The absence of a drop between scans two and three also suggests that some maximum bleaching effect is reached.
Figure 5: The fluorescence drops after the first scan. This is the action of photo-bleaching. The second and third scan remain at the same, decreased, fluorescence level despite further exposure.
The 449nm wavelength used for the triplet of scans in figure 5 corresponds to an energy ($E$) of,
\begin{equation} E = \frac{hc}{\lambda e}  = 2.761 [\text{eV}]. \end{equation}
Electron volts (eV) are used in the following section as they are appropriate to the energy scale used in the experiment. For reference molecular bonds have energies of the order 1 to 10 eV.
Figure 6 shows the decrease in fluorescence caused by increasing the photon energy. The figure also shows fluorescence loss for the same energy photons at a higher exposure time. The TECAN plate reader was capable of emitting photons at a maximum energy of 5.39 electron volts . At this maximal energy the decrease in fluorescence is minimal compared to the decrease that could be obtained by increasing the exposure time. As the exposure time could be increased over a far greater range it was decided that this should be the variable parameter in the photo-bleaching experiment.
The energy was not changed to the maximum for the photo bleaching experiment as the greatest emission from iLOV was observed at an excitation wavelength of 449nm. The larger emission minimised the error in measurements of the fluorescence decrease.
Figure 6: The decrease in fluorescence caused by increasing photon energy to the maximum available to the TECAN is marginal compared to increasing the exposure time. Keeping the photon"

DAY 1
Inoculate 10 ml of LB+Tet medium with ER2738 in a 125mL Erlenmeyer flask. This culture will be used for titering in Step 8 and can be used in ~3.5 - 4 hours. Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking. Incubate the titering culture until needed.
Remove the piece of fabric/thread from the blocking solution. Wash the fabric rapidly 10 times with TBST 0.1% (TBS + 0.1% [v/v] Tween-20) by dipping the threads in a well from a six-well plate filled with ~8mL TBST per well and going back and forth through the washing solution. Alternatively beackers can be used in place of six well plate.
Dilute a 25-fold representation of the library (e.g., 2 x 10 11 phage for a library with 2 x 10 9 clones) with 250µl of TBST (therefore add 10µL of phage library). Place the piece of fabric/thread in the Eppendorf tube containing the library and rock gently for 60 minutes at room temperature.
Inoculate 20mL of LB medium in a 250mL Erlenmeyer flask just before the end of the incubation period of the fabric in the phage library solution. Incubate at 37°C with vigorous shaking. This culture will be used to amplify the eluted phages.
Remove piece of fabric/thread from the Eppendorf tube.
Wash fabric 20 times with TBST as in step 2.
Elute bound phage with 1 ml of an ap¬propriate elution buffer for the interaction being studied. A general buffer for nonspecific disruption of binding interactions is 0.2 M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.2), 1 mg/ml BSA. Rock gently for 15 minutes. Discard the piece of fabric.

PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENCE FESTIVALS
We made presentations for the wider public as well. Wanting to interact with youth interested in  science, we arranged to present ourselves and iGEM at science festivals.  We spend a day at a booth at ZOTKA's talents science festival. ZOTKS (Association for Technical  Culture of Slovenia) is a society that organizes a research competition for high school and elementary  school children every year. After submitting their research, the finalists are honored and given their  awards at ZOTKA's talents, where they also present their research. Other societies and people with  interesting research to show are invited as well, and the event attracts many visitors: finalists, other  competitors, their families, important researchers, members of Association for Technical Culture and  politicians. We were glad to be able to present our work and the whole field of synthetic biology to  many aspiring young scientists.
Slika 7: Our presentation at Sciencetival
We decided to present our project to children as well, and were fortunate enough to be able to make  a presentation at another science festival aimed at younger children and their parents. Hiša  eksperimentov (The House of Experiments) is a museum trying to appeal science to kids. The  museum is full of fun experiments (giant bubbles, a bed of nails, dancing non-Newtonian fluid, visual  tricks etc.) that explain the basic concepts of natural sciences (such as surface tension, the  distribution of forces, electricity, friction…) to young children in an entertaining way. The museum  also has exciting curses, such as ''Eggology'', ''Bubblelogy'' and ''Ice creamology'' to interest children  in science. Every year the museum organizes Znanstival (Sciencetival), a festival of sciences for  families with children, where we presented iGEM and our project as well. We found this presentation  particularly challenging, as the children do not understand more technical concepts of synthetic  biology, but we were able to explain it to them by using metaphors like building a world with legos  and cutting and pasting collages.

Nobody can do the synthesis biology and complete the whole iGEM competition on their own.
We had lots of contact with the other iGEM teams in China and even teams from other countries,     via e-mail, wechat, online confereces
and different meet-ups we attended in this year.
We are glad to mention those friendly iGEMers we met in this year and show co-operation details on this page.
Collaboration with  FJNU-China
We have used the E.coli (DH5α) and Yeast Cen.PK2-1D to help FJNU-China to test the inhibitory effect of PLA (Poly lactic acid) in common growth circumstances with different concentrations. And we would show the broad-spectrum antibacterial performance results in the below. What’s more, the FJNU-China team have provide tube of water             sample from the Fujian province, China, and then, we would test our detection chasis with this samples.
Our two teams often communicate with each other over the summer, during which we exchanged experience and interesting things through chat tools in daily life and establish a good relationship.
Collaboration with  XMU-China
We offered XMU-China the information of our team, including team introduction, project description, etc, which will be recorde on Newsletter edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to communicate and cooperate with the external world.
Collaboration with  NKU_China
We offeredNKU_China our constructive detecting chasis to test the minimal inhibitory concentration , MIC, in different labs. We can get more information about this detecting chasis tolerance through this testing that the detecting chasis can work at a Tc concentration of 0 to 200 ug/ml. And this collaboration results would help us verified the function of the gene tetA,"

However, some small alterations are noticeable, for example, residues Y6, W14, W112 and F246 move towards the bound D-fructose.
Figure 3. Active site of Dpe from A. tumefaciens (PDB: 2HK1). D-Fructose is shown in green, the Mn2+ ion is in purple and all cyan residues are implicated in the D-Fructose stabilization. Pink residues are involved in Mn2+ ion coordination. Finally, white residues are involved in both.
The binding of D-fructose shifts the loops between β4 and α4 and between α1’ and α1. This permits the enclosure of the substrate in the active site. With the concerted action of the D-fructose binding and the loop shift, all the water molecules leave the active site in the ”closed” conformation, even those implicated in Mn2+ ion coordination, which are replaced by O2 and O3 from D-Fructose.
In the Dpe-fructose complex, the O2 and O3 of the sugar are in an eclipsed conformation that mimics the intermediate cis-enediolate of the epimerization reaction. Three residues, E156, H186 and R215 are involved in a putative hydrogen bond with O1 of D-fructose. The Mn2+ ion is within 2,4 Å of the O2 and O3. O2 might be involved in hydrogen bonds with H186 or E244. O3 is also possibly stabilized by interactions with E150 or E244. For O4 there is a possible interaction with E150. O5 had no possible interaction within 4.0 Å. To finish, O6 seems to interact with A107 or I66 with hydrogen bonds to the backbone.
The putative catalytic mechanism of isomerisation involves two glutamate acid residues coordinated with the Mn2+ ion: E150 and E244. One of the two residues removes a proton from C3 to generate a cis-enediolate intermediate, and the second one helps to protonate C3 from the other side, in order to form the epimer. In the case of the epimerization from D-fructose to D-psicose, E244 removes the proton and E150 gives it back.
All this information can be crucial for us to investigate a directed mutagenesis on these residues that interact with fructose or the cofactor to improve the activity of"

Integrated Human Practices
We have organized the “human practices” elements of our research this summer into two categories, which follow from the two spaces in which our technology might be applied: outer space and Earth.
Space Applications: Planetary Protection
We were initially inspired to create a bioballoon for atmospheric research on Mars and other planetary bodies. Planetary scientists need to find ways to feasibly investigate the life history of other planets while still preserving these spaces as pristine environments for future generations of researchers.  We wanted to develop a tool that could help them.
We spoke to several planetary scientists about the profound significance of responsible research on planets like Mars and Venus and on moons like Titan and Europa.  These researchers included Dr. James Head, Louis and Elizabeth Scherck Distinguished Professor of Geological Sciences at Brown University, investigator on several NASA and Russian Space missions, and current co-investigator for the NASA MESSENGER mission to Mercury and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter; Dr. Lynn J. Rothschild, our team PI, evolutionary biologist and astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center, Adjunct Professor at Brown University (Molecular and Cellular Biology and Biochemistry) and at UC Santa Cruz (Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology); Dr. Jill Tarter, Bernard M. Oliver Chair for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California; and Dr. Alan Stern, former chief of all space and Earth science programs (2007-2008), current leader of NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, and current Chief Scientist at World View Enterprises, a company developing high-altitude balloons"

We also got several followers who chose to receive FB notices if we release any new article. Each time we released a new article, you can see that more than 200 FB users will see it within a day. Some undergraduate students even came to us, face to face, to know more . They wanted to start their own iGEM team early, to think of a great project, and recruit their members early. We gave them our best wishes and promised to share our experiences in iGEM competition.
Seeing all these great results, we want our internet platform to be more inspiring for any person who is interested. We start to collect any information about synthetic biology in Taiwan. Recently, we released a notice about symposiums , such  as the 6th IECA Conference 2012: Synthetic Biology with Applications to Biotechnology in National Taiwan university. We want this platform to be a space where all those who are interested in synthetic biology can share and get new information, not only now, but also in the future.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html," Ozonation as a satisfactory solution. Additionally, Jesper Olsson’s statement “With PAC, the pharmaceuticals are not eliminated, they end up in the sludge’’ spotlighted another flaw of Ozonation (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). When the conversation ended up on Activated Carbon the investigators voiced that: “The biggest concern is the production of PAC if we are going to implement both technologies, which is a very energy consuming process. With GAC, a technique similar to the one the drinking water plants use to take away organic pesticides, the cost is much higher’’ (Study visit J Olsson, E Kusoffsky 15 Aug 2018).
Taking into account all the relevant data and information we managed to collect about the existing solutions, we considered useful to create a landscape map in order to synthesize an overview of the field.
Figure 3. Landscape of the existing solutions for treating wastewater from pharmaceuticals in WWTPs.
From the first sight of the landscape map in Figure 3, it is apparent that there is a great need for a new solution that will meet the capabilities of Activated Carbon for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater. In addition, the solution would need to be energy efficient without creating unknown by-products with unknown ecotoxic effects and it would not need to be coupled with another solution in order to sustain low costs.
In support to this conclusion comes the statement from Stefan Berg, SYVAB’s process engineer at Himmelfjärds WWTP during our skype meeting: “Ozonation can be good, but not enough if you have tough restrictions. Although it is very common to have Ozonation followed by PAC or GAC, I would prefer one technique and not a combination’’ (Skype call S Berg 29 Aug 2018).
Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that WWTPs are indeed examining their available options for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater and are susceptible to implement a solution that covers their unmet needs.
Our Solution - Biotic Blue
The bead...
In order to limit the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment we developed Biotic Blue, an enzymatic solution exploiting synthetic biology - based techniques. Diving into the molecular level, Biotic Blue comprises of a mutant oxidoreductase, the laccase enzyme from the polypore mushroom Trametes versicolor, immobilized on magnetic beads. In more detail, our mutant laccase, approximately 55 kDa in size and improved for degrading SMX, differs from the wild-type laccase by three amino acids. The bulky,"

What makes our project a great one is                         not only the project itself, but also the engagement with public issues.
See our story.
Winter Camp
After the Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share their experience                                 of participating in iGEM. With the coming                                 of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire.
To promote the concept of synthetic biology, we invited our instructor Prof.                                 Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competition.                                 Students participated were very eager to ask some questions and share their ideas.                                 Some of them also showed their interest in participating in iGEM next year.
Communication & improvements
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific conference held by                                 team NCKU Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the conference, and all of them made splendid                                 speeches to present their own projects, from which we got to know plenty of exciting ideas.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other three teams: Peking, Jilin_China , UCAS. Through these exchange meetings,                                 we got many useful suggestions to shape our project step by step.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we shared ideas with other teams.                                 Through this process, we all enlarged our horizons and improved our project greatly.                                 At the same time, we realized the importance of communication,                                 which facilitated the beginning of our HP union.
The main goal was that we could not only communicate with other teams more conveniently but also interacted with and got feedback from public easily.
To achieve our goal, we tried to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other teams and introduce teams’ project to the public.
We led the HP union and started the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan, Jilin_China , Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.

Friday June 22nd
Friday was assigned as a weekly meetup day with our entire team and our advisors. We explained where we are at in terms of researching for our project, and they gave us some interesting aspects we can look at. We narrowed our project down to just plastic degradation, as the archaea engineering would be a clear cut contribution to the parts registry, but would not be as interesting to the team as a whole and not a sufficient project to pursue for the entire summer. However, it was suggested that we make a toolkit for parts for archaea so future iGEM teams can pursue constructs in archaea.
Week 2
Monday June 25th
Monday signified the beginning of week two for iGEM! The day was mainly composed of reading papers and looking into ways to which we could degrade plastic. We also scheduled a visit to a local landfill, with an intent to see how the landfill deals with plastics and other synthetic polymers. The toolkit idea was also considered a secondary project idea.
Tuesday June 26th
We practiced lab protocols a bit more, and conducted more research after finding out the planned trip to the landfill. We also prepared questions and did research concerning what the landfill does and how we can benefit from it.
Wednesday June 27th
Today we went to the Yolo County Landfill to meet with Ramin Yazdani, the senior civil engineer at the landfill. We were given a tour of the landfill, and discussed procedures and systems Dr. Yazdani has in place regarding the decomposition of trash, specifically in terms of methanogens and methanotrophs. He similarly provided us with guidance concerning the direction of our project, and the possible application and impact our project could potentially have in terms of trash degradation.
Thursday June 28th
We spoke with our mentors regarding the feasibility of our project within the given time span. Ruled out polyurethane due to toxic byproducts.
Friday June 29th
Conducted more research in engineering methanogens and methanotrophs. We also looking into how our project could apply to the landfill, and discussed the feasibility of PET degradation versus methanotroph and methanogen consumption of methane.
Week 3
Monday July 2nd
We further looked into the means by which our project can be outlined and planned.

Computation of Regulation Rate in synthetic cascades
   The limitation of the above equation derivation is that we assume the equilibrium concentration of activator and repressor are known values but, in a real regulatory network, there are some factors would affect those equilibrium concentrations due to the fact that activator and repressor are parts of the targeted proteins in such network. Therefore, we cannot just simply apply (1)(2)(3)to compute its equilibrium concentration and find out the related regulation rates by applying (5)(7)(12)(13)(14)(15). In the following passage, we would explore how to compute different regulation rates in a gene more effectively with respect to a general regulatory network.  And we would use  to represent the regulation rate.
   Given the network would arrange some circuits, Circuit1,Circuit2,...,CircuitN, in an order. The expression of the first gene  is not regulated while the genes behind are regulated by formers regulatory proteins, i.e.  acts as an activator or a repressor on. The algorithm of regulation rate is as follow.
Algorithm 1(tandem circuits)
   Step 1: To compute the equilibrium concentrations of targeted proteins,[Protein1]s,[Protein2]s,...,[ProteinN]s, in existence of no regulation based on equation (1)(2)(3)with respect to the type of promoter.
   Step2: As the expression of is not regulated, the equilibrium concentration of its target protein is [Protein1]s'=[Protein1]s
   Step 3: There is a cycle for the remaining Circuitk(k=2,...,N). Based on the type of actual regulation, we substitute Circuitk-1’s equilibrium concentration of targeted protein obtained from the former cycle into one of the following equations, (4)(6)(8)(9)(10)(11). Then, we can get ’s equilibrium concentration of targeted protein,[Proteink]s' .

Hailing from Glasgow's own Wild West end, Roddy brings a most necessary element of calm to the team - cool and collected in the face of results that might frazzle a softer scientist. Roddy has become our resident biochemist, absorbing the techniques of PhD students and PIs alike to become a one-gunned, sharp-eyed, no-horse-having, western-blotting hurricane. Roddy's extra mural activities also strengthen the team - his karate-honed reflexes mean he never drops the lunchtime frisbee and his time spent moonlighting as the lovely Violet has honed a thinly veiled talent for sass, which keeps the rest of us on our toes.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," mechanism. LasI is produced constitutively by a cell. LasI synthesises the C12-HSL quorum sensing molecule. C12-HSL is able to diffuse through the membrane into the extracellular space.  When enough LasI positive cells (cells producing LasI) are present in one location, the amount of C12-HSL in the extracellular space reaches a threshold concentration. At this point, the quorum sensing molecule diffuses into the surrounding cells through their membranes. These cells also produce the LasR transcription factor. C12-HSL can bind to LasR,  enabling the transcription factor to activate transcription from the PLas promoter.
In nature, QS systems tend to be used by pathogens as a method of synchronising virulence factor production (Rutherford and Bassler, 2012). When enough pathogens are present that infection is likely to succeed (dictated by the amount of cells required to reach the QS molecule threshold), virulence factors under the control of a promoter regulated by the QS transcription factor (e.g. LasR or RhlR) are expressed. This enables a co-ordinated attack, instead of individual or a small population of cells producing virulence factors, signalling their presence to the immune system, and reducing the likelihood of a successful infection.
QS mechanisms provide a very convenient mechanism to engineer cell-to-cell communication into synthetic microbial communities. Some cells in the population can be engineered to produce the AHL synthase (e.g. LasI or RhlI), while others to produce the AHL transcription factor (TF) (LasR or RhlR). Desired parts can then be assembled after the AHL-TF regulated promoter, such that they are only produced when the sender cell is present or activated. One example of quorum sensing in synthetic biology is to synchronise gene expression, which leads to reduced variability within a population (Danino et al., 2010).
In the Sensynova framework, the quorum sensing mechanisms are used as follows. The lasR gene is encoded by the detector cell under the control of a promoter regulated by the target analyte/condition of choice. In the presence of the target, LasR is produced and C12-HSL is synthesised and released into the extracellular space. The LasR transcription factor is produced constantly by the processor cells, and when the C12-HSL is present transcription from the Plas promoter is activated. The desired processing device is placed under the control of the Plas promoter, and RhlI synthase is produced by the processing device. The RhlI device can then synthesise the C4-AHL,"
Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," strain, there is less fluorescence without IPTG, than with IPTG. While this does show that 1mM IPTG is sufficient to induce the BBa_R0010 promoter, this is not a perfect control for the concentration of IPTG used unless KillerRed and KillerOrange also have this promoter. In the DH5α strain, there is not much difference between RFP fluorescence with or without IPTG – this is due to DH5α not having a functional copy of LacI, the lac repressor, therefore lac-repressible promoters are not “OFF”, so cannot be switched “ON” by IPTG induction.
Sequencing
Other reasons there may not be any KillerRed or KillerOrange protein produced, are mutations in the promoter. This was something we encountered when attempting to clone a promoter in front of the toxin from the toxin-antitoxin system we were working with. If a protein is toxic to produce, any cell which is producing less or no protein will grow faster than a cell which is producing the toxic protein. This means a mutated, non-functional promoter will have a proliferative advantage during transformation. So, as we were sending our BioBricks for sequencing before submission to the iGEM registry, we decided to sequence the minipreps of KillerRed and KillerOrange as well with the registry standard pSB1C3 sequencing primer VF2, to check for any mutations.  Both plasmids had the BioBrick prefix, and the correct sequence for both KillerRed and KillerOrange open reading frame. The sequence between the prefix and the ATG start codon, we checked against lac-repressible promoters in the iGEM registry. We found a match to BBa_R0184, which is a T7 lac-repressible promoter. T7 promoters require T7 polymerase to be transcribed, as they are not recognised by E. coli polymerases. This results confirms the result of the fluorescence measurements. No KillerRed or KillerOrange fluorescence was observed, as neither gene was being transcribed by either DH5α or DH5α.Z1 as neither strain produces the required T7 polymerase. A protein overexpression E. coli strain such as BL21<DE3> which has the T7 polymerase gene inserted into its genome is designed to use T7 promoters would have been able to express these KillerRed and KillerOrange constructs.

There is no reported harmful activity of the proteins used in our studies, namely the  a-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase, a-Galactosidase and the Endo-ß-Galactosidase. These proteins originate from the organisms Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Bacterioides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens, respectively. Since synthesized sequences were used for cloning of all of the proteins, aspects of biosafety regarding the original organisms did not have to be considered for our work.
Although the product of our application is thought to be used in public, the procedure of antigen-hydrolyzation will be carried out in a laboratory environment.
 
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The organisms our parts originate from are classified as risk group 2 organisms, but we used gene synthesis to acquire the parts of our interest and did not handle the organisms themselves. Furthermore, our lab work was mainly based on purified proteins, thereby minimizing the risk of any contaminations with genetically modified organisms.
All of the parts we use are not known to have any harmful effect on humans or other organisms.
 
Which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
In Germany any work with genetically modified organisms is regulated by the "" Gentechnikgesetz "". There are different biosafety levels ranging from 1 to 4. Our lab has been registered as biosafety level 1. Our work matches the definition of level 1 since based on our current understanding we see no threats on human health or the environment originating from our work. Genetically modified organisms are allowed to be released into nature only after permission of the Umweltministerium (Department of the Environment) and once freed they need to be monitored constantly.
 
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Parts that are able to induce apoptosis or autolyis could be expressed under promoters that are activated in the context of specific environmental effectors. A huge amount of examples for these so-called kill-switches was designed by the iGem community and is now available in the registry (see for example 2011's team of UCL London and the 2013 BGU Israel's iGEM-team).

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html,"2, induced at 25 °C overnight
The expression of pSB1K3-T7-EB seems to be successful for the first batch but not for the second one. EB is calculated to be 30 kDa and we observed an intense band around 30 kDa after IPTG induction.
As mentioned above, we added the untransformed BL21 cells to see whether there is a difference in expression between the transformed and non-transformed cells. The result turns out the bands at 40 kDa and 35 kDa are universally expressed in all samples.
Since the last experiment shows an universal protein expression at 35-40 kDa no conclusion can be drawn whether we have successfully expressed Esp. Furthermore, we have seen protein expression in this range both in the soluble and the insoluble samples, therefore we have not succeed in determining the solubility of Esp. If we had more time we could have used mass spectrometry for more accurate results. Furthermore, if we had succeed to insert the His-tag in the gene encoding for Esp before this experiment was performed we could have purified our samples before running the SDS-PAGE’s or performed a Western Blot with anti-His-tag antibodies. That could have given us easier results to interpret with no surrounding noise due to the impurities.
Furthermore, during our project we have prepared our own buffers and gels. If we would have had the possibility to use standardized material for the SDS-PAGE maybe we could in a greater extent avoid bad separation and smeary gels.
Adding Sortase and His tags to the expression construct
In order to purify and attach Esp to spider silk, the addition of linkers and tags (LT) was necessary, which was going to be achieved by a modified 3A assembly using a BamHI restriction site. This site first has to be introduced to EB using PCR.
PCR adding BamHI overhang, First Attempt [❌]
In the first trial adding BamHI overhang to EB using PCR, the setup reaction was similar as regular PCR with a reverse primer designed to add a BamHI site. It had the same annealing temperature as the pre-existing forward primer (VF2). Positive control was performed with VF2 and VR, which proved to be functioning in our previous experiments. We tested two annealing temperature with 52 °C and 57 °C.
As shown in figure, in both of the gels, there were intensive bands for positive control. However, the overhang PCR seemed to have been unsuccessful with PCR products that were either unspecific (at 52 °C annealing temperature) or simply"

In our Notebook you can follow our progress through the summer and fall of 2018. This notebook contain our weekly reports, for more detailed information and protocols see “Experiments and Protocols”.
Week 24: 11 - 15/6 Summer has begun and we are excited to start our project! This week was filled with preparations for the coming days and weeks. Prepping agar, LB-medium, buffers and so on. Started working with our biobricks from iGEM followed by methods like transformation in BL21 competent cells, inoculation, plasmid preparation and gel electrophoresis. Week 25: 18-21/6 This week we continued working with biobricks and changing parameters on our methods to achieve better results. We also had a short vacation as we celebrated the Swedish holiday Midsummer. Week 26: 15-29/6 This week more investigation on error sources was made as we continued to have no bacterial growth on agar plates. Changing parameters did not have an effect. We also had a visit from our sponsor Cenova, which told us about their company and also discussed about the IGEM-competition. Week 27: 2-8/7 This week we begged the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations for help. We got a massive amount of good answers that helped us progress with our project. We also managed to do our first Gibson assembly. As a part of the iGEM-competition’s criteria; we also started working with the mutagenesis on the plasmid from the previous team (LiU iGEM 2017) and try to improve it. Week 28: 9-15/7 This week we continued with our Gibson assembly, getting both wanted and unwanted results. This was followed by a lot of changes in PCR temperatures and times. We got good results on our biobrick and chose to verify it on our part pages. Week 29: 16/7-22/7 This week we learned that extracting DNA from the gel is very difficult if you don’t have good materials to do it. We still struggled with our Gibson assembly but at least our mutagenesis is showing promising results. Week 30: 23-29/7 This week we really tried to keep a good attitude to the project and"

Pipet 1 µL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube.
Pipet 50 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Pre-heat water bath now to 42°C. Otherwise, hot water and an accurate thermometer works too!
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the water bath for 45 seconds. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 950 µL of LB media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour shaking at 200-300 RPM.
Prepare the agar plates during this time: label them and add sterile glass beads if using beads to spread the mixture.
Pipet 100 µL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates with the agar side at the top, and the lid at the bottom.
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony count in the calculation.                                             Efficiency (in cfu/µg) = [colonies on plate (cfu) / Amount of DNA plated (ng)] x 1000 (ng/µg)                             Note: The measurement ""Amount of DNA plated"" refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the total amount of DNA used per transformation. You can calculate this number using the following equation:                         Amount of DNA plated (ng) = Volume DNA added (1 µL) x concentration of DNA (refer to vial, convert to ng/µL) x [volume plated (100 µL) / total reaction volume (1000 µL)]
Overnight Culture in Falcon Tubes Protocol:
gBlocks come as 1000 ng (basic 1 and basic 2)
Method:
Centrifuge the tube for 3-5 seconds at a minimum of 3000 G to ensure the material is in the bottom of the tube.
Add water to reach a final concentration of 20 ng/µL (Add 50 µL of water).

UT-Knoxville,2017,Team:UT-Knoxville#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"olualdehyde had retention times at 7.1, 9.7, and 10.28 minutes respectively. The internal Standard ethyl benzoate had a retention time of 10.64 minutes. Signals are directly overlapped in order to show differences in concentrations.
The production of m-tolualdehyde using the m-xylene induced production circuit BBa_K2451015 also termed UTK05 was analyzed through GC/MS using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a 7693A automatic liquid sampler, an HP-5ms capillary column (30 m long × 0.25 mm inside diameter with a 0.25-µm capillary film of 5% phenyl methylsilicone) and a 5975C mass-sensitive detector.  As expected our production module was not capable of producing any m-tolualdehyde or the intermediate product, 3-methyl Benzyl Alcohol, without the exogenous addition of m-xylene as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, our negative controls were not capable of producing the final product even after induction. Importantly, the inclusion of the Pu promoter to the production module did not lower the production of m-tolualdehyde. The 7.25 mg/ml of m-tolualdehyde our m-xylene induced module was able to produce matches favorably with the ~5 mg/mL produced by our IPTG induced module. This provides good evidence that helping to regulate the expression of production module conserves cellular resources by limiting expression early in growth and by basing expression on the concentration of m-xylene. Figure 2 is a representative chromatogram from the GC analysis of the production module. As the chromatogram shows, we are seeing no presence of the intermediate or the final product. Our analysis leads us to conclude that our production circuit is not only working, but is being induced by the simultaneous expression of xylR and the presence m-xylene activating the Pu promoter.
Conclusions
Given the presence of 1 mM m-xylene, our mutant strain (BL21(DE3) + BBa_K2451013) exhibited a 4-fold increase in fluorescence. This validates our construct, and we coupled it with our 2016 production circuit. In theory, we have neared our end goal- such that catalytic enzymes (xylAMB) are produced only in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons. While we cloned this construct (BBa_K2451015), time constraints did not allow us to characterize the circuit in its entirety.  Additionally, our data suggests the nitrogen content of the"
