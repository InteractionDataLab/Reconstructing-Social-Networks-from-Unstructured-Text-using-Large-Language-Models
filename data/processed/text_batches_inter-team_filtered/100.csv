Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

Harvard,2017,Team:Harvard#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the proteins must first be exported into the periplasm, since none remain in the cytoplasm. The mechanism by which this occurs is the Sec secretion pathway. The  main actors in this secretion pathway are SecYEG, which dimerizes to form a protein conducting channel (PCC), SecA, which acts as an ATPase driving the translocation, and SecB, a chaperone protein that keeps proteins in an unfolded state (Driessen et al., 2007). As a protein emerges from the ribosome, SecB, a homotetramer, binds and stabilizes it in its unfolded conformation. This protein complex then binds to SecA, a homodimer, which also recruits SecYEG to assemble the dimeric PCC.
In our model, we simplify the interactions into three steps: the binding of the SecB homotetramer to the csg protein to form a \(SecB:csgX\) complex, the subsequent binding between the \(SecB:csgX\) complex with SecA, and finally the translocation of the protein from the cytoplasm to the periplasm.
$$csgX_{cyt} + 4 SecB  \underset{\gamma_{-1}}{\overset{\gamma_{1}}{\rightleftharpoons}} SecB:csgX$$ $$SecB:csgX + 2 SecA + 2 SecYEG \overset{\gamma_{2}}{\rightarrow} Sec:csgX$$ $$ Sec:csgX \overset{\gamma_{3}}{\rightarrow} 4 SecB + 2 SecA + SecYEG + csgX_{per}$$
The rate of binding and secretion is assumed to be conserved across the different proteins due to the similarity in mechanism and homology in the Sec signal sequences. Thus, instead of listing the same interactions for every protein, the generic \(csgX_{cyt}\) and \(csgX_{per}\) are used to denote the csg proteins in the cytoplasm and periplasm, respectively.
Extracellular secretion
Analysis of the crystal structure of csgG and has revealed that it assembles into a double-nonameric form in D9 symmetry (Taylor and Matthews 2015). CsgE has also been shown to form a nonamer at the base of the csgG structure in the periplasm, providing selectivity for the substrates that are secreted (Goyal et al., 2014). CsgG and csgE participate in the"

Interview with Dr. Mendelson
Dr. Mendelson’s research revolves around Infectious diseases in countries with high rates of antibiotic resistance (AR). He focuses on models of antibiotic stewardship, antibiotic prescription and response, hospital collaborations and the use of antibiotics in surgical pathways. Most his work centers around international policy development for infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance strategy.
Dr. Mendelson highlights how there are many players in the antibiotic game, not just scientists or doctors. Finance, food production and the general public are often in tandem with the science behind antibiotic resistance (AR). He stressed the importance of education and awareness as well as individual and national responsibility to use antibiotics in a poised manner. Using language that is clear such as ""antibiotic resistance"" vs ""antimicrobial resistance"" is also essential to the fight. Dr. Mendelson thinks that carefully planned use of antibiotics will be a lasting solution in addition to new therapies being created to fight bacteria.
Additionally, we asked for suggestions and things to consider when molding our project. Dr. Mendelson proposed that we carry out risk analysis to evaluate the chances of our therapeutic working and weighing the risks and benefits of this delivery system. He also advised us to be specific about what genes we are trying to target while remaining cautious. “Antibiotic Resistance isn’t just because of genes. Superbugs have multiple resistance mechanisms, disabling the genes doesn’t mean it’ll surefire die.”
Takeaway: Our conversation with Dr. Mendelson helped us be more considerate with the language we use when referring to antimicrobial resistance. When talking about antibiotics, this website only uses the terms ""antibiotic resistant"" or ""drug resistant infection""; according to Dr. Mendelson, most of the population can understand these terms, a first step to combating AR worldwide. Dr. Mendelson also convinced us to carry out risk analysis for our protein delivery approach.  .

Putting the obtained equations together, we get
\[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} \frac{\mathrm{d}C_n}{\mathrm{d}t}&=k_nC_m^s\\ \frac{\mathrm{d}C_{ns}}{\mathrm{d}t}&=k_{ns}C_m^{s-1}(C_s-C_{ns})\\ \frac{\mathrm{d}C_m}{\mathrm{d}t}&=-\frac{k_eC_nC_m}{K_m+C_m}-\frac{k_{es}C_{ns}C_m}{K_m+C_m}-s\frac{\mathrm{d}C_n}{\mathrm{d}t}-(s-1)\frac{\mathrm{d}C_{ns}}{\mathrm{d}t}\end{aligned}\qquad\qquad\begin{aligned}c_n(0)&=0\\c_{ns}(0)&=0\\c_m(0)&=c_{m0} \end{aligned} \right. \]

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," at this point, the medium began to be the same yellow colour as for CSE minimal medium. This lead to the ATCC medium that did not show a very high growth, but nevertheless, the cells actually grew in the medium. This was later confirmed to be B. subtilis by plating them out on LB plates. However, now a new problem arose - how could we get the B. subtilis to grow into a higher density which is needed to get bioproduction of a high-value compound such as P(LA-co-3HB). We hypothesized that by changing the medium once in awhile we would refresh the nutritions and B. subtilis will grow more. This was done in the second experiment we carried out with ATCC medium. The medium was changed every fourth day, and OD was measured every second day. This shows that the growth of B. subtilis indeed can be raised by changing the medium (Fig. 7). This is something we need to consider in the final design of the co-culture. How can the nutritions be refreshed? One way is to use different kind of waste products from astronauts or Mars settlers and add those to the medium instead of changing the medium.
----------------
Question: Can B. subtilis grow under osmotic stress?
Experiment: B. subtilis was grown at different concentrations of supplemented NaCl (0 mM, 50 mM, 100mM, 150 mM, 200 mM and 500 mM) in LB medium. The samples were incubated at 28 degrees at 100rpm for 17 hours. Growth was measured with OD at 600nm over a time period.
Result: As stated by both Ducat et. al. and Stanford-Brown 2011 the cscB transporter does not work without an osmotic stress to accumulate sucrose in the cytoplasm of the cyanobacterium. We therefore need to test the ability of B. subtilis to grow in high osmotic stress. B. subtilis was inoculated in  LB medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl. The growth curve of B. subtilis was obtained by measuring OD at 600nm. The growth curve shows that B. subtilis is not affected by the salt concentrations at all (Fig. 8). Up to  200mM NaCl there is no difference between the high salt samples and the reference curve (without salt, blue diamond on Fig. 8). Only one sample showed severe growth impairment, which was the sample that was grown in"

Safety
1.Biosafety considerations and investigation for our project
Having identified our project, we discussed the biosafety of our project with professor Liang who has worked for years on nucleic acid detection and biosensor. We discussed with professor Liang on the safety and feasibility of our project . For the safety of our project, our experimental strain is E.coli DH5 Alpha, a very common strain in biological experiments. As long as we do experiments according to microbial and molecular experimental operation specification, there will be no safety issues. For the feasibility of our project, designing different structures of hairpin and enzyme to regulate the expression of the gene of interest is very useful for the future work.
2.Biosafety Project
Because the track of our project is Foundational Advance, the downstream products have nothing but fluorescent proteins which act as a reporter to characterize our experimental results. What's more, nonpathogenic bacteria E.coli DH5 Alpha is employed as the main chassis for our prior design on the DNA sequence, stem-loop and enzyme. As a matter of fact, when using hairpin"

The weekly notebook includes the work process of every teammate everyday. Here you can see the detailed steps of finishing the two projects for iGEM competition, and go through the days that our projects grow up with us together.
 
Week13～Week18
    
Week13
    
    Asia Jamboree in HKUST!
    We met many teams from China, Japan, Korea, India and Indoneisa. We presented a high quality presentation. Yet we received many good advices from the judges. And we showed our poster and made many friends! But it is a little upset that we only got a silver medal. We think that we deserved a gold medal. Because we think we fulfilled every requirements of a gold medal.
Week 14, 15
    First two weeks from Hong Kong. We were a little upset since we were not invited to MIT. So we did nothing these two weeks.
  
Week 16
    Good news! We were invited to MIT, too! We came back to our second project---BioDesign. Xiao Tong and Zili Fan were in charge of the drawing part. They spent virtually all the spare time on this project. Sometimes they even skipped classes to write code. Mubing Zhou was in charge of the rest part other than the drawing part. He was also very hardworking. Deng Pan and Yujun Zhao were in charge of updating BioSearch. While Qijia Cheng, Chenchen Lyu and Junqiu Zhang were busy preparing the presentation. Yidan Pan and Xin Yang were in charge of the wiki writing. And Jingyao Guo and Yiqi Jiang were in charge of name card making and poster redesigning.
  
Week 17
    Since we had had some experience in writing codes, we didn't discuss too much when developing BioDesign. This week. We kept working hard. Xiao Tong, Zili Fan and Mubing Zhou already finished BioDesign. But there was a huge task remaining--debugging. Hundreds of bugs were hidden between lines. Sometimes, they spent half a day just to fix a tiny problem. Other guys were still doing their jobs. Jingyao Guo and Yiqi Jiang printed our name cards and new poster. Deng Pan and Yujun Zhao fixed some bugs in BioSearch.

Calcium Phosphate Transfection
Title: Transfection to microglia and astrocytes via “calcium phosphate” method.
Conducted by: Sagi Angel
Date: 3-7.6.18
Aim: In this experiment we have tried to use the calcium phosphate protocol in     order to transfect microglia astrocytes and HEK as control in GFP gene. The     use of HEK cells as control, is due to its ability to be transfected     relatively easily by the various techniques, including calcium phosphate     method.
Importance: This experiment was carried out in parallel with experiments using     different methods of transfection (different reagents and electroporation)     in order to find an efficient way of inserting our plasmids into astrocytes     and microglia for the continuation of the project.

Expectations:
The expected results were the illumination of GFP under a fluorescent microscope. It could be assumed that if the experiment was conducted well, the HEK cells would be able to insert the GFP plasmid easily and the illumination would be high, and one could hope that some of the experimental cells, astrocytes and microglia, would also show fluorescence. If there was a problem during the experiment or in the quantities of the materials, it would not be possible"
SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," came from General Hospital of Chengdu Military Region and Doctor Kong who came from the First People's Hospital of Chengdu. They addressed the consensus on the treatment of hyperuricemia in circulatory, urinary, digestive, endocrine, and other disciplines. Especially, the present situation of urate lowering by drug therapy was explained in detail, which was very useful for us to understand the existing methods of urate lowering. Moreover, we found the advantages and disadvantages of our project compared with the existing clinical treatment methods, and it was beneficial to making best use of the advantages and bypassing the disadvantages, so as to improve our project. After the conference, we had a separate exchange with Professor Zhu Jun. We briefly introduced our subject to him, and he was interested in the intestinal part. The drugs for promoting excretion now used in urate lowering are all aimed at the kidneys. The intestinal excretion of uric acid has long been neglected. Therefore, the idea of our subject was worth trying. In addition, Professor Zhu also suggested that we should read more literature to understand the current research frontier in this area, not behind closed doors, in order to avoid carrying out our idea irrespective of external circumstances.
West China Hospital Visiting for the 2nd time With Dr. Yi Zhao, Dr. Chunyu Tan, Dr. Min Yang, Dr. Xiaomin Cen, Dr. Hua Zhao, Dr. Beibei Cui
After the last exchange with Dr. Yi Liu, we found that the direct communication with clinical doctor was very helpful and efficient for us to understand the status of clinical treatment and to improve our project. As a therapeutic project, doctor's advice was essential to us. Therefore, relying on the advantageous resources of West-China Hospital Sichuan University, we contacted Dr. Yi Zhao, Dr. Chunyu Tan, Dr. Min Yang, Dr. Xiaomin Cen, Dr. Hua Zhao, and Dr. Beibei Cui these six doctors, and we communicated directly with them face to face about what we wanted to know and what they suggested about our project.
We first asked the current situation and existing problems of clinical blood uric acid concentration lowering therapy for hyperuricemia and gout. The doctors' answers were basically similar. At present, the clinical use of blood uric acid concentration lowering drugs can basically reduce uric acid in patients and have less adverse reactions, but the biggest problem is the poor compliance of patients. Since the treatment cycle of acid lowering is very long, most patients stop taking medicine when they are not painful, so the treatment effect is difficult to achieve."
Peking,2014,Team:Peking#TeamCom_-_-_TEXT.html,", how to establish a proper model became the same concern. WANG Chenggong introduced Peking’s models detailedly, including the insight, the methods, and analysis results. iGEMers from BNU-China offered us many decent suggestions. Later, they discussed Beijing Normal University’s project and WANG Chenggong gave some suggestions on constructing a dynamic model of E.coli and peanut root system, which can quantitatively simulate the process of engineered organism movement(Fig. 5 & 6).

Peking iGEM and OUC-China had pleasant communication experience in the past years. This time, we both chose holin/endolysin lysis system to construct an inducible suicide switch and we discussed experiment protocols and results for weeks. Besides, Peking iGEM provided these two genes with their primers for OUC-China due to the difference between the genes we used. Also, OUC-China sent their gas vesicle plasmids to us and did a confirming test.
In short, team communication is an indispensable part of human practice. Tens of Meet Ups were held before the Giant Jamboree around the world. By communicating, teams exchange their ideas and discuss problems.
This year, some first-year iGEM teams received Peking’s assistance, including advice on modeling, experiments equipment supply and BioBrick (BBa_K1405002) standardization.
It is the 7th year since Chinese teams joined in iGEM competition for the first time and more and more universities even some high schools have established their iGEM teams. Synthetic biology as a novel tool has been improving our life and many ideas from iGEMers came into application. And it is undeniable that team communication did a lot for this. Chinese iGEM teams have been working together to promoting the development of synthetic biology and iGEM Competition. Education based on research impelled passion from young undergraduates, and some of them would surely become specialists in some areas. Peking iGEM believes that team communication is a key to promote synthetic biology development.

Tsinghua,2009,Team:Tsinghua#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," breakthroughs in the genomics field made gene therapy one of the most rapidly advancing fields of biotechnology and we can have a better understanding of the role of genes in disease with great promise for treating inherited and acquired diseases. the absence or inappropriate presence of a protein results in many human diseases. The protein could then be administered to patients in order to compensate for its absence. Nowadays gene therapy is the ultimate method of protein delivery. With the steps moving from the laboratory into the clinic, several issues have been brought in a central role of the development of this technology: gene identification, gene expression and gene delivery. More and more disease-related genes are found one by one, which is still growing on a rapid speed. Broader clinical application of related genes are also being utilized to develop immune activating agents with an acurate targeting site[20].
Differents types of vectors used in gene therapy
Vectors in Gene Therapy
Despite substantial progress, a number of key technical issues need to be resolved before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the clinic, and an ideal gene delivery vector is one of the bottlenecks in gene therapy application[3]. Generally, vectors applied in gene therapy can be classified into viral or non-viral.
Viral Methods
All viruses bind to their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as part of their replication cycle. This genetic material contains basic 'instructions' of how to produce more copies of these viruses, hijacking the body's normal production machinery to serve the needs of the virus[1].
Adenovirus.
Adenoviruses are kinds of viruses, which carry their genetic material in the form of double-stranded DNA. Respiratory, intestinal, and eye infections are caused when these viruses infection occur. And then they introduce their DNA molecule into the host. The information contained in the adenoviruses is not transient into the host cell's genetic material, while the DNA molecule is left free in the nucleus of the host cell, leading to the final transcription of the target gene just like others.
Adeno-associated virus.
Adeno-associated viruses is one of the parvovirus families, which are small viruses with a single stranded DNA. The wild type AAV can insert into chromosome 19 at a specific site with near 100% certainty. But the recombinant AAV, with no viral genes contained, failed to integrate into the genome. What's more, instead the recombinant viral genome fuses at its ends via the ITR (inverted terminal repeats) recombination to form circular, episomal forms which are predicted to be the primary cause of the"

Learning about Mathematica and membrane computing
I was busy to learn about Mathematica. Mathematica is a language with powerful built-in functions that could be used for various applications. I watched many online tutorials that are available at Wolfram’s website (the company that developed Mathematica).  Reading papers about membrane computing was another activity that I have done in this week. These"
NTNU-Trondheim,2013,Team:NTNU-Trondheim#ExamplePage_-_-_TEXT.html," believe we are getting very close to successfully expressing an inducible chimera because by showing activity it proves the estrogen receptor is not broken. Peters 1999 showed that the estrogen receptor can show dimer inducibility as a chimera in the presence of estrogen, and we think that trying a few more strategies will allow our ToxR chimera system to be inducible. We are going to try several more truncations, as well as various linkers, and the co-expression of different estrogen receptor truncations as was shown to work in the Peters paper.
One issue that could be affecting the Estrogen Receptor is the physiology of the periplasm that causes its cysteines in the LBD to cross react. This could potentially throw off the structure and therefore the functionality of the ER. Ee sought to correct this problem by growing the cells in a reducing environment that would prevent such bonds from forming. Our preliminary results below show that Trunc 8 is greatly stabalized by the addition of beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), effectively creating a reducing environment sensor.
Since the above system, although clearly stabalized in the periplasm, was not estradiol inducible we decided to look deeper into its ability to sense reducing environments. The first experiment showed how it grew in a reducing agent, while our next experiment below showed how it would respond (after growth saturation) to introduction into a buffered and non-buffered reducing environment. Once again Trunc 8 showed impressive inducibility in a reducing environment but only if the solution was buffered.
We believe that the right combination of buffer, reducing media, and truncation size will allow us to create a functioning estrogen biosensor, but in the meantime we have a proof of principle for our biosensor platform in the form of a reducing environment sensor.
All of the composite parts submitted to the registry and experiments discussed on this wiki were created and performed by the 2011 iGEM team Berkeley undergraduates. Some of the basic parts (RBSes, etc.) were obtained through the Anderson lab, for which they have our thanks.

Summary
We were able to successfully:
Design 4 novel plasmid constructs
Transform B. subtilis with all 4 constructs, successfully
Transform E. coli with all 4 constructs, successfully
Miniprep purified plasmids for all 4 constructs (pSB1C3 backbone only), for submission to Registry of Parts.
Performed lysis protocols on E. coli cells
Test our constructs on PET and non-PET plastic and run the results through the spectrometer for early quantitative results about mCherry visibility and PET adhesion
Dried and submitted plasmid DNA for all 4 parts to the Parts Registry
Unsuccessful results:
As expected, E. coli are not secreting protein constructs well. With lysis, we hoped to increase protein visibility, however our lab does not have protein purification capabilities at this time. This would be a logical next step for other teams with this capacity.
Spectrophotometer results were ambiguous for many constructs - likely due to the lack of protein purification. Our spec is also very old and has limited capabilities. In future we hope to use some community lab space in our area to re-assay all constructs on a more powerful spec.
It took a long time and many trials to get successful transformants in Bacillus. For this reason, we were unable to complete any characterization of how our parts work in the Bacillus chassis system  but hope to do so in the future.

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," oGEM meeting took place. Bringing together all of the post-secondary iGEM teams, the day allowed for discussion of our projects, our future, our strengths, and our weaknesses. While they were not at the center of the talk, surely but slowly common worries were brought forth, none of them relating to our projects at all but to our own selves: how do we even begin an iGEM team? How do we manage one that exists? How do we continue one that graduating students leave to us?
Throughout the years, this running theme of looking at our iGEM teams not through the lens of our projects and work but through the very essence of them, which is to say the people who make up iGEM in the first place, is something that has oft been pushed back and neglected. At the meeting that day, we realized that surprisingly, none of us were in the same stage of development in our growth as iGEM teams. Two teams just started that year; others had come back after some years of hiatus or had only been established for a number of years. Then, there were the teams that had been established as the forefront of oGEM, having been constants for years in this field. Yet, we all had our concerns about how to manage, grow, and develop our teams to be better. Despite our differences in experiences and years, or perhaps because of that, we came to realize that we could help each other build better, more solid foundations by exchanging the knowledge we had accumulated over the years. Thus, this manual came to be, out of a desire to be able to share and pass down that knowledge to all of us, and to you.
This manual will always remain open to edits, revisions, suggestions, comments, and questions. It is in our hopes that this manual grows as our teams will, and that what we have learned through this amazing journey in camaraderie and synthetic biology will always be available for those who need or want it.
Thank you, and good luck with your endeavours in iGEM. You’ll be amazing.
The Ontario iGEM chapters collaborating on this venture jointly by McMasterU, are: U of Guelph , Toronto , with entry contributions from Waterloo . The finished manual will then be distributed both in print and online to any chapters interested across Ontario and Canada.
Below is a list of the topics covered in the oGEM Manual, compiled by our Human Practices member Aline-Claire Huynh.

10. Let the plates sit on the bench for several min to allow excess liquid to be absorbed, and then invert and incubate overnight at 37°C (12-16 h).
Make sure that all these steps should be done in super clean bench to avoid contamination.
bacterial Colony PCR for Verification
After the growth of E.coli, then pick up some colonies from the plate and do a colony PCR verification. (体系！！！)Do an electrophoresis to test which colony is positive.  Besides, the colonies we choose should also be stored, we can incubate these colonies in one plate after every colony has been marked.
Culture the Bacteria
Pick up the positive colonies and throw it to 5ml LB liquid media using 12.5ml centrifuge tube. Then culture the bacteria in 37℃ overnight.
Plasmid DNA Isolation
Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Electrophoresis(proof)
Because the colony PCR test is so sensitive that we still need a digestion to proof that the mutation is successful again.
Procedure
1.  Prepare the control reaction as indicated below:
Total: 10μl
+ 0.5μl of Pst I restriction enzyme
+ 1μl of 10XH buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 7.5μl of ddH2O
2.  Prepare the sample reaction as indicated below:
Total: 25μl
+ 0.5μl of Afl II restriction enzyme, #ER0831
+ 1μl of 10XM buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 1.0μl of 0.1% BSA
+ 6.5μl of ddH2O
Then do an electrophoresis.
Amplify GFP & RFP using PCR
GFP and RFP is the fragments which need to be ligate to the plasmid.PCR amplification can get enough quantities for the following reactions.
１．Prepare the sample reaction as indicated below:
Total: 100μl ( PCR amplificationｏｆ ＧＦＰ）
+ 1.0μl of Taq DNA polymerase
+ 10μl of 10XTaq buffer
+ 10μ"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Wetlab#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," another round of PCR was done using the isolated fragment as template. We cleaned up the PCR product and achieved concentration of 250ng/µl for fragment 1, and 50ng/µl for fragment 2.
We sent these PCR products individually for sequencing. The alignment result of this sequence is shown on Figure 1.
Sequence alignment of integration product (two red arrows) with the target EPO. Pink box represent the sgRNA binding site.
Figure 1 shows the sequence alignment between the two fragments and the target EPO gene.From the sequence alignment, we can confirm that integration occured upstream the sgRNA binding site. The overlapping alignment between the two products  suggested that integration does not always occur at the exact base pair position (~10bp variation), which might be the result of the flexible linker between dxCas9 and Tn5.
Next, we used pGEM T-Easy cloning method to clone these fragments on individual plasmid to be able to sequence verify them individually. By doing this we will be able to see the variations within that band individually. The protocol for pGEM T-Easy can be found on the protocol page. We used 2µl of 10x diluted sample of isolated fragment 1 or 1µl of isolated fragment 2 to be cloned into the plasmid. We were able to get white colonies and isolated their plasmid, but however, the sequence verification result did not come on time.

cph8 is a fusion protein form by a phytochrome Cph1 and a histidine kinase domain, requires the biosynthesis of phycocyanobilin. The resulting molecule is a transmembrane protein. the cph1 domain it´s outside the membrane and the EnvZ domain dephosphorylated ompR with the stimuli of red light.
The transcription factor OmpR positively regulates the promoter. Phosphorylated OmpR binds to operator sites and activates transcription. This state is achieved by the EnvZ site of cph8.
The EnvZ/OmpR regulatory components are a dimeric histidine kinase EnZ, serving as a signal sensor. After a signal the envZ autophosphorylates and the transformed to EnvZ-P to produce Phosphorylated OmpR or OmpR-P. OmpR-P is a transcription factor that binds to promoter regions and regulates it´s expression.
YF1 is a fusion protein from a covalent bond between FixL and YtvA. It was reported by Möglich et.al. (2008), as a control for gene expression in a light-dependent manner in vivo.  YF1 was conceived by oxygen-sensitive, light-inert histidine kinase by replacing its chemosensor domain by a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) photosensor domain.
When expressed, this protein migrates to the cell membrane and becomes able to receive luminal stimuli, it get excited when photons in a wavelength of 470 nm hit the outer part of the protein, and stops the phosphorylation reaction.

Taking the chance here, our team would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all those individuals and groups for their assistance and cooperation.
Industrial Community
Established in 1985, Shanghai Energy Conservation Association (SECA) is a membership non-profitable organization that works on the sustainable energy development on behalf of the industrial firms. Most of the local industrial companies, including those very influential ones like Bao Steel, are the members of the association. The SECA is set for the potential industrial collaborations with regards of the energy issue, whose main duties include the industrialization of new energy technologies as well as the propagation of the idea of energy conservation. Most employees working at SECA, including the interviewee, previously worked in the real industry. With their sufficient experience in the field, and also benefits from their daily cooperation with industrial partners, the SECA is undoubtedly an excellent place for our team to seek more insights from the industrial point of view. Also, the comments from the SECA would be of great importance for the industrialization and scale application of our project to yield more social interests.
Our delegation visited the SECA, organizing an interview with Mr. Lan (Yujun Lan), director of the expert committee at SECA, and Ms. Chen (Meijuan Chen), vise director of the expert committee at SECA.
At the beginning of the meeting, team member Haolong delivered a brief introduction to our project first. Both Mr. Lan and Ms. Chen were deeply impressed by our dauntless but creative idea. As they commented, they had served for the energy industry for decades, but this was the very first time they heard about using biological platform to provide new energy source as hydrogen gas. From an industrial point of view, they could tell the great future potential and feasibility our project suggested to be further developed into real industrial application in a big scale, meanwhile they also point out that some modifications especially with regards of the working conditions as well as an adaptation to the flow line production would be necessary. Besides, as Mr. Lan further said, the mission of the SECA included the promotion and industrialization of new technology; with their abundant experience in the field, they were willing to assist our team to continuously modify the project and try to put it into industrial application.

In this section of our protocol pages you can read more about our methods for cloning and BioBrick assembly.
Genetic engineering is a basic tool of synthetic biology. With the help of standardized DNA building blocks (BioBricks) it is fairly easy to create new and modify existing natural systems. The methods we have used in our project to create BioBricks and to modify, mutate, transform and analyse DNA are presented in this section. Methods used: Electroporation; chemical transformation; Standard, Freiburg, Gibson and 3A BioBrick assembly; restriction analysis; colony PCR; site directed mutagenesis. read more
Production
These are the protocols for the cultivations and the downstream processing.
Before one is able to work with a cell-free system based on biological material, the needed proteins have to be produced and purified first. These methods and the ones we used to characterize BioBricks in vivo are presented in this section. Used methods: Cultivations in shaking flasks and bioreactor; protein clean-up from medium, periplasm, whole cell and inclusion bodies; UF / DF; IEX; Ni-NTA columns and chromatography; recrystallization and immobilization of S-layer proteins. read more
Analytics
Protocols for the analytical methods we used.
DNA and proteins are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. To control the success and the results of your upstream and downstream processes, analytical methods are necessary that give reliable results to make DNA or proteins in any way visible for you. The analytical methods we used in our project can be found in this section. Used methods: Fluorescence measurement"
DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic Biology is about modification of organisms by engineering them to perform new and innovative tasks. An analogy, both conceptualizing the goal and methods of synthetic biology, is computer engineering hierarchy, were  every constituent part is embedded in a more complex system that provides its context. Starting in the bottom of the hierarchy with transistors, capacitors, and resistors; second the engineered logic gates performing binary computations and finally the more complex integrated circuits.
This is equivalent to how synthetic biology works. In synthetic biology standardized parts such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites are used as the basic components. The device layer regulates physical processes by the constructed biochemical reactions. The parts can be assembled into modules in order to assemble more complex pathways, having similarity with the integrated circuits. Connection of pathways and their integration into host cells allow researchers to extend or modify the behaviour of cells in a programmatic fashion (2).
The world calls for a better Assembly System
The Registry of Standard Biological Parts and iGEM make use of the Standard Assembly of BioBricks formulated by Tom Knight.   The BioBrick Standard Assembly makes use of the restriction recognition sites of the four restriction enzymes EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI. The BioBricks are flanked by a prefix and a suffix containing the restriction recognition sites EcoRI, XbaI, and SpeI, PstI, respectively. To ensure a correct assembly the BioBricks cannot contain any of these four restriction recognition sites. This means that if any of these four restriction recognition sites are present, they will have to be eliminated by alterations like site-directed mutagenesis, which can be time consuming and laborious. In developing new BioBricks from natural sources and higher organism such as eukaryotes the illegal restriction sites can be a problem. Furthermore, when assembling BioBricks with the Standard Assembly System scars between the Biobricks are introduced, this can be a problem for the construction of fusion proteins. Additionally, the BioBrick Assembly Standard has the drawback that only two BioBricks can be assembled at a time (3).
All in all, the iGEM competition and the fast growing field of synthetic biology calls for a simpler, faster and more efficient assembly system that is easily applied to both bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells.
USER cloning
In the early 1990s, uracil excision-based (USER) cloning was invented as a ligation-independent cloning technique that could substitute the conventional cloning methods, which mades use of restriction enzymes and ligase. In 200"

(3)PcpcG2+PluxR+RFP
(4)PcpcG2+PluxR+GFP
    When bacteria are expressing AHL, PluxR is turned on continuously, and the inputting optical signal is changed into another light of different color. For example, irradiating with red light will turn on Plamda, resulting in the emission of green light (GFP).     In practice, If the period of the oscillation system is 1.5h, suppose we irradiate three tubes of bacteria using red light, green light, red light at 14:00 in the afternoon, we can get the feedback of green light (GFP), red light (RFP), red light (RFP), which are the encrypted cipher-text. Then the bacteria will continue oscillation but we could not know their states.  When we need to decrypt, irradiate them using green light, red light, red light at 15:30, the bacteria will return to their original states, emitting red light, green light and red light which means we get the original text.  By now, we have successfully achieved the process of encryption and decryption.
Basic function
    Using light-switchable two-component systems as input, and AND gate circuit to manipulate the input signal, we have already achieved the basic function of the cipher machine.
Previous Next
(When the mouse is out, it's ""invert"" operation, when the mouse is in, it's ""remain"")
Advanced function
    To realize an independent and dynamic encryption, we use logic gates to combine the light control system and the oscillation system. We use AHL to replace Ara, and DPD to replace IPTG. Thus, with the adjustment by the oscillation system, the second generation of cipher machine could change periodically between two different code books all by itself.

We did not get better results even with these new fragments.
We realized in fact we have a problem with the XOR2 gate. Instead of having only one site cla1 inside the XOR2, we had two. The problem was therefore the restriction with cla1!

Creation of another reversed RFP fragment but with bamH1 restriction site on each side of this DNA fragment. With this, we were able to overcome the problem of two cla1 restriction site inside XOR2. We cloned this fragment into XOR2. But it didn’t work.
It seemed that RFP was well inserted into AND2, but after DNA sequencing analysis, we didn’t get the right fragment at the right place.
First verification of cloning parts size by digestion by EcoRI and PstI enzymes:
o And 1 – pSB1K3
- pSB1K3 linearized: about 2200 bp.
- And 1 fragments: about 500 bp.
o Xor 1 - rbs RFP term – pSB1K3
- pSB1K3 linearized: about 2200 bp.
- Xor 1 - rbs RFP term fragments: about 1200 bp.
o And 1 - rbs RFP term – pSB1C3
- pSB1C3 linearized: about 2000 bp.
- And 1 - rbs RFP term fragments: about 1200 bp.
=> Cloning parts size is confirmed.

Fitting Experimental data
The purpose of modelling is to predict the result before doing experimental data.                                              Our model focus on the metabolism pathway in engineered E. coli,                                              trying to understand how E. coli utilize CO2.                                              The result can fit with our experiment result to see if our model method was correct.                                              However, most of our experiments is about cell growth under different condition.                                              There are too many factors affect biomass and we cannot list all of them into model.                                              Therefore, pyruvate, was chosen to represent the trend of biomass                                              since that the metabolism of pyruvate downstream process is quite clear with abundant research have been done.

* LXSPC = Engineered E. coli contains PRK, Rubisco, and CA
The final goal of our project is to prove that our engineered E. coli could                                              successfully consumed CO2 into its metabolism.                                              CO2 convert into pyruvate through E. coli and then express on its cell growth.                                              Therefore, we can conclude that pyruvate production will have correlation with biomass,                                              which confirms that our model is reasonable to show the result with pyruvate production.

For each DNA fragment, assemble the following components in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube in the following order:
2 μL 10 X NEBuffer 2.1; X μL DNA fragment (500 – 1000 ng total); Y μL MilliQ ddH2O; 1 μL T4 DNA Polymerase, 0.3 U/μL (Make dilution in 1 X NEBuffer 2.1); 1 μL Dpn I (10 U/μL). 20 μL Total reaction volume.

Arrest chew-back by adding 2 uL of 10 mM dCTP and then place tubes on ice.
Step 3: Assemble DNA fragments and transform into E. coli
Based on the amount of DNA added to the chew-back reaction and the length of DNA fragments, determine the amount of each chew-back reaction needed to make an e quimolar mixture of each fragment that totals to at least 1 μg DNA (1,000 ηg DNA). For example, to assemble three DNA fragments of 7000 bp, 1500 bp and 900 bp at a concentration of 50 ng/uL each in chew-back reactions one would calculate (total volume = 26.8μL:

This year, we have carried out several collaborations with other iGEM teams. As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficultliusaehglsdhlisudhgliuhx viluhdgxiuvhkxjhv n oisdhfvkj oisdhvn oishdfn oisdhf oifj oifuln oi loiufosiduf osi uosif hosiu osif hvosd hvos osdh y and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit P&P to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team accepted this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.

Initial Denaturation: 98 C for 30 seconds
Denature: 98 C for 5-10 seconds
Annealing: 45-72 C for 10-30 seconds
Extension: 72C for 15-30 seconds per kb

Final Extension: 72 C for 5-10 minutes
Hold: 4 C for forever
4. Products were removed from the thermocycler and stored at -20C until they were needed.
Gel Electrophoresis
Purpose: Gel Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique that can be used to separate DNA fragments of different lengths. This is done by applying an electric field to DNA fragments. Since DNA is negatively charged, all of the DNA will flow toward the positive end of the electric field; the gel allows smaller strands of DNA to move faster than larger strands, so that is how the separation occurs. After a gel has run for 1-1.5 hours, there should be a visual difference between different strands of DNA present in the sample. In our lab, it is most commonly used to separate PCR products, but this has also been used as a technique to sequence and compare different types of DNA in forensics.
Procedure:
1.  An appropriate sized well and comb for the amount of samples was chosen. Typically, a smaller well is chosen with a comb that either has 6 or 10 slots.
2.  The comb and well was rinsed to make sure that any of the residue from the last gel that was run was washed away.
3. 50µL of a 0.8% agarose solution was mixed with 0.5µL GelStar solution from New England BioLabs Inc.
4. The gel was allowed to sit until it solidified and then the comb was removed.
5. The well was filled with 1X TAE until it covered the gel.
6. An appropriate kilobase pair ladder was chosen based on the prediction of the desired results of the separation.
7. 20 µL of the ladder was added to the first well.
8. 10µL of loading dye was added to each sample being run and then mixed thoroughly, without creating bubbles.
9. The entire contents of the PCR tube was added to the designated well for that sample, being careful to gently load the sample so that the DNA does not spread out of the well.
Note: Each sample was documented as to which well it was placed in"

BioBrick Workshop
The idea
We planned and hosted a three-day BioBrick workshop to introduce ourselves and the other iGEM teams from Denmark ( SDU , KU ) to the lab skills necessary to complete our projects. The workshop consisted of a mix of lectures, lab work and social events. Lectures were on the BioBrick standards, BioBricks registry, project and time management, biosafety considerations, and the methods used over the lab experiments of the workshop, such as: USER cloning , PCR reactions and purification of plasmids, etc.
Purpose
The purpose of this workshop was to serve as an assembly tutorial to cover lab techniques independent of organism and project.  We combined 5 parts using USER cloning in E. coli, and validated that the transformation was successful.
And of course, also to have fun!!
Agenda

Today I leave the lab and I'll be helping in planning and experimental design.
Tim Weenink
Today I restricted p(LacI) as an upstream part and *T1 (homing endonuclease without promotor) as a downstream part. Additionally I ligated the restricted I-SceI PCR fragment. This fragment was PCR'd from the plasmid from leiden containing the conding sequence of ISCEI. It was purified and restricted using E and P. Using the standard protocol, it was ligated into a pSB1A3 vector.
Finally, Esengul streaked a plate of K12 strain, that allows IPTG induction (without being expressed constitutively). This strain wil be grown up and made electro competent.

Winnie Yan Wa Ho
The Wonder Woman/Lifesaver. Winnie is very efficient when it comes to work. Either in the lab, or in Graphic Design team. She can do a lot of things in a short time. She’s also very diligent in naming gel photos and keeping them tidy (the lifesaver of our presentations). Other modules should be jealous of pTet for having Winnie in the team!

Alice Wang Qingyang
Alice is one of the smartest person we have around. She had given us constant encouragement in Modelling, MATLAB coding, and when we encounter difficulties in lab work. She also teaches us how to face challenges with optimism when we face challenges. We sure miss her a lot when she exchanged to Cornell in the Fall semester.

Bonnie Park Hojeong
Bonnie is a kind and amiable person. She always carry with her a big smile and you will find her comfortable to talk with. She loves cats very much and when you find drawings of cats in the lab, we can be 99.999% sure that it was done by her. Having Bonnie as one of the advisor in this year is definitely a pleasure for us.

Edward Ng Siu Wang
Being a final year student but his first year as an advisor (3rd year as iGEM member), Edward devoted a lot of his time to our training at the very beginning despite being busy at his internships and studies. He is the first choice that you would go to when you have uncertainties about lab work in mind since he would always answer you in a very gentle way with extraordinary patience. When you feel daunted or discouraged by your experimental progress or performance, he is also the one telling you not to mind as long as you learn from your mistakes.

Eric Cheung Ming Fung
The lab psychopath. Eric is the team leader of last year’s iGEM team and a first-time advisor this year. He would always question us on our interpretation of our lab results, regardless of if they are positive or not, but that’s just because he wants us to think critically. He may seem difficult to get along with at first due to his constant poker face. However, he does show a quirky side once in a (long) while. His advice is generally helpful and often helps add onto our knowledge. He is crazy in the way that he will only have lunch if his experiments fail, what a lab maniac!

We hope that the increased presence of IPTG-induced bacteria in comparison to non-induced bacteria might be a sign for an increased retainment of the bacteria due to the BAR expression. However, further investigations with a slightly changed expression construct would need to be done for this purpose.
Human practice collaborations
Amoy
Last year the iGEM team from Xiamen University together with the team from Paris Bettencourt University founded the Newsletter platform. Through this, iGEM teams from all over the world could share information about their project and discuss issues concerning it and synthetic biology in general. For this year’s version of the Newsletter iGEM Amoy contacted iGEM Stockholm to include us in the 2015 issue. We contributed with five articles concerning setting-up a team , germline modifications , a description of our project , an update on our progress and a controversial comment on impact factors in science.
Global collaboration on human practice surveys
CGU Taiwan involved the Stockolm team into a broader collaboration, evaluating public recognition of iGEM projects. Except for CGU Taiwan and Stockholm iGEM teams, the following teams collaborated on this:
Technische Universität Berlin (Berlin)
Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)
University of São Paulo (Brasil_USP)
The Chinese University of Hong Kong
University of Leicester
Tianjin University (Tianjin)
Université de Toulouse (Toulouse)
University College London (UCL)
Our role was to come up with questions for a survey and coordinate the technical work on the survey. In a related collaboration, we also hosted a survey on our servers for iGEM Nankai and provided them with technical support.
Aalto-Helsinki and Institut Pasteur
In the Stockholm team, several members expressed their will not to use Facebook for communication. The reasons ranged from personal to the fact that Facebook lacks key functions for streamlined collaboration and possibilities to customize it. Discussions regarding other means of communication started and the idea of the Hub arose as a common place for teams to discuss and collaborate both within the team and with other teams.
Aalto-Helsinki assumed these concerns were not limited to Stockholm and Alto-Helsinki decided to find out what other teams thought. Discussions between Stockholm, Alto-Helsinki and Institut Pasteur led to the setting up of a network using an open source platform called HumHub. This platform could potentially be used by all iGEM teams to streamline collaboration and communication within iGEM.

Human Practices
In order to gain an appreciation for the effects that C. albicans has on the military community, we contacted military health professionals from the 10th Medical Group hospital located on the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) installation.  The USAFA iGEM team received yeast infection rates from 2014-2018 for the community of cadets and active duty members on the base.  As seen in the pie chart to the right, from January 2014 to July 2018, there were 167 reported cases of C. albicans infection.  Of these infections, 102 infections occurred in cadets. 13 of these infections occurred during Basic Cadet Training, a high stress environment with limited hygiene time.  This information shows that yeast infections are an issue for the USAFA military community.   Additionally, analysis of combat-related injuries from Afghanistan and Iraq revealed that patients who also developed a Candidiasis infection had a higher mortality rate (7.1%) relative to the overall Trauma Infectious Disease Outcomes Study (1.4%) 1,2.
Furthermore, between the years 2002-2008, there were 1,696 reported cases of Candidiasis among OIF/OEF veterans who sought care at the Department of Veteran Affairs hospitals 3. And studies have shown that Candida spp infections account for 5% of deployment-related infections4, see bar graph on the left. Our ultimate goal of this research is to identify and characterize the RNA-binding proteins that drive this phenotypic change and thus increase the virulence of Candida albicans. If successful, we could potentially reveal novel anti-fungal drug targets which could reduce the mortality rate for combat veterans as a result of Candidiasis infection following a combat-related injury.

The following diagrams, Figure5-1.~Figure5-3., are from the Flow cytometer  experiment we did. The green fluorescence intensity of E.coli incubated at 25℃ (Figure5-1) and 37℃(Figure5-2) for 9 hours is lower than incubated at 42℃(Figure5-3),which also can refer to the data from Table 1. In Figure5-2., the peak of green fluorescence intensity of E.coli incubated at 37℃ for 9 hours moves right a little bit than incubated at 25℃ for 9 hours. Last, in Figure5-3., incubated at 42℃ for 9 hours, the peak of green fluorescence intensity is significantly stronger than incubated at 25℃ and 37℃ for 9 hours.

Discussion
Form the experimental data, we find that MEFL increases steeply at 42℃ in first two hours, which means the expression of GFP is high. Although after the first two hours its performance decreases and maintains at certain volume, it still expresses a lot more than the other two samples in different temperatures. We can regard GFP as our target protein. This means that our hypothesis has been confirmed that any protein placed after this circuit ( BBa_K098995 ) can be regulated by elevating or lowering temperature. At higher temperature(42℃), our target protein will perform significantly. On the contrary, at lower temperature(25℃), it will express slightly.

The way she flips her hair gets us overwhelmed. Our princess of vlogging, our proponent of public education, and Swati’s beloved twin, she comes with only one disclaimer: after midnight, nothing that she says can be held against her. If only we were her boyfriend, we’d never let her go.

We’d like to thank Dr Chris French, Dr Martin Peacock, Dr Karen Polizzi and Dr Oliver Purcell for their invaluable insight into biosensor development and their help in influencing our project.
Conclusion
The possibilities of synthetic biology biosensors are wide reaching, from diagnostic applications to bioremediation, and their advantages include low equipment requirements and portability in the field. However, there are still many issues in their development and deployment. As a team, from all our skype calls, emails, conferences, and own research we have identified five main issues, which have influenced how we addressed our project. We recognise there are other issues in biosensor development which were not able to be considered in the scope of this project; sample backgrounds and speed are two problems which, in the future, can be tackled. On the whole, we focused on problems that we had established were the major concerns and offered our solutions to each. Our project demonstrates the importance of early stage human practice discussions. Through attendance at a crop improvement conference and early discussions of the specific herbicide biosensors in our original project plan, we gained an understanding of the broader biosensor issues.  It was through these realisations and subsequent discussions with stakeholders in biosensor development that we were able to confirm that these were real issues, and changed the focus of our project accordingly - shifting from production of a specific biosensor to a broader study of synthetic biology produced biosensors. A willingness to facilitate honest discussions about the advantages of a synthetic biology approach whilst reviewing the limits of the current technology is essential for progress. Teams starting to integrate human practices at a later stage in their project development, having invested time and resources into a project, may find themselves at risk of having to “sell” their project to potential stakeholders, preventing opportunity for open and honest discussion. We hope that in addressing the barriers outlined here, we have facilitated the progression of synthetic biology biosensors, bringing us closer to a future in which the broad range of biosensors developed are utilised and have impact on our lives on a day-to-day basis. Encouragingly, we found that all the biosensor developers we approached were very open to discussion of the limits of current technology, and excited about potential improvements.
Advice to future teams
We advise future iGEM teams to begin early with human practice discussions. We approached stakeholders in our project within a month of settling on a project idea: well before the summer had started and wetlab work began. This means that projects still have the plasticity to adjust following discussions, even if"
UNAM_Genomics_Mexico,2012,Team:UNAM Genomics Mexico#HumanPractices#Who is Mrs. Cohnnie PhD_-_-_TEXT.html,": female applicants were rated lower by both male and female scientists than male applicants on scales of competence, hiring, and mentoring.
In a world where we have agreed to treat people equally when they show the same abilities, this is simply unacceptable.
How to solve a problem like this? In the NYT's Room for Debate devoted to the issue described above, two debaters caught our eye. First, Dennis Berkey argued that female students need to be put in leadership roles, and that ""strong institutional and personal commitments are essential to ameliorating gender bias"" as well. Similarly, Janelle Wilson stated that female role models should be sought, since ""positive influences and mentors for girls in elementary and middle schools can counteract long-standing cultural norms.""
Mrs. Lupita Cohnnie, the new face of science
Mrs. Cohnnie’s name was inspired by one of the discoverers of B. subtilis, Ferdinand Cohn (well, actually the one that renamed it as Bacillus).
Her first name is ""Lupita"", a very Mexican name!
When deciding the image (or as some call it, “mascot” ) of our team, we discovered that female icons, slogans or “mascots” have been underrepresented at iGEM. Thus, we decided that our main “friend, advisor and companion” had to be a female PhD, with a normal life, who likes going to the beach and enjoys spending time outside in the winter . Our “mascot” is Mrs. Cohnnie, PhD. Yale's paper on gender bias came as a confirmation on what we had already discussed with our advisors and instructors. When we claim that Mrs. Cohnnie is the ""new face of science"", we are not suggesting a void or a cheesy marketing scheme. We are trying to make a categorical statement
This might not be a breakthrough activity, or a massive campaign in favor of feminism. it might be considered a small step towards that personal commitment to raise awareness about the gender discrimination within the sciences. People who have seen so far Mrs. Cohnnie and learnt about the current situation have been made aware of gender bias in the images and practice of science. We hope that any iGEM team that reaches this page in the future would consider doing something as little as choosing a feminine mascot to fight gender biased perceptions of scientists, as well as having a conversation among their peers, advisors, instructors, teachers, and even PIs to walk ahead towards an egalitarian, almost perfect community.

Evaluating each species at every step, we obtained:
If we analyze the behavior of the system in different simulations, we realize that the levels of the system are more similar. We can see how the system is able to set a higher level for each repressor’s expression.
As we did with the basic toggle switch we made an analysis of the system when we simulate weaker stochastic actions and no inductions on the system.
It shows how the system is still no stable; however the system doesn’t change its state by itself. It must be mention that in this situation, the simulations of this model are very similar between them; it always wins the repressor2, and it never changes the state.

Add 1 μl of DPN1 to 50μl of PCR products.
Incubate 1 hour at 30°C.
Do a purification of PCR products using Qiagen purification kit Purification of DNA protocol .
Do the calculations in order to have between 50-100 ng of plasmid DNA and two or three-fold of insert in pmols. So, the calculations are:
$pmoles_{plasmid} =  \frac{m_{plasmid(ng)} \cdot 1000}{bp_{plasmid} \cdot 650}$
$pmoles_{insert} = pmoles_{plasmid} \cdot fold$
$m_{insert(ng)} = \frac{pmoles_{insert} \cdot 650 \cdot bp_{insert}}{1000}$
Mix 10 μl of Gibson assembly master mix 2X, plasmid DNA and insert and complete reaction with deionized water until 20 μl.
Incubate sample 15 minutes at 50°C.
Store sample at -20°C before doing the transformation.

\begin{equation} \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \frac{c^{n+\Delta t}_{i,j} - c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta t} \end{equation}
With \(c(x_i,y_j,t_n) = c^n_{i,j}\), and so \(c(x_i,y_j,t_n + \Delta t) = c^{n + \Delta t}_{i,j}\) For the other 2 partial derivatives, they wil be discretized as follows :
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2} = \frac{c^n_{i + \Delta x,j} + c^n_{ i - \Delta x,j} - 2\times c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta x^2} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial y^2} = \frac{c^n_{i,j + \Delta y} + c^n_{i,j - \Delta y} - 2\times c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta y^2} \end{equation}
The equation can than be written as :
\begin{equation} \frac{c^{n+\Delta t}_{i,j} - c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta t} = D\times(\frac{c^n_{i + \Delta x,j} + c^n_{ i - \Delta x,j} - 2\times c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{c^n_{i,j + \Delta y} + c^n_{i,j - \Delta y} - 2\times c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta y^2}) \end{equation}
Solving the equation thanks to discretized equation
Once simplified, the approximate solution of the discretized equation can be written as follows :
\begin{equation} c^{n + \Delta t}_{i,j} = D\times(\frac{c^n_{i + \Delta x,j} + c^n_{ i - \Delta x,j} - 2\times c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{c^n_{i,j + \Delta y} + c^n_{i,j - \Delta y} - 2\times c^n_{i,j}}{\Delta"
SMS_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SMS Shenzhen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"illus subtilis levansucrase, which catalyses hydrolysis of sucrose and synthesis of levans (high molecular weight fructose polymers). It is lethal to gram-negative bacteria E-coli.’*5 And we know that scale insects secrete honeydew that contains amino acid and sugar, such as cane sugar. Those secretions can cling on the surface of the scale insect’s shell. Above all, if we put SacB gene into our E. coli, they would recognize scale insects easily and specifically. Then, if our E. coli meet some cane sugar that is placed on the surface of scale insects, the bacteria would suicide and release the pest-killing factors.
In general, we introduced three core parts in our project. First are two parts expressing enzymes that would degrade the thick layers of scale insect. Second is a part called SacB which makes sure that the powerful factors would only to secreted on the pests. With these three parts, the main body of our research has been done and our experiments were able to be carried our.
IV Product Design
According to our explanation above, it is necessary to predict the result we would get from this project. As we all know, scale insect is the nightmare of many succulent plants and fruit, so probably this project would be used in agriculture and farming.
We can design a pesticide kit that contains 3 kinds of engineered E.coli, which are separately designed to produce 3 kinds of enzymes. Farmers can easily mix them together at a certain portion and spread the pesticide to the scale insect. Since we don't want E.coli to have any competition with each other, those 3 kinds of E.coli should be cultivated and kept separately, and they would only be mixed just before people spray trees or crops with the final insecticide.
In order to eliminate the possibility of damage during transportation process from the lab or pesticide company to the customer, we collaborate with team SIAT-SCIE. The special technique developed by team SIAT-SCIE would keep our product safe and make it convenient enough for long-time transportation. Thanks to team SIAT-SCIE, our project becomes more reliable, controllable and applicable.

A broad variety of microorganisms, such as E. coli, are inhibited in growth or killed by exposure to Cu(II) (Ochoa-Herrera et al., 2011). Furthermore, copper ions can interact with oxygen by catalyzing Haber-Weiss and/or Fenton reactions. This results in the generation of ROS which can ultimately damage biomolecules (Halliwell, 2007; Halliwell & Gutteridge, 2015). Copper is toxic in both of its forms: as a nanoparticle and as dissolved ions. Therefore, an approach to decrease the toxic effect on the cell is needed.
Figure 3: Toxic effects of copper nanoparticles and copper ions on the cell. Copper nanoparticles and copper ions lead to a rising level of ROS which causes oxidative stress and damage to the DNA, proteins and the membrane.
Iron
Iron is crucial for certain biological functions and necessary for the cell in order to work properly. Especially when it comes to electron transfer reactions iron as a cofactor is critical for the formation of biomolecules (Zhang, 2014). However, free non-bound iron bears risks for the cell. Iron regularly appears as a ferrous (Fe(II)) or as a ferric ion (Fe(III)) and is able to accept an electron from neighboring molecules which leads to the generation of ROS and causes damage to cellular components. The generation of ROS occurs by Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions (Kehrer, 2000; Winterbourn, 1995). The desired iron nanoparticles should be composed of Fe2O3 which is one of the most abundant transition metal oxides and ubiquitous in the environment (Bi & Xu, 2012). Toxic effects by these nanoparticles arise from the formation of ROS by converting H2O2 or O2 (Huang et al., 2015). Further studies performed by Wang et al. (2017) regarding the photocatalytic degradation of DNA who found that the majority of intracellular damage especially concerning the DNA arises from ROS.
Reactive Oxygen Species
As most problems from heavy metals arise from the generation of ROS, the efforts to improve the resistance to their toxic effects need to focus on the repair of the damage of biomolecules and the prevention of further damage. Molecular oxygen itself cannot easily oxidize another molecule due to its spin restriction (Farr & Kogoma, 1991). However, certain cases allow oxidation of molecules by molecular oxygen, e.g. the presence of a paramagnetic center other than that of the"

A Separation Problem
Our access to easily extractable copper is gradually diminishing as demands for copper continues to grow worldwide. To meet these demands, non-traditional, metallurgically challenging deposits are expected to become more prevalent, thereby forcing us to deal with more complex, and lower-grade ores containing higher levels of impurities.  Arsenic-challenged deposits is a concern for the copper mining industry as arsenic produces hazardous fumes and oxide dusts during the smelting process. Smelting with arsenic therefore poses a significant risk to the health of the workers and to the environment. Furthermore, safe removal and disposal of stabilized arsenic is often difficult and costly.   With stricter legislation in place, the mining industry is facing increasing pressure to progressively reduce the amount of allowable arsenic concentrations for smelters. Consequently, fines and penalties are set for arsenic concentrations exceeding 0.2 %, while ores past 0.5 % arsenic concentrations are rejected by smelters. Therefore, there is increasing precedence for removing arsenic-containing minerals such as enargite (Cu3AsS4) from relevant sulfide minerals, such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), during the flotation process. However, separation is often conflicted with shared flotation properties between enargite and the associated valuable minerals. The mining industry has developed several methods for dealing with arsenic impurities, which includes precipitation with scorodite and pressure hydrometallurgical procedures (150 °C and 1380 kPa) for processing high concentration of arsenic while extracting copper in parallel. However, many procedures requires an enormous amount of energy or additional acidic chemicals to help selectively separate arensic-containing minerals in the ore mixtures.
Our solution: Mineral Binding
We, the UBC iGEM team, feel that separation and enrichment can be done in other ways that does not rely on energy or chemically-intensive methods. Our synbio solution involves the use of small surface heptapeptides and octapeptides, which have previously been demonstrated in M13 bacteriophage"

Selection plates
The plates put after 16 hours in the incubator have a lawn of very small colonies growing very slowly. The selection with no plasmid is not growing on NM, as expected, but we do see colonies on the negative control library plate. However, there are clearly a lot more cells on the Zif268 positive control, and the dilutions seem to have colony amounts in between or similar to the negative control library plate.
We will try several different variations:
plate 1uL of each saturated culture on NM+spec (or plain NM in the case of the selection strain without plasmid)
plate 100uL of each washed saturated culture on NM+10mM 3-AT

Selection plates and cultures
1uL NM plates: not much is growing on even the Zif268 control. 1uL may not be enough to plate in minimal media. We will let them continue growing to see if anything shows up.
100uL 10mM 3-AT plates: looks very promising!  Zif268 has lots of small colonies, and the amount of growth steps down through the dilutions. The negative control library shows practically no growth at all. We will also keep these in the incubator to see if that helps makes the differences even clearer.
NM+his liquid cultures: none of them are as saturated as we would like, so we'll leave them in longer.

Results of transoformation
We got colonies! We did not run a second background test yesterday, but based on the previous background plate (which contained the same backbone used in this reaction) most of our colonies should have the insert.
The best plate was the 2:1 insert to backbone ligation. The 8:1 reaction had a similar number of colonies, as well. The 3:1 and 5:1 plates had far fewer.
We performed 4 2 mL minipreps (with yields of approximately 100 ng/ul for all) on the 2:1 culture and made 4 1.5 mL glycerol stocks.

Last week, we digested fadE and fadD inserts and stored them. This week, we ran the digested B beta-oxidation part on a low melting point (LMP) gel and recovered the part by excising it from the gel. The gel containing the B Beta oxidation insert was melted at 65°C and ligation protocol was performed. We then transformed the plasmid into competent DH5α. C Beta Oxidation was also ligated with pET29b(+) vectors and transformed into competent DH5α. The pET29b(+)-fadE and pET29b(+)-fadD transformants colonies were observed after the overnight incubation. A master plate and overnight cultures of selected colonies from each plate were made. The vectors were isolated, digested for confirmation of insert, and ran 1% agarose gel.

After entering the numbers into the excel sheet we were able to calculate the standard curve of fluorescence for FITC concentration. Our results can be seen in figure 1.

Cell measurement protocol
Finally, after finishing all the calibrations, we did the transformations of five plasmids (three devices, positive and negative control). We succeeded only on our third time. The plasmids we received in the measurement kit [3] were dried out so we had to resuspend them in 100µLs of diH2O. Almost everything was done according to the transformation protocol [4] . Few differences were that after resuspending dried up DNA we were supposed to add 5µL it but we added 10µL. Then for the transformation of device 1 we did the heat shock for 70 seconds instead of 60. Also, we had to keep plates with colonies in the fridge for about three weeks due to some reasons. Therefore, we decided to do the restreaking of all colonies. Later these new colonies were used for cell cultures.
After growing of cell cultures was done we measured their OD600. Later, after diluting the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 and completing other necessary procedures we measured the hourly recording. Results can be found in figures 2 and 3.

Our team is made up of engineers first. Biologists and students of medicine complete us. We were brought together by the Georgiev Lab whose engineering and innovation philosophy set the bar for all ideas and activities. We strive to make synthetic biology more comprehensible and bearable to engineers. This is the first iGEM team from the Czech Republic, hence the name. In a country where synthetic biology still lacks footing, we are outsiders in all of our respective departments. This brings us close together to a single lab from multiple corners of our country. In the months of hard work on the IOD band, our own band of friends and lab geeks emerged.

It goes without saying that these wiki pages are primarily the work of all team members with constant language corrections and comments on content clarity coming from the advisors and instructors. The advisors kept the work on track and helped answer the tough questions. They also checked wiki pages related to their field of expertise. The instructors were closely involved keeping the message clear and the team on track to reaching the goals. The external help was indispensable providing advice on medical topics where team expertise was lacking.
