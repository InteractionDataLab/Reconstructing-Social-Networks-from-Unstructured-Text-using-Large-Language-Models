Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Tubes with 1 µg/µL to 100 µg/µL clavulanic acid showed no growth while tubes with 0.001 µg/µL to 0.1 µg/µL clavulanic acid showed normal growth.
Wednesday, September 18, 2013
Investigators: Jan
On Wednesday, we repeated the experiment we did on Monday with a different scale of concentration steps to more precisely determine the best concentration of clavulanic acid for future experiments. Unfortunately, all samples showed growth so no further distinction could be made.
Hence, we went ahead with the 1 µg/ml of clavulanic acid we determined on Monday to remove background expression of beta-lactamase. We applied this information to a certain growth behavior of E. coli JM109 bacteria transformed with our final construct (K1073034). Therefore, we cultivated this strain in 2x YT media with ampicillin and clavulanic acid. Out of four cultures, only two contained the inducer necessary for successful induction of ampicillin resistance.
Thursday, September 19, 2013
Investigators: Jan
Liquid cultures of 2x YT media with ampicillin and 1 µg/ml clavulanic acid were inoculated at different ratios (based on OD520) of E. coli JM109::K1073034 and E. coli Top10F'::K1073035. Each culture was additionally performed with chloramphenicol instead of ampicillin as unregulated control. Unfortunately the concentration of clavulanic acid was too high and no growth was observed.
Week 19: September 22 - September 28, 2013
This week started with the last continuous cultivation, which in contrast to earlier ones was performed with added beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid). On Wednesday, we repeated last weeks experiment to investigate the ratio of bacterial growth if both strains (E. coli JM109::K1073034 and E. coli Top10F'::K1073035) are cultivated together under different conditions and with varying inoculation ratios. This was a really tough last week, no wounder that people going crazy at the lab.

Fig. 6-3-3-2. After inhibiting expression of GFP by MazF, it was resuscitated by expression of MazE．
In this experiment, MazF was expressed by arabinose, and after 2 h MazE was expressed by IPTG.
From the results, it was found that the turbidity of the sample without MazE almost did not rise at all. However, it was also found that if IPTG is added, and the MazE will be expressed, the E. coli will recover its growth.
Also, if only the MazF is working, the RFU of GFP barely rise. If MazE is induced, the RFU of GFP will rise. Read mazEF system Assay page .
As the result above, we concluded that MazF inhibits the E. coli's growth and translation. However, MazE resuscitates the growth and translation stopped by MazF.
Althrough this experiment, we indicated that the TA system functions properly.
4． Degredation of C12 by AmiE
Here it is indicated that AmiE degrades AHL selectively. We performed an experiment using BBa_K1949052 .
Fig. 6-3-4-1. AmiE degrades C12   Fig. 6-3-4-2. AmiE barely degrades C４
C12 is greatly degraded. On the other hand, the C4 is barely degraded by AmiE.
In this experiment, it was examined whether AHLs would be degraded after the addition of 3OC12HSL(C12) and C4HSL(C4) molecules into a culture of E. coli that expresses AmiE.
From the results, it was found that the C12 added into a culture of AmiE expressing E. coli is greatly degraded. On the other hand, the C4 added into this culture, is barely degraded.
From the above result, we showed that AmiE selectively degraded AHL molecules.

In order to provide more people in general with a more accurate information about E. coli, gene reconfiguration, and synthetic biology, we planed to conduct some School-visits. Finally, we have managed to give the classes to 269 middle and high school students of 6 schools. Furthermore, these activities were good opportunities for us to know how our project impacted on the general public.

Parameters:
Km : Michaelis constant of transcription
Kmu: Michaelis constant of translation
δ: mRNA rate of degradation
λ: mRNA maximum rate of synthesis
k: Repressor rate of synthesis
Kiu: Dissociation constant of repression
γ: Cooperativity of inhibition by the repressor
Before describing the reactions’ equations, we describe the assumptions made:
Repression is modeled as an inhibition of the mRNA synthesis. Instead of considering the repression as a different process, we include this effect into the Michaelis-Menten equation as a modifier of the Michaelis constant Km, assuming that the protein binds competitively with the RNAp to the promoter site, and knowing that the repressor may form multimers.
Due to the high values of the RNAp and ribosomes concentration versus promoter concentration, we can assume that the Michaelis-Menten rate law may change into a mass action rate law. Although this assumption is valid for the transcription process, the rate constant changes his value according to the repressor level.
The reactions considered, and the rates of change of the produced species are listed here:
Transcription + Repression 1:
RNAp + promoter1 + repressor1 → RNAp + promoter1 + repressor1 + mRNA1
Transcription + Repression 2:
RNAp + promoter2 + repressor2 → RNAp + promoter2 + repressor2 + mRNA2
Tanslation 1:
mRNA1 + ribosomes → mRNA1 + ribosomes + repressor2
Translation 2:
mRNA2 + ribosomes → mRNA2 + ribosomes + repressor1
mRNA1/mRNA2 Degradation:
mRNA1 → null
mRNA2 → null
Repressor1/Repressor2 Degradation:
repressor1 → null
repressor2 → null
You can download the full Simbiology model of the Basic Flip-Flop here:
Simulations
When we initially consider the same concentrations of each species, if we let the system evolve the simulation offers the following result:
The repressor2 wins the competition: this effect is due to the stronger expression of the repressor2
But if we establish a higher initial concentration to the repressor1 mRNA:
Now, repressor1 wins. We can see that the maximum level reached by repressor1 is lower.
With these simulations we can see how the system is able to work on two different points.
Once the basic operation is described, next we consider the inclusions of actuators to modify the state of the flip-flop,"

Further information
Aptamers, originally having been conceived as an alternative to antibodies have proven notoriously difficult to properly select, against the multitude of targets available in nature. With our software [INSERT_NAME] you can find your own aptamer to target the ligand you want. To acheive this, we use an algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence minimizing the entropy of binding to the ligand. What enables this, is a combination of stratified sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. With this contact form, you can send us ligands, which for we will then compute aptamer candidates. To do this, we need crystal structures of those ligands, which have to follow a few rules for swift processing.
The format should be .pdb for proteins, and .pdb or .mol2 for small molecules.
In the case of small molecules, please take the time to run a semi-empirical quantum chemical calculation of its parameters using the following command in ambertools: antechamber -i [INPUT_NAME].pdb -fi pdb -o [OUTPUT_NAME].mol2 -fo mol2 -c bcc -s 2 where you substitute [INPUT_NAME] and [OUTPUT_NAME] with the respective filenames. Please then submit the .mol file.
The files should contain no waters, unless you need, for some reason, an aptamer for water (which would not work).
Protein files should contain no prosthetic groups or cofactors. This would require separate quantum-chemical handling for parameter estimation before processing.
Proteins should contain no nonstandard amino acids, not contained in Amber parameters.
For proteins, which are very large, please consider, if targeting a specific domain of that protein would be sufficient, or even beneficial to your project. Very large proteins could incur penalties on the software's performance.

Background
Dipteran fly damage
Dipteran fly damage (stress on the animal) can be divided into direct and indirect hazards.
Direct hazards:
1) Bite, harassment: sucking mosquitoes, sand flies, gnats, midges and flies and other insects can be stabbed vampire, was bitten at itching, severe papules-like urticaria, affecting the normal life and production of animals.
2) Cause allergic reactions: arthropod salivary glands, secretions, excretions and shedding of the epidermis have all heterologous protein which can cause allergic reactions.
3) Parasitic: parasite larvae parasite can cause myiasis, for example, after bovine fly larvae parasitic in the bovine skin, the fur is perforated because of the larvae 'growth, which will lower its use value, at the same time, myiasis can also cause the decline in the quality of beef and the sharply drop in the amount of cattle milk.
Indirect hazards:
Many species of Diptera are used of vector insects in the transmission of pathogens between animals, pathogens, including bacteria, parasites, viruses and rickettsia and so on. Such as mosquito-borne malaria, filariasis, yellow fever and dengue fever, etc.
Chrysopa lucidum, Chrysanthemum, Chlamydomonas, Carassius auratus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mosquitoes, gadfly and midges and other insect’ bites can make dairy cows infected with mastitis, which is one of the common breast disease during summer and dry milk.
Whether it is direct or indirect harm, the final result always affects the normal life and production of animals.
Fruit fly
The fruit ﬂy Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most powerful genetically tractable model organisms. Work using Drosophila has made many valuable contributions to our understanding of animal development, behavior, and physiology and of human disease. While Drosophila is also a member of Dipteran fly.
UAS-GAL4
In yeast, GAL4 regulates the galactose metabolism, transcriptional activation of galactose utilization genes occurs when GAL4 binds to the upstream activation sequence (UAS) containing a varying number of a 17-mer repeat. GAL4 binds to DNA as a dimer through a Zn (2)-Cys (6) zinc ﬁnger. The N-terminal region mediates both dimerization and DNA binding and contains a nuclear localization signal, while an acidic C-terminal domain controls"

1. How warriors kill enemies:
    AHL1 in warrior I excretes AHL1. AHL1 goes into its enemies and forms a complex with the protein AHL1R. This complex activates the promoter Pahl1, thus activating the expression of LacI. The expression of LacI inhibits the promoter Plac, thus inhibiting the expression of cmR. Because we culture our E. coli in medium containing chloramphenicol, warrior I kills its enemies. As AHL1 does not form a complex with protein AHL2R inside E. coli from warrior I’s group, thus we fulfill our desire that warrior I just kill the enemies but not bacteria from it own group. Warrior Il works in a similar way.
2. How farmers provide nutrients:
    RafD encodes invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose. The signal peptide of HlyA ligated to RafD can help the invertase be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence. This is our new part. Besides, combining with extrinsic HlyB, HlyD and intrinsic TolC from the nucleoid in E. coli together form the transporter which helps the invertase to be secreted.
    This whole part is designed to produce a secretory invertase. As our E. coli can use glucose but not sucrose as its carbon source, farmers fulfill the role of providing nutrients.

Title
Reprogramming microbes to cater to or silence their hosts - beta carotene production and RNAi delivery
Project Abstract
Humans contain billions of microbes which help digest our food and produce vitamins to suppliment  our diet, while plants such as corn harbour microbes within their tissues  which can extend the metabolic capacity of their host. In an attempt to  exploit these patterns of microbial habitation, we built constructs which were inserted into                         the broad host range plasmid pDSK-GFPuv to contain either a synthetic operon of metabolic genes  belonging to the soil microbe Erwinia uredovora, or Biobrick compatible  RNAi constructs targetting the plant expression of either GFP or corn TB1 genes. These plasmids were to be electroporated into either probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 or endophytic  Klebsiella pneumonii 342. Assays will then show whether a genetically modified  enteric microbe could be made to produce vitamin A in a modelled human intestine,  or whether a common corn endophyte could stably express and deliver RNAi  signals against expression of GFP and corn TB1 genes while living inside a growing corn plant.
Overall project
Microbes are found in every nook and cranny of the planet, and multicellular organisms are no exception. Plants and animals are found to contain huge numbers of bacteria and fungi that help with nutrient absorption, producing beneficial compounds, fighting off pathogens, or often are pathogens themselves. We are interested in taking advantage of some of these microbes to deliver transgenic payloads for the benefit or modification of the host organism. These might be called GM endosymbionts. On the human side, we would like to introduce the carotendoid metabolic genes from a well studied soil microbe called Erwinia urodovora into human probiotic microbes which will survive and colonize the intestine for stable production of the essential human nutrient, pro-vitamin A. Time permitting, we will attempt to enhance carotenoid accumulation by increasing plasma membrane sink by overexpression of the fumarate reductase operon.

We even went on to attempt a β-galactosidase assay with the new construct, and achieved some fairly high activity with the plasmid. However, this activity did not correlate with the test KNO3 concentrations (see the page on β-galactosidase assays for the data collected during this test, along with all the other repeats run during the project). With this information, we decided to have the construct sequenced, a procedure we would have to have done in any case, and awaited the results.
After around an hour of confusion on receiving the sequencing data, we found the reason behind the odd results - the PyeaR sequence had disappeared from the construct! With no explanation as to how this may have happened, we quickly rethought our plans and returned to the BBa_K216009 part in order to get some usable characterisation data, and sadly abandoned our attempt to create a PyeaR+LacZ construct.

SynBio Intro
High School Visits
After participating in the iGEM competition, all of us had an idea of what synthetic biology was and what it could do for human. We thought it was our responsibility to let the public know more about synthetic biology and have a rational understanding of it. So we went to three high schools to hold lectures. We hoped that those students would then introduce synthetic biology to others, just like Pay It Forward.
In the lecture, we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM. When introducing synthetic biology, we emphasized the idea of standardization. We also delivered an idea that synthetic biology is not creating life but creating life for practical purposes. What’s more, we showed students the application and research achievements of synthetic biology. After talking about synthetic biology, we introduced iGEM. We showed them some interesting project and invited them to participate in the competition.
In the Q&A time, those students asked many questions.Here we listed three kind of questions  that most students asked:
1. questions about the safety and ethic issues.
2. questions about the difference between synthetic biology and genetic engineering
3. questions about iGEM competition
Pro He answered all the questions patiently based on his understanding of synthetic biology. Students clapped for his beautiful and scientific answers. After the lecture, many students showed interest in High School iGEM competition. We introduced details of iGEM competition to them and welcome them to our school to have some corporation. SUSTC-Shenzhen-A team made a handbook of synthetic biology. The biology club member in Shenzhen High School took more than 100 handbooks, saying that they want to introduce synthetic biology to others. Hearing this, we felt so happy because it was really like Pay It Forward.
We hoped that more and more people have an understanding of synthetic biology and participate in the field of synthetic biology.

Reformed Plasmid Result
We designed four reformed plasmids, pBluescript II KS(+) ScaI deletion, pBluescript II KS(+) EcoRV deletion, pBluescript II KS(+)_3_copy, pBluescript II KS(+)_5_copy. And we tested their co-transformation ability and got the result picture. All of these plasmids have Amp antibiotic resistance.
We co-transformed pRSFDuet-1 and two plasmids, pBluescript II KS(+) ScaI deletion & pBluescript II KS(+) EcoRV deletion, respectively. So the plate has two antibiotic resistance, Kan and Amp. We cultured two different strains on the plate and got the result picture.
Figure 2.1.1 Two plates of Co-transfected bacteria (pBluescript II KS(+) ScaI deletion & pBluescript II KS(+) EcoRV deletion)
Moreover, we verified our pBluescript II KS(+)_3_copy, pBluescript II KS(+)_5_copy part through lacl & blue-white spot screening.
Figure 2.1.2 Two plates of lacl & blue-white spot screening
So we have experimentally validated that our reformed plasmids perform as expected.
Function Identification of TAL USB
The membrane anchor system (ssDsbA-Lgt) comes from iGEM12_SJTU-BioX-Shanghai BBa_K771000. In order to connect TAL protein designed by 2012 Freiburg iGEM team, the TAL USB also consists of T1 sequence, T14 sequence and two sites for type II restriction enzyme BsmBI.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour33_-_-_TEXT.html," profitable at a price above 4 % that of mAbs, which corresponds to a price of 0.07 [million USD/g]. It is most unlikely that investors can be paid back at this price, and should be taken as an indication of the margin in pricing. In this estimate it will be possible to raise prices by 44 % before exceeding the goal. Another uncertainty is the validity of the estimate, since this is only an approximation of reality. Therefore the same calculations were done, if the cost turns out to be double. This showed profitability at a price set at 8 % that of mAbs, which corresponds to a price of 0.13 [million USD/g].  This leads to the conclusion, that there is a good possibility of making a profitable enterprise, and it should be encourage to keep working towards more accurate estimates and finally the realization of PAST.

Marburg,2016,Team:Marburg#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," probability: The probability that an individual survives a release into wild life even though the kill switch should                 have killed it. Since mutations gradually change the kill switch’s parameters over the incubation time, the escape probability is a measure for how robust the                 kill switch’s topology is in terms of evolutionary stability.
Implementation
The computationally most expensive step is solving the differential equation for \(\vec{X}(t)\) for all substances and all \(N\) individuals at each time point. Each simulation                 is executed multiple times to obtain statistical relevance.
The algorithm including all numerics has been implemented in Python [10] to run on multiple CPU cores in parallel. The systems of ODEs are generally not                 solvable analytically. Thus, we have used a stiff ODE integrator to compute the solutions [11] .
The full code including extensive documentation, further optimizations and a user-friendly framework is available upon request                 (Martin Lellep, martin.lellep@physik.uni-marburg.de ).
Kill Switch Database
The tool we develop can be applied to arbitrary kill switches. In order to provide a good starting points for future iGEM teams                 to quantify kill switches with our tool, we created a database of all kill switches ever implemented in iGEM since 2004.
This database comprises all the years and teams that implemented a kill switch. For each kill switch we summarized the used parts,                 toxins and their antagonists. In particular, the included pictures of the kill switch topologies will safe future teams a lot of                 work. Find the kill switch database here:
Kill Switch Database
Summary
We introduced further steps in the general genetic algorithm to adapt it to our needs. Not the individual with the highest fitness is computed but rather the                 escape probability of individuals after incubation time due to mutations. We accomplished this by using an integration of ODEs to update the population from                 one to another time step.
The results section will present the simulated kill switches' dynamics, incubation time rescaling by the mutation rates and the evolutionary stability                 algorithm's findings in terms of escape probabilities. We provide general statements on how a kill switch topology should be designed for future                 constructs.

iGEM China Community
This year, USTC-China Team cooperated with SYSU-China and founded a online/offline community for iGEMers in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. More than 30 teams has been involved in it and benefit from the openness in this community ( more info ). The USTC-China team helped the building of community website, collecting member information as a organizer; and USTC-China is also a active participator in the online discussion. We are trying to keep this community running continuously and independently. So this is not a single-year project, if you are interested to join, welcome to contact the mail address (contact AT igemcc.org) for further information.
Propagation in Social Network
Online propagation is becoming an increasingly important approach to introducing iGEM and synthetic biology.
Sina Weibo
Our project is featured on Sina Weibo for Weibo is a good entrance to all the public in China and we get in touch with many teams in China. This platform helps us communicate with each other and propagate much more biology knowledge to the public.
Facebook

BNDS_China,2016,Team:BNDS China#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," high school student had synthesized a special type of bacteria, enabling it to clean up plastics waste in a river. I was amazed by how conveniently the problem was addressed and that using synthetic biology to solve problems is not too complicated, for a high school student at least. I soon realized that synthetic biology was a great tool to solve problems in environment, energy and healthcare. I believe it still has many untapped potential and my goal in the future is to develop it and makes it a common tool to solve not only big problems but our daily problems as well.
Greetings, everybody! I’m Michael Wang from Beijing National Day School Grade 11, international program. I feel grateful to be a member of our school’s IGEM team and to discover a brand new method correlates to water purification. As a passionate worker I am in charge of going through the actual experiment and practical methods. I have learnt a lot from my teammates, our team mentor as well as some other students who shared the same interest of the topic as I do. I am pretty confident that our team can accomplished our task through our hardworks!
Hello, my name is Wang Ziqi. I am a 12 graders in Beijing National Day School. I have studied biology for over three years, and I really love this subject. The intention of my doing iGEM competition was to brainstorm as much as possible and to learn more technologies which I didn’t get chance to study on. There are many talent students in my team, so I have learned a lot from them as well. After doing iGEM for few months, I think I am more erudite. I gain lots of knowledges about lab, for example, I know how to make LB medium, how to do the electrophoresis, etc.. As far as I am concerned, studying in a lab can nurture not only our scientific knowledge, but also our manual dexterity and ability. Therefore, I really encourage others to come and attend this competition if they want. I think iGEM helps me a lot.
Hi, I’m Ellen Yuanyi Xu from Beijing National Day School Grade 12. I’ve taken Biology for 2 years and it’s so glad for me to participate iGEM competition with my wonderful teammates. I enjoy the moment of staying in the lab for hours and come up with a successful result! Doing the project teaches many new things outside textbook, and I can demonstrate Biological concepts that used be vague and far away from me. Working with my brilliant teammates offer me a chance to learn more and I really appreciate the moment we spend together. I’m pretty sure"

Introduction
Like the fact that one chopstick is easy-break while ten chopsticks are hard to break off, iGEM is a team competition, which need not only cooperation in own team but also collaboration with other teams.This year, ZJU-China have worked with four teams tightly and participated many teamworks.
Take a look at our collaboration.
UCAS
UCAS is our important fellow iGEM team.We have established initial relationship as early as team building.We first participated in their questionnaire survey about security law problem raised by transgenosis technologies or related products, and we also helped them collect more than 70 samples in our university.
When we did molecular cloning experiments to build our BioBricks, it was difficult to build this part(BBa_K2207021) which has four repeated short  sequences on its forepart.UCAS used Goldgate method to link 17 Oligonucleotides and successfully builded this BioBricks for us.We combined this part with mRFP to respond to the Calcium influx in yeast which is an upstream signal in our transduction system.
Fig.1 The transformed E.coli that UCAS sent to us.
When UCAS was trying to investigate the ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen content of different waterbody, we helped them to gather water samples from our local waterbodies even from our own fish tank. We adapted  Peking University’s Taipu kit and UV spectrophotometry to detect the ammoniacal and nitrate nitrogen content of these samples.
What’s more, we also detected the contents of four metallic elements in these samples with ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer). The four elements are potassium，sodium，calcium and magnesium. The equipment is Agilent-700 ICP-OES from Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University. We have discard the impurity through filtration and adjust the pH value to 2.0"

Pili were considered but then abandoned due to its virulent characteristics in some bacteria, which may lead to pathogenic consequences (ex: using pili of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pathogenic to human body)
E.coli were considered because they are very well adapted to the laboratory environment, are easy to keep alive, can be fairly easy modified, and they no longer have the ability to thrive inside the intestines.
Furthermore, they have used their risk-assessment guidelines to describe the safety of each of our contributed parts, which included four dimensions and several related questions:
General use-What type of lab should work with this BioBrick be done in?......etc.
Potential pathogenicity-Does this BioBrick produce anything that plays an significant role in environmental processes?…. etc.
Environmental impact-Does this BioBrick produce anything that plays an significant role in environmental processes?...... etc.
Possible malign use-Can your chosen host be arosoled? Does this BioBrick increase the host’s ability to vaporize?……etc.
Each part was accomplished by BLASTed the sequences of their parts, searching for the function and homologs of the pars, considering and assessing the questions mentioned earlier. Among all parts, only hyperflagellation part was considered to increase the pathogenicity of bacteria. However, the bacteria they chose are unable to survive and reproduce outside of laboratory conditions.
(2)Laws and guidelines
Risk assessment
Based on the current UN and Denmark rules and law for genetically modified microorganisms (GMM's), risk-assessment was developed by listing some questions as assessment factors for evaluation, so that they can judge if our use of GMM's poses a threat towards the well-being or safety of human beings, animals, plants, or the environment.
Substitution
In a suitable system, compatible with the intended work, that is safer for humans, animals and plants, or the environment is always significant, which might be achieved by substituting the other, more dangerous system. In their study, though the E.coli strain they used (MG1655 and TOP10 strains) was harmless, issues of substitution was also taken into consideration due to the laws and guideline in UN and Denmark.
Assessment by local bio-safety group
Al the members of their team attended laboratory safety course from the Committee for Students’ Laboratory Safety to ensure everyone knew basic safety precautions before entering laboratories. For their project, all the experiments were done in security level 1 laboratories, and no"

After running the gel, the concentrations of CpI 1, CpI 2 and CpI 3 were much lower compared to the chromoprotein genes (see gel picture). Amplification of CpI 3 failed. The problem was an alteration to the primers necessary for amplification. Re-ran PCR for CpI 3. Modification: Appropriate primers (P13 & P22) and the extension phase of PCR has been reduced from 2 min to 15 sec since N7 is only ~300bp long. The DNA was then purified using the QIAGEN QiaQuick Gel Purification Kit. The DNA was eluted in 50 ul of EB buffer. Due to the large elution volume and the lower yield of the backbone DNA, the concentrations (measured using Nanodrop) were lower than the suggested 10ng/ul threshold for Gibson.

Hypothesis 4: Increased expression of RFP due to increased osmotic pressure
After successfully cloning the RFP+OmpR construct into the low copy number plasmid pSB4A5, we tested the activity of the promoter by using the same protocol as for the YFP testing.
When using RFP instead of YFP, we obtained reliable and conclusive results (figure 5). Now we could observe a significant increase in fluorescence of the samples, in comparison to the negative control, as shown in figure 7. It was noted that, the fluorescence intensity (at wavelength 580 nm ± 10 and emission length 627 nm ± 30) of the salt gradient cultures was very low in comparison to those in the sucrose gradient.
Throughout the growth curve, the fluorescence also increased with the increasing sucrose concentration (figure 6). However, the bacteria grown in 15% sucrose did not grow past OD 0.3 and therefore no results were obtained regarding the highest sucrose concentration for higher OD values. It is still to be noted that there is a significant increase in fluorescence when increasing sucrose concentration.
Figure 5. Average fluorescence of RFP at OD 0.3, only sucrose and controls.
Figure 6. Fluorescence of RFP over OD values, samples cultivated in sucrose gradient.
We could unfortunately not draw any conclusions from the salt gradient. As previously mentioned, the fluorescence intensity was very low in comparison to the sucrose gradient and at the same time no trend could be observed (figure 8). As demonstrated by figure 9, there was almost no difference in fluorescence between the samples, at any point in the growth curve.
We had designed the NaCl experiment on the results obtained by iGEM UCL 2015 where the team had used NaCl concentrations between 0.05% and 0.1% but had concluded that these were too high for the OmpR promoter. We therefore designed our experiment with lower concentrations, between 0.00625% and 0.1%, but still we did not see any conclusive results.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," complexity (FR1.3.1), our current design had two subunit types meaning that a most appropriate reaction pathway would be one that only required two enzymes.
Iteration 1 – Plastic Degrading Enzymes
Initially, it was proposed that we work with novel plastic degrading enzymes, PETase and MHETase. These enzymes were isolated in 2016 from a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F617. They were found to be involved extracellular enzymatic PET degradation, and their use in metabolic engineering could have widespread impacts for our plastic dependent society. However, quantifying the enzymatic activity of PETase and MHETase was considered to be relatively difficult. A previous iGEM team, Tianjin 2016 , attempted this with cell-free protein expression which does not directly or clearly show the alteration in product titre. An alternative suggestion was to use electron microscopy to physically measure plastic degradation, however this would have presented challenges for our team regarding training and funding. So, despite the benefits that could come from using such a metabolic pathway in our scaffold, it was evident that using this plastic degrading pathway would not be the best method of achieving proof of concept for our scaffolding system. Instead, the team decided to look for a more feasible pathway that would involve the synthesis of a product that was easier to measure and quantify.
Iteration 2 – The IAA Pathway
This led us to consider using the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis pathway:
This metabolic pathway involves the conversion of tryptophan, a simple amino acid, to IAA using enzymes tryptophan 2-monooxygenase (IaaM) and indole-3-acetamide hydrolase (IaaH)18. In practice, IAA has a role in promoting plant root growth and has been shown to be chemically labile and easily metabolised by plants, by the 2011 iGEM Imperial College London team . The biosynthesis of IAA can also easily be assessed in the lab. Previous iGEM teams who have worked on enzyme scaffolding projects, such as ZJU-China 2012 and NUDT-China 2015 , used this two-step enzyme reaction and developed protocols, standard curves to quantify IAA biosynthesis.
On evaluation of this pathway, it was clear to us why previous teams had chosen to work with it, providing the ideal features to satisfy some of our functional requirements:

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," on a synthetic alternative for palm kernel oil in E. coli. Would you use in this way produced oil?
It sounds very interesting. The prerequisite for being able to use products from such a new source would be correspondence to certain characteristics that are important for candle production. Penetration is such a characteristic for example. It describes how soft a material is at a certain temperature. Other important characteristics are melting temperature, viscosity, colour, transparency in liquid form, odour, etc.
Which other (native) oils are in use?
Apart from ample supply and an acceptable price, palm oil has the advantage that is does not necessarily have to be chemically hardened, depending on the type of candle of course. It is possible to physically fractionate palm oil into a liquid and solid fraction, and the latter can be used directly in some candle types. But I would say that the largest part that is used is hardened.
Other oils and fats can be used too, at least theoretically. One example is soy which is often used on the US market. Its use is rather low in Europe, mostly because of the considerably higher price compared to other raw materials. Another alternative you can find on the market are candles made of canola, but rarely because of the higher price.
GMOs are a big topic. We work with GMOs, but in the final product wouldn't be any remains left. Would this find usage in the candle industry?
In the end this question can only be answered by each candle manufacturer individually, or, more precisely, by their customers. There are some prejudices against using GMOs. I think one would have to be very transparent and communicate this to customers, both professional ones and the end-consumers, to find out if this is an option.
Do you think the end-consumers would accept it more likely, if we could purify it, that no trace GMOs remains?
I can't answer that for sure, but I know of more than enough examples where this was and is the case. For example, with rennet in cheese production, where it is obviously well accepted. But one should concentrate on the specific case.
How important is environmental protection for the candle industry?
Very important! There are many candle manufacturers of course, and for some it is more important than for others. But generally speaking, the candle industry attaches very high importance to protecting the environment.
Where does the palm oil of your member companies come from?

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#rMFC#GeneticalApproach_-_-_TEXT.html," the E. coli cell. For that we are going to use the outer membrane porine OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) provided by iGEM Team Bielefeld-Germany 2013 .  Crossing the periplasmatic space, the mediator adsorbs at the inner membrane of the E. coli cell. Electrons have to be transferred into the cytoplasm, but the mediator should not enter the cell, because regeneration at the electrode is absolutely necessary. So membrane proteins are required to transfer electrons trough the inner membrane. We looked for different oxidoreductase systems located in bacterial respiration system (shown in figure 3).
Figure 2:  The electron flow mediated by redox active mediator
(for example neutral red) in interaction with fumarate reductase
in E. coli cell. The electrochemical reduced mediator has to cross
outer membrane via genome integrated outer membrane porines OprF.
The fumarate reductase in the inner bacterial membrane get electrons
from the mediator for reduction of fumarate into succinate
in the cytoplasm. Excretion of succinate is avoid becuase of
knocked out C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB.
We focused on respiratory complex II, which contains the fumarate reductase (Frd) and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh). Last one catalyzes the oxidation of succinate into fumarate by transferring electrons to FAD+ generating FADH2. ( Iverson et al., 1999 ; Richardson et al., 1999 ) FADH2 enter the electron transport chain and achieves proton translocation over the inner bacterial membrane. The proton motoric force is used by ATP synthase. Generated ATP effects an increasing metabolic activity. ( Gottschalk et al., 1986 )
So our aim is to generate a succinate overage in the cytoplasm by increased fumarate reductase activity. The reduced mediator functions as an electron donor for the fumarate reductase. Reduction and oxidation between fumarate and succinate creates a loop into the citric acid cycle. In fact electrons are transferred from the mediator to FAD+ regenerating ATP via the electron transport chain. This concept was successfully shown in succinate producing Actinobacillus succinogenes by Park et al., 1999 .   Naturally E. coli cells release overproduced succinate into the medium. This occurs especially under anaerobic conditions because bacteria use fumarate as a final electron acceptor instead of oxygen."

Formal Lab Session - 18th August 2009
Overview
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - recovered sleB/cwlJ spores using given protocol
Metal Sensor Team - transformed E. coli with BBa_J33206 from Spring Distributions and prepared for test PCR of pGFP-rrnB in B. subtilis genome
Stochastic Switch Team - following the failed transformations from the last lab session, the team carried out a second attempt at transforming E. coli with 7 BioBricks from Spring Distributions
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
Summary
Jane plating out sleB and cwlJ germinated spores.
Today, the moment of truth, the recovery of spores cwlD seemed to have worked judging from the results . A big sigh of relief from our team.
Since it has been confirmed that the problem was that insufficient lysozyme stock solution was added, and that the current amount of lysozyme stock solution now works, we proceeded with the treatment for the recovery of spores sleB and cwlJ. The only and main difference is that the spores after treatment were plated out on plates with Kan and Em antibiotic.
Iodine crystals.
Performing the iodine test in the fume cabinet.
We also performed the iodine test, as can be seen from the pictures above, which came back with good results .
Lastly, we also made up a new batch of LB solution for common use.

Concerns about accidental leakage of GMO
Advancement in science and engineering has led us to the era of synthetic biology. By reprogramming living things at DNA level, synthetic biologists could introduce new characteristics or modify existing properties to create synthetic organisms for the sake of human well-beings. For example, bacteria and yeast have been engineered for drug production that can hardly be obtained in nature1 and for cleaning-up large scale environmental pollution2. Given the rapid development of synthetic biology, more sophisticated organisms with de novo applications may be created in the future. Meanwhile the expanding applications of synthetic biology have also raised public concerns over the risk of accidental leakage of synthetic organisms which may jeopardize the ecosystem and public health3,4.
Control of leakage
Although no one has fully understood the actual impacts of escaped synthetic organisms on the environment yet, various containment policies have been adopted to minimize accidental leakage of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Physical containment, such as proper handling of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM) with suitable containment equipment and implementation of laboratory practice is one of the simplest way to prevent escape of synthetic organisms3. However this strategy may not be applicable to open-setting applications, for example biomining5 and biosensing6 which often involve deliberate dispersal of GMO covering large area.
To address this problem, intrinsic containment or ‘built-in safeguard’ have been developed to control unintentional release of GMM. One of them is to design auxotrophic organisms by removing metabolic pathways responsible for synthesizing essential nutrients, such that modified organisms can only survive in the environment with addition of essential nutrients7. Alternatively, lethality can be induced by built-in killswitch which will be activated when GMM escape from specific environment. For instance, iGEM13_BGU_Israel has designed an IPTG-and-arabinose-regulated repressible killswitch using holin and lysozyme, in which escape from medium containing IPTG or arabinose would lead to lysis of bacterial cell wall, and hence cell death.
Toxin-based killswitches seem to be effective in eliminating escaped GMM but undestroyed plasmid and chromosomal DNA could remain intact in the environment for months8. Moreover, a recent astrobiological research has demonstrated that up to 35% of plasmid DNA remain functional even after expose to high temperature and pressure"

The concentrations of the results from the gel extraction were checked using a Nanodrop. Lastly, the mutant strains with csgA and without csgA were each inoculated onto plates with LB and Kanamycin and with just LB respectively, and these plates were stored in an incubator overnight to grow.
Thursday (08/03/17)
Sense/Respond: Today the students got back to work on the sense plasmid. The students performed a PCR, because finally their primers came in. The PCR product was ran on the gel and the students got the results they were hoping for. Next, they performed a MiniElute Reaction Cleanup Kit and then conducted a Nanodrop. The Nanodrop were high concentrations of DNA. To end the day, the students  performed another digest using the PCR they had just purified.

Packaging: Using the gel extractions from Wednesday, the RXers performed four ligations. After two hours, part of the ligations were removed in order to complete several transformations, while the remaining ligations were left to incubate overnight. Colonies from the plates containing the University of Michigan strains were transferred to flasks containing LB Broth and LB Broth with Kanamycin.
Friday (08/04/17)
The big day to present to the Chief Scientist of the lab had finally come. Early in the day, the students had a dry presentation with their teachers and mentors. They received criticism and praise for their work and presentation that they would present later. They left in high spirits to return to the lab and begin the purification, ligation, and transformation of the plasmid for the “sense” component of the project.
Sense/Respond: The purification was then nanodroped and the students were pleased with the results. The students then performed a ligation on the plasmid backbone from the iGEM part and the sfGFP. The ligation seemed to go as planned and the students hoped that the two sticky ends had connected. After completing the transformation, they got ready to present to the Chief Scientist who got the funding for the iGem team. The presentation went extremely well and the Chief Scientist was very impressed with"

μShroom Mapper | Shane McCormack
With the new facilitated design method of Liquid Flow Relations, a behind-the-scenes software tool was needed to interpret and translate the LFR and UCF into a functional MINT file. This task is fulfilled with muShroomMapper; muShroomMapper takes LFR and UCF as inputs, maps the LFR into a graph with the support of NetSynth, then informs that graph with the UCF. The informed graph is then translated into a MINT file, to be placed and routed to a blueprint for fabrication.
μShroom Mapper-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
Liquid Flow Relation files and User Constraint Files greatly simplify the microfluidic design process. With the implementation of the LFR and UCF file types also came the development of uShroom Mapper, an algorithm that takes LFR and UCF file inputs and converts them into MINT file types. These file types and tools by themselves are incredibly useful, enabling researchers to specify more complex designs with greater ease. Unfortunately, alone these tools would be cumbersome and difficult to use for an inexperienced programmer.
Therefore we integrated the LFR and UCF file types into Neptune, and we integrated the uShroom Mapper algorithm into Neptune's backend libraries. To make these tools easy to use, we developed a sleek, simple and appealing user interface where LFR and UCF files can be edited and then sent to uShroom mapper for conversion to MINT. We also integrated a front end terminal that provides compilation feedback and throws errors when design rules are violated. All this to speak, we integrated uShroom Mapper with Neptune by sculpting a clean user interface that makes the design simple and efficient.
Fluigi-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
After uShroom Mapper outputs a MINT specification of a microfluidic chip, designers can modify this file type to do fine-tuning and optimization of their design. A microfluidic designer can also opt to skip specification at the LFR level, and they can go right into designing a MINT file. This being said, MINT files are not the end of the pipeline, and this filetype must be converted to a microfluidic design schematic that can be used for fabrication.
Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic"

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together"

The transfer of electrons from NADH to the anode can be executed in three different ways, as shown in Figure 13: redox shuttles, direct contact electron transfer, and bacterial nanowires Logan BE, Hamelers B, Rozendal R, Schroder U, Keller J, Freguia S, et al.

Figure 13. Three different ways to transfer electrons from microorganisms to an anode. a) Transfer of electrons to the anode using a redox shuttle (Med). Two different types of redox shuttles exit: One going through the membrane and another receiving electrons from membrane proteins. b) Transfer of electrons to the anode by direct contact. c) Electrons are carried from the inside of the cell, directly to the anode through nanowires.
The redox shuttles use extracellular electron mediators, which hold the advantage of not being limited by the surface area of the anode, although it is restricted by the slow diffusion of the extracellular mediators. The direct contact electron transfer is, in contrast to the redox shuttles, strongly limited by the surface area of the anode, but the membrane bound cytochromes that are in direct contact with the anode, rapidly deliver the electrons. Bacterial nanowires are known to efficiently transfer electrons, as for the direct contact electron transfer. However, bacterial nanowires are not as strictly limited by the surface area of the anode as the direct contact electron transfer. This is due to the ability of bacterial nanowires to form complex networks of interacting nanowires in biofilm, thereby efficiently transferring electrons from distant microbes to the anode Khanal YLaSK.

Lund,2018,Team:Lund#Design#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html,", 6 to 10 millions of hectares equals approximately 16 000 to 26 000 million kg of food affected by water-logging every year. VHb co-expression can be a viable solution to alleviate this issue, while also providing the additional benefit of increasing the biomass content of plants [5][12].
Bioremediation
Contamination of soil and groundwater stems from pharmaceutical residues [13], petroleum [14], aromatic hydrocarbons [15], organic dyes [16], pesticides [17] and heavy metals [18] Many of these contaminants can lead to serious disorders in the domestic microbial flora [19] and human population [20]. Bioremediation is an environmentally friendly solution to this issue and is used to treat heavily contaminated sites [21]. A frequent issue during bioremediation is the lack of oxygen in the environment where it is taking place. VHb has been used in various bioremediation scenarios for exactly this reason.
Kahraman and Geckil [7] proposed a potential solution to the problem by expressing VHb in yeast capable of using benzene, toluene and xylene as carbon sources. Hypoxic conditions were emulated by limiting the oxygen supply and a significant increase in degradation of the contaminants was observed.
To prevent the release of genetically engineered bioremediating organisms into the environment, Urgun-Demirtas [22] used a membrane bioreactor commonly used in waste-water treatment. They studied the degradation of 2-chlorobenzoic acid by Burkholderia cepacia modified to express VHb. The transformed cells reached higher cell densities compared to their native counterparts, 3.2–5.4 g/L and 2.8–4.7 g/L respectively. Survivability in hypoxic oxygen concentrations also improved.
Biofuels
CO2 emission is expected to increase by approximately 20% before 2035 according to the Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change [23]. Biofuels have become a feasible alternative to fossil-based fuels and more car owners are committing to the change. The consumption of biofuels, mainly ethanol, is predicted to rise from 1.3 barrels/day in 2011 to 4.1 barrels/day by 2035 [24]. In turn, the demand for more efficient biofuel production will increase.
Ethanol makes up three fourths of biofuel use [24]. Until now it has been produced using cornstarch, sugar canes and sugar beets, however a cost-effective production of bioethanol will necessitate the development of alternative fermentation feedstocks and"

The spread of HIV/AIDS stems from the stigma on contraception use; according to Masika Vicky's statistics, an estimated 98% of people fear to buy condoms in public and therefore have unprotected sex despite the outbreak of HIV/AIDS. This stigma also correlates with the high birth rates, similar to those seen in the Kasese Municipality where KUWA resides. Masika Vicky relayed that “Uganda is now highly populated, so we are encouraging family planning.” We spoke to five Rita women about their opinions on our progesterone-producing yeast and they liked the idea of a contraception method containing naturally-produced progesterone. One Rita member informed us that they’ve initiated “related programmes to teach women about reproductive health and child spacing”. We are grateful to work with a group with similar goals to ours, and we appreciate the insight.

Dr. Pam Lowe, Aston University
Our team spoke to Dr. Pam Lowe from Aston University in the United Kingdom. Dr. Lowe is the Senior Lecturer for the Department of Sociology and Policy at Aston University. Dr. Lowe is well known for her strong opinions on the unspoken ‘two-child policy’ in the United Kingdom. According to Dr. Lowe, the only stigma on birth control is not on those who use it, but rather on those who don't. Read More >> Fortunately for the UK, birth control is free with the National Health Service, even for teenagers. Even migrants make use of sexual health clinics in the UK since the NHS does not require a valid ID. In Dr. Lowe’s opinion, the UK most likely doesn't need our new method. Dr. Lowe’s information was valuable, even if it didn't favor our projects.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

The CRY2PHR/CIBN mediates reconstitution of orthogonal split proteases upon illumination with blue light
(A) Schematic representation of the CRY2PHR/CIBN light-inducible system with split protease. In the dark, the CRY2PHR and CIBN proteins do not interact (left), while illumination with blue light results in heterodimerization and reconstitution of split protease (right), which in turn cleaves the cyclic luciferase reporter, resulting in increased luciferase activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1:3 ratio of plasmids coding for CRY2PHR:CIBN with split TEV (B) or PPV (C) protease. 24 hours after transfection, cells were illuminated with blue light at 460nm for indicated periods of time. The cells were lysed and bioluminescence was measured with dual luciferase assay. Upon illumination with blue light, the protease cleaves only the cyclic reporter with the correct cleavage site (red bars), while the cyclic reporter with the mismatched cleavage site remains uncleaved (white bars).

According to Figure 1., the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 rises steadily throughout the 8-hour period and peaks at 0.9AU at T=8
Figure 2. Growth curve of bacteria transformed with BBa_K2764002

Similarly, from Figure 2., the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764002 rises steadily, but not as rapidly as BBa_K2764001, and peaks at 0.7AU at T=8
Figure 3. Growth curve of bacteria transformed with BBa_K2764003
.
Meanwhile, from Figure 3., bacteria with BBa_K2764003 remains consistently low, eventually reaching 0.05AU at T=8 despite a jump at T=2 where it reached 0.1AU. However, the overall growth rate of BBa_K2764003 is still much lower than that of the other 2 parts.
Simply comparing the final absorbance of these 3 graphs, it can be safely said that the host cells with BBa_K2764001 has the strongest growth, followed by BBa_K2764002 and then by BBa_K2764003.
Then, when the 3 growth curves are compared with the control’s growth, the graph is as follows:
Figure 4. Growth curve of bacteria transformed with BBa_K2764001, BBa_K2764002, BBa_K2764003
.
From the graph, it can be seen that the control’s growth rate is higher than all 3 parts up until T=3. After which, the control has a slower growth rate than bacteria with BBa_K2764001 but still maintains a higher growth rate than bacteria with BBa_K2764002 and BBa_K2764004 respectively. Another thing to note is that from T=0 to T=2, the cell growth of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 is similar to that of both bacteria containing BBa_K2764002 and BBa_K2764003.
The higher growth rate of the control compared with that of the 3 parts in the first half of the experiment would indeed support the hypothesis that AlkL is the independent variable that affects host cell growth. It can be further ascertained that AlkL is toxic to the host and inhibits growth to a certain extent as the control has a higher growth rate initially. However, it is interesting to note that bacteria with BBa_K2764001, which has the highest promoter strength, could be able to have the highest growth rate compared"

Interview by EJC Online Journalism Community
Recently we have seen an increasing number of cooking programs on TV, most of them, not really teaching the viewers how to cook, but spreading a culture of ""unhealthy habits"". If after the movie ""Supersize Me"", some people have avoided eating at the Mac's, yet, we still have a lot to learn regarding our food habits and many of the things we believed were healthy 10 years ago, might be unhealthy now.
Somehow, science seems to be here to become a controversial item in our menu while the powerful lobby of giant food companies are getting its way through the Media. No wonder we are constantly getting contradictory messages that in the end affect our pockets and our metabolism.
Fortunatelly, the debate is attracting young scientists as well and inviting the public to rething their food habits. In Denmark, a team of talented students went a step further to find an enzyme that can actually help us to eliminate the problem! They are on the race and working hard to win a competion called IGEM while developing their wonderful discovery. Unfortunately, they do not get as much publicity as Gordon Ramsey or Jamie Oliver, and they are searching now for sponsors in order to continue their project on the FIGHTING against OBESITY.
Directly from the Southern university of Denmark, Malou Reedorf, sent me detailed information on their project which you can read here and get to know more about this innovative idea here .
In an exclusive interview to SIJ TV, for the ​​​​​​​​​​​​​SIJ - STUDENTS & INNOVATION JOURNAL,​​​​​​ Asbjørn, tell us about the IGEM project in the video here below

CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan team gave some advices on plasmid recombination, telling us that DNA is poorly cut by fast digestion, which makes it hard to ligate and causing low efficiency of transformation. So they suggested us that NEB should be used since it cuts the DNA much better. And it actually worked! We are very thankful for CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan for this advice.

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," to establish and maintain a strategic and long-term industry partnership, each team will assign an oGEM Delegate who will be the contact point for Dennis to communicate the interests of industries to their partnered iGEM teams. To continue the collaborative effort to further expand iGEM, an advisory board will be formed which will allow PIs interested in teaching and research to coordinate long-term collaborations with industries and create a nurturing environment for synthetic biology to thrive and flourish.
Genetics and Patent Law
A question came out of our wet lab this year that served as a springboard for related questions and speculations regarding ease of sharing in the realm of synthetic biology research. This initial question was the following: ""Our lab received a part from a colleague in the United States. Although no patent exists for this part, the US lab offered it exclusively to our research team (as per email correspondence). Could our team submit this genetic sequence to the Registry of Standard Parts, which would make it available to all iGEM teams?"""" Although the vast majority of our team members were immediately inclined to answer no, with the question seemingly being one of courtesy if nothing more, it got us thinking nonetheless. If the sequence were indeed patented, how would our presence in Canada (as opposed to the US) influence how we might be able to use and share this sequence? And how do we foster collaboration between American and Canadian scientists, and even better, how do we foster international collaboration?
The following infographic outlines what we have set out to do:
Click to enlarge
Our team has arranged to meet with a few experts on law and policy to discuss our thoughts and questions. We also wanted to get an idea of what students in science and/or law thought about these questions, so we designed a survey to do just that. The survey asked 6 main questions, not including questions about students' background.
Should genetic sequences be patentable?
If a patent exists for a particular genetic sequence, where should the patent be applicable?
If a patent on a genetic sequence hinders the advancement of science or stands in the way of the public good, should the patent be restricted or terminated?
Who should decide when a patent is hindering scientific advancement?
How do we encourage collaboration between American and Canadian synthetic biologists?
And the question that started it all:
Our lab received a part from a colleague in the United States. Although no patent exists for this part, the US lab offered it exclusively to our research team (as per email correspondence). Could our team submit this genetic sequence to the Registry of Standard Parts, which would make it available to all iGEM teams (internationally)?

BIT,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Logic Gate, as an essential part of Synthetic biological circuit, is an application of synthetic biology where biological parts are designed to perform logical functions mimicking those in electronic networks. For example, we can refer to the state “Active” as binary number “1”, while the state “Inhibit” as “0”.We can switch those different states by adding a measurable element so that a gene circuit can be accomplished. By constructing layered logic gates, we can design a genetic lock simulating electronic ones to protect strains. The truth table for an AND gate is shown in Fig.1-1.
We designed a transcriptional 2-input AND gate, in which one input promoter drives the expression of an activator and the second input promoter drives the expression of a chaperone protein. The chaperone is required by the activator to turn on the output promoter. The protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions is shown in Fig.1-2.
1.2 IDEA AND DESIGN
We all understand that logic gates must meet our requirements. Thus we used some clever ways to construct them. First, the gate must contain various parts in order to build multiple orthogonal gates. Second, the inputs and outputs of the gate should have a common signal carrier that enables them to be layered (the former output are expected to be the latter input). In transcriptional circuits, the inputs and the outputs are promoters. We have designed a transcriptional double-input AND gate, in which one input promoter drives the expression of an activator while the other input promoter drives the expression of a chaperone protein. The chaperone is demanded when the activator turns on the output promoter. Output promoter is active only when both input promoters are expressed. In other words, if one want to keep transcription factor active, both gate should be activated, too.
Pathway of the layered logic gate system is shown in Fig.1-3.The system is a multilayer logic gates composed by a variety of signaling molecules, which can simulate digital locks or electronic locks. This system consists of three Sensors, an integrated circuit and a reporter gene.
Firstly, We artificially synthesised the genes of ipgC( BBa_K1325000 ),mxiE( BBa_K1325001 ),sicA*( BBa_K1325002 ),invF( BBa_K1325003 ),pipaH*( BBa_K1325004 ) and psicA ( BBa_K1325005 ). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of gene ipgC, mxiE, sicA*, invF, pipaH*"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#DateRapeDrugs_-_-_TEXT.html," in the presence of GABA and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). For this activation, GabR binds the gabT promoter. In addition, gabR underlies an autoregulatory mechanism and binds to its own promoter, repressing the transcription of gabR in presence of PLP and GABA ( Edayathumangalam et al. 2013 ).  Because of the structural similarity to GHB, we first designed a biosensor detecting GABA as a metabolite of the natural GHB pathway as a proof of concept as a basis for the GBL/GHB biosensor. During our investigation on GBL and GHB we encountered the problem that we might provide information on the production of these substances to a wider audience. Dealing with the issue of Dual Use , we decided to provide an extensive report on that theme as a part of our Human Practices approach.

Genetically Engineering Fish for the detection of heavy-metals
The bio-available nature of heavy-metals provides them an ability to accumulate in fishes, mainly in the gill and the liver tissues. (17) This property of fish can be exploited to transform them into an ideal bio-reporter for the detection of heavy-metal contamination in aquatic environment through the principles of Synthetic Biology. (18)(19) The expression of a colorimetric reporter system can be used to assess the water-quality. Carvan et al. have elucidate the use of Zebra-fish, an aquatic model organism, for the detection of heavy-metals in in water. (20)
We are developing eukaryotic bio-bricks for the detection of heavy-metals in water. These bio-bricks will, prospectively, be used to develop a genetically engineered fish, which will express chromo-proteins in its specific regions. Due to safety guidelines of iGEM, these bio-bricks will not be directly introduced in fishes.  We have first tested these devices in E.coli to assess their expression ability and then will move to a yeast model to analyze and compare the working of the bio-bricks in both Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic organisms. This will help in optimizing our assembly"

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#Description#Context_-_-_TEXT.html," of plastic production, which they did [2] .
Nowadays, there are several research groups working on the bioproduction of different materials. With the same idea in mind, we decided to focus on engineering a bacterium for producing a biological alternative to petroleum-based plastic, called Poly-Lactic Acid.
PLA bioproduction: state of the art
Back in 2010, Sang Yup Lee's research group managed to produce PLA by modifying the metabolism of Escherichia coli [3] . They reported the heterologous biosynthesis of the PLA homopolymer and its copolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-lactate) or P(3HB-co-LA).
They described two key reactions: the transformation of lactate into lactyl-CoA, as intermediary metabolite, and the polymerization of this lactyl-CoA. For these reactions, E. coli needed to have an engineered propionate CoA-transferase (PctCp), originating from Clostridium propionicum, and also an engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase (PhaC1Ps6-19), coming this time from Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19.
With these implementations, E. coli was able to produce PLA and  P(3HB-co-LA), but with a relatively low efficiency. Thus, they performed metabolic flux analysis and proceed to knock out several genes, as described on the figure below. An important gene that they tried to enhance, was ldhA, in order to have a high lactate fraction and thus improve the PLA production.
Their results showed that PLA and P(3HB-co-LA) were indeed being produced, as they were characterized by gas chromatography (GC). They could also seen the products in vesicles in the cytoplasm of the E. coli mutants, using transmission electron microscopy.
After the publication of this paper, the same research group kept on investigating PLA bioproduction and published some reviews [4,5] . However, when browsing recent papers that aim at reviewing PLA synthesis methods, most of them do not include biosynthesis [6] . Overall, only the enterprise Carbios seems to have succeeded in engineering bacteria for industrial PLA production [7] . Thus, we aim to push towards this research line, following the path of previous iGEM teams ( Yale 2013 ; UChile-OpenBio 2015 ), as we believe that it could help the bioplastic industry and, in consequence, also to tackle down the worldwide problem of plastic"
Utah_State,2008,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," polyethylene, its biophotonic properties and biocompatibility with human tissues make it appealing for use in biomedical applications. Concerns related to limited oil supply, associated political issues, and public anxiety with landfills saturated with nonbiodegradable materials fuel the need for economical industrial PHB production (Lee, 1996; Poirier, 1999; Coats, 2005).
The Problem with PHB
PHA research has increased in an effort to understand its potential, as well as to counteract some of the issues preventing its widespread use. Because of its high cost, PHB has been used mostly for specialized medical applications, including bone fixation, drug delivery systems and degradable sutures (Knowles, 1993: Kose, 2004; Holmes, 1985: Chen, 2005), and less for commercial packaging.
High expense is the primary factor preventing industrial scale PHB production and commercialization.  A low estimate for the cost of PHB production is $3-5/kg PHB versus $1/kg petroleum-based plastics (Choi, 1997). Some of the factors that contribute to this cost difference are reactor operation, substrate costs, and the extraction and downstream processing procedures (Coats 2005). There are many techniques that have been researched, or are currently being researched, to eliminate some of these major costs. Production methods for PHB involve the use of recombinant microorganisms, crops of transgenic PHB producing plants, and fermentation with naturally occurring strains of PHB accumulating organisms (Poirier, 1999).
For this project, we attempted to minimize PHB production cost by considering the PHB yield, as this can drastically affect the polymer expense. In one example, a study showed that a PHB yield reduction from 88.3% CDW to 50% CDW contributed to a cost discrepancy of $1.6/kg (Lee SY, 1998). Recombinant E. coli cells harboring PHB production genes from C. necator were used in this project because it has been shown that these cells are capable of accumulating PHB in excess of 90% CDW. The goal of this study was to reduce the cost of industrial PHB production by creating a rapid biosensor system for determining the point when PHB accumulation is at its maximum, thereby optimizing polymer extraction.
PHB Metabolic Pathways
The metabolic pathway for PHB accumulation in C. necator involves three biosynthetic enzymes. The figure below shows the structure of the PHB operon. Transcription of these genes occurs under"
DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#MAGE_-_-_TEXT.html," a successful introduction of MAGE in B. subtilis.
Indications identifies the beta-protein to be more efficient, than the GP35.
Methods
The MODEST program was used to design oligos for the experiments[5]. The oligo was designed to introduce a point mutation in the 12S subunit in the ribosome of B. subtilis 168, introducing streptomycin resistance [1]. Thus, it allows the selection of mutants growing on streptomycin. The four engineered strains and the wild type of B. subtilis 168 were prepared electroporation competent and electroporated with the oligo. The recovering bacteria was diluted and spread onto LB plates and incubated overnight. Single colonies were screened for streptomycin resistance by streaking them onto both LB and LB + streptomycin and following replicaplated.
 
upp and amyE screening
To test MAGE compliance, an attempt was made to knockout the amyE and upp gens in B. subtilis by using oligoes to incorporate three stop codons in the coding sequences. Both upp and amyE selection showed to be unable to yield conclusive results.
Theory
amyE is a gene in B. subtilis coding for a amylase protein that can degrade starch. Starch can be colored by an iodine in an ethanol solution and amylase activity is seen by a formed clearing zone due to the degraded starch.
Knocking out the upp gene is a common method for counter selection and the knockout prevents the cell to retrieve pyrimidine’s from the media. upp+ cells growing on minimal media with the pyrimidine analog 5-FU and without any pyrimidine’s, would accumulate toxins derived form 5-FU causing the cells to die. The screening allows the cells that have an inactivated upp gene to persist as the toxin is not accumulated [6]. 
Method
Knockout was attempted using the oligoes shown in Table 1. The oligoes were designed using the program MODEST. The oligo was designed with three point mutations resulting in stop codons in the sequence of the genes.

For the yeast backbone we are using pRS415-GAL whereas pSVA1 is used as the bacterial backbone. Both are available to us at our lab.
For purification of the protein, we are putting a 6xHis-tag into the C-terminal of the protein. This should allow for a simple purification using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC). If the enzyme localizes in membranes with the secretion tag(s), the best way to purify it while making sure it is still active is to purify the membranes as a whole. This means that the enzyme would be in its natural environment in the purified form.
In the design of the degradation part of our project we wonâ€™t be using BioBricks simply because there arenâ€™t any appropriate ones available/well characterized. Our designs werenâ€™t compatible with the BioBrick standard, and we didnâ€™t want to compromise them in order to have for example a ready BioBrick backbone.

Finally, to make a convincing device validation we had to not only characterize our media, but also test whether it could work as a co-culture. We knew from previously described sucrose measurements, that cscB-transformed synechococcus were indeed able to increase the concentration of sucrose in the media, the spend BG-11 media would thus have a carbon source for bacillus to use, hence, we expect it to grow more. To validate, whether bacillus could grow in the final environment of our co-culture, spend medium (BG-11 + sucrose) was mixed with ATCC at a 1:1 ratio, 10 ug/ul chloramphenicol (CAM) was supplemented, and CAM-resistant bacillus was inoculated into the suspension culture. The growth measured in OD(600) was compared between spend medium from WT and cscB-transformed synechococcus (experiment 7). The results were positive, showing a clear increase in growth between uninduced transformed bacillus, IPTG induced transformed bacillus and WT. This implicates that our co-culture can be better than a monoculture under the same conditions, however, our project still lack an ability to measure an output/product, without which a direct estimation of cost-benefit between monocultures and co-cultures in space, is near impossible.

Flow cytometry was carried out to verify the presence of RFP expressing cells. After the plate reading assay, the same samples were taken for flow cytometry. Below, the flow cytometry results for samples at two high concentrations is shown. In the histograms below, we can clearly see the shift in the different cell types, namely between those that produce and do not produce RFP.  In the x-axis is the log of fluorescence intensity, and in the y-axis the cell count.
These results demonstrate that the construct that was made does indeed function and that upon completion can yield high levels of RFP. At the same time though, such production of RFP may interfere with the precise control that is required in our system.
We were not able to test the entire circuit because the final ligations were not completed in time. But the obtained results indicate, as noted before, that the genetic circuit that was conceived can be functional upon completion of the final construct.
Summary
At the time of the Wiki deadline, we were one step away from finishing both plasmids necessary to complete our synthetic network. All subparts have been sequenced and some have been characterized (TetR, RFP). Work is also still being continued at the EPFL to finish the cloning and realize a first full scale on-chip experiment. The microfluidic chip can be successfully loaded with a high cell density. Even though some cells die in the chip, most of them survive and can express a fluorescent marker (GFP or RFP). The main issue resides in the small amount of available nutrient on the chip. On the other hand, the valves work nicely and allow an accurate control of quorum-sensing molecules concentration throughout the chip.
On the modeling side, simulations have been run and showed that the network can respond to green and red levels according to our set of rules. The model showed that our system is very sensitive to many parameters as well as to the level of the molecular components available at the time of the external AHL input. Considering the very complex and noisy ""milieu"" of the cell, we might think that our network is not robust enough to produce the expected functionality. It was quite challenging to design a self-organizing system made of one unique cell type. As a result, the designed network is highly connected and very complex with many feedback and feedforward loops.
Undergoing this iGEM project, we wanted to tackle one fundamental question about the emergence of life: ""How can a complex organism arise from one single cell?"" It seems clear that such complexity cannot be implemented in a synthetic system."

What are we facing?
Biosafety has always been a major concern to the public, to the companies and to the researchers. Doubts and worries were raised just as genetic technology was invented. With the rapid growth of synthetic biology and the iGEM community, and more and more synthetic biology products being built with widely distributed DNA toolkits or the inexpensive DNA synthesis service(Synthetic and Will); we are facing the unprecedented biosafety issue of unwanted leakage of synthetic biology products to the environment that may cause unexpected but likely disastrous problems.
Predecessors
For decades, researchers were striving to build biosafety devices through auxotrophy or external inducive kill switches(Lee et al.); of the latter holins and restriction enzymes are most commonly used. Most failures of the previous devices were due to mutations and evolution of immunity(Moe-Behrens et al.) .
The two major threats of engineered microbes’ leakage are the possible horizontal gene transfer which will lead to the spread of recombinant DNA to the ecosystem, or the fact that engineered bacteria could contaminate or overrun the natural habitat.(Wright et al.))
Project Xscape
Under this circumstance, this year we decided to be a fundamentalist to synthetic biology, using genetic circuits and logic gates to establish biosafety devices which can apply to real-world situations.
Since cell death and lysis mean there is a continual presence of free DNA in the environment, holins, which are most widely used are excluded from our choices, and colicin E2 nucleases (Darmstadt iGEM2016) came into our site. We choose site non-specific nucleases since the entire genome and plasmids needed to be entirely digested to prevent the spread, and we use nucleases from a different family to prevent the possible evolution of nuclease inhibitors. Artificial DNA, RNA, and amino acids are a good solution, but due to its high cost so far, it is not applicable to most of the user.
For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the escape"

A solid foundation of wetlab is good laboratory practice. The best starting point for this purpose are personal safety precautions, such as gloves and lab coat. of course, is to be autoclaved. This should prevent any contamination of the environment with our bioactive material.
Besides this, a division of the lab into different areas is crucial. We designated separate areas for documentation, which of course did not happen on the benches, for lab-work, where we also worked with genetically modified bacteria and an ethidiumbromide-area where we could perform gel-electrophoresis and gel-analysis.
