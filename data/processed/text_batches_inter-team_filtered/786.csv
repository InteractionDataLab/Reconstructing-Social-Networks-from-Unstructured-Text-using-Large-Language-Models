Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#28 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"film, and another paper that brings that number up to 80%. The first paper is very old and the second one doesn’t have a formal source attached to the number (they attribute it to the NIH, but the only place on NIH where I could find it was on a request for proposals released in 2003, where no study or history was included. The only thing is that if I am focussing on biofilm killers for sex appeal, I need to bring in some credibility as to why we care. We all know that biofilms are a problem, but people outside the field might not and we need to convince them while respecting their intelligence.
I also looked at pattern formation, in a study that made pretty designs with the idea that such pattern formation could eventually be adapted to serve in 3-D tissue engineering, biosensing and biomaterial formation  all of which rely on highly-ordered structural design and fabrication. The paper is “A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern formation”.
My third cool example lies in the value in engineering multi-cellular systems, with emphasis on the quorum-based repressilator. When quorum sensing is coupled with the repressilator, system noisiness is reduced. Again, the mutant circuits would be effective in validating (or not) the reporters used in this system. The paper is “Modelling a synthetic multi-cellular clock: Repressilators coupled by quorum sensing”
4. Understanding of what synthetic biology is
This is partly to help give me some focus for the first paragraph of the introduction (do I want to focus on standardising biological parts, circumventing the tedium associated with assembling biological systems from raw materials, allowing for a modular approach in system design, assembly and refinement – or all of the above?). I also used it to help me write my part for our APEGGA article. I went to syntheticbiology.org and saw what was there.
Procedural modifications
Nothing fancy here – I just included details on the restriction enzymes that I used in the construction protocols. I’ll throw in a picture to make this easier for a reader to visualise. The specific enzymes are important so that anyone attempting to replicate the experiment is able to insert the appropriate scar between adjacent parts, and doesn’t mix up the order of the inserts.
Discussion writing
I didn’t make it as far as I would have liked. I have a paragraph that discusses what we accomplished, but when I attempted to write something on what the results tell us, I got stuck. I have included what I wrote at the end of the update.

Modeling Overview
Mathematical modeling plays a central role in Synthetic Biology. One of its major abilities is to predict the behavior of a biological circuit. Therefore, it is an important bridge between the ideas and concepts on the one hand and biological experiments on the other.
The main idea is to interact with the experimental part of the project in two ways. On the one hand to characterize the constructed biobricks, and identify parameters of the models thus allowing a better understanding of the biology behind. On the other hand, to direct the way in which experiments are performed, so as to verify a prediction done from the modeling world.
The first step, with a little knowledge, was to develop a mathematical model based on a system of differential equations. Then, the equations were implemented using a set of reasonable values, taken from the literature,  for the model parameters. This way, we could validate the feasibility of the project. Here, one of the main characters of the play came into the ""cheaters"" . We saw the “cheaters” could appear from an original population of “normal” microorganisms. This lead us to perform several experiments to measure the metabolic burden that arises when cells carrying a synthetic plasmid want to effectively synthesize the desired protein, as compared with cells that are NOT producing the protein. This could lead to increase the fitness of the “cheaters”. Go to the Experimental evolution prediction from the model page to see how did we model the cheaters.
Then we started the characterization of each part created in the lab. Some of the mathematical model parameters were estimated thanks to several experiments we performed within the project (others were derived from literature) and they were used to predict the final behavior of each construction. Go to the Modeling Bacteria page to see the models we did for the glucose-sensitive construction and the thermal shock responsive contruction. Also see Modeling Yeast page for the model of our construction in Yeast.
Experimental procedures for parameter estimation are discussed and"
USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," overuse of antibiotics for animal is the same serious as the clinical therapy. In farms or hospitals, solution containing antibiotics directly emittes to river, which potentially strongly influence the ecological equilibrium of bactierial colonies and sidelong threaten public health.
Antibiotics Production and Contamination in China
Because individuals neglecting antibiotic emission, rivers in China now encounter extremely antibiotic contamination.
According to the latest research from Chinese Academy of Science published on ACS Environmental Science and Technology, China used 162,000 tons of antibiotic substances for human(48%) and animal(52%) in 2013, which is tenfold usage of USA and antibiotic substances in high concentration can be detected from many river basins that may potentially harmful to public health and environment. In their professional evaluation, antibiotics can be detected in all rivers in China in different degree.
Among these rivers, the Pearl River Basin in South China and Hai River Basin in North China received the highest antibiotics emission. More than 36 common antibiotic substances were discovered in these rivers, one of them, for example, in the Pearl River Basin, amoxicillin was found at 3384 ng/L and fluprofen at 2867 ng/L. Though lack of standard ranking on antibiotic contamination, according to environmental scienctists from CAS, antibiotic substances concentration more than 1000 ng/L is relatively extremely high, based on Europe Union Standard.
Now, many technology including ELISA, Delvotest, HPLC-MS/MS, CE and Quantum Dot are able to detect antibiotic concentration in river sample, however much of their have much dificiencies, including:
Not portable, many big and automatic equipments are indispensable for concentration detection.
Complicated Routine, which requires traned personnel to conduct experiment. However, facing that large scale contamination, complicated routine and trained personnel cannot be satisfied at all districts, so do it in many developing and undeveloped countries and districts.
Recent technology is still not sensitive enough and sometimes time consuming.
Consequently, this year we iGEM constructed NDM, which is abbreviated from Nanomachine detecting microbiotics. Using NDM based on mechanism of GFP reporter, chemotaxis and interference, a portable and accurate device is established to encounter the issues today.

Interlab
KU Leuven is participating in the 2017 interlab study! This year's goal of the interlab study was: How close can the numbers be when fluorescence is measured all around the world?
Not only did these experiments count towards the bronze medal requirements, we also assisted in iGEM's efforts to improve reproducibility and reliability of experiments worldwide.
The KU Leuven team believes that lots of hands can make hard work lighter, with this attitude we decided to take part in the Interlab studies of iGEM 2017. Besides the acknowledgement of the team in the publication of this research, our main motivation was being part a bigger scientific community where results are shared and checked. This community allows to produce and create much more reliable results then when you would do it on your own. If you want to create an efficient, reliable and repeatable measurement protocol, you need to test the protocol numerous times. Results may vary because you are not always going to perform this protocol in the same lab and under the same conditions. To minimize the risk of false negative or false positive data, this protocol should be tested in as much different conditions as possible. iGEM used the opportunity of access to more than 300 different labs, with different equipment, well by introducing the Interlab Studies, in this way they are able to test their protocol in the best way possible. By generalizing a standard procedure in 1 protocol that would been used by all the researchers worldwide, lots of miscommunication and confusing data-analysis can be avoided. If everyone works with the same protocol, sharing and comparing information will get a lot easier which will benefit science and research in general.
We started our Interlab journey by transforming the parts (positive and negative control and 6 test devices) into Sub-Cloning Efficiency™ DH5α™ E. coli cells obtained from Invitrogen. We obtained several colonies for each plasmid, and were ready to continue to the next steps. 
In the meantime, we have become more familiar with the plate reader: Perkin-Elmer Victor X"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 6_-_-_TEXT.html," following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Influence of temperature on germination
15.04.2013
A paper from 1970 shows that at 44C Aspergillus niger does not germinate, but rather forms giant cells. This dimorphism is not unfamiliar within the fungal world, where at lower temperatures the mycelium is formed and at higher temperatures the yeast-like form is found.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in"

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Modeling#bacterial Growth_-_-_TEXT.html,"Each time, we will expose both a deterministic model and a stochastic one. The major advantage of the deterministic model is its simplicity. But this simplicity has a cost: while every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables, the deterministic models perform the same way for a given set of initial conditions which is not really desirable. Conversely, in a stochastic model, randomness is present, and the variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by probability distributions.

Pure birth process
In this part, we assume that :
bacteria do not die,
they develop without interacting with each other,
the birth rate, $\lambda$, is the same for all the bacteria, regardless of their age and does not change with time.
Deterministic model
Let $N(t)$ denote the population size at time $t$.
Then in the subsequent small time interval of length $h$ the increase in the population due to a single organism is $\lambda\times h$ - i.e the rate $\times$ the time - so the increase in size due to all $N(t)$ organisms is $\lambda\times h\times N(t)$. Thus \[ N(t+h) = N(t) + \lambda h N(t) +o(h) \] which on dividing both sides by h gives \[ \frac{N(t+h)-N(t)}{h} = \lambda N(t)+o(1) \] Let $h$ approach zero then yields the differential equation \[ \frac{dN}{dt}(t) = \lambda N(t) \] which integrates to give \[ N(t) = N_0 e^{\lambda t} \] where $N_0$ denotes the initial population size at time $t=0$. This form for $N(t)$ is known as the Malthusian expression for population development.It shows that these simple rules lead to exponential growth.
Stochastic model
A deterministic model only gives us an average solution of the problem. In order to take into account the unpredictability of biology, we need a stochastic approach. Usually, the stochastic model converge to a limit which is similar to the deterministic model. A stochastic"
Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," higher DNA concentration. (76.5 ng/ul today vs 24.1 ng/ul yesterday). Several improvements made to plasmid prep protocol. Unfortunately, sequencing center returns message kindly explaining that concentration of DNA was still insufficient. Three cultures inoculated for plasmid prep tomorrow. Safety form updated. Lab notebook and weekly update section updated. Plan is tentatively to send for sequencing tomorrow morning by 9 after doing some tricks in plasmid prep to increase DNA concentration. Then, if sequencing results confirm presence of successfully ligated G2, scale up plasmid stock, digest out G2, replace in four ligations with the other GFPs, then transform cells and plate. After this, plasmisd prep and send for sequencing to confirm presence of all five GFPs. If sequencing fails to confirm, investigate other methods of introducing GFP into pFTV (cbar). Inoculated three cultures of pFTV+G2 to plasmid prep tomorrow.
Friday, July 11, 2014
One of our dCas9 ligations, with backbone Plasmid 1 #1 had colonies grow on the plate. The ligation to backbone #2 was not successful. #2 did not appear to sequence well, so perhaps that plasmid is not 100% correct. Emily made a large gel and we ran the digested backbones on it. All 6 plasmid digests ran well.
Plasmid prepped three cultures from yesterday and sent for sequencing on campus, this time with high enough plasmid concentration. Prepared SOC media. Tested electrocompetent cells by transforming one tube with original pFTV and the other with nothing. Plated on Cm plates. Realized problems with Reverse inverse PCR primer. The annealing section is correct but the tail is complementary to what it should be. This is resulting in the correct sequence containing Sac1, a spacer, and Pst1 in the bottom strand instead of in the strand that we want it to be in. Met to talk about the design of the dRBS. It was decided that we would order two oligos with the ends as if the restriction enzyme has already cut them. The plan is to anneal these oligos and we can then skip the digestion step and just ligated them directly into the digested cells. Fingers crossed that this will work. Dr. Salis thinks it should be okay, but Iman has doubts because annealing the two strands (each is a dRBS) is really 48 ligations proceeding simultaneously in the same tube and is bound to"

After that Prof. Dr. Jan-Steffen Krüssel explained how in vitro fertilization works nowadays and gave information about where Huxley had been wrong: For example, using less oxygen is not correlated with lesser intelligence but rather a natural environment in the oviduct of women.
Next, it was our turn. We prepared information booths on four topics: green biotechnology - the genetic manipulation of plants; red biotechnology - advances in medical fields through synthetic biology; white biotechnology - genetic engineering used in the bio industry and CRISPR/Cas - a new technique in genetic engineering.
At each booth we arranged an informational video and a quiz about each topic to test our visitors’ knowledge about each topic.  After realizing that they often had no idea what products are made by genetically modified organisms, people were shown everyday examples, such as detergents with enzymes, foods with added protein and vitamins produced by microorganisms, to demonstrate the importance of synthetic biology in our everyday life. The spectators often weren’t aware and were surprised they had been using products of genetically engineered bacteria all along!
We also gave them several items for comparison, such as rennet cheese with naturally and synthetically produced enzymes, to let visitors decide which they liked best. Surprise: they liked both.
The green biotechnology booth introduced the people to the concept of Golden rice in comparison to normal rice.
For the red biotechnology booth we showed an exhibit of a pig pancreas and were able to explain that this had been used for insulin production a long time ago, whereas the production nowadays is a lot faster and less cruel. The visitors were relieved that the amount of animals we raised for medical purposes had been reduced by such technologies.
In the end one question stood out: “Why do you think the society is afraid of genetic engineering and synthetic biology even though there are so many advantages?”
We realized this fear usually develops from the lack of information about procedures, methods, laws and utilizations.
When given those information, a lot of sceptical people suddenly began to understand the advantages of synthetic biology and started to abandon unrealistic fears.

The radial distribution function can be computed via computer simulation methods. Because the                         peak of the radial distribution function appears at 0.5nm, so the spacing of 5CB molecules is                         around 0.5nm.
Calculate the range of β2-M that can perturb 5CB
We assume 5CB molecule as a ellipse (\(a\)=1nm, \(b\)=0.1nm), we got the tilt angles of three                         molecules by Matlab.
Fig.9 The tilt angles are 43°, 64°, 90° respectively.
\(\therefore\)Maximum radius of β2-M that can perturb 5CB (Fig. 5):
\(R_1=[2\times\sin (64^\circ )+1]\mathrm{nm}=\)2.8nm
Verification
In the liquid crystal experiment, the droplets dropped on the slide have a radius of about 2                         mm.
$$\therefore S=\pi R^2=4\pi\times 10^{12}\mathrm{nm^2}$$
The molecular weight of β2-M is 11800, the volume of the droplet is 10μL.
The area disturbed by each protein molecule is:
$$r=2.8\mathrm{nm}$$
$$S_0=\pi r^2=7.84\pi\mathrm{nm^2}$$
When the picture is just full colorful, the number of molecules contained in the droplet                         is:
$$N=\frac{S}{S_0}=5.1\times 10^{11}$$
$$m=\frac{11800\times 5.1\times 10^{11}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}=10^{-8}\mathrm{g}$$
\(\therefore\)Maximum concentration is:
\(c=\frac{m}{V}=\)1000ng/mL
That is to say, when the concentration reaches 1000ng/mL, the image starts to be completely                         bright. This is in good agreement with our experimental results. The following are the results                         of the liquid crystal experiment.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html," fusion protein has a high specificity for the degradation of BPA. In addition it is possible that the decrease in BPF and BPS concentration is due to internalization of those bisphenols or a endogenous enzyme of E. coli KRX and that the bisdA | bisdB fusion protein was not responsible. It can be assumed that false positive signals because of BPF or BPS present in a sample are unlikely.
BPA degradation with constructs containing FNR
Constructs containing FNR, BisdA and BisdB polycistronic <partinfo>K525551</partinfo>, FNR and a fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB <partinfo>K525582</partinfo> and a fusion protein of FNR, BisdA and BisdB <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> were tested for their ability to degrade BPA. Cultivations were done using the same conditions as with previous constructs. The results are shown in Figure 9 below.
Figure 9: Degradation of BPA after 24 h cultivation with E.coli KRX carrying genes for FNR, BisdA and BisdB polycistronic <partinfo>K525551</partinfo>, FNR and a fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB <partinfo>K525582</partinfo> and a fusion protein of FNR, BisdA and BisdB <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> behind the medium strong constitutive promoter <partinfo>J23110</partinfo> with RBS <partinfo>B0034</partinfo>. Cultivations were carried out at 30 °C temperatures in LB + Amp + 120 mg L-1 BPA for 24 h in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. Samples were taken every 3 hours. Two to four biological replicates were analyzed. All constructs were able to degrade BPA, with the constructs containing fusion proteins outperforming the construct where all proteins were expressed polycistronic.
The results indicate that the BPA degradation was improved using fusion proteins compared to the completely polycistronic construct. Also the fusion protein of all three enzymes (<partinfo>K525560</partinfo>) involved in the degradation of BPA worked as intended which is quite impressive.

iGEM Day
iGEM 2018 being our debut competition, we wanted to start with a bang and intended to do something significant like our counterparts IISc Bangalore did when they hosted the ‘All India iGEM Meetup’. We decided to organize an event in our college itself for our community members, to give them a glimpse of iGEM, as a celebration of creativity, as a conglomeration of minds. On August 25th we organized ‘iGEM Day’. We held engaging competitions and talks to inspire curious young minds who found the idea behind iGEM fascinating and wanted to know and understand more about it. We hosted four major events, namely, ‘Battle of Wits’, ‘Syn-Bio Symposium’, ‘Meet the iGEMers’, ‘Project Methnote’, and ‘Mini iGEM’. .
 
 
Battle of Wits
Students turned up to participate in ‘Battle Of Wits’, a debate competition, to rack their brains around pressing issues like ethics of animal experimental models, eugenics and GMOs. The teams were judged by our faculties Dr. Shyam Sundar Reddy and Dr. Neetu Kalra on the basis of their active participation the originality of their ideas, which is something in the same spirit as that of iGEM itself. We were amazed to see the diversity of thought and opinion stemming out of sharp minds.
Syn-Bio Symposium
This event was about showcasing the ideas of 9 Indian iGEM 2018 teams that sent us their project description. We presented our Team poster here to let everyone know about our work status. The poster was reviewed and scrutinized by our faculties.
Meet the iGEMers
We had the privilege of having one of our faculty, Dr. Nagarjun Vijay, opening the session with a talk. Being an ex-iGEMer (Uppsala University, Sweden, 2010), he shared his own experience of participating in this competition. He talked about his own project idea, the logistics, and practicalities of taking part in such a prestigious competition and most importantly how rewarding a learning experience it is for"

Bisphenol A degradation
There exist a lot of bacteria in nature that can degrade xenobiotic substances such as phenolic compounds or endocrine disruptors. In a lot of soil samples that were taken from contaminated soil to find organisms that do so, sphingomonads were extraordinarily often isolated ( Stolz, 2009 ). In 2005, Sasaki et al. isolated a soil bacterium from the Sphingomonas genus which is able to degrade the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) with a unique rate and efficiency compared to other BPA degrading organisms. This strain, called Sphingomonas bisphenolicum AO1, is able to completely decompose 120 mg BPA L-1 in about 6 hours while other"

This reception system would be coupled both to a reporter gene (i.e. GFP) and, for the purposes of our project, a luciferase gene.
METHODOLOGY
We used a modified version of the YcgF/YcgE system for blue light reception (previously reported by the K.U. Leuven 2009 Team), the modification consists in the reduction of the promoter region to 50 bp.
Originally, we tried to amplify the complete promoter region BBa_238013 (86 bp) from genomic DNA of E. coli K12 by PCR but we failed in several trials. So we decided to synthesize the promoter in a primer and then insert it into pSB4A5 by PCR. Because of lenght limitations in primer synthesis we reduced the promoter region to 50 bp.
The reduced promoter retains the fundamental parts of the original one, these are the -35 and -10 box, the spacer between them, the inverted repeat 1 and 2 (inverted regions are the binding sites for the YcgE repressor) and the transcription start site. We registered this Minimum Blue Light Receptor Promoter as BBa_K360041.
In order to test the functionality of our Minimum Blue Promoter we succesfully ligated it to our Strong RBS BBa_K360031 and the GFP BBa_E0040.
Characterizing YcgF/YcgE BLUE RECEPTION SYSTEM
Experimental procedure
It is reported that the response of this promoter is weak in comparison to some others standard strong promoters registered in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. We implemented a protocol for testing the response of our Minimum Blue Light Receptor Promoter (Min-BP) in which we irradiated cells with the construction Min-BP + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040 with blue light (470 nm) leds for different times. We also irradiated with green (540 nm) and red (660 nm) light leds to discard any crosstalk of these wavelengths. GFP expression was compared to a reference: J23101 promoter + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040.
We measured GFP expression of our constructions, in order to irradiate the cells with Min- BP + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040 we used blue leds and irradiated the cells for 300 minutes, we also measured GFP expression of cells that were incubated in the dark and cells with the constuction J23101 promoter + RBS BBa_K"

I.Collaboration with NJU_CHINA(CLICK)
NJU_CHINA helped us by constructing one of our TAL effectors (TALE1) using Golden Gate technique. They also edited the original vector pTAL1 provided by the Kit to add EcoRI, SpeI and PstI cutting cite, thus ensuring the engineered TAL effector can meet the RCF10 bio-brick standard. This new vector was then used when we construct the other two TAL effectors ourselves. We really appreciate their assistance in our experiment.
In return, we performed nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for NJU_CHINA to help them to have a more precise determination of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes.
The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the EV, as nanoparticles can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. Because exosomes are more homogenous and generally smaller than most EVs with a diameter size ranging from 40 to 120 nm, the percentage of nanoparticles whose size ranges from 40 to 120 nm could be a good indicator of total amount of exosomes. The shift of peak of size distribution of EV from 170 nm to 120 nm and the significant raise of the peak indicated the increase of relative level of exosomes in secreted EVs after overexpression nSMase2 in HEK293 cells.
The result proved the feasible and effective improvement of manufacturing exosomes by overexpressing nSMase2.

Abstract
Welcome to Scotland’s first ever high school iGEM team! For our project, we have assigned our special agent spiRNA on a mission to target Vibrio cholerae and Shigella flexneri - two waterborne bacteria that cause the diseases Cholera and Shigellosis, often proving fatal in developing countries. To achieve this, we’ve created a fusion protein which will allow our spiRNA to hitch a ride out of E. coli. Our agent will sneak its way into the target pathogen and complete its mission by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection.
We’re targeting Cholera and Shigella specifically because they are both a major cause of fatalities in developing countries, due to treatments not being readily available or affordable. Therefore, we aim for our spiRNA to be a cheaper, more effective and more accessible alternative to current treatments; in other words, for it to FIGHT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS!"
EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Tools#Microfluidics#HowTo2_-_-_TEXT.html," we needed a cheap way of viewing the chip on a computer, to then stream the image through internet. We used a toy webcam microscope ($50), and bought a toy light table for rear-illumination ($25). To improve stability and focusing, we fixed the microscope to a chemist's stand and placed the light table on a scissor jack.
Webcam microscope: Celestron Deluxe Handheld Digital Microscope
Light table: Artograph GLOBOX
Hooking it all up: preparing tubes and priming the chip
The presence of bubbles in a channel increases its fluidic resistance, and therefore perturbates or even blocks flow. To avoid this, the first step in running a chip is priming: filling all the channels with fluid, then closing all the micro-valves and keeping pressure applied, until any air remaining in the chip diffuses through the chip walls and disappears.
Once all the channels are filled, the experiments can begin. For the worm chip, we would prime the device with buffer, then introduce the worm after the chip is filled. For the MITOMI chip, we would flow in various biomolecules (neutravidin, bovine serum albumin, antibodies, cell-free extracts) and DNA.
Details of connections
Below are four images detailing how the tubing and electronics in our setup are connected, and the role of each component.
A printed circuit board (PCB) is used to connect the solenoid valves to the relays on the easyDAQ, and power them. The solenoids are connected to the PCB via two flat cables, one soldered to the red wires, one soldered to the black wires (they are 14-wire cables, with two wires removed). The other end of each cable is fitted with a 14-pin connector. The PCB is powered by a 24 V power supply, and distributes the power to each solenoid through the relays on the EasyDAQ. Therefore, when a relay is open, a 24 V load is applied to the corresponding solenoid (wich opens it). When the relay is closed, both leads of the solenoid are grounded (which closes it).
Annotated picture of the fluidics setup. The role of each component is explained. Not shown: since the picture was taken, manometers were added to the pressure regulators.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Science cannot assume that the regulation and policies of Research has to be made by scientists only, rather it is its duty to communicate the results of the researches and to have transparency on the experiments conducted. Scientists should be able to acknowledge that they don’t know something rather than lying to the public. Indeed it is often easier to trust someone when the doubts are clearly stated than when everything is allegedly under control but it cannot be verified.
Life:
Before we can have any kind of ethical reflection concerning our project, we asked ourselves how to best define our “work material”, meaning living beings. Indeed, to be able to estimate the possible consequences of our actions, we first have to characterize what we are modifying.
A living being can be defined as a thermodynamic open system that receives and passes information, and is in this way a sort of “anomaly” of nature since it does not tend towards entropy. In fact it seems that normality is illustrated by non living things, completely subjected to the laws of physics and chemistry, and divisible in smaller parts. If they abide by these laws, living beings should thus evolve towards more entropy and only degrade complex molecules in simpler ones. However, anabolism enables organisms to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones.
As said previously, living beings are sacred in our society because they still hold some part of mystery. Christianity having been predominant historically in Western Europe, it still has an influence on people’s minds and a notion that could be assimilated to sin still clings to the modification of organisms.
We can then ask ourselves the following questions: is it possible to have control over organisms, and if yes, to which extent?  It actually seems that we do not have the power to control them entirely, we can only act on a few metabolic pathways, a few functions, at the same time.
iGEM:
When discussing the different concepts and approaches of synthetic biology, we have to take into account that ethical reflections depend on the core values of a society and thus differ from one to the other.
First of all, since we are participating in iGEM, we reflected on its acronym: international Genetically Engineered Machine. Using the word “machine” appears to us as a mechanistic reductionism. A machine is the assembly of known and controllable components, and this term seems to indicate that we assimilate a living being to a completely characterized system responding to physical and chemical laws. But a machine such as a plane can be built from start to finish whereas a living being like a bacterium cannot. Thus it appears that the use the word machine is somewhat misleading, because biology is much"

In the evening we had a BBQ with all participants which were organized by Team    Delft, too. This was a really great opportunity for us to come together and talk with people all    from Europe and not everyone is being biologist. It was great to meet students from different    schools. The last day of this event we spent in Rotterdam on a Pannenkoekenboot. This means    All You Can Eat Pancakes. We enjoyed it. Sitting together with our new iGEM friends on a    boat driving through the Rotterdam rivers and eating All You Can Eat Pancakes. As I said –    we enjoyed. In the afternoon we walked through Rotterdam and went to a Beer Bar ‘De wilde    Hollander’ in Delft. We enjoyed Beer with the members from Newcastle and had long talks    into the night. On our last day in the Netherlands on the 9th of July we drove to Den Haag and    walked along the beach before we took our way home. Of course, every evening while talking    about the day we ate traditional Dutch cheese and drank different Delft Beer. I don´t want to    mention the monster spiders there in Delft because we’re on our way to forget them. And a    big thank you to those bus drivers who let us drive for free because the tickets are too    expensive.    To sum up, we all had an amazing, exciting and informative time in Delft and great thanks to    iGEM Team TU Delft for organizing this big event.
Post Cards
This year the team from Düsseldorf and Köln invited on the iGEM Collaboration Side all    teams to join their postcard campaign. We really liked this idea, because postcards are an    easy way to reach people, especially since many people collect pretty postcards.    Additionally, the combination of a short text and a picture, representing explanation and    visualization, enables a simple understanding of the subject, even to people without any    background knowledge. Thus, we decided to take part in this campaign.    For the front side of the postcard we chose a depiction of the 3D-structure of the    SpyCatcher/SpyTag System for it plays a key role in our project. Also, since we believe that    many people do not exactly know how to picture a protein because these structures are often    illustrated differently, this should give people a basic idea of real protein molecules. Together    with a short explanatory text on the back, we printed our postcards and sent 300"
NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html,"The success of the DIYBio phenomenon can be attributed to two main reasons:
the Open Science concept that allows transparent and remote information & skills transfer.
the fact that the cost of biological equipment is becoming cheaper.
Budding scientists can pick up DIYbio easily with just a high school biology background. The internet has played a big role in making this happen. The community's websites feature step-by-step tutorials, friendly guide videos for anyone interested in carrying out experimentsand invite readers to join the mailing lists or contribute on the wikis.
Early DIYbiologists were aware that high costs would be a big barrier for newcomers to cross. So they experimented extensively and compiled a list of off-the-shelf household items that could be substituted for more expensive chemicals. They have shown that expensive DNA extraction buffers, for example, can be replaced with common detergents with no consequence!
Teams of DIYbiologists are even working on making cheaper hardware alternatives to expensive commercial lab equipment. The Pearl Gel Box is a testament to this effort. It is a professional grade gel electrophoresis box with a built-in transilluminator for just USD$199, almost half the price of the commercial equivalent.
With access to valuable information catering to any level, and falling costs, it is no wonder that DIYBio is becoming a feasible option for budding hobbyists. The growth of the DIYBio community has so closely paralleled the Open Source hobbyist community explosion that the term “hacker” has been deemed appropriate, by the public, to refer to DIYbiologists. However, the “biohackers” in question, DIYbiologists, don't necessarily appreciate the title, especially if “hacker” comes with the negative connotations reserved for deviant programmers who are most popular for malicious computer practices.
Reactions to DIYbio
Since the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep, the public has been more and more concerned about the ethical issues involved in modifying life as we know it. As such, they tend to focus their attention on the life sciences, including biotechnological advances like genetic engineering and synthetic biology. ""Just because we can doesn't mean we should,"" is a central argument from the cautious general public.
The closed nature of the traditional scientific establishment doesn't help to allay the public's fears. The latest advances and theories only trickle down to the public domain through specialised and isolated sources. This is not conducive to appeasing public curiosity and concern. As a result, there are some damaging misconceptions and pre-conceived notions, that have not been addressed with sound explanations and elaborations.
Like most hobbyist pursuits, DIYbio appeals to a"

Luminescent Bacteria Method：
Adoption of luminescent bacteria for air pollution monitoring, antibiotics screening and rapid detection of water attracts wide attention in recent years. Luminescent bacteria is a kind of bacteria that can produce visible fluorescence in normal conditions, while its bioluminescence is produced by molecular oxygen and catalyzed by luciferase inside the cell. Luciferase oxidates flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) and long chain fatty aldehyde in the reduction state to FMN and long chain fatty acid, at the same time emits blue-green light in 450 ~ 490 nm. Equation can be expressed as follows:
FMN+NAD(P)H-→FMNH2+NAD(P)
FMNH2+RCHO+O2-→FMN+RCOOH+H2O+hv
2、 the effects of Web site, poster and other artists are not so beautiful;
The process of luminescence involves a variety of substances, which are products of bacterial metabolism. When external condition worsens, its luminous way will be affected in a very short period of time, resulting in suppression or shutdown of luminescent reaction. As a result, luminescence of bacteria is positively correlated to the concentration of toxin in condition, what’s more, the correlation can be approached by a linear function. Based on the mechanism, luminescent bacteria have been widely adopted as a biological indicator in rapid quantification of toxin in the environment.
Luminescent bacteria luciferase gene
Bacteria luminescence is a consequence of its luciferase catalytic metabolic process. The luciferase encoding gene is LuxAB. All genus of luminescent bacteria have five core constitute lux gene operon, order of which is luxCDABE. Bacteria luciferase is composed of two subunits heterodimer, including luciferase alpha and beta subunits coded by luxA and luxB respectively. LuxC, luxD, luxE encode for reduction of fatty acid synthesis fatty aldehyde enzyme complexes of three subunits: reductase, transferase, synthetase, respectively. Mancin (1988) successfully cloned the photobacterium phosphoreum’s luciferase operon luxCDABFE and expressed it in Escherichia coli. Except for methods though"

Overview
The purpose of our modeled system is to tune this system as a specific pH-sensing lysis device for releasing our phytase into the stomach. We aim to characterize the interaction between the H+/Cl- antiporter and the chloride-induced lysis cassette in our E. coli chassis. This model examines the effects of varied promoter strengths for the ClC-ec1 antiporter, as well as the plausibility of utilizing the system for nutritional purposes.
We start with a model cell that has entered the stomach. In this high pH environment, protons begin to leak into the cell. For our purposes, this flux of H+ ions into the cell is modeled by simple diffusion.
The leakage of protons due to the acidic environment begins to disrupt pH homeostasis. However, E. coli has acid resistance mechanisms in order to grow in low pH. One of these mechanisms is the ClC-ec1 antiporter protein, which pumps H+ out of the cell (against its gradient) by utilizing the chloride gradient. The flux of extracellular protons (He) into the cell as well as the production of the antiporter protein are illustrated below:
Each antiporter turnover moves one H+ out while importing two Cl-. We now begin by modeling with first order ordinary differential equations.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343004_-_-_TEXT.html," flagella we tried to visualize the flagella with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The bacteria were grown overnight in liquid cultures (5 ml LB-media). The bacteria were diluted to approximately 10^6 cells in 10 µl. At that time we did not have our K343004 composite part so therefore we only tried SEM with the negative control strain DH5alpa and wild type MG1655. We did this as a preliminary work so we would be ready to do microscopy on the MG1655 cells containing the composite part when it was ready. Unfortunately the limited resolution and magnitude of the SEM at our disposal made it practically impossible to visualize any flagella in the microscope. Thus if this approach is to be used for characterization, a SEM of higher magnitude and resolution is required. Our plan was instead to use a transmission electron microscope but unfortunately it was been unfunctional for that last week of iGEM.
The pictures below are SEM pictures of the negative control strain DH5alpha and wild type MG1655.

Stability assay
To determine the stability of our pSB1C3-K343004 plasmid, a stability experiment was carried out according to protocol [ SA1.1 ]. E. coli MG1655/pSB1C3-K343004 was grown in LB media without chloramphenicol, whereby no selection pressure is exerted on the bacteria. Dilutions of the culture was spread onto LA plates and LA plates with 35µg/mL chloramphenicol, respectively, and the colony forming units (CFU) was determined for each plate. The CFU for the LA plates represents the total amount of bacteria in the culture, and the CFU of LA plates with chloramphenicol corresponds to the amount of plasmid carrying bacteria. The percentage of the total amount of bacteria carrying the plasmid was plotted in a semi-logarithmic graph as a function of number of generation.
Figure 8: Stability assay of E. coli strain MG1655-pSB1C3-K343004 showing that almost all cells have shed their plasmids within 20 generations, however some cells kept the plasmids for up to 40 generations. All data can be seen under Raw data

Video-based collaboration:
  We have filmed China's bio-safety education video with Shanghai University of Science and Technology and 11 other universities. We undertook the part of design and shooting of the eighth episode, laboratory reagent leakage treatment.
  1.Background  
  We were connected by Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The lack of teaching materials in the field of bio-safety education in China, the obsolete of the laboratory-safe instructional videos and the disconnection between the content and the actual work of today's laboratories caused us making some educational videos. We aimed to strengthen students' bio-safety awareness and correct students’ operation which do not conform to safety standards. We hope to improve the level of bio-safety education in China and the safety awareness of people with the help of the Yale Laboratory Safety Handbook and other foreign bio-safety education materials.

3.Overview 
  We choose ""reagent leak treatment"" as the theme and narrated a story through the form of melodrama. Two students missed he teacher's teaching because they were late in experiment class. They accidentally overturned the test tube containing ether, while dropping the ether. Being panic, they opened the doors and windows immediately and asked the teacher for help. After the teacher handled the accident, he educated the students and mentioned what had happened before: solid reagent leakage treatment (take the case of sodium bromide leakage as an example) and the leakage treatment of ultra clean workbench medium.

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," the community. This can be done by organising competitions, having themed discussions, or in general, organizing inclusive activities for the community. We believe that such activities will engage the community, challenge DIYbiologists with short-term goals to work toward, and provide them with a sense of commitment towards their hobby and the community. In this way, the DIYbio community can grow in a more robust manner.
Accountability & transparency
DIYbio already has a healthy regard for being open and transparent, and there are no secrets from the general public. In addition, we believe it should adopt some system to un-anonymise the community. Setting up a DIYbio community based social network is one way of doing this; imagine a Facebook for DIYbio! Members can more easily find other DIYbiologists in their area, organise meetups, share what they're doing, get advice on whatever they're doing and so on. All the while, there is a public record of all discussions, meetups & transactions on the website.
This will go a long way in increasing public confidence about the transparency of the community.
DIYbio can also effect a web-shop to sell sensitive items such as bacterial cultures, pipettes or DNA gel stains to registered members. This does not have to be a monetary enterprise, so that DIYbio can remain a not-for-profit organization. The idea here is to introduce some level of accountability for the consumables that DIYbiologists need to use.
One other important way to introduce accountability to DIYbio relates back to an earlier point. By having a clear purpose, DIYbiologists can as a community, work towards fixed goals. Naysayers will not and should not get the opportunity to cast doubt on DIYbio as a whimsical hobby; let it not be said that DIYbiologists have idle minds ripe for spawning mischief.
For example, one of the advantages of the DIYbio approach is that there is no compulsion to source research funding or file patents like real researchers. So what if the DIYbio community can complement local instituitional research efforts? Perhaps DIYbio can be the ""crowd-sourced"" approach to the extensive task of developing biological standards, indexes & references.
In this way, we believe that DIYbio can build up credibility among the public, while offering participants a definite sense of achievement. To the community's credit, they have already displayed their eagerness to collaborate by approaching some iGEM teams in their area to work together.
Safety, security & ethics
We are not denying that DIYbio has a lot of potential. That potential can be tapped, surely and safely, if the community can address"

Fluorescence  was measured using a plate reader (Ex: 548nm +/-9nm, Em: 581nm +/-20nm) and normalized to OD600 of the cell suspension. All measurements were performed as triplicates.
 
Pfet3
Before we could observe the regulation of Pfet3 through the co-expressed membrane-bound progestin receptors, we needed to investigated the native function of Pfet3 which is the response to intracellular iron concentration. Therefore we grew yeast containing the Pfet-mOrange-pTUM100 construct in a low-ion environment (Low-iron medium (LIM) contained 1 mM EDTA). The promoter activity of Pfet3 had increased after 4 h of incubation in low-iron medium compared to cells which were grown in normal synthetic complete medium (fig. 6). After 8 h of incubation in LIM the promoter activity had increased 3-fold. The dependence of Pfet3 activity on iron allows modifying the expression level of the repressors mig1 and rox1. This is desirable as sensitivity analysis has shown that the maximal repressor concentration is crucial for the functionality of the measurement system. Nevertheless, this finding brings along new challenges as we need to maintain Pfet3 activity constant to avoid an undesired influence on the measurement.

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
As useful a tool as synthetic biology is proving to be, it undeniably raises certain concerns for the possible hazards it could bring about in biological systems. Even with the proper biosafety guidelines implemented adequately in research laboratories, the break out of a rogue microorganism is a clear and present threat, especially if pathogenic strains’ potential for bioterrorism is considered. Countries should have the ability to respond quickly and solidly to any microbial outbreak that might occur in the future. An international organization with first-rate specialists dedicated to preserving humanity’s general immunologic welfare should be able to accurately respond to an epidemic by creating effective recombinant vaccines with a minimal response time through biotechnological methods, such as the one used by Dr. José Manuel Aguilar Yáñez for the influenza AH1N1 virus in response to the 2009 outbreak.
As for iGEM, de-activation switches could be developed to be attached to potentially dangerous parts so that they are destroyed or rendered inactive if they are placed outside the laboratory environment. For example, light degradation or perhaps auxotrophy represent potential tools that could be used to keep synthetic biological activity in tight control.

What makes our project a great one is not only the project itself,                         but also the engagement with public issues.
See our story.
Winter Camp
After the 2015 Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share                                 their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire. Students                                 of different majors including life science and technology, electronic engineering, software,                                 art design and so on came to our publicity.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic                                 biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students’ interest in synthetic                                 biology and they wanted to know more                                 about the logic design and skills required to start a project.
Many of them wished to take systematic courses to have better understanding of the core concept about synthetic biology including “design, build and test”. They would like to not only gain more besides biology knowledge, but also extend to how to give a good presentation and how to integrate the mathematical equations into the iGEM project. Based on their needs, we prepared several lectures for eveyone may be interested in the skills required for iGEM competition, the speakers were our instructors and team members. Here are the topics:
(1) The history and development of synthetic biology (Chun Li)
(2) Literature searching and reading (Chenyi Li)
(3) Photoshop training (Mingming Cao)
(4) Academic writing and English presentation training (Hui Luo)
(5) Brainstorm introduction (Zeyan Li)
(6) System biology and mathematical model (Pengcheng Zhang)
We got many positive feedback from students. The overview of synthetic biology                                 let them know how broad the field is. And the training of software such as                                 Photoshop and Matlab shall facilitate their use of tools. It’s the beginning                                 of studying, not the end. They showed great interest in the concept of                                 standardization and the idea of engineering design. And we also invited                                 them to visit our labs. From preparation to implementation, the whole winter                                 camp lasted for two months. Then, we welcomed students                                 who showed great passion to iGEM to take part in the brainstorm activity.

Vanillin in Novel Plants Project
Vanillin is one of the major compounds in the vanilla flavor. A phenolic aldehyde, vanillin is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, beverages, as well as a fragrant compound in different products. The demand of Vanillin exceeded the natural production, so annually most vanillin is produced via chemical synthesis.  We intend to produce vanillin in different plants as a natural alternative for vanillin production.

Introduction
Whether it’s a child’s first ice cream cone or the secret ingredient of a five star chef, everyone loves vanilla flavoring. Europeans first became aware of vanilla around 1520 and ever since then countless products featuring the beloved aromatic have been created. Vanillin, one of the major compounds in the vanilla flavor, is often produced by chemical synthesis due to the scarcity and high cost of natural vanilla extract.  Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-lysase, more commonly known as HCHL, is an enzyme that converts feruloyl-CoA to vanillin and acetyl-CoA. HCHL is naturally produced by Pseudomonas putida Kt2440, a gram-negative rod-shaped saprotrophic soil bacterium. As plants naturally possess large pools of phenolic compounds used in lignin biosynthesis, we hope to be able to express HCHL within plants to convert feruoyl-CoA to vanillin.
Background
In order to express this enzyme within plants, HCHL must be cloned from Pseudomonas putida and modified for codon optimization in plants. This modification will involve the use of the Kozak sequence, which through experimental observation has been recognized as playing a major role in translational initiation. Additionally, a double stop codon along with the CaMV 35s promoter and Nos terminator will be utilized.
Method
In order to transform plants we first obtained cultures of Pseudomonas putida kt2440. We then PCR amplified the genomic DNA in order to amplify the HCHL enzyme. The 35s promoter and NOS terminator were amplified from p cambia p1201 vector.  The 35s promoter was amplified with 2 sticky ends, at the beginning of the sequence with an EcorI restriction site and at the end with Xba1. The HCHL gene was amplified with a  Xba1 restriction"

From our initial idea, the design of our toehold switches and our model to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work.
Here, we have broken our project down into its different parts. For each, we explain the role feedback played in improving the aspect of the project, and why we changed what we did.

Dr Kirsten Jensen
Our initial constructs used a constitutive promoter. After cloning our construct in pSB1C3 plasmid, we attempted to amplify them in E. coli. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find.
We asked Dr Kirsten Jensen, an expert in synthetic biology at Imperial College London for advice. She inspected our sequences and suggested that the transcripts from our constructs were toxic to E. coli. She therefore suggested that we switch our promoter to an inducible promoter to avoid synthesis of the transcript during amplification in E. coli.
Following her advice, we used an arabinose inducible promoter, which resolved the issue for the 15b-5p switches and allowed us to continue with our experiments. However, the 27b-3p switches were still toxic.
See the results page for more details.

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," greatly increased interest in the field, but in the near future the public will have to come to the realization that synthetic biology has limitations and is very far from actualizing many of the goals which have been presented to the public [11]. At this point of disillusionment, public interest will decrease, most likely accompanied by a decrease in research funding. In the case of nanotechnology, the initial excitement of the field throughout the 2000s has been subsiding, and federal funding for the field is also being decreased [17]. If synthetic biology follows this same path (Fig. 1), difficulties may arise in the development of engineered bacterial therapeutics. The very early stage of this type of research, combined with the long lead times for preclinical development and approval of therapeutics, and the fact that no such therapy has previously been approved will result in a very long timescale for the introduction of engineered bacterial therapeutics. This means that both near-term and long-term decreases in research funding for synthetic biology could significantly hinder their development.
It is clear that throughout all stages of research, engineered bacterial therapeutics will encounter hurdles in public perception including mixed opinions of synthetic biology, false impressions of the potential and dangers of the field, and potential decreases in interest and funding for the field. However, these hurdles can be overcome if several measures are taken by synthetic biologists (including iGEM teams), the lay public, the government and the media. Firstly, when iGEM teams, synthetic biologists, and the media describe advances in synthetic biology, we must strive for informational accuracy in our portrayals of the science. Phrases such as ""creating life"" and ""playing god"" detract from public opinion of the field. In response to this, the government has moved in the right direction by calling for an independent organization to fact-check the many claims made about synthetic biology which are disseminated to the public4. In parallel to such a strategy, improving public scientific literacy and education would decrease the likelihood that they accept such claims as truths. iGEM teams have contributed positively to this by engaging in outreach campaigns to the lay public, and the existence iGEM itself has greatly increased synthetic biology awareness and education among youth.
If the public is well-educated about synthetic biology and understands its immense potential in medicine, we believe that synthetic bacterial therapeutics will overcome perception and funding hurdles in the near future and eventually treat diseases in ways which were not possible before.

Coli physiology, the glyoxylate shunt genes are already present, but repressed by a repressor encoded by the iclR gene (Waegeman et al. , 2011). Deleting this gene will make it possible to have an increased flux through the TCA cycle. Using this knockout with minimal mutations, we receive an E. Coli which follows the same metabolic engineering principles as the Synechocystis strain proposed by iGEM team Amsterdam, and is therefore expected to be stable in terms of production (Fig. 2).
This strain is previously made by Song et al. , (2013) and produced 1.45g/L fumaric acid from 15g/L glucose in 24h in flask culture under aerobic conditions. This strain can be further optimized for higher fumaric acid yields; however, this always comes at the risk of impairing other functions.
Figure 2. Central central metabolic pathways in E. coli after engineering E. coli for fumarate production. Thick arrows indicate increased flux by the overexpression of the corresponding gene. The X indicates that the deletion of the corresponding gene. Enzymes encoded by the genes shown are: fumA,  aerobic Class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumB, anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase; fumC, fumaric acid hydratase (fumarase C); iclR, isocitrate lyase repressor. (Adapted from Song et al. (2013))
Fumarates effect on the microbiome of cattle
In theory, fumarate has the potential to decrease methane synthesis in cattle, as it can redirect the available hydrogen into propionate rather than into methane (Fig 3). Fumarate has been proven to reduce methane emission in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Mcginn et al. , 2004). However, a recent in vivo study found no effect of adding fumarate to cattle feed on methane emission. This finding contradicts earlier findings. It is possible that a higher level of supplementation than that used in the recent study would be needed to alter methane production in vivo. It is estimated that the level of supplementation in the recent study provided about 15 mM of fumaric acid (assuming a ruminal volume of 40 L; 116.07 g/mol), although these calculations do not account for fluid dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro."

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html,"em/Z.pdf Interesting information about the Z domain of Protein A, text from the doctoral thesis ""Interaction-Engineered Three-Helix Bundle Domains for Protein Recovery and Detection"" by Tove Alm from 2010 at KTH
http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/remediatedSequence.do?structureId=2SPZ
Andreas: How will we prevent protein A from entering the blood stream? If it is able to penetrate the skin cells to the spot where antibodies are present, it is also likely to ”exit” the skin into the blood stream. If this happens, protein A will not only cause a severe immune shock, it will also interfere with any type of antibody in the blood, not just the ones targeting vitiligo. This is especially true if Protein A is proteolytically very stable, as stated in (e) above.
Are there any examples mammalian in vivo Protein A studies? It would be a great leap forward if there are any such examples, showing how Protein A interacts with the mammalian immune system.  - I found a website at the US National Cancer Insitute, where they mention two clinical trials aiming at using Staphylococcus aureus Protein A as a cancer treatment. The clinical trials made it to phase 2 (out of the usual 4, if I remember correctly), but were then closed. I haven’t been able to find any statements, links or articles on why they were closed, but here is a link to the NCI website: http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C17166 - Now I found an article from the mid-80s on Protein A. Not sure if it is connected to the clinical trials at NCI, but here’s a PubMed link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6379115 - There are also several articles mentioning ex vivo methods with Protein A for cancer treatments.
Nina: Size of protein A with Z domain: 7 kDA
IgG protease
IgG antibodies are enriched in vitiligo patients. IgG proteases could partially solve this problem. Also, IgG protease could be fused with Protein A to get more activity from the protease.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Society_-_-_TEXT.html," observe differences and similarities between the public in Sweden and in the Czech Republic. The results were compared in regards to education and gender as well.
The survey consisted of eleven questions. The first two questions were about gender and age and the third was about if they’d ever heard of GMOs. If the respondent’s answer here was “no” we would explain what it stood for. If they at this point did recognize GMOs we would continue. If they still didn’t recognize what GMOs were we would thank them for their time but unfortunately tell them that we could not obtain any more useful information from them. The explanation of the abbreviation was the only information we gave during the questioning in order to avoid affecting the respondent. The remaining questions consisted of some yes/no/don’t know-questions and some about their feelings towards GMO in general and the research on GMOs based on a scale from 1-10. After the respondent had answered every question we would ask them if they wanted to know more about GMO and about iGEM. To those who agreed we would talk about Golden Rice, biotechnologically produced insulin, about iGEM in general and about our project in an effort to further spread knowledge about GMOs and synthetic biology to the public.
The survey in its entirety can be seen here .
The total amount of people interviewed from the general public were 94 (44 from Sweden and 50 from the Czech Republic), however six of those from Sweden didn’t recognize the term GMO and therefore they didn’t answer any further questions. The total number of academics (biologists) were 82, 63 of whom were from the Czech Republic and 19 were from Sweden.
Overall, a few initial observations can be made. Academics have a more positive attitude towards GMOs in general than the public. Males seem to be more positive about GMOs than females when regarding the public, however even if the difference is statistically significant in total it’s only in Sweden it’s actually significant where the difference is large. The difference between genders in the Czech Republic is not significant. People from the Czech Republic are more positive about GMOs than those from Sweden (tobs=3.30 and tstat(0.05,60)=1.671 in a one-sided t-test with assumed different variance), however how we approached the respondents, where we went or even what day we went on could all affect this outcome.
Figure 1, a comparison of the results obtained regarding the respondents general feeling towards GMO. The respondent were asked to express their feeling on a scale from 1-10 were 1 relates to a very negative attitude"

Right: The cartoons depict receptor ternary complexes in kinase-active (on) and kinase-inactive (off) signaling states.  Changes in chemoeffector occupancy drive the complexes toward one state or the other.  During sensory adaptation, changes in receptor methylation level shift signaling complexes toward the opposing state to restore a balance between CCW and CW signal outputs.  The actual stoichiometry and structure of receptor signaling complexes are not known.  Note that receptor methyl groups are attached to specific glutamic acid (E) residues in the MCP cytoplasmic domain, forming glutamyl methyl esters and neutralizing the negative charge on the glutamyl carboxyl group.  Charge neutralization probably plays an important role in controlling receptor output state.

For many of the more controversial and unpopular research fields, the researchers often do not receive the attention and attention they pay. Synthetic biology is such an area. In China, because the public is more resistant to GM products, the research and the public are almost lost. Researchers often cannot judge whether the results he has worked hard to make are the real needs of the public, or the pseudo-demand he imagines. The lack of public knowledge of synthetic biology further expands the communication barrier between the research team and the public, and thus a large number of scientific research results are not happy or even dare to use. Even more frightening is that social media is full of a large number of pseudo-sciences. Some of them are well-known for their traffic sensationalism, and they are alarmist to promote some wrong scientific knowledge and opinions, which cause great trouble to the public's scientific cognition.
However, we can use this applet to keep our scientific research projects in a more succinct and easy-to-understand manner while keeping scientific rigor, and let the public better understand what we are doing. The public can participate in the project in time to truly understand the real part of the experiment. This will provide a bridge of communication between researchers and the general public, which will better attract the public to understand and accept the knowledge of synthetic biology. Let synthetic biology researchers get more support and help.
4. We hope that people will have the opportunity to learn more about synthetic biology, reduce misunderstandings in synthetic biology, and further promote the development of synthetic biology.
There are many misunderstandings about transgenic and synthetic biology in China. Synthetic biology like plague is generally feared and evaded. We hope to use some successful projects and cases to carry out scientific popularization of synthetic biology for a large number of potential users. If the public can learn more"

MagneGST Protein Purification
Preparation of Cells:
Bacterial cultures can be grown in tubes or flasks. Grow the culture containing the appropriate GST-fusion protein (GST-spycatcher) to an O.D.600 between 0.4 and 0.6, then induce protein expression. For IPTG induction, add IPTG till final concentration of 0.4mM-1mM and incubate at 37℃ for 3 h or at 16℃ overnight. Depending upon the expression system, other methods of induction and growth conditions can be used. Induction conditions often require optimization. For 1ml bacterial cultures, pellet cells by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 3 min and carefully remove the supernatant. For culture volumes larger than 1 ml, pellet the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min. Carefully remove the supernatant. The cell pellet can be frozen at –20℃ or–70℃ for long-term storage, or the cells can be lysed immediately.
Cell Lysis:
1. Prepare cell pellets from bacterial culture. Remove all growth medium. Recommended: Freeze the cell pellets at –20℃ (15–20 min is usually sufficient) or on dry ice for 5–10 min. Freezing cell pellets will increase efficiency of cell lysis of certain strains, such as the BL21 series of strains, or when cultures are grown to a high density. For cultures of O.D.600 >2, more lysis buffer will be required.
2.Resuspend the pellet in MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent at room temperature (20–25℃) by pipetting or gentle mixing. (for 500 ml of bacteria culture, use 10 ml of MagneGST Cell Lysis Reagent)
3.Incubate the cell suspension at room temperature for 20–30 min on a rotating platform or shaker and then sonicate for 1 min.
Particle Equilibration:
1. Thoroughly resuspend the MagneGST particles by inverting the bottle to obtain a uniform suspension.
2. Pipet 100 μl of MagneGST particles into a 1.5 ml tube.
3. Place the tube in the magnetic stand, and allow the MagneGST particles to be captured by the magnet.
4. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.

We are planning to read related literature and develop this excitiing funcion afterwards. Education & Public Engagement Game: ""GO ANTS!!!"" Be Curious about the fantastic biochemical reactions in organisms? Feeling boring in biochemical textbooks? If your answer is yes, then try our game! This year our team designed and developed a fascinating game called “GO ANTS”. This game aims at spreading basic knowledge of metabolic pathway in organisms to general public. It is a double-operated game which incites people’s pleasure of cooperation.The players need to convert a compound to another compound through several enzyme reactions within a specific time limit in order to win. Players control two ants to move and collide with specific enzyme to complete an enzyme reaction via printing different keyboards. If the ants collide with wrong enzyme, then they need to collide with a specific enzyme to undo this reaction.  People will learn related knowledge about enzyme reactions and metabolic pathways in organisms.
A number of students enjoyed playing our game. Some of the players also gave some advice to improve the game experience.

Video call with Ph.D. David De Jong
The application method of our product is feasible, but we should make sure bees could digest them. An excellent measure he suggested us was to eventually plan to extract the hypopharyngeal glands in bees and determine if our AMPs are entering these glands.
He believes okay for us to supply our peptides and then try to see if they help bees resist foulbrood, as for now, he thinks it's an excellent first step if we can produce some material and prove it to work on the laboratory
If we did get to test within larvae, we asked him which would be an optimum method to find out if our peptides are getting to the developing brood.
Based on his advice we can:
Consider two scenarios, feeding the larvae in vitro, where we won't be making use of a nurse bee or the second scenario where the nurse bee feeds the larvae.
See if our peptides get into the worker jelly; we can look at the hypopharyngeal glands and take a worker jelly sample from the cells where larvae are swirling.
Finally, compare to a control.
Regarding the incidence of American or European foulbrood, he mentioned he has worked in the US for control of these two diseases, the percentage was always around one percent, sometimes two. In Brazil, it's not established, they have few European foulbrood cases and there is no presence of American foulbrood, by the other hand, in Argentina, this last has been a big problem.
In Mexico, we have the presence of Varroa, he mentioned that's a concern because is probably affecting the bee's immune system, another reason to be concerned about the AMPs levels.
We asked him if it's legal to burn beehives on Brazil, he answered it’s not for someone who is not a beekeeper, the fireman is only supposed to do it if it’s a matter of environmental protection. He told us about when he was a US bee inspector, what they would do is when they find the disease, they would burn the colonies, he explained to us the methodology they followed.

Thus, it is quite difficult not to absorb an excessive amount of sugar in our daily lives. In the hopes of preventing our bodies from absorbing too much glucose, our team aims to engineer bacteria that absorbs glucose more efficiently. Our team constructed active glucose transporters on the membrane of E.coli, enabling the glucose uptake to become faster than intestine cells. On the other hand, our team has designed a suicide circuit ensuring the bacteria won’t absorb all the sugar so that the body can get an adequate amount of sugar.

To understand what doubt people will react when seeing our product and to increase the extent of public acceptance, we invited The Mingdao Voice, an outstanding club for thinking and discussing. We introduced our project to them during the club time in the hope of getting inspiring feedback. 
 
 
The Mingdao Voice is a club organized by students themselves in Mingdao High School. Students there follow social issue with interest and hold lots of lectures, sharing thoughts with audiences. Quite unique this club is. 
 
This is the first time Mingdao iGEM jumps out of the field of science and collaborate with the elite in humanities and social science. The way they think against the holistic issue and the speech hitting the nail on the head made us realize more about the further influence our product will bring to the world if released. 
The followings are what we discussed with The Mingdao Voice :
Research has indicated that there will be a subtle decline in weight by reducing sugar intake in daily diet. The study lasted for about 8 months. The average decline on weight is about 1.7 bounds. Participants who consumed more sugar gain not much weight than those didn’t. 
“There is also evidence that the longer the study, the more striking the effect.” said researcher Jim Mann, DM, PhD, professor of human nutrition and medicine at the University of Otago. 
But, there’s no correspondence between sugar intake and changes on weight found on children. That may be owing to the children’s ignorance on the advice for diet we gave. Nonetheless, if we just focus on their consumption of sugary beverages, there’s some relation be found. Their habit of having sugary beverages significantly influences their weight, leading to obesity. The research discovered that"

Model - Lattice Model
One of the goals of our project was providing our detection tool with a long shelf-life under simple storage conditions. For this reason, we investigated the use of Tardigrade-specific intrinsically Disordered Proteins (TDPs) to preserve Cas13a activity upon desiccation and storage at room temperature. These TDPs originate from the tardigrade, an extremely resilient micro-animal ( Sloan et al. 2017 ), and mediate the tardigrade’s desiccation tolerance. The mechanism behind this has been hypothesized to be a vitrification process ( Boothby et al. 2017 ). By forming a glass-like matrix upon desiccation, TDPs protect cellular structures and proteins within the cells from degradation. As hydrophilic, disordered proteins, they can form dynamic scaffolds upon desiccation, while they have mutual repulsive interactions.
This matrix formation implies that during dehydration, the TDPs rearrange themselves around, in our case, Cas13a, in a process that could also be compared to phase separation. To simulate the dynamics of this phase separation, we decided to utilize a lattice model, which is well established for modelling these kinds of problems. With our model, we were able to determine which of the four TDPs CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 33020 and SAHS 68234 was most suitable for preserving Cas13a activity after drying and storage at room temperature. Additionally, we studied the TDP behaviour at different concentrations and estimated in what concentrations TDPs have to be used for drying.

Proteins in the lattice model
To keep our model simple, we wanted to take only next neighbour interactions on the lattice into account. Therefore, to be sure that no long-range interactions were neglected in the model, we calculated the Debye length, the length over which electrostatic interactions decline exponentially, with equation (debyelength)
$$\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot\epsilon_r \cdot k_B\cdot T}{2\cdot N_A\cdot e^2 \cdot I}}\tag{1}$$
where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, $N_A$ the avogadro constant and I the ionic strength of the solution ( Russel and Saville 1989"

Campus Activity
Throughout this year, we worked hard to popularize the concept of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance on campus. As college students, campus is our most familiar and influential place. We organized a series of campus activities, both on college campus and on high school campus, with the hope to recruit freshmen or high school students who are interested in science and would like to devote themselves to our projects. After all, the development of synthetic biology should start from students.
In December 2013, we held an activity named “Early birds in the Laboratory” for the freshmen of our college. Basic experimental skills of molecular biology and the concept of synthetic biology were taught.
In June 2014, on the opening day of our university, we set up a tent on campus to answer questions about the synthetic biology and iGEM for high school students.
In June 2014, we arrived at Chaozhou district for a three-day propaganda in the local high schools. We visited 4 high schools, had our tents there to popularize synthetic biology, and gave presentations to deliver knowledge. Meanwhile, our brochures about synthetic biology reached more than 2,000 students.
We organized and participated in the ""2014 National High Educated Teenager Scientific Camp of south china university of technology"" during which we gave a lecture about the advanced synthetic biology to combat the Antimicrobial Resistance and iGEM to all of the teenagers joined this activity.
""The 2014 National High Educated Teenager Scientific Camp-sub-camp of South China University of Technology"" was successfully held at SCUT. 200 senior students from Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Yunnan took part in this educational activity. This activity was directed by the theme ""Fly to SCUT,"

Good because we got a break from work and can just enjoy the beach, the waves!!, the sand, and everything else.
Bad because we’re behind and we got quite a lot of work to do. Ohwell.
But the beach was definitely amazing. The sand was fine and soft. There were waves and they were fun to float in. One of our professors brought a skimboard, and I tried to do that for a while. There were 2 other guys doing it on our beach and they ended up coming up to me and taught me a couple of tricks to stay on the board. Still, I fell a couple of times but I finally did I managed to skid for like a couple of yards. hahah. But I really wished that I can surf more than that though. Doing this reminded me of the time during my senior trip when we went the Bali Island and we all learned how to surf for an hour.

I finally got cgi scripts to work! Another CS prof had to change our directory’s permission settings (something that we couldn’t do), so there was pretty much nothing I could’ve done to help that situation.
But in order to format cgi scripts, I had to learn how to code in perl, another programming language. So for the most part of today, I was learning perl basics. Which was something that I picked up quite easily. Well. kinda. I mean, the syntax is weird. I could write and understand the easy stuff, but what I really need to do with the cgi script is to create a good search engine, which requires higher level coding and understanding. So… back to researching, learning, and understanding.
As for actual progress today, I got mini scripts to work! And I also made a webpage for search result.
July 23: Back to Square One
So after working last night and today, we tried to trouble shoot our way around the problem of why our executable file is not running on the server. I learned that:
- You can’t just change the bit of a folder from 64 to 32. You have to program the whole thing in a 32 bit software. (So here, I learned about bits, computer systems)
- You can’t execute a Windows based file (C#- the language our executable file) in a linux server (puma). We have a “binary error” because the Linux server doesn’t recognize the file"

28 Juli - 3 August
The CP promoters in pSB1C3, that were isolated in the week of 14 - 20 Juli, were tested on their insert size. For this, a PCR was done on the plasmid using the primers VF2 (BBa_G00100) and VR (BBa_G00101) were used. The insert size corresponded to the expected size.
A touchdown PCR was done on the genes of the nisin operon and the  sfGFP(Bs) gene. In this PCR the annealing temperature dropped from 55 °C to  45 °C, lowering the temperature with 1 &degC each cycle. This  unfortunately resulted in a PCR program of just 10 cycles, instead of the intended 30. The remaining steps of the program were finished the next morning. Only the genes NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were amplified this way, see figure 1. Therefore, the PCR was repeated, this time with a complete cycle. No additional genes were amplified this way.
Another attempt was made for amplification of the remaining genes. This time, the most ideal annealing temperature for each gene was used by using a gradient PCR and placing the tubes at the optimal temperature. This still did not amplify the remaining genes. Also, a PCR with a general annealing temperature of 50 &degC was done. This also did not amplify the remaining genes.
The genes that were amplified in the first PCR (NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)) were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit from Thermo Scientific. The purified products were digested with the enzymes EcoRI  and PstI, using 2 &mul of the product. These purified and restricted products were loaded on gel, see figure 2. It was then discovered that the genes were barely visible on gel. The restricted genes were purified with the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit and the concentration was measured with the NanoDrop 1000. The clean, restricted products were too low in  concentration to be suitable for l"

Digestion and PCR Backbone on Selection Construct Plasmid 6/14/11
June 14 - Bioinformatics
We finished writing the generate function, and now have a working sequence generator. We also began more in-depth research into the 2011 work by Persikov which deals with how the zinc finger binds to DNA. He predicts several relations which we should be able to test.
Proposed novel interactions between helical zinc finger residues and base pairs of the target DNA sequence (based on Persikov 2011 )
Persikov sent us his SVM code (used to calculate the probability of a sequence binding to given DNA), so we also worked on adapting this to use when narrowing our sequences to those most likely to work.
There are four canonical amino acid-base interactions involved in zinc finger interactions.
Amino acids in positions -1, 3, and 6 on the helix are known to interact with the 3 bases of the triplet. In addition, the amino acid in position 2 interacts with the upstream base of the complementary strand (Klug 2010).
In addition, Persikov (2011) has proposed novel interactions between these four amino acids based on his analysis of zinc finger binding data up to 2005.
Persikov uses the information between these four amino acid-base interactions in his SVM, to determine whether a finger would be a good binder to a particular DNA sequence.
In order to use his program, we need to convert the helices that are created by the generator into a format the SVM accepts.
The SVM only considers the four canonical interactions. It assigns a numerical value to each possible amino acid-base combination. The program that converts our data into a format the SVM accepts creates a string with these numerical values based on Persikov's key. (See this page for more details on this program.)
Brandon learned basic Python today. Justin created a JavaScript program that recognizes potential binding sites from a given sequence.

Our Project
To control the expression in a cell population, it is essential that the action of quorum sensing is fast and sensitive enough!
This aims to control the time for an inserted gene of interest to function before being knocked out by Cre recombinase.
The function of the Recombination module is to knockout the gene of interest from the plasmid.
Our project can applied to various application in the future.

Assembly of functionalized S-layer proteins
iGEM assembly line
Clone wars
Freiburg Assembly example
To create fusion proteins you have to use a BioBrick assembly which assembles in frame so your fusion protein is functional. The standard BioBrick assembly does not assemble in frame so you have to use other standards - like the Freiburg or the Gibson assembly. Our S-layer gene is already provided in the Freiburg assembly standard so after ordering it you can directly start assembling your fusion proteins of choice to it. In addition, we provided these genes not only in this easy to use standard, but they also exist under the control of a T7 / lac promoter (<partinfo>K525303</partinfo> and <partinfo>K525403</partinfo>). So after cloning you can easily express them in an E. coli strain which carries a T7 polymerase in its genome like BL21(DE3) or KRX. Do not forget to add a his-tag (<partinfo>K157011</partinfo>) to your fusion protein so you can easily purify it and follow the next steps in this guide!

HP-Overview
     Human practice is an important part of iGEM. As future scientists, we mainly focused on scientific research which may create new applications and method used in everywhere and everything. Nevertheless, we also have a great responsibility about what and how we provide them.
     As stem cells therapy is unfamiliar for most of the people, we outstretched our project into the discussion of the safety and efficiency of stem cell therapy. So we discussed with lots of fellows and experts in CCiC about our project and the concern of medical treatments. We also introduced the concept and highlights about stem cell therapy to senior high school students and presented our ideas in SYSU-Bio-festival (an important activity in our university) to promote the treatments of stem cells and allow more people to know them. Furthermore, we set up a questionnaire to collect people’s opinions on stem cell therapy.
     During CCiC, iGEMers from different team were also helpful with advice on how we could improve our system. We harvested suggestions for our experiments, poster and presentation.
     For communication with the teams in SYSU, we helped SYSU-Medicine and SYSU-Software with the vital issues during the experiments and they also gave helpful advices to us. We also collaborated with SZU and FAFU.
