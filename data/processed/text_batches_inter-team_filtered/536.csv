BIOFILM ENGINEERING
What are biofilms?
Biofilms are communities of microbes where the cells are in an aggregate on a surface, bound together by extra-membrane material made of a mixture of specialized carbohydrates and extra-membrane proteins. The special environment in the biofilm allows cells to survive harsher environments.
What is the “biofilm response”?
Bacteria cells can exist in multiple physiological states, which are caused by environmental factors. Common ones include heat shock, nutrient (carbohydrate or amino acid) starvation, metal micronutrient starvation, etc.
Gene expression in each of these physiological states is mediated by the changing the sigma factor involved in transcript synthesis. Each sigma factor has its own consensus sequence; the sigma factor on the RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoter regions. When a sigma factor is active, its effect is to shift which fractions of the genome are preferably expressed, because of the different promoter recognition consensus sequences. The sigma factor that is involved in the stationary phase (I.E. no motility, no reproduction) of E. coli strains is the σS factor. It directs the expression of genes necessary to induce biofilm and aggregation behavior are a subset of those genes whose promoters are recognized by the σSfactor.
Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.

Our results are presented as the Northern Hemisphere (comprised of mostly the United States) and the Southern Hemisphere (comprised of solely Australia).
In order for our team to create and distribute the survey, training by the Institutional Review Board was necessary. Documentation of the students who worked on the survey can be found on our safety page .
Northern Hemisphere Results
Overall, we were able to gather a broad array of information that can be portrayed to show the general beliefs of college aged students on the principles of GMOs, research involving genetic engineering, and the use of a ""cell-death"" mechanism to be implemented in bacteria.
Significant Results
A person who trusts their nation's policies and regulations is more likely to be accepting of GMOs.
A person who trusts scientists is more likely to be accepting of GMOs.
A person who supports the use of GMOs is more likely to support ""cell-death"" mechanisms
Tables of cross-tabulations and chi-squares of some prominent factors which showed great significance
Less Significant Results
A person's home location has some effect on certain GMO applications.
A person's major study area has some effect on certain GMO applications.
One example of this was that science and engineering students tended to have a greater acceptance of the applications of GMOs than those of other majors.
Comparison
As compared to the results of the respondents from the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere had similar opinions of GMOs.  Both places had a large amount of respondents who were supportive of the use of GMOs in different applications.
A significant difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres was the proximity in which the person would like to live near an area where GMOs are used.  As depicted below, those students of the Southern Hemisphere have a greater dislike of GMOs being used in a farm, field or stream than those students in the Northern Hemisphere.  Both sets of students have similar acceptance of GMOs used in a factory or laboratory, but would not necessarily want to live close to them.  The difference in opinions between the two geographical groups of respondents on the acceptance of GMOs used in a farm, field or stream is striking; this difference was not expected.  It would be an interesting study to collect more data and point out the factors that cause the students from the Northern Hemisphere to have such differing views from those of the Southern Hemisphere pertaining to GMO proximity.

The observed halos of the BL21 strain with the library and the reference strain had the same size in the negative control where H2Odd was used instead of an attractant. Therefore, every attractant triggered a chemotactic effect in BL21 cells holding the mutagenesis library. After the third round of selection, the fastest clones were identified and their plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced.
Fig. 2B: Exemplary pictures depicting the third round of selection of the first approach of the library selection assay In this figure, exemplary pictures of the third round of selection of the first approach, thus the first thawed cryostock of the library, are shown. In the next step (see figure 2A), the fastest colony again was cut out three times, incubated and plated on LB-agar plates containing chloramphenicol. The plasmid DNA of 2-4 clones for each attractant was extracted and sequenced. In each of the shown pictures, the clones containing the library were faster than the reference strain except for the negative control containing H2Odd in the Whatman paper. Here, the same swimming behavior could be observed. The swimming movement of the cells did not seem to be directed, because the halos had a round shape. Thus, no chemotaxis could be observed. In general, the different attractants caused a differently strong swimming behavior; e.g. the attractant caffeine always led to big halos, whereas the halos related to geraniol were smaller. Ref.: Reference strain (BL21 with pSB1C3_J23100_tar_QC).
Fig. 2C: Swimming behavior of selected clones versus retransformed clonesThe plasmid DNA was extracted from the clones that had resulted from the selection library and was transformed into fresh BL21 cells. The fresh BL21 should indicate, whether the before observed swimming behavior was dependent on the mutagenized receptor or the cells themselves. The cultures and 0.3 % tryptone swimming agar plates were prepared as described in the methods section. The halos produced by the selected clones were always bigger than the halos of the retransformed clones. In many cases even the reference strain showed a faster swimming movement than the retransformed BL21 clones. S. clones: Clones, selected through the mutation library. Retrafos: Clones, transformed with the extracted plasmids of the selected clones.

M.D Dr. Carolina Guzmán Brambila has a PhD in immunology,  currently she works as a teacher in courses related to cellular biology and immunology, in ITESM campus Guadalajara. We decided to turn to her counsel due to her vast knowledge in immunology, being our main concern if Lactobachill could cause adverse effects on the human body.   She told us that IL-6 is an interleukin involved in the functioning of many parts of the body, that it has a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity; so we need to take special care, otherwise it could cause immunosuppression or the development of autoimmune diseases.   She also mentioned there are studies that prove that IL-6 blocking has been used successfully in the past in the treatment of a variety of diseases.

After the induction of B1, anti-sigmaA is expressed and the value of sigmaA-memory changes from 1 to 0. However, anti-sigmaA has no effect on the transcription of PsigmaB and the value of sigmaB does not change. The same is also true of the input B2. Hence it can be confidently said that E. coli has two sigma memories.

The construction of our resettable counter is explained here.
The construction of our resettable counter is explained here. The maximum number this counter can count is 2.   Sigma factors used in this construction are Ecf20_992 (Sigma1, BBa_K1461004) and Ecf11_3726 (Sigma2, BBa_K1461005). The promoter that correspond to sigma1 and sigma2 are Pecf20_992 (Psigma1, BBa_K1461001) and Pecf11_3726 (Psigma2, BBa_K1461002), respectively. The corresponding anti-sigma factors are AS20_992 (anti-1, BBa_K1461006) and AS11_3726 (anti-2, BBa_K1461007) respectively. These two sigma factors were chosen because they most strongly activate transcription from the corresponding promoter within sigma factors which satisfy following conditions.

Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week, we did miniprep on sequence verified BBa_J04500 . We also ran PCR products of the first Kapa HiFi PCR of TALE A and TALE B primers on gel, no bands visible. Subsequent higher temperature gradient Kapa HiFi PCR produced bands around 2500bp and lots of non specific bands (figure 11). Gel extraction had very low yields (<20ng/uL) and poor purity, and repeated extractions produced similar results.

Week 12: July 15 - July 19
This week we completed ligation, transformation, overnight culture, and miniprep of 5 TALE target sequences (figures 14 and 15). The verification digest gel had strong bands at ~2000bp and weak bands at ~550bp, and plasmids were sent for sequence verification (figures 16 and 17).

The results of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B sequencing were back. However, we realized that TALEs have a Kozak sequence at the beginning, which increases the distance between the promoter and the start codon of the gene.

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

Kill Switch for Engineered Probiotics
Introduction
Why a kill switch for Engineered Probiotics?
Advancements in engineered probiotics have spurred a new generation of novel medical therapeutics and diagnostic solutions. Notable uses of this emerging technology include scientists using engineered microbes to successfully tumours in the gastrointestinal tract with minimal collateral damage. Yet, despite the developments in engineered probiotic medicine, the risk of having these engineered microbes leak into a non-designated environment remains an unresolved threat: a threat that could disrupt ecosystems and endanger patients [1]. Therefore, critical to the feasibility of a functional and commercial engineered probiotic are control systems called kill switches that allow for the spatial and temporal killing of the engineered microbe once removed from its specific target site. Although in recent years kill switches have undergone significant improvement, the feasibility of many existing kill switches in this field are limited because they rely on:
The limited specificity of a single input biosensor [2];
Artificial amino acids: chemicals that are often difficult and unsuitable for implementation in the human body [3]; and
A lack of measures that fail to protect against mutagenesis, leakage and system failure [4, 5, 6, 7]. Ultimately, since no kill switches have passed the standards set by regulatory environmental and, food and drug bodies, the vision of accessible consumer biotherapeutic products such as engineered probiotics will remain just that, a vision [8, 9].
We aim to improve current kill switches to meet such regulatory standards, starting with making the engineering of customised kill switches for engineered probiotics easier and more accessible.

Key findings
1. We have used modelling to study two kill switch designs, one generated automatically by CELLO (Automated Circuit) and one design by the team (Simple Circuit). The performance of kill-switch designs was evaluated based on the following criteria: number of parts required in a design, metabolic burden on cell, and response/lag time. Results showed that the kill-switch design by the team has faster response and lower metabolic burden. Hence, we proceeded to build and perform experiments with this design. Modelling helps!
2. The model has helped us to gain insights"

Project Components
In order to automate the output of a microfluidic device, we have divided our goals into three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, do-it-yourself active XY-translational stage that selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate, as well as automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.
To learn more about these components, explore the tabs below!
Microfluidics
Hardware
Software
Microfluidic chips are engineered devices that manipulate fluid flow through microchannels, which are typically molded or engraved into a material. Due to the small size of the channels, turbulent flow is minimized, allowing scientists to accurately direct fluids through the chip. The most common method of fabricating microfluidic devices is soft lithography, which creates channels by casting a polymer, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), onto a mold and curing the polymer. This, however, involves high costs due to the need to create a master mold for every chip design and the materials needed to create and cure the PDMS chip. In order to make microfluidics more accessible to synthetic biologists, we have adopted the Boston University CIDAR Lab's low-cost manufacturing protocol for microfluidic devices.
BU CIDAR Lab has created a manufacturing workflow, MakerFluidics, which allows scientists to create microfluidic devices by milling microchannels into polycarbonate using a desktop CNC mill.
These microfluidic devices are comprised of two layers of polycarbonate, the flow layer and control layer, which sandwich a thin layer of PDMS. The polycarbonate layers contain etched features that allow for the manipulation of fluid through the device and the PDMS allows for the actuation of valves, which selectively direct fluid flow. Typically, the fabrication of these devices ranges from one to two hours for milling, depending on the complexity of the design, and another hour for assembly.

Sequencing
We then sent these plasmids for sequencing analysis. This step provides us further information on the quality of our constructs.
The sequencing data confirmed the punctuated mutation (pIV*S324G) located in the mutated porin (see figure 3). Moreover, no other differences have been detected between the wild-type and the mutated porin.

PCR reaction
In order to generate linear fragments with a targeted randomized region and overlapping ends, we performed PCR reactions using different set of primers :
Cycling conditions:
Electrophoresis
To verify the length of our PCR products, we used a linear version of the PIV* construct obtained via restriction with BamHI or XhoI (see figure 4).

Gibson assembly
After amplification, those linear fragments are circularized back to a plasmid form thanks to the hybridization of the overlapping region and the Gibson assembly method.

Selection
First step: Selection of the open phenotype
During the first selection step on selective maltodextrin media, we were able to get leaky mutants (see figure 6).
Figure 6: Growth of leaky mutant on selective maltodextrin medium.
As a positive control, we used the pIV*S324G porin that grows on selective maltodextrin medium. On the other hand, for the negative control, we used the pIV WT that needs much more time to grow on this selective medium (see figure 7).
Figure 7: pIV*/pIV WT growth on selective maltodextrin media (controls)
Second step: Selection of the closed phenotype
To select an inducible opening or closing of the porin, we compared bacterial viability on selective maltodextrin media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+). If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#OSCAR#CatecholDegradation_-_-_TEXT.html," by the xylE gene on the Tol plasmid of Pseudomonas putida (Nakai et al., 1983).
Currently the registry has two BioBricks available of xylE.  One contained xylE with its native ribosome-binding site ( BBa_J33204 ), while the other part contained xylE under the glucose-repressible promoter cstA ( BBa_K118021 ).  Given that E. coli is grown in the presence of glucose, we designed a new construct to keep xylE expressed by using the tetR promoter ( BBa_R0040 ).
Figure 1: BioBrick genetic circuit for catechol degradation showing xylE under the tetR promoter
Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is an extradiol dioxygenase which cleaves catechol adjacent to the two hydroxyl groups.  When this occurs 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde is produced, which is yellow in colour.  This change in colour allows for visual assay to assess the activity of XylE.
Figure 2: Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE) converts catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde in the presence of oxygen. Adapted from Shu et al., 1995.
The visual assays were performed with E. coli cells transformed with ( BBa_K118021 ) as well as with E. coli cells transformed with the newly constructed part ( BBa_K902048 ) by bringing the supernatant of an overnight culture to a concentration of 0.1 M of catechol.  When the part ( BBa_K118021 ) was used, the pellet was first washed in M9-MM and centrifuged before catechol was added to the supernatant.  This was necessary to avoid the glucose in the LB from repressing the cstA promoter ( BBa_K118011 ).  Catechol was added to the supernatant because the reaction takes place outside of the cell. Within minutes of the addition of catechol to the supernatant, the solution turned from the pale yellow of LB to a bright yellow.  This was indicative that catechol was breaking down into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde, which was exactly what we expected!  This assay was completed by following the protocol written by the 2008 Edinburgh iGEM team.

Two readings for each sample at each time interval were taken and then an average was calculated for each time interval for both optical density and luminescence.
For each sample at each time interval the average luminescence (normalised by the background luminescence) was divided by the optical density and plotted on a graph, shown below as Figure 3 .
Figure 3: Characterisation data for the red light sensor.
Further characterisation of the RLS was attempted using the Beta-Galactosidase Assay (A Better Miller) from OpenWetWare and preliminary data was recorded and calculated as shown in Figure 4 . The cultures grown were as follows:
JM109 – RLS.lacZ.YFP (Light / Dark)
envZ – RLS.lacZ.YFP (Light / Dark)
JM109 – lacZ Control (Light / Dark)
JM109 – RLS.lacZ (Light / Dark)
The conditions were Cml 40 and IPTG 90 in similar ONs to those used in the YFP characterisation.
YFP RLS Characterisation
Red light = less yellow colour fluorescence.
No Red light = more yellow colour fluorescence.
This assay shows the fluorescence per unit of estimated biomass for a number of different times of incubation. We can see that the controls for YFP in both the JM109 and envZ mutant strains show reasonable paired results in both the light and the dark. This means that the controls work as expected, however the large difference between the JM109 and the envZ control pairs implies that most of the result seen in JM109 is due to background envZ activity.
The rest of the results however are of limited usefulness beyond the testing of our assay procedure and the benchmark they represent of the RLS system which we can use to further improve our characterisation assays. The reasons for the affect seen are similar to those listed above in the lacZ RLS characterisation, listed below.
Figure 4: Further characterisation data for the red light sensor.
lacZ RLS Characterisation
Red light = less yellow colour ONPG
No Red light = more yellow colour ONPG
This characterisation data was acquired using a β-Galactosidase substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside (ONPG) which is cleaved to form a yellow dye that can be easily visualised and absorbance measurements can be taken. This can be used as a direct measure of lac"
Waterloo,2015,Team:Waterloo#Lab#Plants_-_-_TEXT.html,"ling, the tool used to find candidate gRNA targets, also includes an efficiency score for how well the gRNA is expected to knock out the target. This score comes from Doench et al.
. Doench described the algorithm as follows on the Addgene blog: We examined sequence features that enhance on-target activity of sgRNAs by creating all possible sgRNAs for a panel of genes and assessing, by flow cytometry, which sequences led to complete protein knockout. By examining the nucleotide features of the most-active sgRNAs from a set of 1,841 sgRNAs, we derived scoring rules.
Non-overlapping
In several designs we were interested in using multiple gRNAs to target the same area (for example, for design II we chose four targets within P6). However, we didn't want to have any overlaps in our target sequence, since that would make our system less robust in the face of random mutations in a particular CaMV genome and would potentially cause interference between (d)Cas9 proteins vying to bind the same region. For this reason, only the single best gRNA in a region with many PAM sites could be chosen.
Protocol
The specific steps we followed to generate our gRNA sequences were as follows:
Downloaded all genome sequences in the Caulimovirus genus from NCBI (includes CaMV). These sequences are in the file caulimovirus_sequence.fasta.
That FASTA was uploaded to Guidance v2 with default parameters to generate a multiple sequence alignment.
Masked multiple sequence alignment based on base pairs that had at least 0.93% identity across all Caulimovirus. Note that we also tested alignments in the entire Caulimoviridae family, but the sequence homology was so low that there were very few continuous                                 conserved regions.
Copied the masked sequence for CaMV to Benchling, which removed all gaps (represented as dashes) automatically. The masked sequence can been seen at this read-only link .
We then created a CRISPR design on both the masked genome sequence from Guidance and unmasked CaMV genome, which was imported into Benchling using its NCBI Accession Number (NC_001497). The CRISPR design was run using the following parameters:
Start: 0, End: 8024 (entire genome)
PAM: NGG
Guide length: 20 nt
Design type: single guide
Genome for off-targets: TAIR10 (A. thaliania)
Genome region to exclude for off-targets: none

Readings were made at OD 600 nm
Blank: LB medium
Both green and red fluorescence were measured as well as optical density at 600nm. The control used for the OD600 measurement was the blank LB medium without cells, and for the measurement assay the blank was TOP10 cells in PBS buffer. The measurements were taken every four hours for 16 hours. The time required for each measurement was about an hour and a half.
In order to determine whether to include or exclude each sample from the data set, the mean and standard deviation of the triplicates were calculated and with them the coefficient of variation was obtained. When this value was higher than 15, the atypical value was eliminated.
The main practical limit on the number and rate of measurements with this instruments and protocol is that the time required was too long; plus, there wasn’t enough available material to do many repetitions of each sample. No extra material was acquired for the Interlab Study; the only difficulty was to obtain permission to use the microplate reader.
Section III: Measured Quantities
The units of the fluorescence measurement are relative units of fluorescence. The lowest value in fluorescence is 0 and the highest are superior to 900 relative units with this configuration and instrument.

Finishing up the concentration dialysis
8:11AM: withdrew 100uL from the cassette. It seems too dilute.
Ended up withdrawing the silk from the cassette at around 11:00AM... That's about a 21 hour concentration... Why did it not gel up? Is it because of the slightly less concentrated PEG (100g in 1000mL instead of 900mL water?)?
Ended up being 16% w/v.
Spinning Tamura
In any case, we spun 250 uL of it. Because this is fairly dilute silk, we could only add Tamura in a 1:750 Tamura:Silk ratio. Final dope concentration is 15% w/v.
Spin at 10 uL/min, into a 70% v/v EtOH bath
It suuuuuucks.
We got kind of frustrated. Switched to a 90% v/v Isopropanol (IPA) bath.
IPA seems to work very well
We indirectly measured the rate at which the silk comes out of the PEEK tubing by timing the rotation of tweezers as we collected the thread around it. We found 12 tweezer rotations in 26 seconds, where each ""rotation"" is a 180 degree turn. This translates to 7.3846 mm/s."
Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," solid human waste to obtain VFA, separation of VFA from fermented human waste, fermentation of genetically engineered bacteria with obtained VFA to produce PHB, and PHB extraction and purification. After discussing our project with Matthew Bamsey, who is a Chief Systems Engineer at the German Aerospace Center, we decided to use Equivalent System Mass (ESM) to evaluate all the stages of our process. In ESM analysis, pressurized volume, power generation, cooling power and crew time required for a proposed system are converted to an equivalent mass number and added to the system mass. Since the cost of transporting payload is proportional to its mass, ESM is used in Advanced Life Support (ALS) studies as a cost of transportation and as a way to compare different systems (Levri et al., 2003). To help with ESM analysis, Matt Bamsey suggested we also read the Life Support Baseline Values and Assumptions Document, which was created by NASA and provides common assumptions that can be made when developing life support systems.
We read NASA’s document with Equivalent System Mass Guidelines to familiarize ourselves with ESM analysis and factors we need to consider. We also read the Baseline Values and Assumptions Document to understanding what resources would be available on Mars. Among other useful assumptions, we learned about the power sources such as solar and nuclear power that would be available on Mars and how much power each source could provide.
This week, we also run the next set of HPLC samples to quantify VFA. Firstly, we made changes to synthetic poop recipe: live yeast was replaced with yeast extract and peanut oil was removed from the recipe. Secondly, we added a mixture of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid to synthetic feces supernatant to the final concentrations that were within the HPLC working range: 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, and 0.75 mM assuming the initial sample had no VFA. We also run an undiluted sample of synthetic feces supernatant without additional VFA added. All samples were run in triplicates, as before.
Week 11: July 10-14
Although the second HPLC run still had background noise, we were able to manually integrate the peaks for acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid.
Results from the second run of our VFA quantification experiments showed that there were approximately 109 mmol/L acetic acid, 197.51 mmol/L propionic acid, 12.65 mmol/L butyric acid in our supern"
UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#17 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," Annealing: Optimal annealing temperatures for Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase tend to be higher than for other PCR polymerases. The NEB Tm Calculator should be used to determine the annealing temperature when using this enzyme. Typically, use a 10–30 second annealing step at 3°C above the Tm of the lower Tm primer. A temperature gradient can also be used to optimize the annealing temperature for each primer pair.
For high Tm primer pairs, two-step cycling without a separate annealing step can be used (see note 12).  12. Extension: The recommended extension temperature is 72°C. Extension times are generally 20–30 seconds per kb for complex, genomic samples, but can be reduced to 10 seconds per kb for simple templates (plasmid,E. coli, etc.) or complex templates < 1 kb. Extension time can be increased to 40 seconds per kb for cDNA or long, complex templates, if necessary.
A final extension of 2 minutes at 72°C is recommended.
13. Cycle number: Generally, 25–35 cycles yield sufficient product.  For genomic amplicons, 30-35 cycles are recommended.
14. 2-step PCR: When primers with annealing temperatures ≥ 72°C are used, a 2-step thermocycling protocol (combining annealing and extension into one step) is possible.
15. Amplification of long products: When amplifying products > 6 kb, it is often helpful to increase the extension time to 40–50 seconds/kb.
16. PCR product: The PCR products generated using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase have blunt ends. If cloning is the next step, then blunt-end cloning is recommended. If T/A-cloning is preferred, the DNA should be purified prior to A-addition, as Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase will degrade any overhangs generated.
Results:
Media:2015-07-17 PCR PCquad amplification 62C, 66C, 70C .JPG
Lanes 1, 2, and 3 are our construct + primers at 62C, 66C, and 70C, respectively.
It appears as though the desired band at ~1.4kb is still rather weak.
Conclusions:  Further attempts at optimizing the desired band should be done before moving on from this step.  On monday, if reagents come in, protein expression will be continued, so Tyler and Nithin will take over the cloning."

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Overview of vaccine design
Genetic Incorporation of Neoantigen
A major requirement of a neoantigen vaccine is allowing for the facile and secure introduction of neoantigen libraries onto the scaffold/carrier. Using Encapsulin, one accessible method for such a conjugation would be the genetic ligation of the neoantigen oligonucleotide sequence to the C-terminus of Encapsulin, as depicted in Figure 4.
After acquiring the raw Encapsulin sequence from the LBNC lab at EPFL ( Cassidy-Amstutz et al., 2016 ; Addgene Catalogue # 86405), we genetically introduced a HexaHistidine linker between Amino Acids 43 & 44 to create HexaHistidine Encapsulin, which was reported to have higher heat resistance and better hydrodynamic properties ( Moon et al., 2014 ). This modification was done using a Golden Gate assembly with BsaI as a type IIS restriction enzyme. The insert was assembled from two synthesized oligos (60 bp each which partially anneal) with BsaI cut sites. The insert was converted to dsDNA using PCR. The Original Encapsulin plasmid was amplified using primers incorporating BsaI cut sites and the insert was incorporated using Golden Gate.
To obtain a rapid, efficient, and reliable incorporation of neoantigens onto the HexaHistidine Encapsulin platform, we designed the plasmid HexaHistidine Encapsulin-CBsaI (Figure 5) ( Registry Part BBa_K2686005 ). Starting from the HexaHistidine Encapsulin plasmid, we introduce at the C-terminus an sfGFP CDS under its native promoter flanked by two BsaI cut sites.
The BsaI cut sites would allow for the rapid, scarless introduction of oligonucleotides encoding for the neoantigens using Golden Gate Assembly (Figures 5 & 6). These neoantigens would be fused to the C-terminus of Encapsulin, and displayed on its outer surface. Such a system allows for a reliable, but fast expression of libraries of encapsulin-neoantigens.
The insert in between the two BsaI cut sites, consisting of sfGFP with a native promoter and terminator, allows for checking the success of the insertion of the neoantigen after transformation of cells with the Golden Gate product (green colonies do not contain the desired peptide insert, but the original plasmid instead). This cloning strategy was useful in the initial characterization of the system and production"

Realization of Membrane Magic
We expanded the definition of scaffold and developed two universal devices called Membrane Accelerator and Membrane Rudder respectively.
Both of the two devices worked as expected. We improved Fatty Acid synthesis efficiency by 24 fold and stringently switched the direction of Violacein synthetic pathway through blue light signal.
Improvement of Previous Part
We improved previous team's part BBa_I714891 by spliting EGFP into two halves. Split EGFP device could function as a reporter for protein interaction.
Inter-team Help
We helped Team SUSTC-Shenzhen-A characterize their App and gave user feedback.  Moreover, we tested the website of Team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B .
Parts Submission
We have submitted 42 well characterized parts which could either be used directly or serve as a universal tool readily for others' use.
Human Practice
We created an association, called Biocraft in SJTU, spreading synthetic biology in high school and college. To raise more awareness of synthetic biology in society, we interviewed and tried to build collaboration relationship with the founder of Huaqiao Foundation, a non-profit foundation which helped the poor who are suffering.

Cork_Ireland,2015,Team:Cork Ireland#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," our lab at UCC. See figures 1 and 2 for results reported by TCD.
Also, to assist TCD, we researched into the possibility of constructing a detector to detect artemisinin resistance in species of plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. TCD informed us that this is a significant problem in areas where malaria is endemic, as usually the most widely used treatment for malaria is artemisinin. Between the two teams, we found that the most common mutations that confer resistance are SNP’s on the Kelch 13 propellor (Haldar et al., 2015) . The mutations are point mutations, single base changes. Our detector was not sensitive or specific enough to pick up these small changes.

Meetups
In July Cork iGEM, along with Trinity College Dublin (TCD) iGEM, organised a meetup that was posted on iGEM.org. Cork iGEM travelled to Dublin where we met up with TCD for the first time. TCD met us at the front gate with a very welcoming sign and brought us to a hang out space called the Global Room.
We provided feedback on their project work and told them what to expect at the Jamboree. We were in contact with the team during its early days before the team members were selected and stressed the need for a diverse team from many backgrounds. This was something we learned at iGEM in our previous year and knew it was important to relay this advice. We also suggested the team not focus entirely on lab work and engage with the community throughout their project.
Over the course of working on the projects, we kept in contact with the team and aided them in their efforts to create a Youtube Channel “iGEM Academy” with videos of common lab protocols by providing a video tutorial of our “Detector Reaction” for use with our BaseHunter parts.
We gave a presentation of our project and our results up to the beginning of July.
TCD brought us to their lab and talked us through their plans for the project over the summer months. They then kindly gave us a campus tour and brought us to see the beautiful Book of Kells and the Long Room. We had a social that evening!

Plan for Growing Up a New Liter of Tamura
Evaluation of What We've Done So Far
The results of the BCA assay and SDS PAGE indicate that while the extracted Tamura proteins are pure, the yields are quite low. When fractions 3-5 from the previous IMAC batch purification procedure were pooled together and the contents run through a Pierce concentrator, only a little remained in the filter, showing that the protein was suspended in a high volume of buffers and solvents, rendering it very dilute. The concentrated fraction had a surprisingly low weight per volume ratio, estimated to be 0.12 w/v %. Therefore, to obtain greater quantities of concentrated protein of interest, and to better assist the members on the Materials Processing Team with their co-spinning objectives, we will grow up a new liter of Tamura. This time, the correct amount of Lysis Buffer will be added to re-suspend the cell pellets. This will make a significant difference in preventing our Tamura proteins from becoming solvated and diluted in excess solutions. We will also save reagents as quantities of lysozyme, deoxycholic acid, and DNAse required will all be reduced.
Also, when using the Histidine beads last time, there was concern that not enough Tamura protein was adhering to the beads due to an overwhelming presence of excess contaminant proteins binding to the beads instead. When purifying the Tamura proteins this time, the proteins will be suspended in a lot less lysis buffer, resulting in a concentrated solution of Tamura even before using a Pierce concentrator. The increased concentration of Tamura in the volume of solvent will increase the chances of Tamura binding to the beads, limited only by the binding capacity of the beads themselves. This will increase the effectiveness of our purification protocol."

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Notebook#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"onucleases. Buffers and DNA concentrations were used according to the manufacturer's suggestions.
Ligation / Cycled Ligation
After digestion with an restriction enzyme, plasmid fragments were inserted into vectors (which were cut with matching restriction enzymes) by ligation. The enzyme T4 ligase connected complementary overhangs of fragments by catalyzing the formation of the bond between the 5'phosphoryl group and the 3' hydroxyl group.
Oligohybridization of Single-Stranded DNA
Oligohybridization of oligo-nucleotides was used to create a mini MCS for cloning RFC10 compatible parts between promoter and terminator. This was achieved by using complementary oligo-nucleotides that contained the desired sequence with specific overhangs for cloning. For oligohybridization, 25 ml of 100 mM of forward and reverse oligos were put together in one tube and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. The samples were slowly cooled to room temperature in a styrofoam box overnight.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Site-Directed Mutagenesis was used to mutate specific bases of DNA sequences. Therefore, specific primers, which bind at the same site and contain a mismatch at the specific base, were required. The original base pair that had to be replaced was replaced by the mismatch. The method works just as PCR by amplifying the desired product that contains the mismatch. Afterwards, the product was digested with the restriction enzyme DpnI to destroy the plasmids strands which do not contain the desired base pair exchange. The QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit by Agilent Technologies was used.
Sequencing of Plasmid DNA
DNA constructs were sequenced by Eurofins mwg operon using our own sequencing primers.
Protein Biochemical Methods
Protein production in E. coli
In order to produce our desired proteins we used the E.coli strain BL21 and the expression system pBAD. Transformed cells were put in a 4 ml culture tube with LB and 1:500 kanamycin to create a homogenous monoclonal bacteria solution. After a few hours 50 ml flasks were inoculated as a preparatory culture and incubated at 30°C overnight. Each 50 ml flask was then transferred in a 2l flask with LB and 1:500 kanamycin and incubated at 25°C till an OD of 0.8 is reached. Subsequently a concentration of 5mM arabinose was used to induce the production"

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 4_-_-_TEXT.html," been too little time to accurately determine if the transformation worked, as we now have lots of e.coli colonies on the plates. The bacillus plates have not been so successful, but the plasmid was not optimized to bacillus, potentially explaining their failure. We will need to make sure that we include more controls in future to work out where our experiments fail, if they should fail.
In any case, we were able to induce the pBAD promoter with arabinose in the e.coli cells. Results can be seen in the lab book page. We also streaked some further plates to grow up some more transformed e.coli, and inoculated some cells in liquid medium which will hopefully be ready to be tested tomorrow.
The construct we are hoping to submit to DNA 2.0 has also been partially designed. The fusion of the lux α subunit and the mOrange protein has been completed, as described in the project page . The v.haveyi operon that we are hoping to have codon optimized has also been tided up, with more appropriate spacings between the genes.
Additionally, Andreas managed to finish his Arduino device. It now gives a response that is proportional to the ratio of the light intensities on the two light dependent resistors. By using a couple of coloured filters over the top of these resistors, we can measure the necessary spectral properties of our engineered luciferases. All the engineers need to do now is come up with a user interface.

Apologies from the editing parties at Caltech, apparently the remaining changes were not meant to be there. Unfortunately they also edited Brown's wiki. A storm may be brewing, depending how seriously they take the changes...
Anyway, apart from that little drama, lots happened in the lab today. Jolyon recieved his magnesium ion riboswitch primers - see what we did with them in the lab book.
Tom worked on making the construct we need to get ordered from DNA 2.0 using their program Gene Designer. He ran into a few issues, but Jim A. was able to give a few hints, and put him into contact with some friendly people in Newcastle who specialize in working with bacillus. If they don't know the answers, no one will.
Paul and Emmy are running into slight trouble with getting the right arabinose concentration for induction of luciferase production for the E. coli. It seems that with the optimum concentration suggested by previous years' teams there was very little light- so we added more arabinose.

Pro. zhu has been instructing igem teams for over 5 years and he provided extremely helpful advice not only on how to build up a wonderful igem team, but also on how to design                     a feasible experiment plan and how to carry it on safely. Moreover, he introduced us to several scientific authorities.
Pro. Zhu made us fully conscious of the oncoming challenges in igem competition, for example, he emphasized the importance of maintaining a harmony relationship between teammates, which could directly decide the final results to some degree.                     As a result, we made great efforts to assure everyone at the proper position, which finally helped us to accomplish our project in turn.
Prof. Ye Huan
Chief physician, department of infectious diseases, Fuxing Hospital
At the beginning, we focused on no-antibiotic screening in recombinant strains. To figure out the current use of antibiotics in medical and laboratory research, we talked to Dr. Ye from Capital Medical University. He indicated that the                     ability of screening specific strains without antibiotics would undoubtedly be a great breakthrough in fundamental research. However, he also pointed out that the use of antibiotics is irreplaceable in medical healing but dosage and                     extensive application are strictly stated in our law. Dr. Ye made us aware of the fact that the abuse of antibiotics is in fact a very severe problem afflicting modern society.In parts, this problem is, as Dr. Ye says, the strict controls                     of top laboratories making the leakage of superbugs hardly possible. Dr. Ye thus recommended a close collaboration with industrial companies for the law forbids the use of antibiotics in mass-producing fermentation. After the discussion,                     we continually focused on overuse of antibiotics and drafted a manifesto calling for the legislation of biosafty with the help of ZJUT.
When it comes to industrial biology, we came up with the idea of providing growth advantage, leading to the final selectivity of recombinant strains and useful mutants. Dr. Ye was fascinated by our ideas and claimed that applications of                     self-screening system will have a high demand for usage in the industrial business.

We contacted the NRP-UEA team to let them know the requested samples were on their way, and see if there was anything else that we could assist them with. Unfortunately, they had run into some issues with the licensing for importing soil samples into the United Kingdom and their project was stalled.
University of Texas at Austin iGEM Team
We participated with the Greensboro/UT-Austin iGEM team in their Open Sequence Initiative petition to update the assembly and submission standards required for the submission of BioBricks to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts which require the removal of non-approved restriction enzyme sites that are used as the suffix and prefix of parts when assembled using the recommended methods, such as 3A assembly. We participated in a collaborative discussion with them and other teams where input was gathered on our current preparation, assembly, and submission processes to submit parts to the iGEM registry and a petition was proposed to update these submission requirements.
Purdue iGEM Team
We worked with the Purdue iGEM team in their aim to create a standardized protocol for the characterization of parts submitted to the iGEM parts registry, including a list of protocols and assays that need to be performed on each part. We hope to both standardize and improve the information available for parts in the iGEM database. As a team, we participated in a series of collaborative discussions with teams from around the world on what we found to be the most important information for parts in the registry, problems or issues with the current characterization processes, and specific ideas of improvement for the characterization and documentation for biobrick parts. We also volunteered to help review and give feedback of the protocols developed by the Purdue iGEM team, and to use the new protocols in the characterization of our parts.

The protocol for the activity, as well as the PowerPoint presentation and script associated with it, are available here.
The second activity, which involved children 12 to 14 years of age was named “Do We Really Need to Wash Our Hands.” In this activity, the children were asked to swab their own hands (using a sterilized cotton swab) and plate the resulting swab on solid media. They would then wash their hands/use hand sanitizer and swab and plate again. The plates would be left to incubate at 37°C overnight, and the next day, the resulting growth would be presented to the children. As well, they were allowed to swab two other area of their choice, as to see how “dirty” these are. Most chose their own hair, backpack or shoe.
Prior to each activity, a PowerPoint presentation discussion bacteria, pathogenicity, hand-washing, DNA and synthetic biology was given to the students. As well, they were provided with a hand-out to aid them in their understanding of the activity. The handout contained step-by-step activity protocol, as well as spaces for hypothesizing and discussion. The PowerPoint presentation, protocol, script, and handout are available here.
We hope that these initiatives will help engage students outside of the classroom and get them excited about science.
iGEM Ontario (OGEM) Meeting, June 15 2010 at McMaster University
The second annual OGEM Meeting was held at McMaster University in Hamilton on June 15th, 2010. Members of iGEM teams from University of Waterloo, University of Western Ontario and University of Toronto gathered to discuss the future of a regional synthetic biology community, as well as a regional conference. The day turned over to discussions which centered around creating more communication and support between teams. In addition, the gathering was also an opportunity for teams to get to know one another before heading down to MIT. The meeting was a great success and the second of more regional gatherings to come.
As the meeting was held during the annual CSM (Canadian Society for Microbiologists) conference, members were able to attend a series of lectures given by valuable members of the field. As well, iGEM Ontario members were given the opportunity to speak about their projects and promote the idea of iGEM during a poster presentation held along with researchers in the field of microbiology.
In the future we hope to see this organization (independent of an individual iGEM team) become an important resource to Ontario iGEM teams and for educating the general public about synthetic biology. We are currently"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". I plan to work mostly on part/device creation, especially on part characterization and data entry for the BU Registry. Professor Densmore also mentioned that we should write basic laboratory protocols as future references for new people, verification method to determine if things are working, and troubleshooting method in case the experiment yields unusual result.
But the most important thing that came from the meeting was the new objective: creating 4 biological devices for each fluorescent protein. In order to achieve that, we would like to utilize 2 different approaches. The first one is a 'Bottom Up Approach' where we will continue attaching fluorescent protein gene to terminator, then putting them together with RBS before finally combining the resulting composite part with a promoter. While this method is going to take longer time and require more effort, it will allow us more opportunity in creating a fully customizable plasmid. The second one is a 'Composite Approach' where we will obtain premade composite parts from the IGEM plate and combine them with other part to save time. The advantage from this method is the ability to create a working biological circuit in a shorter steps and reduce any possible chance of error. I plan to work mostly on the second approach, so I will try to combine several types of promoter with composite GFP gene that already has a RBS and a Terminator.
On the day before the meeting, I was actually working on trying to combine a cut RBS with a composite GFP+Terminator part. Using the previously prepared GFP (BBa_J52028) + Terminator (BBa_B0015) composite part, I did restriction digest on them using the enzyme X and P. I predicted that the GFP+Terminator will be cut away from the rest of the backbone so that the gel electrophoresis will produce a ~700 bp fragment (GFP+Terminator) and a ~3000 bp fragment (the backbone). However, the gel did not produce the expected result: while a faint second band was indeed visible, it was too close to the first one, meaning that this band was too big to be a GFP+Terminator fragment. I decided to carry on this work along with the new 'Composite Approach'. I did restriction digest on YFP composite (Bba_E0430), GFP composite (Bba_E0240), promoter (Bba_R2000), terminator (Bba_B0015), and the previously prepared GFP (Bba_J52028) + Terminator (Bba_B0015) part. For some yet to be determined causes, the YFP and GFP composite were not digested properly as no second band"

Synthetic Biology Seminar at ITB Central Library
The human practice team of ITB_Indonesia held a seminar with the topic about Synthetic Biology at the library of Institut Teknologi Bandung at May, 2nd 2015. The seminar was attended by many students within the ITB enthusiastically. At this seminar, we provided general knowledge regarding synthetic biology and presented the project of iGEM ITB 2015 this year about Rhamcolipid.After participating in the seminar, the audiences gained insights about synthetic biology and iGEM.
Seminar and Workshop at Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung
Once again, on June, 16th, we had the chance to promote synthetic biology and iGEM competition to the students at UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung. ITB_Indonesia public relation had contacted the university since 2 months ago. We were very excited, finally, we were able to conduct this event after so much preparation. The seminar was entitled, “Biodiversity as Basic Knowledge for Synthetic Biology”. This time, we did not only hold an usual seminar where the speakers shared about synthetic biology and iGEM, but also we had a bioinformatic workshop as an innovative human practice activity. As we had investigated before, most of the students or respondents whom participated in our survey/questionnaires were interested in synthetic biology. So, we realized and though of a way to help the students to gain more insights about synthetic biology. There was a saying, “Practice makes perfect!”. Therefore, we designed this workshop in order to help the students understand about primer design, allignment, and how to create a phylogenetic tree. The students from the campus learnt from us enthusiastically since this was the first time for them to learn more about synthetic biology and bioinformatic"

March for Science
22 April 2017
SCIENCE, NOT SILENCE
Figure 1: Our Team at the March for Science
Science influences very different aspects of our daily life. It is critical to health, economics, food security, and safety. Being part of an iGEM team brings us even closer in touch with what it means to be a scientist and how important the acknowledgement from public policy and society is for our work.
To celebrate and strengthen the role of science in policy making, our iGEM team joined the March for Science in Dresden on April 22, 2017. The initial “Scientists March on Washington” was supported by a series of marches in more than 600 other cities all around the globe. The main goals of the march were to support evidence-based policy making, government funded research and transparency in science.
As young scientists, we walked through the baroque city center of Dresden to demonstrate what value scientific research has for our community and that scientifically proven facts should be taken more seriously in political decisions. The acceptance of the consensus on climate change and evolution has also been one of our major concerns which is why we put a lot of effort into our iGEM goes green initiative. Taken together it has been a remarkable experience to show solidarity with the world wide scientific community and to stand up for our values and interests - We marched forward with Science.

Green Expertise
iGEM goes green
While planning our iGEM project, we thought that only considering environmental implications of our project was not enough. We decided that we want to take responsibility for the environmental impact of our whole project from our lab work to our flights to Boston. Therefore, we started the “iGEM goes green” initiative aiming for a more sustainable iGEM competition and research in general. With iGEM goes green we want to share the ecological"

iGEM 2014 had their first meeting with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard. Ashlee, Emily, Clay, and Sam met each other. Emily will help Ashlee continue work on her Honors Thesis with the project ""Engineering a Biodetoxification Pathway for Lignocellulosic Feedstock"" . Ashlee began to show Emily around the lab and instruct her during her first cloning experiences while they continued Ashlee's semester research trying to add a terminator upstream of the HMF pathway where dCas9 would be inserted. The dCas9 system has a transacting RNA sequence which could disrupt upstream genes if it was not turned off correctly.
Clay and Sam began work for Clay's Honors Thesis in Biological Engineering on the ""Codon Optimization"" project. Clay and Sam began preliminary research and worked on constructing a program to optimize GFPs.
Week 2
Monday, May 26 - Sunday, June 1
- Notebook Entries
Ashlee and Emily saw no success with adding the terminator and must move on to a new approach. With the advice of Dr. Salis and graduate student Iman Farasat, they decided to insert the HMF pathway and the dCas9 system into the genome using homologous recombination and the Lambda Red Recombinase system.
Clay and Sam successfully design a program in Excel to optimize genes, continue working on one to be used in MATLAB. Work begins on designing a plan for obtaining useful data to show efficacy of codon optimization, as well as a plan for this cloning in more specific terms.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html,"
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

This would remove the focus from the decreasing values, and instead place emphasis on the difference between individual arabinose concentrations.  What we find is a much more interesting graph:
Figure 2 - This graph shows the fluorescence readings at 600 nm (485 exciting) of K628006-transformed E. coli in solutions of various arabinose concentrations.  The value of the 0 uM control has been subtracted from the fluorescence values of each other arabinose concentration at every 5 minute reading, in order to show the scale of difference between each reading.
This graph makes the relationship between arabinose and K628006 much more clear. As we can see from the graph, lower concentrations of arabinose cause less cell death than higher ones.  The presence of arabinose within the same solution as our transformed E. coli triggered the pBAD strong promoter to induce transcription of the protegrin-1 coding region.  As the concentration of protegrin-1 protein rose within the cells, these antimicrobial peptides integrated into the phospholipid bilayer, eventually causing membrane destabilization and pore formation.  This allowed the propodium iodine dye to enter the cells, fluorescing near the 630 nm wavelength (we were forced to measure at 600 nm due to the constraints of our microplate reader).  As we can see from the graph, higher levels of arabinose induced more protegrin-1 production, resulting in higher fluorescence values.
Alongside this process, arabinose would also be broken down into ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase by the 'ara operon', naturally present within the DNA of the E. coli and the original site of the pBAD promoter.  This would cause the concentration of arabinose in each well to decrease slowly over time, the rate of which may differ between various strains of E. coli.  Other groups looking to repeat this experiment would need to keep this fact in mind.  Additional information on this process can be found on our Modelling page .
The aim of a ""characterization experiment"" is to gather more data about the biobrick in question.  Submitting a biobrick that has only been tested under a single condition does not reveal the full range of potential uses for that part.  Not only that, but it forces other groups who wish to use that biobrick to waste valuable time further exploring a part that should have been characterized in the first place.  With the number of parts"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," of E. coli Top10 with the construct sfGFP(Sp) in    pSB1C3 were used to obtain ( glycerol stocks ) and plasmid    isolation was performed with QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit . Some of the overnight   cultures seemed to already express the sfGFP (see Figure 5). Firstly,    concentration of the plasmids obtained was measured on Nanodrop.    Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and then stored at    -20°C.
Figure 5. Pellet of the overnight cultures from sample     2 and 5. Looks like the sfGFP(Sp) is also expressed in E. coli Top10.
Sequencing:
Sequencing results showed that sfGFP(Sp) gene is present (see Figure 6). However something happened with the prefix and the suffix most probably during cloning steps. It looks that prefix and also suffix was disrupted by insertion of few base pairs. We cannot really explain what happened and due to time limitation we could not fix this problem. However sfGFP(Sp) is clearly expressed in E. coli (see Figure 5).
Figure 6. Sequencing result of sfGFP(Sp) in pSB1C3. GFP gene itself is underlined by red line.
Conclusion:
The sfGFP(Sp) was cloned to the backbone pSB1C3. However from the sequencing results we could see that this part contains bad prefix and suffix (see Figure 6). GFP gene is underlined by red line on Figure 6, however you could also see the bad prefix and suffix.
Experiments
See decoy experiments with sfGFP(Sp) in B. subtilis.
sfGFP(Sp) in pDR111 and in pDR111+message plasmid
sfGFP(Sp) is a reporter gene originally optimized for Streptococcus pneumoniae. It has been shown when expressed in B. subtilis that the signal is even brighter than the one from sfGFP(Bs) (Overkamp et al. 2013) . sfGFP(Sp) was cloned either only to pDR111 integration plasmid or to   pDR111+message plasmid. These plasmids were constructed with an interest to   have easier screening when integrated into the B. subtilis genome. pDR111 is an integration plasmid which can be integrated into the B.   subtilis genome. By double cross-over it replaces amyE gene, which is   necessary"

A week ago, we divided the students of Wet lab into four groups, each group studied in different directions and everyone read an article which is different from others. The four directions including fusion protein, plastic degradation with hydrophobin, protein sensing chip, vegetable and fruit preservation with hydrophobin. Today, according to the papers we had seen, everyone shared the knowledge we had harvested with others. Then, the human-practice group showed us the arrangements of the fourth Crabapple Season, which is the biggest popularization of science in our school. The modelling group also showed us the knowledge they have learned. Finally, the wiki&design group showed us the original design of our team logo and ask us for some advice.

Make Pasr connect with GlsA. Asr promoter，Pasr， belongs to asr gene encoding acid-shock RNA. It is a pH-responsive promoter native to E.coli which induces transcription in acidic environment from pH 4.0 ~ 5.0 , and shows low activity at a neutral pH. We chose asr promoter as the base of pH regulation system.
After the connection of Pasr and GlsA, it was introduced into Escherichia coli to stabilize it at about pH = 6, and co-cultured with Acetobacter xylophilus at the optimum pH to produce high-yield bacterial cellulose.
The mutation parts
Overview :
In the world of synthesis biology,the prompters’ sensitivity always determine the rate of parts or systems reactions and mutation is a kind of the usual method to improve parts. So we designed 13 groups of point mutations around the -10 areas to improve the sensibility of the promoter. And then, we used the GFP protein to instead of our functional genes when we tested the mutation results.
Key Achievements:
We have already designed 13 groups of the point mtation to improve the sensibility of the promoter and finished the most of mutation works.
Comparing with the target sequeces, the piont mutation sites are in line with our                                         expectations.
In summary, we have obtained 5 groups of the successful point muations which performance can improve a lot campared with the nature promoters.
Improvement :
Modified E.coli with plasmid BBa_K2267001 can stabilize the pH in the culture                                         media.
Via point mutation to plux, these promoters have higher efficiency than the original plux.

Hardware - Spectrophotometer
The creation of a pocket-sized spectrophotometer allows for more applications. A spectrophotometer is now available to more people in developing countries, due to its low cost, size, and convenient design. The spectrophotometer utilizes standard cuvettes and attaches to a smartphone’s flash and camera, making it more accessible.
Our 3D printed spectrophotometer can be attached to the camera and flash of a Sony M4A phone. The spectrophotometer is created with a cuvette holder and a bandpass filter (region: 335-610 nm). This allows only blue light to be sent through the sample that consists of blood plasma.
The spectrophotometer works by utilizing the flash on the phone as a lightsource. Silver surfaces are used to reflect the light back in the direction of the camera lens, where the light passes through a filter that removes all but the blue colour of the spectra. The remaining light passes through the sample before reflecting back to  the camera lens where  a picture is taken. The picture is then analyzed by the SV Detector app on the phone (see more under software ).
The spectrophotometer’s 3D-model can be easily modified to fit most smartphones as well as any optical filter. The fact that it only needs the smartphone and does not rely on an arduino or other external devices, nor needs any external power source, means that it is very portable.
The three substrates that were used in the app should at least give a dilution of ~50% at 30 minutes (the time that the samples are supposed to be incubated for, see Incubation Chamber ), making the accuracy at 20% more than appropriate.
Mechanism of Action
Our proposed solution utilizes the Scavidin present in the composite parts by having a chamber (see Incubation Chamber ) with biotin beads that BioBricks BBa_k2355313 and BBa_k2355302 could bind to. After possible cleavage, the chromophore or enzyme would be released from the chamber and would be allowed to flow to a second chamber through a filtering system. The sample would then be removed from the second chamber and placed in a standard cuvette that is then placed in the spectrophotometer and analysed via the app.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," membrane of prokaryotic cells (Brogden, 2005). AMPs have been recombinantly expressed in a number of organisms, including E. coli (for a review, see Li, 2011) and B. Subtilis (Chen et al., 2009, Yu et al., 2013).
Our concept was to design a star peptide with antimicrobial peptide arms. Wiradharma et al. (2012) first showed that placing linear antimicrobial peptides in a star configuration could lead to enhanced antimicrobial activity and decreased hemolytic activity. Although it is unclear why this is the case, it may be due to the ability of neighbouring antimicrobial peptide arms to interact with each other to synergistically rupture the membrane.
While Wiradharma used a synthetic peptide sequence, we designed a peptide using the naturally occurring AMP, Magainin 1 (Zasloff, 1987). Magainin 1 peptides will be placed to the ends of each star arm.
Magainin 1 was chosen because the Magainins are one of the major classes of antimicrobial peptides, being well studied and characterised. In addition, we were concerned that tethering the antimicrobial peptide to the star peptide might interfere with its antimicrobial activity. Magainin 1, however, has previously been tethered to surfaces, where it has imparted the surfaces with microbicidal properties (Glinel et al., 2008; Humblot et al., 2009). We surmised that if Magainin 1 maintained its activity while anchored to surfaces, it may also maintain its activity while anchored to a star peptide.
The sequence for Magainin 1 is: GIGKFLHSAGKFGKAFVGEIMKS.
When attached to a star peptide it will have the following structure:
There are several design elements to note:
The antimicrobial peptide star will be expressed with a SUMO fusion protein. This is because without the fusion, it is likely that the peptide would be toxic to the host cell.
The peptide includes a Factor X cutting site between the two cysteines for eventual proteolytic cleavage and formation of the star peptide.
In addition to the star peptide Magainin 1, we synthesised a gene for a linear Magainin 1 peptide as well. This is identical to the construct above, except that there is only one Magainin 1 peptide attached to the SUMO fusion.
Unstructured Peptide (USP) Construct
In the second approach, we designed a peptide which can be"

 Part improvements
We improved the BioBricks BBa_K737005 and BBa_K737017 , deposited by team OUC-China in 2012, coding for the        GvpC protein. This protein is one of two proteins that compose protein gas vesicles, which were used in our project to enhance the sensitivity of mammalian        cells to mechanical stimuli. We improved the part by adding a FLAG tag, which allowed us to analyze the expression of the part form the cells via western blot and       to observe the subcellular localization of the protein by confocal microscopy. We further characterized the part by expressing it in mammalian cells together with        GvpA, showing that these proteins substantially increase the cell sensitivity to ultrasound. This part also plays a central role in our Mechanosensing collection.
We also improved BBa_K157010 , a transmembrane domain used by 2008 iGEM Freiburg team. We used this domain as        an anchor to which we attached the TagRFP protein on the N-terminal side and the ER retention signal on the C-terminal side. By western blots and confocal fluorescent       microcopy we were able to show that this part can not only be used for plasma membrane localization but can also be retained in the ER with the simple addition of a       4-amino-acid retention signal KKMP. Upon induced proteolytic cleavage of the retention signal by inducible split protease, the protein was translocated to the trans        GA and the plasma membrane, where TagRFP was cleaved by furin and secreted into the medium."

Kent,2016,Team:Kent#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"165.8 nm as measured from the micrographs using image analysis software ImageJ.
Results show that cells have successfully taken up Iron in the form of ferric citrate which was present in the inducing growth medium; staining was not carried out during sample preparation on EM grids . A and B electron dense spherical shapes have diameters which lay within the expected range of magnetosome magnetite nanoparticles. However, the diameter of C is considerably larger.
Biogenesis of magnetosome compartments in native magnetotactic bacteria involves the invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane [2]. The BioBrick device contains wild type versions of the Mam genes, therefore it was hypothesized that successfully expressed proteins would be targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. The presence of said electron dense spherical regions somewhat supports this notion as they are in close proximity to the cytoplasmic membrane; It could be proposed that if magnetite biomineralization has occurred within E. coli, the nanoparticles would be situated close to the site where Mam proteins are present: the cytoplasmic membrane.
It is worth highlighting that in Figure 17, it can be observed that only single electron dense spherical shapes are found close to the membranes in the cells that do contain them. Hypothetical reasoning would postulate that upon successful expression of MamO/P/X/T proteins and their correct targeting to the cytoplasmic membrane, multiple sites on the cytoplasmic membrane would be present and available for biomineralization. Thus it was expected that multiple sites would yield multiple electron dense sites like A,B,C. As such the reasoning for single sites observed in our data is unclear.
Control samples which were grown in non-inducing liquid and in the absence of ferric citrate did not appear when imaged with TEM, this could be attributed to the lack of staining upon sample preparation. Thus due to the lack of iron, there was insufficient electron dense matter to render the control cells visible.
The findings from our in vivo study suggests a potential leap forward with regards to the biomineralization of magnetite in a foreign organism. The observations presented are however not fully conclusive, thus further characterisation of the electron dense matter is indeed required for a clearer insight. The investigations carried out studied the effect of only four Mam genes originating from magnetotactic bacterium and their behaviour in E. coli; future endeavours could build on these findings by adding further Mam genes to the BioBrick device.

RESULTS
Introduction
These are our list of results that we have successfully acquired through our two-year run developing this project. Special thanks to Lisa Oberding for helping with our Gene Design, Gene Synthesis, and Transformation.
Gene Design
The 4 constructs that we have designed, with the help of our mentor Lisa Oberding and previous iGem teams (especially Tianjin 2016), include:
a polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase (PET-ase) fused to a red fluorescent protein, (or RFP) called mCherry, which gives the protein its colour aspect,
a hydrophobin called BslA fused to mCherry,
a PET-ase without the RFP, and
a BslA without RFP.
Snapshot of our constructs
Special care was taken to ensure the sequences did not include any extra restriction enzyme sites and to design the coding regions to be expressed successfully in BOTH E. coli and B. subtilis cells.  See our parts pages for further details regarding these parts.
Gene Synthesis
The gene constructs we have created with the help of Lisa were synthesized by Bio Basic and shipped to us for transformation. The plasmids were ordered both in the standard pSB1C3 backbone, as well as a second “shuttle” backbone we hope to use in the future for testing on Bacillus specifically.
Transformations
Our lab tried repeatedly to transform our cells.  We had success with E. coli but were unable to transform Bacillus subtilis on our own.  Thank you to Amino Labs who hosted us over the summer for a second (though unsuccessful) round of attempts at Bacillus transformation.  Thankfully our mentor, Lisa Oberding from Fredsense Technologies, was able to help us successfully transform both E.coli and B.subtilis cells with each of our four constructs.
These pictures are our constructs in E.coli DH5alpha. The ones on the left are imaged under regular light and the picture on the right is under UV light. The coding system Lisa used for the test is:

As most synthetic biologists and iGEM teams work with Escherichia Coli, the use of other model systems can cause confusion. We hope to ease the legibility of our project descriptions by creating eukaryopedia, an overview about transcription factors and cell lines we used in our studies, as well as general molecular biology issues that affect our work. We hope it can help you find guidance in the jungle that mammalian molecular biology is at the moment.

The CLS iGEM team started this year on an uphill struggle. To enter a competition of this magnitude is an impressive feat for any high school, let alone one that is entering for the first time and with minimal help from any Universities. We were told countless times to wait till we go to University to enter, or to spend this year raising funds and to enter next year. However, thanks to the generosity of the School and in particularly to Sarah Fletcher the Head, we raised enough money to enter 4 boys and the PI to Jamboree although every boy has done enough to merit a place. We have completed the vast majority of our lab work without any outside help, and we are thankful to Imperial for lending a helping hand when, and only when, required. We are in the unusual position of being in a boys only team, simply because CLS is a Boy’s School. However the fact that our team is comprised from only one school, unlike many of our competitors, has proved advantageous. We are able to meet up at incredibly short notice and we have gone through the inevitable ups and downs of microbiology as a coherent unit. The smaller number of people in the pool to choose from forced us to look beyond Biology as the primary skillset of useful Team members, and the resulting montage of skillsets in our team has allowed us to reach such heights.

Imperial have been extremely supportive of our project and helped us several times when we encountered difficulties due to the limited equipment available to us.
We needed to check our cloning strategies, both when making the new parts for the registry and when thinking about introducing them into a dual-host vector. We checked our thought processes with them at various stages and learned some neat tricks (like using PCR clean up kits for something other than PCR reactions!)

The end
Doesn't rubber come from trees?
Let your eyes (and mouse) wander to these trees to discover our idea on how to help the environment and change the future of rubber-production. Take a look at our short project description below.
The growing demand for natural rubber causes deforestation of the rainforest or occupation of arable lands, all due to the founding of new plantations. If producing rubber by bacteria succeeds, production of natural rubber will not be limited to the regions where the rubber tree can grow but can be done even in barren lands.
Our project aims to make a common bacteria able to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions.  Natural rubber is composed of molecules, each consisting of the substance IPP linked together like a chain. The common bacteria that we use already possesses the ability to produce the IPP, but it lacks the enzyme to connect the IPP links together into a chain.  Through this project we introduce the enzyme that the rubber tree has for connecting the links, into the bacteria. Furthermore we manipulate the bacteria into producing more of the IPP links.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#2D Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html,". When the agar has cooled down, the chips are cut out of the mold and are ready to use. Storage of the readily usable sensor chips is possible for up to two days at 4°C when using LB medium or up to five days if TB medium is used. A detailed description of the sensor chip manufacturing can be found in our Protocols section.
Assay to detect P. aeruginosa using Cellock Holmes
This flow sheet shows the procedure to sample and detect P. aeruginosa: A sampling chip is briefly put onto the potentially contaminated surface, added onto one of our sensor chips and inserted into WatsOn.
Using Cellock Holmes, we developed a simple assay to detect P. aeruginosa. Initially, a so called sampling chip is placed on a solid surface that is potentially contaminated with the pathogen. Subsequently, the sampling chip is removed from the surface and put onto one of our sensor chips. Theorectically, the sensor chips could be directly used for sampling, however, this was avoided in our project to match biosafety regulations and to prevent the spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The two layered chip-stack is then put into a petri dish which is inserted into our measurement device WatsOn for evalutation.
Mode of action inside WatsOn
Chips are incubated at 37°C to stimulate cell growth and then illuminated with blue light to excite fluorescence. A picture is taken and analyzed for fluorescence signals using the software Measurarty.
Inside WatsOn, the chips are incubated at 37°C and the sampled populations of microorganisms attached on the sampling chip start to grow and multiply. During incubation the chips can be illuminated with blue light at any time, and a photo of the chips is taken. The software Measurarty then analyzes any fluorescent signal. P. aeruginosa secrets an increasing number of quorum sensing molecules that are recognized by Cellocks, thereby producing a fluorescence signal. For detection of P. aeruginosa, we focused on a quorum sensing molecule called N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (for short: 3-oxo-C12-HSL), which is involved in virulence regulation of P. aeruginosa (Jimenez, Koch, Thompson et al., 2012). The incorporation of the 3-oxo-C12-HSL detection system into the Cellocks is explained in detail in the REACh Construct section.

Design
NrtA protein sticks to the periplasmic membrane through a flexible linker to capture nitrite or nitrate in the periplasm.       Then delivery to the transmembrane complex that made by NrtB.       In our project, we try to transform NrtA gene from cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to E.coli, and then co-culture the engineered E.coli with microalgae.       Engineered E.coli will be capable of clutching nitrite or nitrate present in the environment.       They will not intake nitrate or nitrite since the accumulation may be lethal to E. coli But the amount of microalgae that contains nitrate and/or nitrite will decrease.       Therefore, the microalgae will undergo nitrogen starvation and produce oil more efficiently.
After building up the nitrogen starvation and extracting oil from microalgae, we need to kill the E.coli to prevent contamination.       So we planned to use endolysin and holin for cell lysis, which is similar to the mechanism used by team PeKing (2014 iGEM Beijing).       Holin can trigger the formation of holes on cell membrane.       When holin successfully forms holes on cell membrane, endolysin can pass through the membrane to decompose peptidoglycan.       Then, E.coli is lysed after the cell membrane and cell wall are destroyed.       To control the suicide timing, we designed an inducible promoter for holin, so that we can induce the suicide of the E.coli at the exact time we want.

Concentrations used in M9  liquid medium with E. coli BL21 DE3 gold:
Gentamicin 5 µg/ml and
Kanamycin 10 µg/ml
Testing Transformation Efficiency
To get a maximum of colonies with transformation of the mutant library, the following tranformation methods were tested:
A) co-transformation of both plasmids at the same time: reporter + tRNA/synthetase plasmid B) transformation of chemical competent cells (already hosting the reporter plasmid) with tRNA/synthetase plasmid Conclusion: To have both plasmids in one cell, the best solution is the transformation of the tRNA/synthetase plasmid as PCR product (deriving from mutagenesis PCR) in competent cells which already contain the reporter plasmid pRXG. Colonies appear smaller in comparison to E. coli BL21, because they have two additional plasmids resulting in metabolic burden and hence a lower growth rate. Compared to co-transformation, the number of cells is higher by a factor of 10.
Testing Various Cultivation Steps
As transformation on LB solid with subsequent picking in M9 liquid resulted in almost no growth, proper cell growth is achieved by the following method:
Pick into M9 liquid: Masterplate, growth: 2 days at 30°C, 900rpm,
Replicate into M9 liquid Screening plate, growth 2 days at 30°C, 900 rpm
For positive screening:
Induction with 100 µM IPTG
2mM DMNBS
For negative screening:
Induction with 100 µM IPTG
Cryo cultures are made from all intermediate steps.
Dissolving DMNB-serine (DMNBS)
DMNBS is soluble in 50% DMSO at basic pH. A stock of 50mM is prepared and used with a final concentration in M9 of 2 mM resulting in a pH value of 7.55.
Determining Growth with DMNBS
Cultivating E. coli BL21 DE3 gold containing two different plasmids shows lower growth rates when adding 100µM IPTG and 2mM DMNBS to M9 minimal medium, resulting in an overall growth time of 42-48h.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Nowadays, there are two major bottlenecks when talking about production of high quality graphene:
First, its mass production, since it is very difficult to produce large amounts of graphene with needed qualities for electrical sectors given that it must have a high conductivity and optical transparency.
Secondly, actual methods to synthesize graphene involve the usage of hazardous chemicals, like hydrazine, that generate toxic gases and waste.
To address these issues, it is imperative to develop a greener process with an eco-friendly approach, since the demand of this material will increase, and as such, its pollutants if the process is not modified.

Model 3. The gene expression model of AimR-AimP systems
Introduction:
This models, which can predict the gene expression of AimR-AimP systems, is practical for many research. In this model, the genetic circuit describes the biochemical reactions taking place inside the cell (Figure5). The intracellular model describes the fluctuations in concentrations of each substance by modelling each chemical reaction.

This QS system of AimR-AimP remains to be further studied for potential application. The QS response is quite tightly regulated as expression occurs only once the local bacterial density passes a fixed threshold value, similar unlike a switch. This system is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. In the sender system, aimP produces the peptide and the concentration of peptide changes along with time. While in the receiver system, the peptide binds with aimX which inhibites the target gene expression. The mechanism can briefly described in the following:
The AimR is a transcription factor, which has a helix-turn-helix domain to bind DNA and a TPR domain to bind the signal peptide. The AimP is the propeptide of the mature signal peptide, sequence of the mature signal peptide is SAIRGA. Binding of AimP to the AimR will disrupt the dimer forms of AimR. After that, the AimR can no longer bind to the promoter of AimX, a potential non coding RNA involved in the process of lysis-lysogeny. A superb characteristic of the Aim system is that the AimR only bind to
Modeling:
In this model, we want to quantify the gene expression of the complete AimR-AimP system including the sender and receiver. Let us now consider the complete AimR-AimP system as illustrated in the figure 5. For the rate equation involving [P], we need to add both contributions from the sender and receiver systems and"
