Workshops
W&M iGEM held workshops all over VA this summer!
We held a total of nine workshops about Synthetic Biology this summer, both in and out of our lab, all over the state of Virginia, for more than 150 students from Kindergarten to Pre-College, as well as adults.
1. Bruton High School Lab Visit, AP Biology Class: Emil Davis' AP Biology class from Bruton High School, a local public school, visited our lab during the first week of summer research when their school year was ending. We reviewed basic AP Biology concepts with them, showed them some protocols they had read about but never performed, such as gel electrophoresis, and taught them about lab safety.
2. King Solomon Christian Academy, June 26: We taught 1-3 graders at King Solomon Christian Academy's Summer Session program. They learned about codons and genes, modeled DNA structure, and predicted what traits an offspring of two individuals with specific alleles would have.
3. & 4. Learning Fun School, June 27, 1-3 grade and 4-6 grade w/ parent session We hosted two workshops at LFS. Each had an optional parent session during which we explained Synthetic Biology, iGEM, and our 2015 project. The students extracted DNA, learned about alleles and genes, interpreted codons, predicted offspring traits, visualized gel electrophoresis, and observed changes in protein structure after exposure to disturbances such as heat.
5. Saturday and Summer Enrichment Program Workshop, July 11, 4-6 grade: William and Mary's School of Education has a Center for Gifted Students program that runs events for students when they are not in school. We hosted 4-6 graders in our lab, where they got a firsthand look at our equipment and our project. They even got to see our confocal microscope in action!
6. & 7. Girl Scout Synthetic Biology Badge Workshop, July 18; brownies, juniors; cadettes & ambassadors; parents session This summer, we developed a Synthetic Biology Girl Scout Badge through the Girl Scouts of America Make Your Own badge program. We also hosted two workshops where girls could earn different levels of the badge, based on their age. They got"

Regulations of hokD toxin in E. coli hok/sok TA system
The hok/sok system of the E. coli plasmid R1 was originally discovered in a screen for a locus that mediates efficient plasmid stabilization by killing plasmid-free cells. Sok antitoxin RNA is encoded by plasmids, represses the synthesis of a small, hydrophobic protein (Hok) that kills the host cell by damaging the bacterial cell membrane.
These loci code for three small genes that in hok/sok have been denoted hok (host killing), sok (suppression of killing) and mok (modulation of killing).27 The hok gene encodes a highly toxic transmembrane protein of 52 amino acids that irreversibly damages the cell membrane, and is thus lethal to host cells.
The mok reading frame overlaps extensively with hok, and is required for expression and                                 regulation of hok translation. The sok gene specifies a small cis-acting antisense RNA                                 of 64 nucleotides that is complementary to the hok mRNA leader region. Sok RNA is quite                                 labile (half-life is about 30 sec), but is constitutively expressed from a relatively                                 strong promoter. In contrast, hok mRNA is very stable (half-life is about 20 min)34 and                                 is constitutively expressed from a relatively weak promoter. Genetic analyses showed                                 that Sok RNA inhibits translation of the mok reading frame and that translation of hok                                 is coupled to the translation of mok.31 Consequently, Sok RNA indirectly inhibits                                 translation of hok by preventing mok translation.35 Because Sok RNA is very unstable                                 and is quickly degraded when the R1 plasmid is lost from the cell, the more stable hok mRNA is translated and cells increase plasmid maintenance by killing plasmid-free cells. This plasmid stabilization system is as a result of a phenotype called post-segregational killing (PSK).
In terms of hok/sok gene family. The chromosome of E. coli K-12 contains six hok/sok homologous loci (A, B, C, D, E and X). The hokD gene, formerly known as relF, is encoded by the third gene of the rel"

Google Hang-Outs
We had google hang-outs with the Peshawar, UCL, and Lambert HS iGEM teams.  It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas and hear about the other teams’ experiences!
Meetups
The UCLA iGEM team invited us to a Southern California meet-up, where we got great feedback on our project and the wiki. We hosted a meet-up with the ULV-LC-CV iGEM Team at Alverno, where we had the opportunity to plan follow-up outreach plans for educating local schools about synthetic biology.
Future Plans
We plan to create a possible outreach system with the ULV/LC/CV as a way to get our school and other schools more involved in synthetic biology research. We plan on visiting other campuses in order to show them the extent of iGEM and demonstrate its significance in the world of research.
Social Media
We created a variety of social media accounts         ( Twitter YouTube Facebook and Instagram ) as a means to reach out to         other teams, and to keep interested people informed about our         progress.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Gan Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," try to improve and outperform each other with each round. Eventually, the Generator will reach a level of sophistication in which the generated images will not be distinguishable from real images anymore, which is the ultimate goal of GANs.
Mathematical Description
The generative adversarial networks can be described as a zero-sum game, where the objective function is represented as a minimax function.
Objective function
The Discriminator is trying to maximize the objective function, therefore a gradient ascent can be performed on the objective function.
Gradient Ascent
In contrast, the generator tries to minimize the objective function, therefore a gradient descent can be performed and by altering between gradient ascent and descent, GANs can be trained.
Gradient descent
Yet, it was observed that optimizing the Generator objection does not work well, because when the sample is generated that is likely to be classifeid as fake, the model tries to learn from the gradients turn out relatively flat. Therefore, the generator objective function was changed so that instead of minimizing the likelihood of discriminator being correct, it maximizes the likelihood of discriminator being wrong. According to this new objective function, the gradient ascent is performed on the generator.
New Generator Objective Function
Applications and Examples of GANs
Transfer of image domain – CycleGANs
These GANs transform images from one domain (say real scenery) to another domain (Say Van Gogh paintings) [8].
It can also transform pictures between zebras and horses!
Super Resolution
Super Resolution GANs (srGANs) allow to transform low resolution images into high resolution ones [9].
High resolution image synthesis
GAN algorithm called pix2pixHD allow to generate synthetic real life images from a semantic map [9].
Generating images from text descriptions
Researchers have also showed that GANs can be trained to generate visual scenaries that are described only by text [10].
Drug Discovery
Even though mainstream generative adversarial network research revolves around visuals, researchers from Insilico Medicine proposed an approach of drug discovery using GANS [11].
Similar work with anti-cancer compounds resulted in prediction of compounds that are already proven to be anti-cancer agents and new untested compounds that should be validated with further experiments.
GANs and Synthetic Biology
There is no doubt the Generative Adversarial Networks is an amazing tool which can bring immense changes into numerous, if not all, scientific fields.
Yet, expanding GANs can be a challenging task frequently requires a complete rethink of whole network architecture as was shown by previous examples [12-14], and has yet to reach the field of Synthetic Biology.
Despite that"

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," bind the dCas9s to any targetable DNA fragment. Although our initial design of targeting GFP prioritizes proof-of-concept over application, our team collaborated with synthetic biologists and people in fields outside of biology throughout our design and development process to make sure our product was a tool that would actually be used. We focused on developing three specific applications of this tool, but this should not box in its future uses.
Firstly, our system enables local delivery of therapeutics to specific infected areas. Our project inspiration was originally derived from this need area. We talked to local cannabis growers in the Bay Area and found out that crop loss to aspergillus flavus has significant impacts on both small and large scale growers (see Human Practices for more information). With Cerberus, therapeutic RNAi can be delivered to fight aspergillus flavus with specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which a strand of RNA binds to its complement, creating a strand of double-stranded RNA. Cellular enzymes then cleave this double-stranded complex, leading to gene silencing. This process has been exploited by bioengineers in applications such as pest control to silence the pest’s vital genes and kill it. RNAi based pest control requires no laborious genetic engineering of crops—for instance, Syngenta’s RNAi based insecticide is a spray that contains double-stranded RNA. However, such a spray would need to be reapplied and can be costly to produce. With our system, we can enable screening of large amounts of crops for Aspergillus flavus by screening for DNA fragments commonly exchanged in bacterial recombination between e. Coli and the fungus. We could thus selectively deliver an RNAi-based fungicide to infected plants, rather than the entire population to save time and money.
Secondly, diseases such as liver cancer have biomarkers that can be exploited to improve diagnostic tools. Using our detection system will allow us to create a transcriptional response to oncogenic biomarkers. We spoke to Ritish Patnaik about his work identifying liver cancer biomarkers in the Wang group at Stanford University, and discussed how our system might be helpful by creating transcriptional data for his magnetoresistive (GMR) platform. This platform for early detection binds to transcribed RNA and intensifies the signal with magnetic amplification, which could lead to earlier and more sensitive liver cancer diagnoses.
Lastly, we had a conference call with Mehmet Berkmen, a senior scientist at New England Biosciences (NEB), to discuss potential applications within the field of large scale protein production. At NEB, batches"

Our human practice project includes two themes raising many very different questions. The first one is about various intellectual property issues. The second theme deals with the relation between scientists and public stake holders.
We have chosen to divide the theme ""intellectual property"" into three parts because it represents the main part of our reflexion and required a longer development.   As a summary : the first part deals with the intellectual property rights inference towards the iGEM contest and was made by a reflexion on the economic challenges the synthetic biology industry faces. Then we give some answers through a FAQ to the questions you could have after reading our main intellectual property essay. In the third part, we sum up our collaborative work on the intellectual property with the University of British Columbia iGEM team which consists in a survey about IP issues in iGEM.  In the two last parts, we develop our actions towards the public.
Part I: Intellectual property issues
Introduction
Free knowledge sharing is part of the foundational principles of the iGEM contest. Consequently, protecting the possible commercial uses of the iGEM team members’ projects seems difficultly feasible by common ways (especially patents and copyrights). However, the intellectual property rights in general and patents in particular are commonly known to be the only way to promote innovation in a profit-making logic: if companies cannot secure the economic outcome of their investments in R&D, they will not invest in it. A simple conclusion could then easily be drawn from these very statements : iGEM projects would be unlikely to be industrially and commercially developed, to the extent that it would be difficult for companies to capture the economic returns of their investments.
Nonetheless, the decision of opening an iGEM entrepreneurship division, whose objectives are clearly to optimize the economic opportunities given by the performing iGEM innovation system, vigorously shook that very last conclusion.
The aim of this human practice project is to show that patents are not the only way, not even always the best mean to promote innovation. Viable alternative models do exist, such as the ""Commons' system"", which will be discussed further on. We will assume that iGEM members form a commons similar to the Open Source community of the IT sector to strike up a reflexion on the development of alternate economic solutions to patents.
We will most notably refer to both Joseph Stiglitz’s (Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001) and Elinor Ostrom’s (Nobel Prize in Economics"
Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," to link together different kinds of actors (companies, scholars, hackers, etc.) pursuing different objectives : making profits, publishing, or more original motivations, such as ""the fun of programming"", ""the sense of belonging to a common culture, where participants share a common ideology, often characterized by reciprocity"" (Henry and Stiglitz, 2010).
Can a commons coexist with other forms of the organization of economic activities (such as the market or the state involvement) inside the same sector ?
Nothing opposes the possibility that different modes of coordination co-exist within the same sector. A given firm may share knowledge in a commons perspective, while simultaneously developing market relations. For instance, some software vendors sell proprietary software (“proprietary bricks”) that complement a main open source program (which is free to use) like an option.
Existing economic associations such as the BiOS (“Biological innovation for an Open Society”) Initiative of Cambia, suggest that such a combination would be possible in the field of synthetic biology. The BiOS license allows the licensees to use Cambia enabling technology (a few key plant gene transfer patented technologies) royalty-free, on condition that the improvements made to the technology are also made freely available (i.e. they can be used royalty-free by other licensees). Furthermore, the BiOS founders, who claim that they have adapted the “open source” approach to biology (the source code being here the enabling technology), also argue that their licensing device does not lessen the usual incentives to innovate, including the possibility of patenting some products developed from the application of the enabling technology.
Why try to find our own rules for the iGEM commons ? The open source seems to work great, so shouldn’t we use theirs ?
Ostrom put forward a set of generic principles for a commons to be economically viable. One of them is that every single commons has its own rules that are defined by both its actors and the resources that are dealt with. Not only are the actors of the open source software movement different from the synthetic biology community but source code is also a resource different from the biological parts. These reasons make it hardly possible that the same rules could be applied to both commons, especially on the legal point of view. Indeed, the open source software movement is based on the spreading of open source licenses, which derive from copyright (“copyleft”). Such a solution is generally considered by legal experts as unadapted to biological parts (Henkel & Maurer, 2007). These experts also suggest that an economic model combining patents with legal devices ensuring free knowledge sharing and use would be the best way to the"

Gold mining in the Amazon region, although brings economic benefits, faces a number of serious environmental problems that affect ecosystems on a global scale. Due to mercury in gold mining activities, waters of the Amazon rivers faces one of the biggest threats: contamination in the whole life chain, being harmful from microorganisms to vertebrates.
Mercury is used for separate gold from debris, being added to mud, forming amalgam (complexed gold), then it is heated evaporating the metal and revealing the gold. Mercury vapor produced in this process as well as the remains of the metal present in the dirt, contaminate rainwater and rivers. Triggering a series of problems environmental issues ending up in innumerous human health hazards. This all occur as mercury in the environment has high chance of entering the food chain of animals in the ecosystem, contaminating natural stocks like fishes, which are the main protein source of the inhabitants of the banks rivers.  More concerning  though, is it know that mercury is one of the most toxic metals on the planet and can cause a number of neurological disorders (eg. tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, comportamental issues), being highly dangerous for pregnant women and children. Mercury contamination happens for two main reasons: lack of both environmental law enforcement and technology.
The Team UFAM_BRAZIL who are living in a city that is in the middle of the Amazon forest, and eating all kinds of fish almost every day since forever, is very worried about this situation!
Moreover, we are lucky to be always motivated to solve problems using Synthetic Biology, we want to help and develop technologies that can enable advances in gold mining without contaminating and damaging the environment, therefore our statement for this year’s project is:
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AS BIOTECH TOOL FOR RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.

The second dilution would put 10 uL of the 8.33x10^4 cells / mL tube into 1 mL.  The number of cells in this second dilution would thus be 8.33x10^2.  Plating out 20 uL or 100 uL of this final dilution will give you either 1.66x10^1 cells or 8.33x10^1 cells onto the plate.  This last situation is the most accurate for determining plating efficiency, because even with 100% transformation efficiency, one would only have to count 166-833 colonies.
We made an excel spreadsheet to help us calculate this in the future.

8 - 100 or less (pTEF primers, control)
9 - 100-200 (pGPD primers, control)
10 -100 or less (mCYC + BS primers, control)
The ones that seem most promising are mCYC + ZifA BS and mCYC + GliA BS, seeing as they are within the correct lengths.  The mCYC + LexA BS should be 244 bp, but the band appeared around 500 bp.  pCYC should be 288 bp, but its band was at 300-400.
Note that wells 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all came from the first round of PCR.  As such, we did not get an accurate assessment of the PCR that really did work, which was the second round.  We need to run another gel tomorrow using the correct PCR products.
Did 30 uL restriction digests of the purified PCR products, with the exception of mCYC + LexA BS (mLexA).  Thus, the parts that were digested with EcoRI and PstI in buffer H were ZifA (no promoter), GliA (no promoter), LexA (no promoter), mCYC + ZifA BS (mZifA), mCYC + GliA"

Below we share a PDF of the guide we wanted to give to future iGEMers with the points we covered to develop Topic A. Here we mention what to include on each point and how to adapt it to any Topic you decide to discuss.
MEXMUN Guide
▼
For this case, we share as an example the PDF of Topic A that iGEM Tec-Chihuahua 2018 wrote for this year’s event. MEXMUN and our team used this PDF to help mentor delegates so they can understand what synthetic biology is and how it is related to biological weapons. This document can be also found on MEXMUN’s official website. Below we annex both versions, the original version in Spanish and the translation in English. It is worth mentioning that after the event took place, CDSI was the only committee which presented the two solutions for both of the topics discussed. As well, MEXMUN counted with the honorable presence of the Hungarian Ambassador to Mexico, Ivan Medveczky, who told students the actual topics that are treated nowadays in the UN and the topics that will be treated in the upcoming years.

An assembled genetic circuit of: Promoter- R0040, Ribosomal Binding Site B0034, and Tinsel purple (Tspurple)- (BBa_K1033906) (Uppsala 2013) was constructed to use in conjunction with a Protease mechanism of ClpXP.  ClpXP is a protein complex comprised of two parts.  ClpX recognizes an SsrA tag sequence at the end of a protein linearizes the tagged protein and brings it to ClpP.  ClpP is an ATPase and cleaves the primary peptide bonds resulting in degradation of the original protein into individual amino acids.  This demonstrated the potential usefulness of the 3-D fuge and Chrome-Q system as a replacement for fluorescent plate readers and centrifuges.

Dow Chemical Company
The Dow Chemical Company (based in Midland, Michigan, USA) is one of the largest chemical manufacturers in the world. This company is involved mainly in the manufacture of plastics, chemicals and agricultural products. As the hydrogen gas is the byproduct of not only oil refinery reactions, but also different industrial processes such as paper, rayon and leather manufacture, we decided that the opinion of people specialized in chemicals production is also very important. We organized the meeting in Astana city with the representatives of this company. During this meeting, many significant conclusions were drawn:
1. The process of hydrogen sulfide conversion can be used not only in oil & gas refineries but also for sewage treatment. There is the serious problem of hydrogen sulfide remained after water treatment, which can be recognized through the strong smell present in some streets in the city of Astana. The country manager of this company also underlined that our project would find easy application namely in this case.
2. The use of cyanobacteria in hydrogen sulfide conversion would be really challenging in oil industry application. There are two reasons for this statement: light delivery and speed of flow. Under the conditions of factories, it is unknown how possible will it be to provide light for maintaining the life cycle of cyanos and what amount per hour they can really deal with.
Overall, the experts were really inspired by our project and they continue to support us by providing with essential contacts and useful advice. With their help, we contacted the ChemInvest company which promised to provide us with the oily water samples
KazMunayGas JSC
KazMunayGas is one of the major oil and gas companies in our country, so the meeting conducted with its representative specialists was probably the most challenging and important one. It was crucial to investigate the details of the oil refinery, namely the separation from the hydrogen gas; to know the possibility of integrating the project and the general aspects that we should consider. Our team members presented the project idea in Astana to the company experts who are responsible for the scientific part. The meeting was really fruitful, and it forced us to reconsider many things, such as:
1. To be realistic. The project itself is very interesting and it would be wonderful to apply such advanced principles of synthetic biology in one of the most challenging problems of the oil industry, but there are many unanswered questions such as the possible ways for storage of hydrogen gas, the capacity of H2S consumption by cyanobacteria, the disposal of cells excess and other details.

The resulting 6 nt scar sequence insertion increases the distance between the RBS and the AUG start codon, a result which is likely to cause a decrease in riboswitch efficiency. Inserted biobrick “scar” region highlighted in violet, AUG start underlined.
Team Lethbridge 2009, used the same theophylline riboswitch (clone 8.1) to generate a riboswitch-CheZ construct. However, this team created a 11 nt insert after the AUG start codon. This result created a UAG amber stop codon (in the 3rd amino acid position) as well as a frameshift mutation. Therefore it is unlikely that a functional CheZ could have been produced from this system.

Due to the difficulties faced with previously submitted riboswitches we decided to make our own new BioBricks. An objective of our project was to show higher efficiency of activation and make these constructs available for future teams to use in a modular fashion. This way, any coding sequence can be controlled in a riboswitch-dependent manner for function in an unlimited number of applications (Figure 11).

Tec-Monterrey,2011,Team:Tec-Monterrey#teamha#onlinearticles#english_-_-_TEXT.html," highly unproductive since a lot of effort was placed in obtaining a desired feature.
Genetic modification is a more efficient and accurate tool that has allowed scientists to find the specific gen they need for a particular trait. Later on, this gen could be cloned and introduced to a plant which would get the desirable characteristic.
It´s not that easy for the plant to express the desirable feature, even so, genetic modification has allowed the next advances:
• Plants resistant to insects.
• Resistant stems harsh climates
• Higher yields of production
To get more information, visit actionbioscience.org and read the article: Biotechnology in crops: Issues for the developing world, and Crop Biotechnology: Feeds for livestock from the university of California.
Fact: No genetically modified organism is released if it doesn’t comply with the regulation required.
In the United States, the regulation of genetically engineered (GE) foods is divided among three federal agencies: the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) (oversees GE crop field trials); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(for selectable marker genes and proteins in crop development); the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (conducts voluntary consultations on other aspects of GE foods with the companies that choose to consult it). For more information about these agencies, please consult the review Safety Testing and Regulation of Genetically Engineered Foods in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews.
In Mexico, the regulation is based on the Mexican Constitution that establishes the general guidelines to be followed by government dependencies.
Some examples are:
•Ley General de Salud (Health General Law)
•Ley Federal de Sanidad Vegetal (Federal Law of Vegetal Sanity)
•Ley federal sobreMetrología y Normalización (Federal Law about Metrology and Normalization)
•Ley Federal sobre Producción, Certificación y Comercio de Semillas (Federal Law about Production, Certification and Trade of Seeds)
• Normas OficialesMexicanas (NOM) (Official Mexican Standards).
An important law that regulates most of the crops in Mexico is the Ley de Bioseguridad de Organismos Genéticamente Modificados (Biosecurity Law for Genetically Modified Organisms). This law regulates the activities of confine employ, experimental, pilot program and commercial release, marketing, import and export of GM organism.

4Conclusion
Experimental Results
In order to prove the feasibility of our project 5 main points needed to be adressed:
1. Addressing proteins to the emmiting bacteria outer membrane
2. Controlling the production of outer membrane vesicles
3. Addressing proteins to outer membrane vesicles
4. Fusing outer membrane vesicles of the emmiting population with the outer membrane of receiver cells
5. Transducing a signal from a protein in the outer membrane to a reporter gene in the receiver
We provided experimental evidence for 3 out of this 5 points:
Addressing proteins into the sender bacteria outer membrane
Our strategy was here to take advantage of the clyA outer membrane protein by fusing a fluorophore to N or C terminal of the ClyA protein.[ More information ]

The different exposure durations were chosen in order to predict and create a basis for coming experiments on adaptation and acclimation setup. The setup of 0.5 kPa, 30 mins of UV and 1H exposure has shown excellent performance in comparison to the other curves despite the fact that it is the lowest pressure value, and longest UV exposure duration, it is among quickest growing population.

Question How well did the S.elongatus and B. subtilis adapt to the Martian conditions?
Experiment Due to the breakage of JMMC and lack of time for reparation, the adaption experiments are carried out in another facility at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Plant and Environmental Science. At first the plates are exposed to UV single wavelength of 293 nm and subsequently exposed to pressure of 0,8 kPa for a duration of approximately seven minutes. The replating of exposed colonies will take place at their stationary phase, then incubated overnight in order to grow for another round of exposure with the same premises and values as applied in the first round. Growth rate assessments and physical changes of bacteria will be carried out by the means of OD and microscopy at an instant of each cycle. This procedure will demonstrate their ability of adaption and acclimation of the bacteria to Martian conditions.
Results The graphs and microscopy images of the adaption and acclimation results will be present at the presentation and included in the poster for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.

LIKA-CESAR-Brasil,2014,Team:LIKA-CESAR-Brasil#ColiAlert_-_-_TEXT.html," due to the neutral pH of LB media.  However, with the addition of the solution at acidic pH, the bacteria instantaneously change their color to yellow. This is a reversible process. The same modified genetically engineered bacteria, will change their color from pink to yellow, and from yellow to pink with variations in pH. The process becomes irreversible when cell lysis occurs, causing the ColiAlert only remains yellow. The biobricks constructed it was placed genes that promote that chromoproteins remain at plasmatic membrane. The process of lysis of the membrane, probably affects the structure of chromoproteins or ability to react with the basic or neutral conditions, thus maintaining its original yellow color.
This color variation is shown in the graphs of absorbance shown in figure 3 and 4. Figure 3 is an absorbance spectrum generated by readings from 300 to 680nm at pH 4 and 7. It is possible to see that the samples at neutral pH, having two absorption peaks, while acidic pH has only one, showing the transition of colors. In Figure 4 is possible to observe the change in absorbance obtained from samples of ColiAlert diluted in citrate buffer (0.1M) and phosphate buffer (0.1 M) at different pHs in readings of 500nM.
To try to show that ColiAlert signals the process of extracting nucleic acids correctly, we tested the extraction of nucleic acids only with blood, and blood together with ColiAlert.  At the end of procedure, the resulting samples were quantified with NanoDrop (Results in Figure 5). It is possible to note the indirect evidence that in the presence of ColiAlert, the amount of DNA generated was more than twice as high. Figure 6 shows the variation in color and pH obtained after the lysis procedure and figure 7, 8 and 9 shows plates with ColiAlert. And figure 10 shows the process of reversible and irreversible change in coloration.

(Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
Our plan is to make pens with E.coli in ink as a result transduction. If children lick the pen, they might mistakenly intake E.coli.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.

I explored different possibilities to create this database. We work with MySQL and SQLite. Ankit and I determined that SQLite was sufficient for our purposes. The two of us, spent the rest of the week learning how to use SQLite3 and integrate it with Django.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html,"lnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"

Edinburgh,2015,Team:Edinburgh#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we are testing is the processed vs unprocessed cellulose. As you can see on the graph, there are large error bars however there is a clear difference between the binding on the processed and unprocessed sheets of microbial cellulose. This could be because the processing may get rid of any remaining organisms or proteins that would inhibit the CBD binding. Due to limited time and cellulose sheets from the Stanford-Brown team, we were unable to repeat this experiment.
From these results we would have to conclude that if we were to make a microbial cellulose based biosensor, it is best that it uses the processed sheets. From this we also advise the Stanford-Brown team to use the processed sheets. Due to the higher binding affinity of the CBD to the processed sheets, they should be able to have the spores stick for folding. Check out their project and how they processed the cellulose!

Formal Lab Session - 6th October 2009
Today we did B. subtilis transformations using our ptotocol. We prepared the LB+ CHL(Chloramphenicol) plates since we will transform the cells with pGFP-rrnB.  We used 5ml 2.5 mg/ml stock of CHL, however it should have been 2 ml since the final concentration should have been 5ug/ml CHL.
We did miniprep to look for CotC+ pmutin4 colonies. We used 12 ON cultures. Finally we did a restriction digest with HindIII and BamHI. But we could not find a right colony again. Although the transformations seemed worked we had colonies on both ""backbone+ no ligase + no insert"" and ""backbone+ ligase + no insert"". Our transformations dd not have the ligated product! Digest:
H20 11ul Buffer 2ul DNa 5ul HindIII 1ul BamHI 1ul
Control Digest:
H20 13ul Buffer 2ul uncut pmutin4 2ul HindIII 1ul BamHI 1ul
The bands were pmutin4 were not very clear and we decided to do a midiprep for pmutin4 again.

We induced the BL21 cells, containing the pSB1C3 vector with the T7 promoter system, with IPTG to start expression. In order to validate the successful expression, we performed a SDS-Page.
Results and Discussion
The cod gene was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 after induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expression temperature was reduced to 30 °C.
Analysis utilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), shown in figure 14, revealed single bands for the COD enzyme (approximately 45.5 kDa).
Further approach would include adding His-tags and purification via affinity chromatography. To test the enzyme activity the amount of released acetic acid during enzymatic reaction can be measured, using an acetic acid assay kit, or via thin-layer chromatography.
Considering the importance of using two CDAs, an orthogonal expression system could be implemented to create multiple patterns of deacetylation.

Designer Future
Since chitin oligomers are deacetylated at specific positions by different deacetylases, the usage of different enzymes makes it possible to create chitosans with defined patterns and special properties. While our project only involves two deacetylases at this time, others could be introduced as well, giving us the opportunity to create varying patterns. To accomplish this future goal, we would require an orthogonal expression system. Unregulated parallel usage of several CDAs only results in chitosan oligomers that are deacetylated by all enzymes. If they could be individually induced, each combination of CDAs may be expressed and different chitosan oligomers could be constructed for various applications"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

The result shows the kinetics of SNP releasing NO in LB. From the dynamic curves, we could see that even low concentration of SNP could continuously release NO for 5~6 hours or even more, and the concentration of released NO is just appropriate for mimic the rectal NO concentration of patients of IBD, which is about 10 μM [3].
Figure 2. The concentration of NO released by SNP in LB medium were determined by Griess reagent. Add Griess reagents to samples within 96-well plate and read the absorbance at 540 nm by the microplate photometer.
These conclusions suggest that SNP releasing NO in LB culture could mimic the NO gradient in the inflammatory gut of IBD patients. (换个更好的用词)
NO Sensing
Microbiome have evolved several biological NO sensors, including SoxR protein, FNR family, NorR protein and so on. [4] NorR protein has an N-terminal regulatory domain, which is regulated by NO molecule, and a C-terminal DNA binding domain, which will binds to promoter pNorV to initiate transcription when activated.
(此处补一张NorR，pNorV机理的图)
We integrated this system to a vector into E.coli, which would produce NorR protein constitutively and activate pNorV transcription if NO exists.

        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage."

A SINGLE-STRAND DNA 3D-STRUCTURE PREDICTION TOOL
using ViennaRNA[1] and Rosetta[2] bioinformatics software
We found a simple method to predict the structure of aptamers, by copying the protocol to compute RNA 3D-foldings with Rosetta. The trick is to convert the aptamer to RNA, then compute its structure, re-convert to DNA and minimize the free energy to adjust atom coordinates.
Why
The best advantage of aptamers is their ability to be easily modified, improved, to increase their affinity or stability. This can be done by doing substitutions, insertions or deletions to the original sequence. To study the effect of the modification, you need to have the 3D structure of your aptamer. The goal of our tool is to predict the 5 most probable structures your aptamer would have in biological samples, and output them in PDB file format, from scratch with only primary sequence input.
Applications
Want to see what the aptamer you designed looks like?
Want to prepare a PDB structure for docking with your target/biomarker?
Want to see how a polymorphism in the chain influences interaction with the target?
Then use this computation procedure. Although it is not made to give precise energy computation results, it does return the most probable 3D structures.
A not so fast but simple and  free tool
We are currently in the process of making the tool available online for non-commercial use. It will be hosted onto one of our school’s server so anyone will be able to use it directly online. (our team signed a custom licence of the Rosetta suite for the purpose of our web server).
http://ia2c.heavydev.fr
As we are not funded, our computation capacity is still limited: it may last several hours, and only 4 tasks can be treated at the same time.
You can also download it for your local server at https://github.com/ia2c/aptam"

The modeling work is supposed to be implemented before the experiment to make a prediction and instruction for laboratory work, while sometimes the modeling work just follow the experiments. Not all the researches are suitable to make modeling, and many biological question cannot be predicted and it can be only examined by real experiments.
In conclusion, modeling can help to design and serve as a guideline to experiment, while the data gaining from experiment can verify the degree of accuracy of modeling.
C.The 6th China Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Forum
We were honored to attend the great conference in cardiovascular field, which is held by the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University in 24th July. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to promote our idea based on the concept of synthetic biology to a variety of attendants of doctors, researchers, druggist and specialists. We introduce many applications of synthetic biology in health and medicine, such as rapid detection of cancer, killing device of virus and bacterial, in order to make them understand how synthetic biology can affect the current medical treatment, which raised their considerable interests. We also presented our project to some cardiovascular specialists and ask them for suggestions to improve the project design. During the conference, we were lucky and excited to interview Professor Hu Dayi, a very famous doctor in cardiovascular field. He said to us that gene analysis can be a medical tendency in the future, and tens of years later it may become a regular item of physical examination. It can help us know more about our heath condition and can improve the development of precision medicine. He also mentioned that our project may become a prototype of gene therapy for cardiovascular treatment.
In addition, here are some points of view gained from other specialists:
In the clinical trials, we clinical workers also expect some new development in the research of preclinical medicine such as gene therapy and synthetic biology method, so that we can have more therapies to help patients get rid of diseases.
Cardiovascular prevention is a heated and essential point for research. Thus, it is worth thinking about a way to do early detection using the method of synthetic biology."

The principles were same when we considered the construction of PbrR metal binding peptide (MBP). It was accomplished by fusing two copies of alpha-helices 5 of PbrR in tandem with three nonnative amino acids, SSG, as a bridge. PbrR MBP was then constructed and cloned into pSB1C3 backbone as a standard part for function test and the pET21a backbone as the commercial plasmid for the western blotting, as is shown in Fig 5.
Fig 5. Construction procedure of PbrR (lead) MBP. Top: Standard part; Bottom: Expression detection part.
As proved previously, when the mercury MBP was fused to DsbA, it would be efficiently translocated to the periplasm and works comparable to those targeting to the cytosol. Therefore, we fused lead MBP using the same method as it was in mercury MBP construction (Fig 6). Particularly, the PstI restriction site inside DsbA was mutated synonymously.
Fig 6. Procedure of DsbA-MBP construction.
In order to standardize the module, with Nest PCR, RBS (BBa_B0034) and T7 promoter are prefixed with the DsbA-MBP fusion, as is shown in Fig 5. A His-tag was fused at the C-terminal for further western blotting.
Fig 7. Standardization procedure of DsbA-MBP.
DsbA and MBD gene was amplified by PCR from pET-39b (+)-DsbA-MBP, with the primer containing T7 promoter, RBS and SD restriction sites, as shown in Fig 6. The PCR product was digested with EcoR I / Pst I and then cloned into EcoR I / Pst I double digested pSB1K3, to achieve the goal of standardization of the fusion protein (Fig. 7).
Like surface display of MerR MBP, Lpp-OmpA-MBP was designed as a fusion protein consisting of the signal sequence and first 9 amino acid of Lpp, residue 46~159 of OmpA and the PbrR metal binding peptide (MBP).

Prediction Model
The last step is to predict the behaviour of the system. For a global prediction, all species and processes that are related to the system should be covered. Therefore, we also consider the dynamic of mRNA and fluorescent proteins in the prediction model. Nevertheless, another problem is brought about because this setting is contradictory to our model as the dynamic of mRNA is ignored before. In fact"

Worldshaper-Wuhan,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Wuhan#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," of Wuhan University. After the interview, we realize that it is essential to improve the current diagnosis and treatments on colorectal cancer. Biomarkers may be a way to improve the techniques. The interview suggested the importance of diagnosing colorectal cancer at its early stage. It was later posted on our team’s WeChat official account.
Later we had another interview with Professor Zhou at Wuhan University, School of Basic Medical Science. The questions are more focused on experiments and technique development instead of clinical implementations like what we talked about in the previous one. She suggested the using of microRNA as a biomarker and told us about its function as a target in cancer treatments. After reading reviews on microRNA and cancer, we decided to focus our project on the application of miRNA-21 as a biomarker.
Professor Zhou provided suggestions on the future direction of microRNA biomarker. She told us that microRNA biomarkers not only serve for the diagnosis of cancer, but also help people to improve the treatments; that is, the marker developed can function in both diagnosis and treatment. Our group was at first focusing on the role of microRNA in diagnosing colorectal cancer, however through the interview we realized that the technique can be always developed as a tool for treatments. We modified the methods, and had a second trial.
Self-improvement
Without realizing the medical ethics protocols behind, we formerly planned to borrow real rejected patients’ tissues from the hospitals, which provide an ideal environment to measure the expression of mir-21 in colorectal cancer patients. However, after the interviews with Professor Zhou and Professor Rui Xu and a careful review of iGEM’s guidelines, we became aware of the challenging, time-assuming and ethical aspects of this plan in light of the complex procedures that we have to complete in order to borrow and perform experiments on human tissue. For this reason, we reformed our plans and instead created environments containing varied concentration of mir-21, which simulated the varying amount of the miRNA in different human bodies and enabled us to better test and observe the potential of mir-21 sponge to be used as cancer detectors in various environments. The interviews also shed lights on the long way to come if we want to use mir-21 sponge in further researches
Visiting to biomedical testing center
At the end our first trial, we visited Kindstar Global, a biomedical testing center, to learn about techniques relating to our projects. The sophisticated machines were fascinating.

The Risks of Our Projects Now
What are the risks to the safety and health of lab members?
To minimize risk to team members working in the lab, BSL-1 facility standard operating procedures are followed. http://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/biosafety/ The lab is kept clean and organized and inspected regularly. All members of the lab group have received current instruction on safety procedures.
What are the risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab)?
All strains used are considered nonpathogenic and engineered to be unable to survive outside laboratory conditions. To minimize accidental exposure, access to the laboratory by unauthorized persons is not permitted. There is no planned release of engineered bacteria. In order to reduce risk, cultures are grown in small quantities and micro technique is followed for all laboratory procedures as to minimize ecological impact and potential for toxicity to humans.
What are the risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab)?
All of the strains we use are engineered to be unable to grow outside of a laboratory environment. Waste disposal should pose no threat as the modified bacteria cannot live on pipet tips or dried up agar plates, and liquid cultures are killed with bleach before disposal. Our lab is locked, with access to lab members only, and any materials that escape should not be able to survive without the correct additives in the media.
What are the risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries
None of the strains used are on the Select Agent list and pose no threats to biosecurity.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For"

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to write a model for this is that this is a very simplistic model that makes use of several assumptions and simplifications. This is because biological systems are extremely complex, and at a single instant of time, there are several hundred reactions happening. Thus, we need to simplify and lump certain intermediate reactions, in order to have some quantitative estimate of how our system will behave.
Some of the assumptions made here are -
mRNA is made directly from DNA, and all the other components and processes in between, such as pulling of RNA polymerase (RNAp) by the TATA box in the promoter, binding of RNAp to the promoter and initiation of transcription are sufficiently fast, so that the parameters can be lumped and variables (such as RNAp and Promoter) can be ignored.
Degradation of molecules such as mRNA and protein is spontaneous, and is not triggered or accelerated by certain components (such as ssrA).
The rates of production and degradation are constant.
mRNA is not degraded, damaged, or consumed in any way during translation or production (transcription).
Total DNA inside a cell is constant.
Mass action kinetics is valid for the reactions occurring above.

Genetic Engineering
The science of modification of genetic material (DNA) of an organism in order to alter its characteristics in a particular way.
Ligation
The joining of two DNA strands or other molecules by a phosphate ester linkage.
Marker
A selectable marker is a gene introduced into a cell, especially a bacterium or to cells in culture, that confers a trait suitable for artificial selection. They are a type of reporter gene used in laboratory microbiology, molecular biology, and genetic engineering to indicate the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign DNA into a cell. Selectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes; bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic, and those bacterial colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and expressed the introduced genetic material or in other words, these markers make the organism resistant to that particular antibiotic. Normally the genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin, etc., are considered useful selectable markers for E. coli.

Serine with O-nitrobenzyl protection group, a non-canonical amino acid (“caged” serine).
Ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONBY)
Tyrosine with O-nitrobenzyl protection group, a non-canonical amino acid (“caged” tyrosine).
They are used in the process of photocaging with its corresponding orthogonal tRNA/ synthetase pair.
Nucleotides
It is the basic structural unit of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and nitrogenous bases like Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T)/ Uracil (U) and Cytosine (C).

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html," we will use primers with GO flags on either end that match the overhangs and homology regions on corresponding fragments. GA shortens the construction process because it does not require the use of restriction sites, can be performed in under an hour, and seamlessly integrates fragments.
Dr. William Belden informed us of his extensive experience with another assembly method: yeast-mediated cloning (YMC). At the beginning of our research, we considered this to be an innovative cloning technique, but we abandoned it due to our lack of experience. Dr. Belden explained that YMC works similarly to GA, but the process occurs naturally within yeast. Similar to GA, YMC requires homologous overlaps between fragments. Because GA and YMC involve similar designs, we reasoned that we could perform both experiments simultaneously without sacrificing much time or effort. Running both experiments in parallel will allow us to experiment with YMC while keeping GA as a contingency plan. We consulted Dr. Kamakaka on our parallel experiment idea, and he offered his support by providing protocols for YMC.
YEAST TRANSFORMATION
We want to integrate our gene cassette into the Y. lipolytica genome so that our construct will be passed on to offspring with each round of replication (Summers, 1991). We investigated a paper on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to insert pathway genes into Y. lipolytica (Wong et al., 2017) and considered using this system to incorporate our progesterone precursor genes into the yeast genome. In this paper, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 to integrate a set of two genes into the Y. lipolytica genome, but they used a gene cassette much smaller than ours will be (Wong et al., 2017). Schwartz et al. (2017) identified five loci within the Y. lipolytica genome with a high rate of integration via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (Schwartz et al., 2017). They found that gene disruption in these regions did not affect the growth rate of Y. lipolytica, which made us consider using them to integrate our genes of interest.
Gene integration via CRISPR could cause gene drive, which occurs when a particular set of genes spreads rapidly throughout the population of an organism (Noble et al., 2018). The use of gene drive violates the iGEM competition rules, so we will not use it in this project. To avoid gene drive, our mentor, Dr. David Bernick, suggested that we use microin"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"
Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," at the Germany-wide and European Meet-Up as well as posted a collaboration request on the official iGEM Collaboration Side looking for other teams that could translate the basic set of cards and rules to other languages or create new cards for the set. Luckily, many teams got in touch with us wanting to contribute to this project. So first of all, we want to thank all of these teams for making these collaborations possible and the game very versatile. We think, that every single one of these collaborations was very pleasant because we could not only broaden our and the game’s horizon, but also received a lot of feedback on the concept and implementation of the game as well as suggestions for improvement.
Our card game was translated into many languages.
The following teams had a part in the development of our card game:
Team Peshawar:
The team from Peshawar contributed the card “Treponema pallidium” to the English basic set of cards. This was a very good addition, because it causes a very severe and still wide spread disease. Thank you!
Team Cologne-Duesseldorf:
The team Cologne-Duesseldorf made a great effort and translated the game into five different languages, which is amazing and for which we are very thankful. Adding Greek, Portuguese, German, Hindu and French to the repertoire, they contributed a very broad spectrum of languages. Also, we discussed the card game in a skype session, receiving different suggestions for improvement.
Team GIFU:
Team GIFU from Japan helped us improve the card game with very constructive suggestions regarding the execution. They also translated the basic set of cards to Japanese, whereby they adapted the concept of the game to common Japanese games. We think that this is very helpful, because it enhances the playing experience by making the rules and the procedure of the game easier to understand. Therefore, thank you!        Download the card game in Japanese here!
Team Eindhoven:
As Eindhoven is located in the Netherlands, the team Eindhoven collaborated with us in translating the game into their national language Dutch. So now every German can play our game with our Dutch neighbours. Thank you, Team Eindhoven!        Download the card game and the rules in Dutch
Team NYMU-Taipei:
The iGEM team from NYMU in Taipei translated the basic set of cards to Traditional Chinese. Chinese is the language with the most native speakers on the globe, making this translation a real enhancement for our card game. Thank you!        Download the card game in traditional Chinese !

3. A new scaled-up restriction digest of the parts 3, 4 and 10 was executed, because the digested stocks of these parts were empty.
4. Some more unsuccessful ligations and transformations of the parts 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 into pRS vectors. There grew no colonies on the agar-plates or the ligation failed.
5. The T-shirts for the Jamboree in Amsterdam were designed. Aside, a lot of work on the wiki had to be done.

1. Some more mini-preps of the parts 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in pSB1C3 were executed with a following restriction digest . But there were still issues with the Chloramphenicol concentration, because the bacterial densitity was very low in the LB medium. Therefore no bands were visible on the gel after the mini-prep.
2. Finally the Wiki was completetd. The final design of the poster and the presentation for the Jamboree in Amsterdam were made.

Interactive Information Booth
Most people would agree that there is too much unfiltered material about glyphosate on the internet. Hence, we wanted to directly talk to the public to check on their state of knowledge and what they really know and think about glyphosate. Therefore, we packed our poster, together with some props and survey sheets and travelled to the Gänseliesel in the heart of Göttingen to uncover the opinion, knowledge and wishes of the people.
Proudly presenting our interactive information booth.
A nice day in the heart of Göttingen to update your knowledge over glyphosate.
This booth might seem small but there were several things to discover. For once, of course, the poster, that helped us to explain who we are and what we do. It also showed the current status of our project.
A general concern about glyphosate is its impact on biodiversity in the soil. Since glyphosate was first introduced as an antibiotic, its accumulation in the soil may also influence the biodiversity of bacteria. There are approximately between 100 million and 1 billion bacteria found in a teaspoon of productive soil. These Soil Bacteria have a diverse set of skills, which allows them to act as one of the greatest “real-life” influencers on earth.
However, most of the visitors had only a narrow idea about what microorganisms are, what they do and where to find them. To illustrate and exemplify with how many different microbes glyphosate may interfere in the soil, visitors could participate in a small experiment, where they could leave their microbial fingerprint on a BHI agar plate. To check the microbial diversity on the hand of each participant we incubated the plates at 37°C over the weekend and published the results on our Facebook page in the folder ""Infostand Göttingen"". Check out whats on your hand that you can’t see! Small hint: washing your hands with soap for at least 30 seconds helps to fight against infection! You want to know how to properly wash your hands .

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Test_-_-_TEXT.html,"xidative stress underlies many of the health problems of ageing so we will develop a number of free radical mopping devices. These devices will include therapeutic bacterial chassis triggered by oxidative-stress to deliver free-radical mopping compounds. To lay a conceptual foundation for genetic tools that address ageing within human cells, we will also use gene-editing tools to map the relationship between telomerase expression and cellular robustness to oxidative stress.
False teeth – a thing of the past
Increasing tooth loss remains a feature of old age in humans throughout the world. We will harness synthetic biology to improve the dental health of the ageing population by designing bacteria that do not cause decay but actually prevent it. These biofilm-fillings will provide a regenerative internal environment for the tooth whilst fighting off the surface bacteria that cause dental plaques.

This year, iGEM IIT Delhi went a step further in its quest to promote collaboration among the diverse enthusiasts of synthetic biology and to spread awareness about the emerging field of biological engineering and genetics.
We participated in iBEC, a competition organised by the Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India, and emerged as the winners with a reward of 10 lakh rupees. The foundation for this mini-iGEM competition was laid by iGEM IIT Delhi.
We underwent collaboration with iGEM IIT Kharagpur on their project. The 2016 kit plates had not yet arrived and they needed certain parts which were available with us in previous year’s kit plates. We sent them these parts so that they could begin working on their project. This proved to be a crucial headstart for them and they have attributed us for the same on their Wikipedia Page.
We also collaborated with iGEM Glasgow on their project wherein they needed reports and findings on deficiency of Vitamin A. A survey ( https://goo.gl/forms/xg9LuUXzCtD5iN8g1 ) on Vitamin A intake was conducted and publicised through social media platforms, messengers and circulars. This survey was conducted on a very large scale and invited responses from over 700 Indians. Their responses were evaluated and analysed and we reached the conclusion that Indian people mainly suffer from deficiency of Vitamin A due to insufficient consumption of carrots, fish and meat. After the survey, we came up with a message on IITD On Air describing the benefits of Vitamin A. All the findings and our analysis was reported to iGEM Glasgow and we hope it helped them in their project.
A PhD student, Mr. Mahendra Sahare, doing a humanities project under a Supreme Court lawyer, Dr. Naveen Thayyil, has been in collaboration with iGEM IIT Delhi for the past two years. Together, we have worked on the aspect of ‘Ethical Scientific Practices’. Also, on his recent visit to IISER Mohali, he came back with a collaborative offer for iGEM IIT Delhi to mentor IISER Mohali and help in the establishment of iGEM club there. On our return from the Giant Jamboree, we have a presentation scheduled there. Below is the screenshot of the e-mail showing the confirmation of the visit.
Loreal India also approached us for expert consultation regarding drug synthesis (production of opiods).
Our last year’s project, which involved a meeting with the Delhi Govt., has been turned"

9. Transformation
We use DH5α chemical competent Cells for common plasmid or cloning transformation.
1) For plasmid transformation, we add 2-5µl DNA (about 100ng/µl) into 50µl competent cells. For linearized producttransformation, we add 10µl DNA (about 50ng/µl) into 50µl competent cells. Usually, we will make a control transformation.
2) The mix of DNA and competent cells incubates on ice for 30min, then is heat shocked at 42℃ for 1 min and incubate on ice for 5min.
3) Pipette 500µl LB to each transformation and shake incubate （150rpm）for an hour at 37℃.
4) Pipette each transformation on two plates for a about 50µl and 300µl plating.
5) Incubate plates for 12-15 hours at 37℃.
We need to pay attention that before adding LB into the tube, we should be carefully and gently.
10. Colony PCR (DNA polymerase: rTaq; DNA: x bp)
This protocol is frequently used in our examination of colonies, which are from linearized product transformations. Just pick single colonies from transformations to do a colony PCR. If the results are right, do the further experiments.
Reaction System (Table. 6)
Reaction Program (28cyc: 2-4) (Table. 7)
11. Transformation of miRNA
1) Mimics synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma co.ltd. were dissolved to 20μm with DEPC water.
2) Thaw 50μl competent cells on ice until the last crystals disappear and mix gently.
3) Add 100ng plasmid DNA and 1-5μg miRNA mimics to the cells, flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and miRNA mimics. Do not vortex.
4) Place the mixture on ice for 30 min.
5) Heat shock at exactly 42℃ for exactly 90 seconds.
6) Place the tube on ice for 2min.
7) Pipette 500μl LB into the mixture.
8) Shake vigorously (200rpm) for 60 min at 37℃.
9) Add 2μl antibiotics and 1.5ml LB into the culture, continue to shake (200rpm"

Where:
\({V_{{m_f}}}\) is the maximum forward reaction rate attained when all enzyme molecules are bound to the substrate (DHT).
\({V_{{m_r}}}\) is the maximum backward reaction rate attained when all enzyme molecules are bound to the product(\(3\alpha Diol\)).
\({K_s}\) is the substrate concentration at which the forward reaction rate is at half-maximum.
\({K_p}\) is the product concentration at which the backward reaction rate is at half-maximum.
While we couldn't find the kinetic constants relevant for the human scalp, we found an article which measured them on rat skin [5] . We will assume that the constants are of the same order of magnitude as on the human scalp.

Graphs from top to bottom are the simulation for the following initial concentrations of DHT:
\(0.1 \cdot {K_s}\), \(1 \cdot {K_s}\) and \(10 \cdot {K_s}\)
From the simulation we can see that for an initial concentration that is lower by an order of magnitude from \({K_s}\), the time elapsed for the system to reach steady-state is almost the same as for an initial concentration of \({K_s}\). However for a value that is higher by an order of magnitude, the time increases significantly.

Inviting NJU-CHINA to attend academic debates.
In order to enhance the exchange between two teams, we invited the iGEM team of Nanjing University to attend                 the academic debate (Figure22). Two teams conducted a debate on whether changes in epigenetic modification                 can determine tumorigenesis at the China Pharmaceutical University Conference Center:
Positive side: CPU _CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications can determine tumorigenesis
Negative side: NJU-CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications can not determine tumorigenesis
The two sides hold different arguments, and even cited frontier knowledge of self-argument and deduction                 to express their views. Also, two teams were a lot of gains during the debate, as well as developed a further                 exchange on the issue of respective topics.

The meeting invited Haoqian Zhang, the predecessor of Peking University iGEM team, to shared                 his experience. According to his previous experience, all the notes on the formation of the team and participating                 in the Giant Jamboree have been described in detail and shared with us on the personal growth experience                 of participating in the competition.

Into 2 2 mL tubes, 3.3 µL of AMP was pipetted into them. This process was repeated for 4 other tubes with CAM and TET. A control with water was also used.
2 of the 2 mL tubes were then placed into a 35x10 mm Petri dish. This was done with 5 other 35x10 mm Petri dishes. 3 of them were rinsed after 15 minutes while the other 3 and the control were rinsed after 30 minutes. These were then recultured by pipetting 100 µL of LB media into the rim of the 35x10 mm Petri dish. It was the put back into the tube along with 5 µL of KAN.
These were then put into the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.

Next, we are going to have more detail description on three parts, which are Gas preparation system and flow                                             system , Medium preparation ,                                         and Downstream products purification and                                             biosafety .
A. Gas preparation system and flow                                         system
Fig 3. Diagram of gas preparation system and flow system
According to IGCC (Integrate Gasification Combined Cycle) flow                                         diagram, the fuel is first converted to syngas which is a mixture of H2 and CO. The syngas is then burned in a combined cycle consisting of a gas                                         turbine and a steam turbine with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). After                                         CO2 / H2 separation, IGCC can reach the demand of CO2 purity including low SOx and NOx emission fraction of allowable limits of                                         bacteria. Finally, the produced flue gas could enter the pipeline leading to the bioreactor.
In E. coli utilization system, the air is pumped in to neutralize the                                         concentration of CO2. A controlled valve is used to control flow                                         rate and split distribution. When the switch a is turned on, the switch b will                                         be turned off, and vice versa. As for the CO2 inlet and outlet, it                                         will maintain an open system of bioreactor. In other words, CO2 will                                         enter continuously and cause some non-reacted CO2 emitted.

Syngas has been treated by sulfur and nitrogen removal, as well as heavy metal                                         removal and cooling tank. Through IGCC process, purified CO2 in flue                                         gas is allowable for E. coli CO2 utilizing.
B. Medium preparation
Fig 5. Diagram of medium preparation
At this stage, we have two sections to consider, medium storage                                         and medium preparation before replacing time.
The medium is composed of M9 salt and xylose. For storage, we will convert it                                         into powder with the required proportion. At one hour before replacing time,                                         pour the powder into the medium tank and turn on the water injection switch.                                         Turn on the stirrer of medium tank to have medium powder and water perfect                                         mixing. The outlet of bioreactor (switch c) will be turned on at the same time,                                         letting ninety percent of the medium in the bioreactor flow out . When the                                         medium have prepared well, turn on the switch a"

ESBS-Strasbourg,2010,Team:ESBS-Strasbourg#Test3_-_-_TEXT.html,"thetic biology is a new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic biology encompasses a variety of  different approaches, methodologies and disciplines. We can define the synthetic  biology as the design and (re)construction of new biological  functions and systems not found in nature.
Similar to the construction of a car,  Synthetic Biology uses simple gene building blocks for the construction of new complex systems with distinct functions.  These gene building blocks are collected in a database by iGEM and can  be used by all participants of the competition. So far, the collection contains  more than 13,000 gene building blocks , due to the continuous development of  new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed  projects which will then be presented in the beginning of November at the  “Jamboree” in Boston. Several prizes in different categories will be awarded.

Lethbridge,2009,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," is, and even those who have some knowledge of the term stated they don’t care, reflecting either apathy or a lack of interest.
As a comparison, we next examined students’ knowledge of the term “synthetic biology” (Figure 2). These results distinctly contrast from the students’ knowledge of genetic engineering. Only 18% of students either never heard of the term or didn’t know what it is, as opposed to over half of students (58%) who either never heard of or didn’t know what synthetic biology is. This isn’t surprising however, as the field of synthetic biology is just emerging. Again, students who have at least some knowledge of synthetic biology generally have a favourable view of it.
Since the University of Lethbridge iGEM team is small and Southern Alberta is not particularly populated, we next determined high school students’ interest in science in general, interest in a scientific career, and interest in extracurricular activities in science. This survey serves two purposes: one, to ascertain if students were at all interested in science or a scientific career,  and also as a tool for future recruitment to the U of L iGEM team. The results are summarized in Figure 3.
These results are of particular interest to the U of L iGEM team; while the majority of high school students have a general interest in science (71%), only 32% actually have an interest in a scientific career, suggesting students may not view science as a means to earn a living. Indeed Alberta is generally a “primary resource” based economy, with many jobs in Alberta in the primary industry such as agriculture and oilfield based industry. Thus, if Alberta wants to become a leader in biotechnology, this perspective must be changed. This is further reflected by the fact that 54% of high school students interested in science showed a high or very high interest in extracurricular scientific activities such as iGEM. These are the students that must be recruited from outside the university in order to grow the U of L iGEM team.

Safety
Our project did not raise issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety, because we used non pathogenic species and parts.  Our work is carried out in a level 1 facility, and all of our parts/materials were level 1.  We did not create any new, unknown or untested parts, but developed parts based off of existing genes.   If our project were to be continued further, and we achieved the usage of a new chassis (Spirulina maxima)"

CIDAR MoClo ( Iverson et al., 2016 )
The Cross-disciplinary Integration of Design Automation Research lab (CIDAR) MoClo Library represents the first toolbox adapted for bacteria focused on E. coli. It offers 95 genetic modules for bacteria and proposes a modified protocol reducing the reaction time of the assembly steps from 5 hours to just 90 minutes. The toolkit provides a series of level 0 plasmids derived from the iGEM pSB1A2 backbone. Four modules are assembled into a series of level 1 destination plasmids derived from pSB1K3 to transcription units using BsaI. In a next step this transcription units can be assembled to multigene modules by restriction with BbsI. Up to 4 transcription units can be assembled to a level 2 multigene construct.
EcoFlex ( Moore et al., 2016 )
EcoFlex is a toolbox specialized on the use with E. coli that offers a wide variety of modules. It features a library of constitutive promoters, T7 expressions, RBS variations, synthetic terminators, protein purification tags and fluorescence proteins characterized in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore it is compatible with MoClo, Golden Braid 2.0 and PhytoBrick standard.
One unique feature of this kit is the ‘entry vector’ for ORFs. The parts are flanked by NdeI and BamHI sites again flanked by BsaI restriction sites. The NdeI sites provide the fusion sites for Golden Gate assembly without addition of amino acids to the coded protein and in combination with BamHI additionally  providing compatible transfer to the commercial available pET vectors. If NdeI or BamHI are present in the coded protein NcoI and BglII can be used respectively for the assembly.
The second unique feature of EcoFlex is the inclusion of a secondary module. Here level 2 transcription units (TUs) can be subcloned into a corresponding secondary module using compatible BpiI sites located upstream the primary MoClo BsmBI sites. This way a module of multiple TUs can be ligated into a secondary module containing further TUs. The introduction of this feature offers a simplified and faster method for combinatorial pathway optimization.
Loop assembly ( Pollak et al., 2018 )
Loop assembly provides a new toolbox designed for plant engineering purposes. It contains a series of 8 plasmids derived from pGreenII backbone divided in two sets to loop over several levels of assembly. Level 0 modules are assembled into odd receiver plasmids (pOdd) with"

Team
The third-ever Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team is composed of five undergraduate students majoring in biology, biochemistry and biomedical engineering. With the help of two mentors, Dr. Joe Jez and Dr. Gautam Dantas, and several graduate students (Brian Landry, Bert Berla, and Larry Page), the team developed and carried out a project of its own devising – namely, the synthesis of the components of saffron in the vector Synechocystis.
This year’s team was assembled at the beginning of the spring semester. Through weekly Wednesday morning meetings, the team brainstormed ideas with the mentors, eventually forming a concrete plan to be implemented over the summer. With most of the planning done during the semester, the team was free to spend the summer first ironing out the finer details of the project and then implementing the project.
