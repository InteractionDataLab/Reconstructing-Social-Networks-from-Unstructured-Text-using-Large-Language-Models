Tsinghua-E,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," from E.coli BL21(DE3)
We cloned dnaQ gene from E.coli BL21(DE3) by PCR and utilized overlap extension PCR to introduce mutagenesis in dnaQ by the following protocol.
Firstly, we used E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain as template to amplify dnaQ gene by PCR with mut-F and mut-R primers, respectively. After purification of PCR product (the 〖E.Z.N.A.〗^TM Gel Extraction Kit, produced by Omega Bio-tek), it was used as template to introduce point mutation by two parallel PCRs with the following two sets of primers: mut-L73W-F and mut-L73W-R (generating L73W); mut-A164V-F and mut-A164V-R (generating A164V). The three PCR products were gel-purified and combined by 5ng,respectively and assembled with mut-F and mut-R primers. The resulting overall product was T-cloned into Takara pMD-19 T-vector (produced by Takara BioTechnology (DALIAN)CO.,LTD.) and sequenced to confirm the sequence. The L73W and A164V mutant BL21 (DE3) dnaQ was named after mutD.
Figure. 2 tryptophan sensor construction with lacZ as output signal
Maltose hydrolase gene malQ was cloned from E.coli JW3995.
In parallel, we also constructed tryptophan sensor circuit. According to the report about the translating ribosome by nascent peptide based tryptophan degradation gene cluster regulation mechanism, we previously synthesized the corresponding tnaC coupling Rho sequence. This gene cluster was assembled with lacZ gene by overlap PCR and the gel-purified fragment was cloned between NcoI and HindIII sites of pTrc99A vector by restriction enzyme digest and T4 ligase induced ligation. All the information about primers was shown in “primer information”. This plasmid was named after pTrc99A_trp sensor_lacZ.
Week4(7.15-7.22)
In this week, we tried to clone mutD and sfGFP cluster downstream of araBAD promoter (pBAD). We amplified pSC101-Cm-pBAD and sfGFP fragment from plasmid AraC_pBAD_CI_OR222-sfGFP, which was kindly provided by Professor Ouyang Qi in Peking University. mutD was introduced by three different ribozyme binding site (RBS) sequence upstream and also"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"

My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at the University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am.

Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:

Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," to collaborate. The Bordeaux team kicked of the meeting with a presentation on what the term GMO entails, and which ethical issues GMOs raises. They then continued presenting about the conferences they organised, the experts they met and their findings on human practices so far. Besides just presenting the findings of their meetings with experts they also offered to bring us into contact with them.
The expert that seemed most valuable to us was Manguene Marc of the fondation Anthony Mainguéné. He and his foundation promote the responsible and forward-looking raising of awareness in innovative and creative ways. We asked the Bordeaux team to forward our most important questions to him. We also gave presentation´s to each other and a brainstorm session about ethical matters involved with the use of GMOs where we discussed the questions we prepared in advance. We summarize the findings below:
Safety
Ethical issues concerning safety can entail large questions such as how big should the risk be before we ban further work, or in other words, what is the red line? These are the kind of questions scientists have tried to answer on large scale conferences such as the asilomar conference mentioned above. For our project we looked at the more concrete and smaller safety issues directly related to our project.
One of the biggest safety concerns in most projects involving GMOs is the risk of a GMO escaping the lab. What happens when such a leak occurs? There are a number of possible consequences, including the spread of new pathogenic strains and the release of toxic molecules in the environment, and the possibility of the escaped strain taking over an existing niche or creating of a new one. How do we tackle this issue? In theory the organism we modify could live outside of the lab as s.cerevisiae is a ubiquitous. In the wild our strain however doesn't stand a chance as every wildtype microorganism will grow much faster and will likely outcompete our strain. Also there is no existing biological niche that our organism could occupy as cellulose in complete absence of glucose monomers or other carbohydrates. A future step of our strains development is inducing a tryptophan deficiency that would further limit its potential to proliferate outside of the laboratory. Besides this we’re working on methods to make our cells grow only in very specific circumstances to limit the chance of it being able to live and procreate outside if the lab. A way to really force this is by implementing a kill switch, make sure the cell can only live when a certain compound is around. This particular compound will be fed to the cell when it’s safely contained in the lab, but it won’t be able to find it when it’s out in"

Overview
This year Tsinghua-A iGEM Team is trying to explore the ability of genetic regulation pathways to reduce noise and accurately convey information. Here we are going to share our experience in safety control.
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Project design is foundational:
we do not have a specific real-world application. And all of our experiments are only in the lab. So there is little risk our project will pose. We just want to figure out the ability of genetic regulation pathways. It is theoretic and will cause no harm to the society.
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis:
We use E. coli (lab strains that are non-pathogenic) for doing the cloning and carry out the measurement in HEK293 human cell line.Experiment with any other organisms besides the chassis is not carried out.
Choosing parts that will not harm humans/animals/plants:
Harmful parts are not allowed in our project. The parts in our project are most commonly used florescent proteins, which are harmless. So none of our parts would raise any safety issue according to the current professional knowledge.
Safe Lab Work
According to the requirements of iGEM policy, in our daily bench work we never performed any dangerous experiments or faced any unusual safety issues. Our bench work followed some basic regulations as below:
Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission is strictly prohibited.
Experiment participants need to understand the experiment completely.
Necessary steps should be performed in bio-safety cabinet.
Fire, electric heaters, microwave oven should not be left while being used.
Sterilize all liquid waste and solid waste containing living organism.
Sterilize the lab using UV-light every week.
The last person to leave the lab should make sure that water, electricity, gas, and air conditioner has been closed, and doors and windows has been locked before leaving.
We take a lot of actions to reduce the risk at the laboratory stage:W"

Digested insert did not appear in the
Colony-PCR of CBDclos(T7) .
Picked and plated several colonies of the CBDcex(T7)+GFP_His -assembly and plated the on CM-Agar.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
Flask cultivation of E. coli KRX with BBa_K863005 to test various concentrations of chloramphenicol. We used E. coli KRX as negative control.
Settings: 100 mL flasks without baffles, final volume: 10 mL, autoinduction medium with 20/ 57.5/ 95/ 132.5/ 170 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 37 °C, 120 rpm, double determination.
Note: Found out, that we did not use the maximal possible concentration of chloramphenicol. We decided to use a higher concentration than 20 µg/mL and chose 60 µg/mL for further cultivations. This is a compromise between benefits and costs.
Saturday August 11th
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Colony PCRs showed positive colonies for ecol(J23110) so we plated this colonies on new plates.
We did the PCRs of the laccase genes ecol, bpul, bhal and tthl again. We used the …_FW / …_RV primers and the …_FW / …_RV_HIS primers of the different genes. Digestion of this PCR products and ligation with pT7 or promoter J23110 and the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone.
Team Site Directed Mutagenesis:
Agarose-gel-electrophoresis of xccl-PCR (yesterday) showed bands at 3.2 kbp and over 12 kbp but not at 4 kbp as it should be.
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
A few of the plated  pSB1C3+CDBcex+GFP-assembly colonies have grown
Colony-PCR CBDclos(T7) -colonies showed no positive clones.
Team Activity Tests: Today we received samples of BPUL from Team Cultivation that were cultivated in different chloramphenicol concentrations. Very exciting! We measured as usual at OD420 and analyzed the supernatant (Figure 1) and the cell extract (see Figure 2). Unfortunately no activity was seen for any of the samples. We feel sorry.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," green anti-sigma factors cannot block the already-existing green sigma factors’ effect on the green sigma promoter completely.
Here is the state after cell division.
The genes on the right stop being translated. Plenty of red sigma factors and green anti-sigma factors are made from the gene 5. The expression of gene 3  gradually declines because of the increase of green anti-sigma factors.
When there are sufficient green anti-sigma factors, the gene expression will finally become as following.
This is the exact same state as the phenotypic changes began, except that it is genes 5,6, instead of genes 3,4, that are being expressed. In other words, the expressed genes are switched through one cell division. The gene groups are symmetric in terms of colors (red, blue and green) when the reagent does not exist. Therefore, the expressing genes will be genes 7,8 after another division, and switch to genes 3,4 again after another. If the 3 patterns of gene expressions can be shifted in turn as expected, we can elongate the loop without a complicated gene design.
Above is the gene groups that we designed. Toehold switch takes a key role of the gene expression change, and makes it easy to expand the system because it has a lot of pairs which do not crosstalk (link to application & citation). Also, it is a translational regulator, not transcriptional, so the response is expected to be faster.
Sigma factors and anti-sigma factors enables the pattern of the gene expression to be looped among cell divisions.
Pnrd switches the gene expression at the timing of a cell division.In reality, there are problems such as the inconsistency of the timing when Pnrd works and cell division, (Pnrd actually works on the time of DNA replication, not that of cell division.) and the preference of sigma factors to bind with anti-sigma factors than sigma promoters(see also model, and experiment pages). However, various phenotypes can be realized theoretically according to our computer simulation, depending on the properties of the factors and promoters.

1.5 Provide examples for iGEMers
Now many iGEM teams engaged in fundamental advances are confused how to integrate their project with practice. So another five teams and us form the fundamental research transformation group. We used our project as an example to specifically describe how to apply project to practice and how to adjust our project accordingly. Then we shared our experience with Tianjin University, Zhejiang University and National Defense Science and Technology University to explore the transformation of fundamental research results and formed joint a report, hoping to provide a reference to future iGEM teams.
1.6 Give lectures in OUC
In order to promote the spread of synthetic biology in our campus, we gave lectures to those who are interested in it and helped them form a syn-group. More than 20 students form different majors join this group. These members gave presentations once a week according to their interests and interacted with others, improving their ability of reading papers and their understanding of synthetic biology. As their advisors, we do our best to help them and guide them. During one year, syn-groupers have learn synthetic biology, molecular biology, microbiology and lots of papers, which helped them improved a lot. It is really a good way to promote the spread and inheritance of synthetic biology in our school.
2. Education for children: Comic book all over the world
To popularize synthetic biology in a more interesting way, we put our comic book collaboration request on the website and more than twelve teams contacted us and helped us translate comic book into other languages. Furthermore, they used our comic book to popularize synthetic biology at the local, hoping to let more people in more countries know the comic book. Under the help of other iGEM teams all over the world, now, our comic book has been translated into more our comic book into Chinese, English, French, Estonian, Russian, German, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Greek, Portuguese, Lithuanian and Turkish, totally 13 languages. 16 iGEM teams take our comic book E.coli SPACESHIP to local areas for science education.

TU-Eindhoven,2016,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," asked us about the topic of our project, the worst thing that happened in the lab and what our secret is to get a good team spirit. Curious about the whole interview, you can read it here.
Translation of protocols
iGEM team METU HS Ankara invited us to work with them and other iGEM teams on translating protocols from English into different languages. This way, general protocols like making LB broth, transformation and plasmid isolation will become more easily accessible for people who do not have a great understanding of the English language. These protocols are available at their WIKI .  It was a nice collaboration and we hope we delivered a valuable contribution to their project. Thank you for inviting us for this collaboration!
Collaboration Badges
The iGEM team from Virginia asked us to fill out their survey regarding biocontainment, which we gladly did to help them with their research. For doing this Virginia has send us this collaboration badge as a token of appreciation. Check out the results of the survey on their WIKI . (Try hovering over the badge!)
The iGEM team from Evry made a survey about synthetic biology and asked us to fill this in. Moreover, if we could help them get more people to fill in the survey, we would earn a collaboration badge. And so we did, after asking our friends and families to help them out. Good luck with analysing the survey and we hope to hear the results !

Two-Hybrid System

In order to make a great screening for peptide aptamers you need a well-functioning screening system. Our screening system is the bacterial two-hybrid system, which is based on the reconstitution of the adenylate cyclase and enables detection of protein-protein interaction. Here we validate the function of our bacterial two-hybrid system.
To validate whether our T18 and T25 domain constructs in fact can be used to study protein-protein interactions, we made a control experiment, where the leucine zipper (Zip) region from the GCN4 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein was fused to the T18 and T25 domains (T18-Zip"

Microfluidic Experiments
Here, we fixed the Caenorhabditis elegans in the Immobilization Chip to observe the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms under the fluorescence microscope and saw the neuronal activity successfully, which can confirm that the worms can express our target genes. We also put the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms into the chip, after a few minutes the worms would be inactive, then we can ""wake up"" the worms by the blue light.

Then, we demonstrated that the insertion did not damage the olfactory receptor neuron pairs of the worms by testing their response to diacetyl and 2-nonanone in the Gaussian Plate.

Behavioral Experiments
Here, we confirmed that the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms could sense the blue light by inducing the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms to crawl a cycle on NGM plate. The Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms could follow the blue light spot just like the attract of the food.

However we expected PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes to stimulate more the growth of biofilm, but perhaps this may be just another indicator of the incomplete coating. Surprisingly, PEDOT:Cl tends to allow better formation of biofilms. We realized only after the experiments the need for a control biofilm culture without membrane.
Conductivity with a biofilm is better with gold membranes, although the conductivity of gold membranes themselves isn't the best. This may be explained by the fact, that because of the thinner biofilm formation on gold membranes, the electrical wires touched not only the biofilm, but also the membrane, bypassing the biofilm and leading to imprecise measurements.
Approximate biofilm conductivity is therefore probably wrong for the gold membrane. However, it is interesting to notice that the biofilm conductivity measured for the bare alumina oxyde, PEDOT:Ts-coated one and PEDOT:PSS-coated give more or less the same value, suggesting that with more measurements, adapted equipement and better methods it would be indeed possible to measure the biofilm's conductivity with our PDMS well chips .
Summary
Achievements:
Successfully demonstrated the confinement of bacteria by a membrane filter.
Successfully coated alumina oxide membranes with PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts .
Partially coated alumina oxide membranes with PEDOT:PSS.
Successfully demonstrated the enhanced conductivity induced by the PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts coating.
Successfully enhanced biocompatibilty with PEDOT:Cl coating.
Next steps:
Enhance measurement precision for membrane conductivity with and without biofilm.
Improve PEDOT:PSS coating to form a uniform layer."

a. Introduction
This model was created for describing the relationship between the concentration of the textile dye and the time.
The reaction between enzyme and the substrate can be described by the following diagram:
b. Mathematical Proof
c. Conclusion
Therefore, the relationship between concentration of textile dye and time can be described by the equation:
As shown in the equation, the concentration of textile dye decreases in a natural logarithm relationship when time increases.
In the future developing, experiments need to be done to collect data and make regression for this function. Also, the function can be further developed by using Hill equation and Michaelis-Menten equation to estimate at the situation in which multiple enzymes on one PHA particle react with the substrate.

Let a new collaboration begin!
Sunday, September 21th
After discovering the awesome video of the Edinburgh team on Twitter, we wanted to know more about their project. As it is clear that the three quorum sensing systems we consider are crosstalking, finding a team focused on the development on communication ways between bacteria was really interesting for us. Their topic is metabolic wiring.
We had a Skype meeting with them this week to discuss about possible opportunities of collaboration. Given the stages of our experiments, we decided that a theoretical collaboration would be more plausible. Next step will be to talk about the models and design a set-up that could fit our two projects.

Complexity in town planning and complexity in religion
In the last days Stefanie met an architect and a priest to discuss complexity in their occupational field. Both conversations were highly interesting and at the same very different. It was fascinating and inspiring to once change the point of view and to approach complexity from new positions. For the priest, Josef Fuisz, the struggle of men with complexity might be represented by the following psalm (42.5):
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why so disturbed within me?
Put your hope"

During these past months, we enjoy establishing many interactions with academic labs as well as other iGEM teams.
We deeply believe that iGEM is all about sharing and collaborating with the world, that's why we decided to dedicate a main part of our human practice to scan and analyse all the iGEMs team collaboration within the years... More on our human practice iGEM's collaboration map here .
With iGEMers
Human practice collaborations :
Freiburg - we gave a thorough feedback to Freiburg's team after reviewing their ""Oath for Life"" project . The point we conveyed to them was about the respect of laws and regulations and the fact that they should mention and may be develop a point about international standards since an oath is valid ''if and only if'' everybody respects it worldwide. We also sent them the ΔEnvZ (E. coli) strain. Some of us have signed the SynBio Oath.
Grenoble - We had a concrete exchange with the Grenoble team, with whom we were in constant contact throughout the past months. They lend us a hand on our Human Practice project by sharing with us their thoughts on the issues we were discussing on regular basis and shared the video of the debate about Synthetic Biology they ran to analyze. This was incorporated into own discussions, summary of which can be found in our human practice section, most notably where ethics is concerned. In parallel, we ran and analyzed the experiment they designed as part of their own Human Practice project.

Cyano 2018: 3rd Early Career Research Symposium on Cyanobacteria
One of the major key players in our co-culture is Synechococcus elongatus, a cyanobacterium that provides the other organisms with carbon. Every year a conference on cyanobacteria takes place in Germany where experts meet and discuss recent progress, research and their current projects. Last year it was held at our university in Duesseldorf, which is why our advisors knew of it and advised us to visit the conference this year. We sent the organizers of this symposium an abstract of our project and were actually accepted to present our project in a 20 minute talk.
On the 12th of September two of our members started their trip to Freiburg, a beautiful city in the South of Germany, where the 3rd symposium for cyanobacteria was held for three days. We were greeted with a lot of sun and temperatures up to 80 °F (30 °C), whereas the other members of our team had to freeze at 15 °C in our lab.
Every day a couple of talks were held in addition to a presentation from a keynote speaker. On the first day a team of Serbian scientists presented their research on cyanobacteria in their natural habitat. Slađana Popović even found a new species in a cave in Serbia! Christoph Howe then talked about his idea to use cyanobacterium biofilms for H2 production for biofuels.
Another interesting idea was the one of Moritz Koch. He presented his idea of cyanobacteria as a PHB producer - a carbon friendly bioplastic against the pollution of the sea on the second day. In between poster session and discussions we were able to socialize with other cyanobacteria researchers. The organizers even offered a guided tour to the Münster - a famous church in Freiburg and a hike to the Schlossberg (castle rock) which offered a great view over Freiburg and the surrounding hills. The last day of the conference was the big day for us: We got to present our co-culture project in front of the real experts of cyanobacteria.
After explaining what the iGEM competition is to a lot of the people who hadn’t heard of it, we started detailing our concept around the cyanobacteria in the planned co-culture. After the talk the audience ended up starting a discussion about our strategy. We are very thankful for the mentioned advice and tried to integrate all the input in our work.

Multichromatic control of gene expression in Escherichia coli. Journal of molecular biology. 2011;405(2):315-324. .
In situations where no red light is present, the photoreceptor PCB activates the phytochrome Cph1, thereby promoting kinase activity through the EnvZ kinase, illustrated in figure 1. When the transcription factor OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, expression of genes controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of the PCB by red light, results in a situation, where EnvZ will not be able to phosphorylate the transcription factor OmpR. The lack of phosphorylated OmpR leads to no activation of the OmpR-regulated promoter, thereby preventing gene expression by this promoter.

The pie chart clearly show that almost every participants in the survey do know we are able to regulate multiple gene by synthetic biology techniques.
Interestingly, there is a great percentage of participants thinks that creatures created by synthetic biology is harmful to human. While only 8% of all participants consider it not dangerous.
From the image, we can also observe a similar result that over half of the participants think products of synthetic biology is dangerous to human.
Although the participants think products of synthetic biology is dangerous, they are still willing to use it.

Jun 18: Brainstorming and Researching
Today, I spent the morning catching up on all the brainstorming I missed. In the afternoon, I researched previous iGEM teams on the iGEM archives to see if any teams had already converted the iGEM registry into RDF format. I found a couple teams who had worked with the registry, but none of them converted it to RDF. At the end of the day, we decided to approach the problem differently.
Jun 19: Using Google Custom Search
We examined other ways access data from the Parts Registry and the iGEM registry. First, we looked into using a web crawler. However, we decided to try mining data from Google Custom Search first. We figured out how to use the Google Custom Search results through Visual Studio and have the results display in a data grid. We had a team meeting with Orit in the afternoon to discuss the MoClo Planner and the work we had done so far - she was happy we had figured out how to implement Google Custom Search.
Jun 20: Creating a Web Crawler
As we examined our work from yesterday, we realized that our data grid of the Google Custom Search results could only display 10 results, and those 10 results did not match those that came up online. Again, we had to abandon that approach. We resorted to creating a crawler, using a previous PubMed crawler as a template. Our first job was to customize it to pull data from the Parts Registry.
Jun 21-22: Continuing with the crawler
Nicole and I continued to work on the back-end - we created two files: one to access the data on the Parts Registry and one to grab specific data to put in each part's data sheet. We worked with a few other team members to come up with a comprehensive data sheet template.
Jun 25: Still working on the crawler
Today, we made some more progress on the web crawler - we got RegList to extract data from the Parts Registry. We also used the tentative data sheet template to do some basic coding on RegDataSheet. Nicole and I are getting better at pair programming.
Jun 26: Almost finished with the crawler
We're getting closer to finishing the Parts Registry web crawler. We worked on it all day, and by the end of the day, we were able to have the console print out a tentative ""data sheet,"" complete with the name of the part, its link, its type, and its regulation.

We also need to figure out the arrangement on the 96-well plates.  It will require either reducing the number of strains of yeast tested against each other on a single plate or reducing the number of methionine concentrations.  It appears to be a good idea to do the former first so that we can observe a good sweep of activity across several concentrations.

Introduction
CRISPR/Cas9
Base Editor
Base Editing to Record Stimuli
CUTSCENE
Introduction
In biology, timing is very important. The stable recording of cellular events including the timing, location, and concentration of molecules has the potential to advance our understanding of a cell’s history and how cells respond to stimuli. To obtain a molecular record, however, there must be a method to measure and record the dynamics of a specific stimulus.
Recording of environmental and cellular signals has previously been achieved by manipulating transcription and translation in bacteria. However, analyzing information recorded in this manner cannot be passed on to future generations of cells, and the recording process itself is delicate because many extraneous factors contribute to transcription and translation efficiencies. In contrast, recording information directly into the DNA is a permanent change that can be read even after a cells death.
Previously, recombinases and integrases have enabled scientists to record states directly into the genetic code[1]. Despite these advancements, past systems are limited in that they can only take a “snapshot” of the environment, preventing scientists from understanding event order along with the strength and duration of stimuli.
A cellular recording device that can record the timing of stimuli has many potential applications in environmental sensing to detect pH, light, nutrients, pollutants, and more. It can also serve as a useful tool for researchers in determining pathways and uncovering cellular processes. With this goal in mind, we sought out to design a method of true chronological event recording that can achieve temporal resolution of stimuli using recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
CRISPR/Cas9
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a prokaryotic immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as through from bacteriophages.  CRISPR actually refers to the segments of DNA containing short, repetitive base sequences in a palindromic repeat. What most people think of as CRISPR is actually the CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) protein. This protein is what scientists have used to revolutionize the field of gene editing.
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has two components: a guide RNA (gRNA) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). The gRNA is a short single-stranded RNA sequence approximately 100 base pairs long. It is composed of two parts the crRNA and the tracrRNA. The tracerRNA is the portion of the sequence that interacts with the CRISPR complex. The crRNA is the "

Moreover, the reference strain nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA::TtrpC::argB (without the lacZ gene) was also inoculated on the plates. The PgpdA 0.5kb promoter on both plates appeared to endorse the strongest expression. When comparing the intensities of the two transformants with the DMKP-P6 promoter it is clear that the expression of lacZ is most similar to the expression with PgpdA 1.0kb. The same observation was made for the PalcA-2 promoter, however the expression of the lacZ gene in the PalcA transform ants seam to differ a bit, since the colour intensity for PalcA-1 is the lower than for PalcA-2. Thus, the qualitative analysis indicates that both promoters DMKP-P6 and PalcA are of medium strength. This is in accordance with previous data for the DMKP-P6 promoter (not published), but PalcA is known to be a strong promoter and we would have expected to see the same colour intensity of the PalcA transformants as we did for the nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA 0.5kb::lacZ::TtrpC::argB strain. A reason for this could be a sub-optimalt level of the inducers ethanol and threonine in the X-gal plates.
Quantitative analysis
The level of protein production was examined by performing a β-galactosidase assay. First, conidia from a three-point inoculation were grown in minimal media in shake flasks for 48 hours with the appropriate supplements. For each strain, two individual transformants were used, thus providing biological replicates.
Filamentous fungi have a tendency to growth in pellets, when circumstances are not optimal. Growth in pellets was observed for all the suspensions, but for the strains with the PalcA promoter it was more pronounced, most likely due to the different growth medium. Then proteins were extracted from the cultures and used for the β-galactosidase assay and Bradford assay (described below). All measurements were performed in triplicates.
It can be very difficult to measure the optical density of fungi, because they grow in complex structures, are heavy and not single celled like bacteria. Therefore the OD measurement that is usually performed when conducting the β-galact"

The BostonU iGEM Team has sent in three BioBricks for evaluation. The first, BBa_K2805002, is mRuby reporter backed by a C120op-based promoter site that is activated by LOV2, a blue light inducible transcription factor. Our second, BBa_K2805003, is the plasmid that codes for the LOV2 protein. When this protein is exposed to blue light, the helix turn helix DNA binding domains become exposed due to a conformational change, which allows the protein to interact with a promoter site. BBa_K2805004 is a composite part with both BBa_K2805002 and BBa_K2805003. A cell expressing both of these genes exposed to light between 450-490 nm will produce red fluorescent proteins.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," A further set of interactions with medical doctors, experts on infectious diseases and others helped us to get a clear overview of the problem at hand. This helped us tremendously in the product design process . It was extremely motivating to experience the enthusiasm of medical doctors when we told them about our project. This inspired us to work even harder! These experts also had interesting advice for improvements on our design. As a result of the stakeholder and expert interactions described above, we took several decisions and made adaptations. Summarized:
The choice for dextran as our hydrogel of choice was confirmed by a discussion with Prof. Patricia Dankers.
Input from RIVM experts, Dutch biotechnologists, dr. Sandra Hofmann, and an anonymous dermatologist made us decide on wound healing as our field of application. This decision was further informed by a discussion with ethicist Dr. Lily Frank, during which we realized that a product for our own country is preferred over one aimed at developing countries considering a fair distribution of risks.
We researched the chemical safety of our hydrogel and its synthesis after advice from Lori Goff and risk assessment expert Cécile van der Vlugt. We demonstrated the chemical safety of the final product and proposed some adaptations to improve the future safety of the synthesis.
Thanks to a visit to Plasmacure, we decided to research the requirements for a patch against burn wounds and against diabetic wounds. This resulted in visits to the Maasstad Hospital (burn wound center), Expertise Center Wound Care, and in calls with a patient suffering from chronic wounds and an expert on diabetic wounds and infectious diseases. We learned that besides S. aureus, Streptococci and P. aeruginosa would be our main targets for diabetic wounds and burn wounds, respectively. We designed an additional BioBrick (pyocin S5) to target P. aeruginosa and we selected an existing BioBrick to inhibit Streptococci.
Several stakeholders stressed the importance of safety. Therefore, we designed a kill switch  as an additional safety level, based on advice from Prof. Jan van Hest.
The doctors in the Maasstad Hospital and from the VUmc made us realize that a sensing mechanism to regulate our secretion system would be a great asset. We subsequently designed one .
Wound healing professionals emphasized user-friendliness as a design requirement for the plaster. We integrated this wish in the future scenario of our plaster , with a freeze-dryable, sterilely packed plaster ready for use. We will make sure the plaster can stay on the wound for a few days to limit patient suffering,"

Considering the urate concentration                     in the gut (about 100uM) and E. coli Nissle 1917 expression ability, we chose J23100 for YgfU and pucL                     expression, J23113 for 4.1.1.97 expression. (See modeling and measurement for details)
We constructed 16 parts for our pathway evaluation.
Table 3 The parts related to urate metabolic pathway submitted.
BBa_K2334001-BBa_K2334004 are generators of the enzymes and transporter we planned to use. The strongest Anderson’s Promoter                     J23100 is used in these parts to test if the proteins are expressed. Parts were transformed into E. coli BL21 for expression. We detected our target protein by SDS-PAGE.
It’s obvious that PucL, PucM, 4.1.1.97 were expressed successfully. However, the membrane protein YgfU wasn’t detected in                     the lysate precipitation after centrifugation. As an application-targeting project, we didn’t continue                     to verify the expression of the protein by Western Blotting or qPCR detection. We tested its function                     by adding this gene directly into the pathway to see if it can help the pathway function, which will                     be discussed later.

To test the function of the metabolic enzymes we expressed (pucL, pucM, 4.1.1.97), we used the crude bacteria extraction                     (expressed in
E. coli BL21) to test directly. Before we started to react, the total protein quantity                     of each sample was made the same. 100ul reaction extraction was added into 900ul PBS with urate (PH=8.0).                     HPLC was performed after reaction for 2h and heat for 10min. The components of reaction extraction are                     described in the table with brackets. (See protocols for more details). The result shows that, pucM and                     4.1.1.97 didn’t help much in the pathway in this experiment, which is hard to explain because it’s not                     consistent with the experiment we would describe later (Table 4) .

This scheme illustrates handling WatsOn when testing the 2D biosensor chip for a fluorescent signal.
Hardware
Hardware components
From top left to bottom right: Arduino, Peltier element, Raspberry Pi, relay, cables, MOSFET, temperature display, camera, LEDs and resistors.
Our hardware consists of the casing and the electronical components. The casing which can be seen in the first section was build from laser cutted acrylic glass.
The electronic circuit is a combination of the components displayed in the image above. We combined the Raspberry Pi - a small single-board computer running a Linux operating system - and an Arduino board which is a programmable microcontroller. The Arduino operates the excitation LEDs and a Peltier heater for incubation. For taking images of the sensor chips we used the Raspberry Pi camera module which is directly connected to the board.
WatsOn is designed such that it can be easily copied. Our work heavily emphasizes the Open Source concept. Therefore a detailed description of all components and the wiring can be found in the Engineering section of our Notebook .

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#SmallPhage#Cholera - Detection#Period4#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," As part of the project, I need to attend a science seminar. Tomorrow I’ll attend the seminar by John Roth on something to do with molecular biology, then write a one-paragraph summary of HOW the presentation was done, the showsmanship of the presentation. On the day of our presentation we need to explain the background of what we have done, then go into our methods and results, then give our conclusions. Today we followed the mini-prep/Alkaline lysis procedure to purify plasmids from our overnight samples. We followed the step-by step protocol given in the kit we used. We chose to use 1 mL of our E.Coli overnight solution in our samples ... and at the end, our plasmid concentrations were low (24 ng/microL and 16ng/microL, respectively). We used the spectrophotometer in Dr. Grose’s lab to determine the concentrations of our plasmids. So, in the future, we ought to a) include Dr. Grose as we follow the protocol to ensure we are doing things correctly, and b) probably use more of the E.Coli sample to get more plasmids and hopefully a higher concentration.
- KP April Today we purified the plasmids and got them ready to be sequenced. We used Dr. Grose’s spectrophotometer. We learned how to analyze the graph in order to know if we just have DNA or if there is something else in our mixture after the purification process. The bump of our graph was right over 260, so we know that we successfully purified our plasmids! The only object of concern, is the fact that we had a very low concentration of plasmids. The instructions in the kit advised 1-3 mL of E. coli potion for high copy DNA. We used 1 mL, so next time we will try 2-3 mL to see if we can get a higher concentration. We are unsure if we did something wrong, if there is something wrong with the kit, or if we just need to use more of the E. coli overnight potion. I need to become more familiar with the sequence of our plasmid, and we need to find out why our E.coli doesn’t glow. When I understand the plasmid sequence, hopefully we can know what is missing or defective in our E. coli that keeps it from glowing.

Polyacrylamide gel on SOD
I ran a polyacrylamide gel on SOD that I have tried to get pure.
Ladder: PageRuler Unst. Protein Ladder Fermentas
Arragement on gel:
I had a Coomassie blue staning and destaining on the gel.
Protein concentration
I measured the protein conc on the samples: unbound, wash 1-3, elute 1-4 and not pure to check if I had any proteins. I had to test this since the gel shows that I don't have any proteins, even not much in the unbound lane, which should have a lot of bands. It could also be that my samples that I loaded onto the gel was very diluted since I had fractions consisting of 10 ml solution. This could give me an indication wheter I need to concentrate my fractions with a Millipore centrifugation.
I measured the concentrations using a BSA-method.
I got a standard curve from another student (Annika) in the lab I work in.
The standard curve was obtained by following this:
I measured the conc by following these instructions:
I got these absorbance values for each well I loaded:
Samples from top to bottom: unbound, wash 1-3, elute 1-4.
From the standard curve I can calculate the protein concentration:
A = 0.3617 * C + 0.0778
C = (A-0.0778)/0.3617
However I realized that the blank I used did not have any imidazole added, this is therefore not a good control for the elute samples since they contain a high amount of imidazole.
The imidazole molecule contains structures that can absorbe light and therefore the value of the elute samples might only indicate the imidazole and not the protein conc in the sample.

ProtoCat 3.0 - Project Design
Overview
The design of ProtoCat this year maintains the same basic structure as last year's version but with a more dynamic underlying structure to support our new features. Therefore, in addition to the protocol and user tables, we have added many more (protocol steps, reagents, user info, instances of reagents, categories, comments, and ratings). Our software uses Django to combine all of this stored information and then return it to the user through the templating engine.
Frontend
For the frontend, our software uses the JavaScript library jQuery to manipulate the webpage to make it more dynamic. To make the HTML layout dynamic to the size of the user page, we use Bootstrap, which has the added benefit of cleaning up the design of our webpages.
Backend
On the backend, we used the Django framework and MySQL (SQLite on development computers) to respond to web requests and store the information. The reason we use Django is that it is very simple to do the basic features required of a website, such as authentication and storing to any major database software. It also has a built-in templating engine for sending the data we have stored to the user."

Away from the bench, policy and practices are making further progress. A member of our team is spending the week visiting a UTI clinic in London. This will allow us to conduct interviews with researchers and patients and to gather more feedback on our project. We have also been publicising our project on various media, with responses from, among others, Guardian science and the Wellcome Trust. Over the next few weeks up to wiki freeze, our team will finish characterisation, and complete our wiki. We will also be preparing our poster and presentation ready for Boston.
Until tomorrow...
WHAT'S UP? 06/08/15
Time is moving fast and the jamboree is drawing closer, we are currently 7 weeks into the project and our story is beginning to take shape. In the wet lab, we have now completed the cloning and preparatory work, with several biobricks ready to be sent; some unique and others improved upon. Characterisation and data collection are now our main focus, which means use of a new range of techniques. Members of the team have been getting to grips with toxicity assays to determine whether our products are harmful to the bacteria. Others have been working on fluorescence microscopy which allows us to detect the level of expression. Our next step will be to carry out secretion experiments and test our products on a target biofilm.
Alongside the wet lab, significant experimental modelling has been carried out, with members of our team modelling, amongst other things, the gene expression of our secretion systems as well as the rate of diffusion of our secreted products. This represents an important companion to our wet lab work and will inform later experiments.
Policy and practice is the other main area of focus; following an interview with medical professionals, we have begun to consider the importance of fungi in the urinary tract. By contacting other experts, we have begun to formulate a strategy to target specific fungi, which will mean that our method is a more complete solution to UTIs. Science outreach is also a key element of our project. Currently, members of the team are taking part in a summer school in Oxford to promote synthetic biology to prospective applicants. We will also be raising awareness of antibiotic resistance and targeted solutions. Later in the summer, other members of the team will be giving a similar talk to high school pupils of a nearby school. As a team, we will also be taking part in the UK iGEM meet up taking place later in the month at UCL. This will be"
Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", while a previous digest of pC13P was used. Subsequently, pC13E, pC13Z, and pCg13S were column purified and the plasmids left to ligate overnight. Tried to redo cloning of pC13AU and pAK13AO because pC13AK was digested with the wrong enzymes yesterday, but failed once again. Finally, pC13I was cloned and pC13BD and pC13Z were submitted for sequencing.
Ran a gel of the Q5 PCR of the pCg13Y and pC13BD. One sample of pC13BD looked good, so it was sent in for sequencing. Isolating G. lucidum's DNA didn't work. Will try flash freezing the cells with liquid nitrogen next time.

After growing up more pC13AK, attempted site directed mutagenesis to get rid of the PstI internal cut site in pCh13V. After running a gel against an unmutated control, found that GC worked while non-GC didn't. Afterwards, both were digested with DpnI and column purified. Attempted to clone pC13I. Also transformed ALL of the constructs, including: pC13AK, pK13AL, pA13AM, pCp13Y + pAK13AD, pAK13AC, pAK13AO, pCg13Y, pC13AY, pC13AU, pC13AV, pC13AT, pC13AQ, pC13AF, pC13I(crtE in psB1C3), and pCH13V GC with PstI mutation.
We tried the site directed mutagenesis of pCh13V to remove the Pst1 internal cut site. Looking at the gel, it looks like the site directed mutagenesis worked! In addition, we cloned crtE into pSB1C3 and performed a ton of transformations!

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," should the bacteria express DNase or cytotoxic genes to kill themselves. So, we went through the registry, found that Peking iGEM2017 characterized several integrases, which can be used as an initiator in our project.
In order to eliminate leakage in the expression of the cytotoxic gene, integrase is employed in the genetic circuit of the regulator. The promoter upstream the executor ccdB colicin E2 is reversed so that no suicide gene is transcribed before the temperature reaches 36 degrees Celsius. Reaching temperature turns on the temperature-sensitive promoter upstream serine integrase that consequently flips over the promoter upstream suicide genes and initiates transcription and cell death.
So the final circuit will be  a NOR gate
4 Cold-Lux-Repressible
Since we target to modify bacteria used in the fermentation industry, which primarily are used for material synthesis and production, our sequence inserts should occupy as limited resources in bacteria as possible to avoid significant expression burden. In order to reduce this expression stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking-S, 2011) and the “Cold Box” in 5’UTR region of CspA (Ionis Paris, 2017). With only one transcriptional regulator, less energy will be consumed, which is beneficial for cell resource distribution.
Therapeutic Bacteria
In iGEM, bacteria for human are popular, almost a thousand pages in all the wiki pages mentioned therapeutic bacteria therapeutic bacteria such as diagnostic bacteria and drug delivery bacteria. However, project for drug delivery bacteria, drugs were released by the lysis of bacteria, so bacteria are destroyed, but naked recombinant DNA will enter the human body, which may be taken up by the human microbiome.
We designed a set of devices, which can carry out real-time tracking of the bacteria, drug release and genome degradation, all in one host bacteria.
1. Tracking and locating of microorganisms in their host organism has always been a big challenge, previous methods like an optical reporter and radioactive reporter cannot be quickly or accurately track and locate it(Bourdeau et al.). From a set of research, we found that gas vesicle could act as a non-invasive reporter due to its unique acoustic characteristic.
Gas Vesicle is an organelle found in cyanobacteria, it acts as a buoyancy regulator by permitting air in and out of the vesicle, to send the bacteria to the optimum depth with sufficient oxygen needed. Several teams had tried to build a floating bacteria like OUC-China.
By using gas vesicle, we can carry out non"

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," hand what hydroponic setups look like and how we could develop our own. With her advice, we decided to obtain greenhouse space to try our hydroponic system and learned about some of the variables, such as light exposure and nutrients, that would make the biggest differences in our cultivation.
Growers
Overview
Growers are at the backbone of OxyPonics since our goal is to have them incorporate our platform in their greenhouses. So we interviewed a lot of them - over 30 total. We talked, and we listened to what they had to tell us, instead of trying to steer the conversations to oxidative stress specifically. The feedback helped us authentically realize what farmers are looking for to improve their farms.  This helped us understand what the problems we should be addressing are - a critical step to the design thinking process. Some of the most valuable exchanges are detailed in this section.
Key Takeaways
Many farmers are working towards consistent crop yields and larger, tastier plants by moving towards automation. Our OxyPonics system was developed to help growers like the ones we talked to survey their crops more efficiently.
Most farmers are looking to increase margins since hydroponic farming is typically much more expensive than traditional farming, and has many costly requirements for operation and upkeep. As a result, many hydroponic farms have failed within a few years of starting.
Hydroponic farmers currently work with the variables of light, atmospheric pressure, humidity, pest control, microbes, temperature, pH, and nutrient levels. Hydroponics requires a controlled environment.
Oxidative stress is a variable largely untapped by current growers. Considering the background gained from literature and researchers, we believe monitoring and maintaining certain levels of oxidative stress could increase plant growth. There is a need for a product like OxyPonics.

Omega Gardens
Omega Gardens is a small hydroponics set-up focused on turning consumers into producers. Ted Marchildon, the owner, has a rotary greenhouse, which captures and spreads artificially added light to allow plant growth using only 3-4 watts. We hoped to gain insight on what makes his small scale farm work in an economic sector based on produce numbers.  Omega Gardens is fleshing out an idea called Farmdominiums, which would be much like modern-day sharecropping where you buy land and pay people to grow the crops for you.  They are working to increase the atmospheric pressure in their greenhouses to increase crop growth. We learned that Omega Gardens deals with bugs and humidity problems.

Hi! After doing the bachelor Life Science & Technology and being board member of the study association for one year I'm currently doing the master Life Science & Technology. I'm the science manager of this year's team. For me iGEM is a nice practical application of my master and also a good way to learn more about other subjects like policy & practice, fundraising and design.

After my Bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Basel (CH), I was looking for a new challenge which I found in the Life Science & Technology Master and the iGEM competition. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to drive innovation towards greater sustainability in the chemical industry. My role is the scientific specification of our construct and hardware requirements for it to be put into practice. During my free time I fence saber on national level and I recently participated as a dancer in a theater production.

We also found an online written tutorial for Autodesk for Maya which is so far the best teaching resource for Maya. It explores the functions through practical step-by-step examples. It also includes a tutorial on Dynamics and a variety of plug-ins such as nParticle which might be relevant for our project. It is a relatively long document so it will take at least a week to go through it, but it is extremely useful for utilization of advanced with Maya functions. This week we also arranged regular meeting with Dr. Nygren which will take place every Thursday morning so we can discuss the progress of the engineering and modelling team and receive his valuable feedback. We also signed up for Matlab workshops which will take place on Wednesday, June 18th.  Next week we are also planning on contacting Cesar from Autodesk to further discuss Maya applications and software, and potential skype meetings in the future.
Week 7: June 16th - June 20th
This week consisted of continuation of looking into Matlab applications and data analysis as well as into what materials we will need to purchase to begin modelling with the Arduino Uno microcontroller.  On the 18th we attended a Matlab workshop and information session that was focused on proper data analysis and representation.  Additionally we have begun weekly engineering meetings focused on quantitative modelling and the state of our prototyping.   We have begun to look into how we can use quantitative analysis for modelling purposes.  We have focused on how to optimize the device and its respective materials, dimensions, and components.  We have also looked into how to use this data and analysis to reevaluate and make changes to our prototype device.  At our meeting with Dr. Nygren we further discussed the potential to use technology such as Bluetooth to add onto the device in which the results could be easily read or documented on a smartphone or computer to compliment the patients file.  Although this aspect of the design would not be designed for rural areas in the developing world, there is potential of the modular device to have a worldwide impact in locations with more resources.
The proposed reporter for our system is a fluorescent protein such as Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Another option for the reporter is lacZ. Using a light sensor, and potentially a filter to ensure we are not detecting ambient light, we will detect the presence of light and convert it to a voltage that the Arduino Uno can detect and display a result.  This will most likely be designed as a closed environment in order to eliminate other sources of light that could potentially trigger the sensor.  The concept"

The article indicates purification protocol suggested and been used for several MerR family in general. It has been suggested to be used for ZntR (Zn(II) homologue in E.coli), CueR (Cu(II) homologue in E.coli) which belong to the MerR family and GolS itself (underneath)
Protocols listed for ZntR:
""ZntR gene was cloned from the E. coli chromosome using the primers ZntR N-terminal (59-CTA GTG GAG TAC ATA TGT ATC GCA TTG G-39) and ZntR C-terminal (59-GTA ATC CTG CGG ATC CAA AAA ATC AAC AAC C-39). The 461-bp PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET11c (Novagen) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting overexpression plasmid (pET11cZntR) was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The cells were grown in 9 liters of Luria Bertani broth with shaking at 37 °C and induced with 400 mM IPTG at A600 5 0.6. The cells were harvested by centrifugation 2.5 h after IPTG induction and then stored at -80 °C. The pelleted cells were frozen and thawed three times (45) and then resuspended in 250 ml of Tris buffer A (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein in the supernatant was precipitated with 45% (NH4)2SO4. The precipitated protein was then resuspended"

SWEETNESS AND US
Sweetness, a pleasurable taste associates with happiness and satisfaction.
For most animals including human, it seems innate to be addicted to sugars and some other sweeties.
When we were just babies in the warm embrace of moms, breast milk came firstly as a gift containing galactose which also survived us.
In the Victorian era, some British people ate excessive sweet food thus their tooth were decayed, which was regarded as a symbol of high status in society etcetera.
In some tribes nowadays, people still managed to get honey under the risk of being stung.
As a matter of fact, modern science has demonstrated that our love to sweetness is due to our genes.
Our brain will release serotonin when we take sugar, which makes us feel delightful.
WELL WHY?
Sugar is essential nutrient for everyone.
However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), having excessive sugar is even more harmful than smoking.
Having excessive sugar may not only cause obesity, but also trigger diseases, such as diabetes and gout.
We need to satisfy our brain with sweet things, nevertheless, metabolizable sugar with enough sweetness usually has high calories at the same time.
Therefore, the demand for seeking sweeteners containing both high sweetness and low calories is quite urgent.
To detect sweetness of substances and find new ideal sweeteners, people have done a lot.
At the very beginning, saccharometer was used to physically measure the refraction simplicity, but it is not accurate and can only work on the carbohydrate.
Then some people were hired and trained as professional tasters to tell the sweetness of each particular sugar. But it’s really costly and time consuming.
Although there are several other current methods to test how sweet the sugars are, there remains limitations from labs to society.
Thus, it is really urge for us to create a new convenient and effective way to test the sweetness and find more available sweeteners.
With the development of technology, artificial sweeteners are becoming better choices. The production technology of artificial sweeteners is becoming more mature. Meanwhile ,as a food additive, artificial sweeteners are also more widely used in the field of food production."
USTC-Software,2016,Team:USTC-Software#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," structure, which is needed to purify the protein. This steps can be really time-consuming, because if you make some mistakes in designing amino acid sequences, months of experiments can be of no use.
Users can design amino acid sequence from the provided structure. Just input the number of result files and tag name (optional), then upload the .pdb file(which represents the structure) and click UPLOAD AND CALCULATE. Then the server will generate amino acid sequence file you want. Just follow the steps below, then your file can be evaluated. And there is one thing you should pay attention to: Every time you upload pdb file, the server will clean old .pdb file and overwrite old results.
While server is calculating, you can click GET STATUS to know whether processes are done. If your file is still being processed, you will get a dialog below:
If files are generated successfully, the 'GET STATUS' button will change to 'DOWNLOAD FILE', then you can get your result as a .zip file.
There is possibility that something go wrong during designing, so if any error happens, you will get a dialog about error information.

Improving on Neptune
The control syringe system we implemented in TERRA was repurposed from the 2016 Boston University iGEM Hardware Team, Neptune. Neptune designed an end to end design suite for continuous flow microfluidics, which helped automate the microfluidic design process. The team coupled this design software with DIY syringe pumps hardware, which are responsible for inputting flow into the microfluidic chip, to increase the accessibility of microfluidics due to the high cost of retail syringe pumps.
Our team decided to repurpose Neptune’s syringe pump hardware to develop our control syringe system because they already went through the process of designing and validating a DIY platform for automating syringe movement. In addition, since the syringe pumps were used to gradually push a syringe to dispense at a constant rate, they were able to demonstrate a high degree of controllability with their hardware platform. This gave us the confidence to reuse their hardware platform for our control syringe system in TERRA.
However, because of the difference in application between Neptune and TERRA, we needed to update the software operating the syringes. TERRA’s control syringe system is responsible for actuating control valves on the TERRA Adapter as opposed to inputting constant flow. In addition, the control syringes needed to work alongside the other components of TERRA, particularly the XY Plane and UI. To accomplish this the control syringes system needed to be able to sustain on/off states based on the output selection system on the TERRA Adapter in order to dispense the proper product into the vessel. In order to execute this, we programmed the servo motors for the syringes to move and hold certain positions based on the experiment protocol given by the user. These positions would last for a certain duration, depending on how long an output is selected for. Then, based on the experiment protocol from the UI, these on/off states were coupled with specific outputs on the microfluidic chip to control which when they would be dispensed and how much. These improvements to the software enables us to reuse the hardware for a wider range of"
Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," The cells were resuspended with 5 mL of 1% PBS (with 0.15 mM NaCl) and transferred into test tubes. The cells in the test tubes were agitated and 100 µL was taken ~0.5 cm from the surface every 10 min for the first 60 min; then every hour for the next 3 hours and again at 18 hours and 18.5 hours. The samples were also subjected to OD590 measurements using a microplate and the SoftMax Pro Software.
Results
Figure 2.E. coli DH5a cells containing BBa_K542009. Cultures were first agitated and then sedimentation rates were monitored. (a) Initial reading at the beginning of the experiment for the induced and uninduced. (b) Initial reading for the blank and 30 min after agitation for the induced and uninduced. (c) 3.5 hr after agitation for the blank and 4 hr after agitation for the induced and uninduced. (d) 17.5 hr after agitation for the blank and 18 hr after agitation for the induced and uninduced.
Figure 3. Microplate readings at 590nm for samples taken from the sedimentation assay using SoftMax Pro Software. Increase in absorbance at 150 min may have been due to the aggregation of the cells on the microplate prior to taking the measurement.
Conclusion
There is a significant difference between the aggregation of cells with the Antigen43 construct (BBa_K542009) and the cells without the construct after 18 hours. The pLacI promoter is known to be leaky. This was illustrated by the similarity between the uninduced and induced samples (Figures 2 and 3). These experiments support the conclusion that BBa_K542009 works as expected and the induced cells exhibit sedimentation.

Datasheet for Part BBa_I716462 in E. coli strain DH5alpha.
Introduction
Part I716462 was previously characterized by the UC Berkeley iGEM team in 2007. The purpose of this part was to prevent unwanted cell proliferation by engineering a genetic self-destruct mechanism into bacteria that upon induction would express a genetic material-degrading toxin, the endonuclease BamHI that would kill cells yet preserve their physical integrity. BamHI has a restriction cut site of G'GATCC, generating sticky ends (1). The restriction endonuclease was placed under the control of the arabinose- inducible promoter, pBAD. In 200"

Catalog for regulatory RNAs
Over the years, the number of regulatory RNAs in Part Registry has steadily increased over time and many has been made available to end users. Based on different mode actions and natures of regulatory RNAs, they can be grouped into different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing regulatory RNAs. Some of them are grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them.Over the years, the number of non-coding RNAs in Part Registry has increased steadily over time and many have been made available to end users. More than 400 entries in the Part Registry are related to RNA devices (updated 25-12-2014). Based on different mode of actions and natures of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), they can be grouped under different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing ncRNAs. Some of them are simply grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them. For example, BBa_K145013, which is a part for antisense LuxI, could be used to add an extra layer of control to the widely utilized quorum sensing Lux pathway but it has not been extensively reused. It is likely that Part Registry users are unaware of its existence because there has yet to be an information hub for ncRNA.
We would like to solve this problem by designing a list of category tags as well as a guideline, so that automated display of non-coding RNAs by the
function can be facilitated. By doing so, we hope that we can assist other users to find and use those parts efficiently. Ultimately we want to facilitate the implementation"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp_-_-_TEXT.html," on humans. We tried to incorporate a foreign inducible metabolic process into human liver cells; therefore we had to consider how to eliminate possible complications that our project could cause. We approached this aspect by meeting two prominent scientists in Hong Kong society who are currently actively participating in scientific and medical research. They helped us by evaluating our project from their professional point of view and to think about the possible concerns that can arise if we try to transform our project into a product. With these experts we discussed three main topics: application of our project, biosafety and bioethical issues concerning our project, synthetic biology in Hong Kong and in Asia in general.
Bioethics and Biosafety
We went beyond fulfilling the minimum iGEM competition requirement of filling in the safety sheet. Because applying foreign DNA or cells into humans is currently not a widely employed technology, we thought it would be necessary to research these techniques. During the interviews with the experts, gene therapy was mentioned and we did some research to write an informative article about it. In the article, we provided some background information on gene therapy, discussed the bioethical and biosafety issues concerning gene therapy, and thought about if gene therapy could be used as an application of our project.
Provision of Information
The concept of synthetic biology is not prevalent in Hong Kong and in Asia. We thought it was imperative to provide information to the public. We tried to achieve this by making short and informative but hopefully interesting videos and an interactive blog that introduce synthetic biology and our project. We have included translations of our work in Cantonese so that the public in Hong Kong can easily digest the information.  While we were gathering information about synthetic biology.
We observed inadequacy in the amount of information of synthetic biology in Asia. To amend this problem, we have researched information about synthetic biology in different languages such as English, Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Indonesian. We have complied information on synthetic biology in four East Asian countries/regions and one South East Asian country. We believe that this novel approach will help the reader have a more holistic and unbiased view of synthetic biology all around the world.
We also had time to share our experience and thoughts to various people through presentations. We already had semi-formal meetings with the SUSTC and CUHK iGEM teams, during which the teams presented their projects to each other. However we have also prepared delivery of three more presentations, two for HKUST students, and one for the general public in Hong Kong.

Biofilm
Bacteria are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilm. In biofilm, cells grow in multicellular aggregates that are encased in an extracellular matrix produced by the bacteria themselves (1). The extracellular polymeric matrix is an important structural component of biofilm and it plays an important role in the attachment and colonization of microorganisms on a surface also acts as a diffusion barrier to small molecules. Related to this, in biofilm the diffusion of nutrients, vitamins, or cofactors is slower resulting in a bacterial community in which some of cells are metabolically inactive. (2). Bacillus subtilis forms biofilm whose constituent cells are held together by the extracellular matrix and one of the main matrix competent is the protein TasA which is a form of amyloid fibers and binds cells together in the biofilm (3). The matrix, which is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and water, enables the biofilm to attach to the surfaces. One of the most important functions of the matrix is to protect the bacteria from various stress and factors such as UV radiation, extreme pH values, osmotic pressure, dehydration and antibiotics(4).

QUORUM SENSING
In the biofilm formation bacteria can talk each other via some signal mechanisms. And those mechanisms are called “quorum sensing”.
Quorum or diffusion responses in bacteria are mediated by secreted signalling molecules that accumulate extracellularly as cultures grow to high density. The regulatory response to these signalling molecules can result in dramatic changes in gene expression. In Bacillus subtilis, a quorum response is mediated by a secreted 10-amino-acid modified peptide (ComX pheromone) that activates a receptor histidine kinase (ComP) that activates"
Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Latex_-_-_TEXT.html,"ected with both plasmids, a supplement of magnesium sulfate, IPTG, and glucose is necessary to induce protein expression, activity, and cis-polyisoprene polymer synthesis.  IPTG is necessary for expression of both the DXS plasmid and latex operon proteins; magnesium sulfate is needed as a cofactor for HRT1 and HRT2 to be enzymatically active; and glucose is needed as a substrate (Figure 5,6).
To induce latex production, IPTG (400 mM), glucose (500 mM), and MgSO4(500 mM) were added directly to 350 ml liquid cultures growing at 37˚C at 100 uL per 1 mL. After being kept overnight, a second round of IPTG, glucose, and MgSO4 was added. Latex extraction was performed on 350 ml of our cells containing the plasmids for the Latex Operon and DXS Synthase. Cells were spun down and fractionated into the cell pellet and LB media. In order to lyse the cells, chloroform was used—however because chloroform is a nonpolar solvent, it dissolves polyisoprenes in solution.[25, 26]  After the cells were agitated and lysed with chloroform, the solution was filtered to yield chloroform and its solutes, and methanol was added to precipitate the latex.  The LB fraction was also subject to a similar procedure except the chloroform layer was obtained from the LB fraction by separation of the solvent layers.
Figure 6: DXS synthase accelerates the conversion of pyruvate and G3P to DXP in the endogenous MEP/DOXP pathway.  Downstream, the activated HRT1 and HRT2 complexes can extend IPP (left) into polyisoprene (right) via dephosphorization.
After this procedure, we precipitated 1.5 ml of a rubbery, off-white polymer from the methanol as expected. For a quick characterization test, the polymer was dried and burned, which resulted in a smell of burning rubber and a strong black smoke—typical of rubber fires.  Additionally, our extract (when dried) is highly compressible and elastic.  Further tests with mass spectrometry, acetone characterization, degradation, and physical stress tests will be needed to confirm the composition and validity of our latex.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

b. Gene therapy
Gene therapy holds promise in curing diseases previously thought to be impossible to treat.                                     One of the many challenges it faces is the need to lengthen the gene expression time                                     while avoiding its permanent integration into the host genome. A prime example is the use of gene therapy to temporarily stimulate osteogenesis in stem cells, thereby healing                                     bone defects. To enhance the effect of gene therapy, researchers use SSR to circularize                                     the gene fragments transfected into the cells. As circular DNA is less subject to DNA                                     degradation than linear DNA is, this method allows the gene to be expressed for a longer                                     period of time, enhancing the healing potential of the stem cells. Also, SSR is being                                     investigated to cure HIV, and similar diseases such as T-cell leukemia that are caused                                     by retroviruses.

(1) Lo, S., Li, K., Chang, Y., Hsu, M., Sung, L., Vu, T. A., Hu, Y. (2017)                                     Enhanced critical-size calvarial bone healing by ASCs engineered with Cre/loxP-based                                     hybrid baculovirus. Biomaterial. 124: 1-11

c. Regenerative medicine
The discovery of the formula -- the so-called Yamanaka’s cocktail -- to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has opened up myriad possibilities for regenerative medicine,                                     a branch of research that deals with treating diseases through stimulating organs to                                     heal themselves, or to grow organs and tissues in vitro from sources such as stem cells.                                     However, the process of creating iPSCs involves introducing several potential oncogenes                                     into the somatic cells, causing concerns over its safety in clinical use. Fortunately,                                     these transgenes can be removed efficiently using SSR, and this technique has been widely                                     adopted to treat diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 𝛽-thalassemia.

Discussion
Why were there 2 bands obviously in figure 1？
The two bands were in the lane 3-lane 8, so when the modA was inducted, maybe the modA has been cut, and for the pET-21a sequence, we knew that the his-tag was in the C-terminal, and the His-modA can chelate to the Ni column, so we guessed what the modA was cut was its C-terminal or pET-21a’s T7-tag(for western), what we work next maybe clone a new modA that there were few animo acid lost to see whether there were 2 bands, and we cut or use clone to cut the T7-tag to verify.
Why were there so many bands obviously in figure 2?
We actually did not know why there were few band above to lane 1, maybe the modA were polymers in the 20mM molybdate, the band below may be the modA binding molybdate that made its charge changed and got faster than others, and because we use excessive protein, not all proteins bind to the molybdate. For the binding molybdate, we refer to this [16]fig3

What Are We Doing Here?
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries.       One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation       of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle      vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that       A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by       spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).       These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and       even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and       capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Introduction
In synthetic biology when creating the minimal cell  XXX factors have been identified as essential for normal function of RNAP, both regarding normal elongation but also in terms of normal termination function. (REFFF) of these XXX have been identified to take part in regulatory function. While the rest is core subunits. Of interest for regulation in terms of termination Anti-termination will be highlighted:
NusA:
NusG:
NusE:
NusB:
Due to the construction of the RNAP of many subcomponents and systems, the function of the RNAP can be regulated by only adding or changing one or a few factors. This is the mechanism in the different termination and anti-termination functions described below.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!"

Delft
This year for the first time the University of Florence has taken part in the iGEM competition. The team UniFi, made of thirteen students, proposed an interesting project of science art during the Symposium held in Delft on the 7th and 8th of July. The European iGEM meetup was organized to bring all the european iGEM teams together, have fun, and learn even more about synthetic biology. It was a new experience for the six italian students that represented the team and they couldn’t have missed the opportunity of visiting Delft’s important university center: the Technische Universiteit Delft, one of the most advanced in Europe. Alice, Gabriele, Lorenzo, Martina, Sophie and Valentina spent three days in Delft, a little and really nice town, not so far from Amsterdam. They travelled by plane and were soon greeted by the owner of the hostel, a very nice lady who suggested them some places to visit and where to eat. In the same hostel stayed two other iGEM team from Germany. Italian students recognised them since they were talking about the protein synthesis and aminoacids; their topics sound really unsual, aren’t they?! So they introduced theirselves and started discussing about their projects. Time passed fast by walking around the town: they had lunch in the central market in the biggest square called Stadhuis van Delft and they tasted typical holland fried fish and pancakes, the Pannenkoeken. In the same evening they went for a walk in the calm streets of Delft; as they said, the amtosphere was pleasant and relaxing and colorful lights brightened up the way.
On the second day, at 10 a.m. the symposium started, so the italian students got up early to reach the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering. The only thing they needed along was the team project poster and a lot of curiosity! TU Delft is detached from the city center and it seems to be a town apart where universitary students live. During the symposium three interesting speakers talked about Synthetic Biology and how they implement this in their field. The first speaker was Dr. Cees Dekker, a TU Delf"

HP-Overview
     Human practice is an important part of iGEM. As future scientists, we mainly focused on scientific research which may create new applications and method used in everywhere and everything. Nevertheless, we also have a great responsibility about what and how we provide them.
     As stem cells therapy is unfamiliar for most of the people, we outstretched our project into the discussion of the safety and efficiency of stem cell therapy. So we discussed with lots of fellows and experts in CCiC about our project and the concern of medical treatments. We also introduced the concept and highlights about stem cell therapy to senior high school students and presented our ideas in SYSU-Bio-festival (an important activity in our university) to promote the treatments of stem cells and allow more people to know them. Furthermore, we set up a questionnaire to collect people’s opinions on stem cell therapy.
     During CCiC, iGEMers from different team were also helpful with advice on how we could improve our system. We harvested suggestions for our experiments, poster and presentation.
     For communication with the teams in SYSU, we helped SYSU-Medicine and SYSU-Software with the vital issues during the experiments and they also gave helpful advices to us. We also collaborated with SZU and FAFU.
