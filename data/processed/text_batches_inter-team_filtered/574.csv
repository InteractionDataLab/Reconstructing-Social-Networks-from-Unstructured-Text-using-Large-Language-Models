18th - 22nd June 2012 Exhibition of our project at the ACHEMA
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) had invited the Hessian iGEM teams to the ACHEMA in Frankfurt. The ACHEMA is the largest exhibition on Chemical Engineering, Environmental Protection and Biotechnology and offered the teams a wide range of interested audience during the presentation of their projects. At the booth of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the teams of Darmstadt, Frankfurt und Marburg were able to present their projects. The Darmstadt team could not only inspire the audience with posters, but also with a presentation as well as many flyers for their project. Laymen, scientists and companies could be convinced by the project ""Next Generation Recycling"" of the Technical University of Darmstadt. The contact to the other iGEM teams from Hessia was of course promoted and it was possible to replace the content and progress of the projects. The project offers in the area of environmental protection many approaches, so it was not surprising that the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) was interested in the project. Members of the DBU stayed a long time for intensive discussions at the booth. To conclude, the ACHEMA offered the team an exciting platform on which they could perform a ""reality check"" of their project. The interesting discussions with members of economy and science showed them the deep meaning of their project and point out that the iGEM Team of Darmstadt is on a good path.
28th June 2012 3rd Annual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+
The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) had invited all German iGEM teams to the 3rd Annual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ to participate. The German teams had the opportunity to see each other for the first time. The conference was attended by representatives from academia, industry and other research institutes. The aim of the conference was to generate new interdisciplinary cooperation that give rise to new ways in the field of biotechnology in Germany. The iGEM teams occurred as proponents of new minds and ideas of the future. Representatives of the iGEM team of Darmstadt had to meet economic and scientific questions from the audience about their project. At a panel discussion it became clear that the conscious use of resources and especially the recovery of these in Germany have to play an important role in the"

Repressilator
Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly"

The Team
Nick Goldner
Nicholas is a senior biochemistry and philosophy major. He is currently applying to graduate schools and plans to obtain his doctorate in either biochemistry or molecular biology. In his free time he enjoys hiking, camping slacklineing and working in the lab. His favorite protocol is the DNA ligation and his favorite part is “The One Ring to Secrete Them All” because it means we actually finished the project. Cheesehead Dave’s Are his favorite lab gloves to wear even though they are no longer in production: he has a box of XL’s stashed away. The greatest song ever played was the entire movie “Dune” the 1986 version that started playing during shuffle. Apparently we only had the audio for the entire movie.
Nicholas served the function of team leader and primary lab techniques trainer. He is the founder and camp director of the Synthetic Biology Summer Camp. He is an integral part in the design process, assembly, troubleshooting and characterization of ""The One Ring to Secrete Them All"". He aided writing the security and safety information and,   identified the necessary information for background research regarding human outreach. He also helped to establish a collaboration with MSOE-Milwaukee iGEM team.
Benjamin Tellier
Benjamin Tellier is a senior Biochemistry major with aspirations of becoming a doctor in the future.  He has learned throughout the course of the project to split his time between studying for school and the MCAT, and his time spent working on the project.  Ben, along with Nicholas Goldner, has performed research in Infectious Disease microbiology in the past and thought that the use of his talents for humanitarian purposes would not be ill-placed.  Ben enjoys the simple things in life: protein shakes, power lifting, wrestling, and cinematic adventures.
If you were to ask Ben what his favorite part of working in the lab is he would probably respond that he enjoys differential media assays, the smell of fresh 70% ethanol solutions, and just about any protocol that he can do while listening to Hardstyle"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices#all_-_-_TEXT.html," and Lithuania. The survey contained several questions regarding people’s preferences in the appearance, intake method and frequency of the probiotics. The intention of the survey was to aid the design of a probiotic, which would meet the needs of the potential users.
First of all, it is vital to understand people’s attitude towards this kind of medication. In Lithuania, probiotics are quite commonly used, as more people reported that they have used this kind of treatment, which is twice as many as those who have never used it. Most of the respondents reported that treatment has had a beneficial effect on their health; however, a similar number of respondents indicated, that they did not notice any health changes. Since Lithuanians are quite well acquainted with probiotics, we felt assured that our developed product will be greeted positively by the users.
Speaking of the appearance of probiotics, in Lithuania, people were asked whether they would prefer to use probiotics as a medicine or as a consumable product, for example, yoghurt or cheese. It appeared that more people would take it in the form of a pharmaceutical product rather than in the form of food. Moreover, the majority of people in Lithuania would like to intake tablets or capsules, while in the UK, gel-like beads were among the most chosen options. Since in Lithuania more people would prefer capsules, our project aims at producing exactly this kind of medication.
It is very important that our designed probiotic is appealing to the patients, therefore, it was essential to discover how often people would prefer to use the capsule. We questioned people whether they would prefer to take the pill regularly or not. The most popular answer was ‘once a day’, which is beneficial for us since our designed probiotic is intended to be used regularly.
To conclude, the survey provided us with the thorough understanding of the people’s needs regarding probiotics. It helped us to fulfill our project in the way, which is the most appealing to the potential users and this has always been our primary aim.
Cafe Scientifique discussion cycle
Due to the fact that we are creating a GMO bacteria to treat a disease, we were concerned about society‘s attitude towards GMO and genetic engineering. In order to raise the awareness of recent scientific advances, genetic engineering and synthetic biology on both local and global scales, we organised a cycle of discussions, consisting of 5 public events. The events were concentrated on different topics of the scientific world. We were collaborating with ’Café Scientifique’ project ambassadors in Lithuania - Baltic Institute of Advanced Technology (BPTI), so the discussions took place in two of the city's cafés - ’Green"

When we further observed the growth independence on tryptophan addition, we found our desired positive relationship between tryptophan and growth with tetracycline concentration to be around 84 and 120 ug/mL and in the host carrying plasmid pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS-ori_tetA. The results were shown in Figure. 5. For our bitter pressure part with RBS B0030 and B0032, desired positive relation was very poor. For these system with in vitro tryptophan addition, we could clearly found that in the control group (tetracycline=0mg/L) tryptophan addition showed significant inhibit to cell growth, which significantly reduced the positive function to growth caused by tryptophan addition and following tetA expression. What was more, in vitro tryptophan addition might face kinetics problem. Amino acid was transported into the cell by positive transport mechanism and the concentration of amino acid was quite different in and out of the cell . Our test system might fail due to the poor and similar intracellular tryptophan concentration although quite different extracellular concentration. Although such unexpected things happened, we still obtained weak but clear desired growth property in one certain system with certain tetA expression level. To overcome the problems mentioned before and proved bitter part’s possibility in in vivo evolution, we designed following in vivo system for further characteristics.

We also selected our engineered sweet pressure part RBS library by the following protocol. 48 strains form our library were selected and cultured in m9 medium with 8g/L glucose for overnight. On the next day, seed medium was transferred to fresh M9 medium in 24 well plate with 8g/L glucose or 8g/L maltose as single carbon source, respectively. Initial OD600 was set as 0.16. The growth curve of each strain was recorded and four strains with biggest final OD600 ration between in glucose and maltose M9 medium were selected. The best one was named after sweet pressure part strain 3-4.  After that, we measure the performance of our sweet pressure part strain 3-4 in a tryptophan addition fashion. The colony from"

The results of the experiment with the UV source being only 10 cm from the cuvettes can be seen in Figures 6 and 7 below.
Figure 6: Fluorescence of E. coli + Bac5 plasmid after exposure to UV for various periods of time at 10cm
These results are slightly strange as we are unsure what caused such an increase in fluorescence of the unirradiated control after 20 minutes. It can be seen that the culture irradiated for 60 seconds starts to show increased fluorescence around 10 minutes after UV exposure and this level of fluorescence is maintained for a long period of time afterwards.
The cultures irradiated for less time do not show such a quick increase in fluorescence, nor does the fluorescence reach such high levels, but it is maintained throughout the period of measurement.
Overall, we think that these results are inconclusive as to whether or not the promoter works properly.
Figure 7: Fluorescence of C. freundii + Bac5 plasmid after exposure to UV for various periods of time at 10cm
The C. freundii results suggest that the promoter takes around 20 minutes to activate, as a marked increase in fluorescence can be detected after this time and the level of fluorescence continues to increase for a period of time.
The culture that was irradiated for 60 seconds shows a jump in fluorescence after the irradiation, presumably because the promoter gets hyperactivated due to intense DNA damage. This culture then shows a little increase in fluorescence, after which it starts to decrease, probably due to the cells being unable to cope with the amount of DNA damage and dying.
The culture irradiated for 40 seconds also seems to die towards the end (but the drop in fluorescence could also indicate that the DNA damage had been mostly repaired, as the doubling time for E. coli is ~20 minutes so after two rounds of replication the DNA may have been restored).
The largest increase in fluorescence can be seen with the culture that had been irradiated for 20 seconds. This length of time is apparently more optimal for this experiment as it gives a good activation of the promoter without killing the cells (too much).
This construct seems to show some activity as there is a difference in fluorescence of irradiated and unirradiated cultures in both E. coli and C. freundii but further tests are needed to fully characterise it and to debug our tests.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Policies_-_-_TEXT.html," suggestions. Some of his suggestions include using Oscillate in co-culturing and differential control of complex microbiomes.
Dr. John March, a Professor and Chair of Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University, suggested using Oscillate for co-culturing, as well. He mentioned that Oscillate could work to control ferritin nanoparticles if there was an environment of sustained heat or fluctuations in temperature.
We want to create a product which has the greatest positive effect on the largest number of people. These potential applications suggest we could make an impact through biomedical sciences, biological computers, or microbiology research, among other fields.  With these possibilities in mind, we continue to optimize Oscillate and our frequency-dependent genetic circuit so researchers from many fields might one day use this emerging technology to affect real change in the world.
Intellectual Property
Before moving forward with our project, we must take into consideration the laws and regulations in place that deal with intellectual property. Our product was created using our university’s resources with the input of several team members and professional experts. As a result, concerns regarding the distribution of intellectual property rights must be addressed and clarified.
First, we contacted Dr. Mariagiovanna Baccara, an Associate Professor of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis with research experience in innovation and intellectual property rights. Our interview with Dr. Baccara was a great launching point for further delving into the specific rules governing the distribution of rights among participants in the ideation and execution process. As a preventative measure for intellectual property disputes, Dr. Baccara suggested looking into non-disclosure agreements as a way to protect the ideas of our team as we continue our discussions with experts from relevant fields.
In a separate meeting with Dr. Nicholas Argyres, a faculty professor of the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Argyres brought up the importance of obtaining a patent as a safety measure before heavily promoting our project idea. Though Dr. Argyres acknowledged that the process of actually obtaining a patent is difficult and expensive, he also reasoned that the university may provide a means of funding the process, in which case the patent would belong to the school.
Since our project has yet to go through the entire commercialization process, we felt that it was too early to obtain a patent as mentioned in our conversation with Dr. Argyres. Additionally, the scale of our project was fairly limited, so we decided against the use of non-disclosure agreements. However, there is real potential for our project to eventually reach the stage of commercialization in which these suggestions would play a key"

Curdlan synthase gene CrdS with codon optimization for E. coli : BBa_K1686046
Curdlan is a bacterial polysaccharide (linear (1->3)-β-glucan) that has been of significant recent interest due to its valuable properties and its bioactivity. In fact, Curdlan belongs to the class of biological response modifiers that enhance or restore normal immune defenses. For example, it can have antitumor, anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities (see other properties of Curdlan). In particular, this (1->3)-β-glucan can stimulate plants' immune system. Our project is focused on the production of curdlan for stimulate plant defense system against Downy Mildew.
The molecular genetics of curdlan production have been investigated in Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749. Studies identified three genes (crdA, crdS and crdC) that are essential for curdlan production The crdASC genes occupy a contiguous 4,948 bp region of the genome ( the crdS gene is flanked by the crdA and crdC genes).
The crdS gene (1965 bp) encodes the curdlan synthase (CrdS, 73 kDa) protein. In Agrobacterium, CrdS is an integral inner membrane protein with seven transmembrane (TM) helices, one non-membrane-spanning amphipathic helix and a Nout–Cin disposition. The UDP-Glucose substrate-binding and the catalytic motif for curdlan polymerisation is observed between TM3 and TM4. The process of Curdlan polymerisation mediated by CrdS occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane
For our project, we wanted to produce curdlan by E.coli, so this part has been made with a codon optimization of the natural crdS sequence for E.coli.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Bioproduction_-_-_TEXT.html," information can be crucial for us to investigate a directed mutagenesis on these residues that interact with fructose or the cofactor to improve the activity of the enzyme.
Clostridium cellulolyticum Dpe (UniProt ID B8I944) has its enzymatic activity [5] greatly enhanced in the presence of Mn2+ or Co2+. The bioconversion level of D-psicose is 32 % with a reaction buffer containing 0.5 μM of enzyme and 50 g/L of D-Fructose at 55°C pH 8.0 for 30 minutes. When the enzyme is at 55°C and with a pH of 8.0, it reaches its maximum activity and can produce D-psicose with a concentration of 218 g/L. The equilibrium ratio at 30°C between D-psicose and D-fructose is 32:68 [ref]. Dpe shows a Michaelis Menten constant (KM) of 17.4 ± 0.2 mM for D-psicose and 62.7 ± 1.5 mM for D-fructose. Which means that the enzyme has a better affinity for D-psicose than D-fructose. Moreover, the turnover number (kcat) are equivalent with 3243.5 ± 56.5 min-1 for D-psicose and 3354.5 ± 47.2 min-1 for D-fructose. Therefore, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) values are 62.7 ± 1.5 mM-1min-1 for D-fructose and 186.4 ± 1.9 mM-1min-1 for D-psicose. The conversion rate is better with D-psicose. Finally, the thermostability of Dpe has been measured and the half-life of the enzyme is about 9.5 h at 55°C.
Cloning of a D-Psicose 3-Epimerase in Escherichia coli

Week 1: 6/10/09 - 6/12/09
First official meeting of the summer: finalizing the project details, setting up a tentative schedule.
We spent the first meeting narrowing in on the system we would use for our upcoming projects. After comparing the bacterial light sensing system with that of the modified yeast 2-hybrid system a consensus was reached to attempt the yeast system first. The yeast phytochrome based system seemed more sensitive and the bistable light inducible system would give us an added element of regulation, in that the system could be rapidly reset using IR wavelengths. This would be useful in a ""bio-blackboard"" configuration.
As a backup though, we should be prepared to revert to the bacterial system.
The potential problem for the yeast system is that phycocyanobilin (PCB) needs to be exogenously supplemented. It may need to be extracted from a suitable (algae?) source or the bacterial PCB biosyntheis pathway may need to be cloned into yeast, if possible. Also, if using yeast as a ""sender"" with red-luciferase, the luciferin substrate for luciferase also needs to be added externally. Uptake should occur if the media is made acidic.
David pointed out a more recent intein system that also utilizes the same Phytochrome/PIF3 domains that the modified yeast two-hybrid system uses.
We carefully studies schematics of the various light responsive genetic systems, including an attempt at adding an ""inverter"" component into the

Congress of the strategy process ""biotechnology 2020+""
On the 28th of June, 2012 the third annual congress of the strategy process ""biotechnology 2020+"" took place in Berlin, Café Moskau. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research started the initiative in the year 2010 to promote the next generation of biotechnological processes. The strategy congress was initiated to give experts from different fields the possibility to exchange ideas for new methods or applications concerning Biotechnology. Be it in medicine, the industry or in environmental sectors everybody is searching for new ideas that offer environmentally friendly, more efficient and lower-cost processes and biotechnology has an unknown potential that could eventually answer open questions. During the congress still existing problems and new ideas were discussed in workshops and presented at the end of the day. Nearly 200 researchers from the industry, science and politics gathered for the congress and among them undergraduate students from all over Germany. Why did the students participate and what did they have in common? All of them were members of one of the eleven German iGEM teams.
Thus the “Biotechnology 2020+” did not only serve as an exchange and communication platform for German researchers but also as the first meeting of the German iGEM teams. Each team was represented by at least three team members and presented a poster describing their project. The remaining time was used quite efficient: new ideas supporting Synthetic Biology were gathered, common problems were discussed and most importantly ties were established between the teams, in order to enable future cooperation. One of the main questions of the discussion was: “How can we bring Synthetic Biology closer to the general society?” This question occupied all of them for it is always important to consider how a project could have an impact on people´s life or the environment. Within the framework of their meeting they agreed to conduct a collective “Synthetic Biology Day” on the 25th of August in order to inform the public about Synthetic Biology and help to dispel existing doubts.
After the conference an article was published on ""Biotechnologie.de"" a homepage of the federal ministry of education and science. Click here to be redirected to the article!

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html," E.coli
As explained in the previous section, to simulate the metabolism of a cell using flux balance analysis, the stoichiometric representation of the underlying metabolic network has to be available. As the biochemistry of E.coli has been extensively studied, there also exist comprehensive metabolic reconstructions. Here we used the iAF1260 model [8], which captures 2077 reactions of K-12 MG1655 E.coli corresponding to 1260 genes. Of course, wild type E.coli is not able to produce Delftibactin. Thus the reactions corresponding to the gene products we are trying to introduce into our TOP10 cells were appended to the aforementioned model.
Figure 4: The production envelope: The line in dark gray represents the Pareto Frontier for the delftibactin production rate. It shows the maximal possible flux as a function of the growth rate, as simulated by FBA using our modified iAF1260 model. The light gray consists of all other growth rate and delftibactin combinations that are possible based on the above model (recall that the flux space is convex). The 10 circled points represent some of the 150 points that were used for simulation of the fed-batch process.
In particular, wild type E.coli can produce all the monomers necessary for Delftibactin production, with the exception of methylmalonyl-CoA, which is required for the PKS part of the synthetase. Thus, a reaction converting propanoyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA with the following stoichiometry was added:
$$ 1 \: ppcoa[c] \: + \: 1 atp[c] \: + \: 1 \: hco3[c] \: \to \: 1 \: mmcoa-S[c] \: + \: 1 \: pi[c] \: + \: 1 adp[c] \: + \: 1 \: h[c] $$
Subsequently, the main delftibactin production reaction was added. The stoichiometry is governed by the amino acids monomers which are combined under usage of 1 ATP each and the Claisen condensation of methyl-malonyl CoA. This core reaction of the synthetase was accompanied with the subsequent modification enzymes [9] which are also necessary for the functional activity of Delftibactin. These comprise the aspartic acid dioxygenase (encoded by the gene DelD), the N5-hydro"

Our Models
For our project, we built three types of models. The first was an agent-based model which simulated our multicellular biosensor framework. This model gave insight into the optimal ratio of cell-types to have in the system. This information was used during experimental characterisation to optimise our system.
Our second model was a statistical, multifactorial Design of Experiments (DoE) approach towards optimising Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) systems. This statistical model was used to generate an experimental design to gather data on the importance of certain supplements in CFPS systems, and then use the experimental data to optimise CFPS systems.
Our third model was an agent-based model designed to replicate the functions of a digital microfluidic chip and schedule the tasks for the device. The final piece of software controls agents which are the microfluidic droplets and moves them around the simulated chip according to predefined movement plans which can be read from either the program itself or custom external files. This provides a quicker, more inexpensive means of testing the chip than repeated real-world experiments.

Rationale and Aim
After the initial design of the Sensynova platform, it was important to determine, in silico, if multicellular biosensor systems constructed according to our paradigm would be able to produce responses to target molecules which were comparable to traditional whole cell sensors. Therefore, a 3D, spatially explicit, stochastic model was constructed, in"

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Humanpratices_-_-_TEXT.html," the potential to combine in dangerous ways. As with many other synthesized DNA constructs, we have found that our plasmids are lost from the bacteria over time (if plated without antibiotic present), due to the expression of colors being an unproductive strain on the cell’s resources. Consequently, there is little risk of our microorganisms spreading. Even if our E. coli strains survived and replicated in the wild, they are highly unlikely to cause harm to any humans or animals as risk level one microorganisms. The microorganisms we are creating in the lab would have less potential for malicious misuse than any bacteria normally found in the environment.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
      The new BioBricks created by the University of Alberta this year do not raise any safety concerns. The BioBricks are novel circuits made from common genes coding for color proteins and repressors. The three color proteins being produced are red fluorescent protein (RFP), blue pigment protein (BPP), and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the two inducible repressors are LacI, and TetR. All of the BioBricks parts produced this year are safe, non-virulent, and are consequently categorized under a Bio Safety Level One (BSL1). According to the WHO manual, BSL1 microrganisms require no safety equipment and allow for open bench work.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
      On most university campuses, there is a local Biosafety Committee that ensures that research labs are following safety protocols put in place by the national government. At the University of Alberta, the Biosafety Committee is a division of the Environmental, Health and Safety Faculty.  The Biosafety Committee is mainly concerned with the proper handling of biohazardous materials. Biohazardous materials are defined as “materials of biological origin or synthetic material which mimic biological entities and may induce adverse conditions to humans, other animals, plants, or the environment”. Under the national and local regulations, our non-virulent strains of E. coli are considered Biosafety level 1 and are of minimal potential hazard. Standard practices, such as wearing gloves when handling microorganisms, as well"

iGEM-UK Shindig, 15/16th July 2008
Taken at 5pm - should have seen them at 1am...
(Hosted at the University of Edinburgh)
All the UK iGEM teams were invited to a wee get-together in Edinburgh to share experiences, trials, tribulations, best-practise and a few beers!    Or a few more than a few... whose idea was the vodka bar?
Matthieu - Bubble-gum flavour vodka is just wrong on so many levels, seriously.
Anyway here's a picture of the teams before they went on a brain cell killing spree.
THE SERIOUS BUSINESS 15th July
Simon Munnery , comedian, ""The engineering equivalent of Genetic Engineering is to get a bunch of concrete and steel, throw it into a river, and if you can walk across it, call it a bridge.""
With this in mind we kicked off with an ice-breaker team-builder where we mixed up folks from the 5 different institutions ( Bristol , Cambridge , Edinburgh , Imperial and Newcastle ) into 6 teams to compete against each other to build bridges made from popsicle sticks. The strongest bridge won a drinkable prize - my idea so I guess I should take some of the blame from the descent experienced that evening... It was all a bit of fun but it did have a underlying motivation: The teams should have learned the importance of doing proper design / brainstorming prior to building and that having a good skills mix within the team was important. NOT sure it ran exactly along those lines...
There were a clutch of teams which held over 3kg of weight but the winning team was ""iGEM Log"".Thanks to Dr Andrew Firth for his help in running this activity. On the 16th July we had a day of actual work.
Down to the serious business of engineering
Rogues gallery - be thankful those iGEMers are not going anywhere near bridges. Let it be noted, however, that the three bridges in the foreground were the strongest. iGEM Log, to the right, won the contest.
I wouldn't walk across this kind of bridge!

Biosafety
Although the manipulation of DNA does not involve the use of live organisms, the utmost care must still be taken with all reagents and equipment in order to minimise the risk to the user and avoid any potential damage to the environment. The follow Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) describe the various hazards associated with the reagents used with Darwin Toolbox, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Risk Assessment for use of the different modules within the toolbox can be found.
Technology Misuse
Our project raises concerns that our technology could be used by hostile groups, similar to the iGEM CU Boulder project . All the equipment our laboratory kit provides is already accessible via online retail outlets.

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," continuous supply. It was a     crucial     factor for the evaluation of our gaming app, where we benefited from the enthusiastic crowd of     people.
Schools
This year we visited local schools to introduce pupils to practical biological work. We     decided to do so, because in this lab-workshop we saw the biggest potential for us to be     helpful and make an impact. A few years ago the German school system was reformed     and the former nine years of “Gymnasium” were cut short to just eight years. We, the     Team Franconia, live in Bavaria, a federal state who executed this reform as one of the     first, fourteen years ago. This brought with it a lot of changes in the curricula of all     grades, especially the last two years before graduation. To get most of the important     topics into only eight instead of nine years, practical work experience was nearly     completely withdrawn from curriculum. So, before graduation most pupils in Germany     know the theory behind modern biological work in laboratories, but have never done it     nor seen it in practice. To change that and fascinate soon-to- be university students in     natural sciences we decided to visit local schools and do a small workshop about     biological work.

Since we were planning to do the workshop in the school building– not in      our laboratory at the university – almost every experiment was unsuitable because of      safety aspects. After long brainstorming sessions, we found three interesting      experiments, neither demanding too little nor too much from the pupils: a simple DNA-      extraction from strawberries, a gel electrophoresis of a plasmid in different conformations      with a harmless DNA-dye and our “microcakes”, mixing ingredients, usually used to bake      cakes, in Eppendorf tubes by using microliter pipettes, micro scales and vortexers. After      contacting two schools in Erlangen, discussing the possibilities with the responsible      biology teachers, planning the experiments and preparing the workshop, we held our      very first workshop on the 24th of May 2017 at the Marie-Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen.
Marie-Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen
The teachers assembled a group of 13 interested pupils from their 11 th grade biology     courses who were willing to spend their – usually free – Wednesday afternoon learning     about iGEM, synthetic biology and how to work in laboratories. We prepared the DNA     extraction, the gel electrophoresis and a power point presentation about us and the     theory of the two experiments, everything being photographed"

About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million.  It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (an annual agricultural fair founded in 1905).  Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative leader Stephen Harper.
The University of Calgary
The University of Calgary is ranked as one of Canada’s top comprehensive research institutions. Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien Centre within which iGEM Calgary operates. The university is also the birthplace of many inventions including the neurochip, and has had 140,000 alumni since its founding in 1966.

Our Team
Consisting of 9th through 12th graders, our team bases itself out of Gaston Day School, a preK-through 12 school in Gastonia, North Carolina. With the guidance of Ms. Anne Byford we enter our second year in the iGEM competition. for this year we have two primary goals:
Create an organism that will effectively sense the presence of iron in water sources.
Adapt techniques from advanced synthetic biology to the high school environment.
Gds student info
Our Project
We have two primary goals for this year’s competition. First, we plan to produce an iron sensitive reporter which indicates elevated levels of iron. This will be done be done by combining an iron sensitive promoter with a constitutive RFP reporter. In addition to achieving this first reporter, we are using the parts submitted by the Cambridge team last year and use them in place of the RFP gene. Our second, and more important, goal is to create techniques and procedures for the common high school laboratory that can replicate the results from the more advanced research laboratories of universities.

Safety
The UCLA iGEM team's safety forms were approved on 9/18/13 by Julie McNamara and David Lloyd.
Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose risks to lab members, security, the general public, or the environment?
None of the biological materials used in our lab pose pose any sort of risk. The main biological part that we are using in this project, the mtd, does not affect any organism other than Bordetella bacteria. Furthermore, all of our work is done in vitro, and our product is not packaged within a vector. As such, there is no chance of our materials impacting the public or the environment outside of the controlled laboratory environment.
If your project was scaled up from a lab study to a widely used industrial product, or if the knowledge and methods produced from your project became widely available, what new risks might arise?
No new risks would arise. Our project has no inherently malicious utilities.
What are your institution's biosafety guidelines?
All biological research at UCLA is overseen by the Environment, Health, & Safety department's Biological Safety Division . Per EH&S's requirements, Members of our team took the Lab Safety Fundamentals Concepts course taught by UCLA's Environment, Health, & Safety department. The course covers fire safety, chemical safety, and mitigation of hazards in the lab. We also consulted with EH&S regarding the safety implications of our project. Initially, we had planned to conduct our experiment in vivo using the BPP-1 phage and its host, the Bordetella bacteria. However, Bordetella causes infections in humans and smaller mammals, and our lab facility was not equipped to handle such a hazard. As such, we decided to switch to a completely in vitro approach.  In the USA, the Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health provide biosafety guidelines for the nation.
What is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
Our lab has a BSL rating of 2.
Does your project involve any high risk organisms?
Our project does not involve the use of any chassis organism. We only use standard strains of E. coli for the transformation/replication of our plasmid (XL-1 blue), as well as for screening purposes.

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive"
Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#wetlab#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," is detected in cell lysates but MtrB is not, indicating the necessity of MtrA in assembly of OM MtrB complexes [7]. This tight interaction between MtrA and MtrB has raised the possibility that MtrA may be embedded within MtrB, thereby allowing MtrA to come in contact with OM cytochrome proteins. Given the periplasmic length of approximately 237 Å and the localization of MtrA and CymA to the OM and CM membranes respectively, it is hypothesized that additional PECs, likely MtrA or NrfA paralogs, are necessary to complete the transfer of electrons between CymA and MtrA in MR-1 [7].
MtrC and OmcA
MtrC and OmcA are two c-type decaheme cytochromes located on the extracellular surface of the OM [4,7]. In vivo cross-linking and in vitro experiments have shown that these two OMC readily complex and that this binding synergistically increases the reductase efficiency of the complex [7]. The current model of MtrC-OmcA metal reduction posits that MtrC and OmcA bind and reduce Fe(III) oxides directly [7]. Study of MtrF, a MtrC paralog, has provided structural evidence supporting the role of MtrC and OmcA as the terminal reductases in Fe(III) oxide reduction. MtrF folds into four domains with domains II and IV, the pentaheme domains, forming a core. Two split-b-barrels, domains I and III, surround the pentaheme cores [4]. Domains I and III are thought to be responsible for binding and reducing Fe(III), domain II for the direct transfer of electrons, and domain IV, for physically interacting with the MtrDE (a MtrAB homolog) complex [4].
The Essential Role of MtrB in the Mtr Respiratory Pathway
In addition to serving as a conduit for electron transfer from MtrA to OM reducatses, MtrB acts as a scaffolding protein. MtrABC complexes are readily isolated after Triton X-100 treatment [7,8]. Isolated MtrABC, when solubilized into liposomes, readily catalyzes transmembrane electron transfer [7]. While MtrAB complexes readily form in the absence of MtrC, MtrBC complexes are not detected in a mtrA deletion background 7. Moreover, while isolated MtrA and"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Ferritin Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"80 kV TEM image with scale bars measuring ferritin nanoparticles.
To make a definitive conclusion if an iron NP core can form in our mutant ferritin BBa_K2638612 we went to a higher resolution TEM performing close up images of the iron core. The iron core resolution is enhanced but contrast is weaker than the images acquired by the 80 kV TEM due to the 200 kV TEM used for making those images having a higher energy beam. A second factor which influences the visibility in the TEM images is the composition of the metal core. Fe(III) oxide shown under the TEM is less visible compared to elemental metal. How elemental metal looks under the TEM can be seen on our page on gold and silver forming ferritin.   To confirm that the particles consist of iron we performed an EDX measurement using the TEM. EDX measurements where however not precise enough to give a conclusive answer about the composition of the metal core. The electron beam is bigger than the size of the 8 nm metal core therefore it is not possible to measure a single NP directly but only large clusters of NP. Measuring large clusters has the disadvantage of not being able to see the exact shape and size of the NP which could lead to wrong conclusions when other particles than the one formed inside the ferritin are being measured. The precise size of 8 nm or less and the round shape are the best indicators for NP formed by ferritin.

Analysis of Enclosed Fluorophores by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) using Zeiss LSM780
To test if our modified ferritin can be used as a cage to enclose various proteins and molecules of interest we attempted to enclose mRFP (27 kDa) and the much smaller fluorescein (0.33 kDa) respectively.
mRFP was overexpressed in psB3t5, the cells where ribolysed and purified using a 0.5 mL protein filter (Amicon Ultra). Synthesized fluorescein was used which our team member Jakob Zubek also synthesized himself in one of his chemistry practical courses.
To compare the enclosure capability we used the wild type HuHF and compared it to our modified ferritin missing the e-helix and DE turn ( BBa_K2638612 ).
As the objective of this experiment was to look for differences in the pH values necessary for disassembly of the unmodified ferritin and our modified ferritin we exposed the ferritins to different pH"

Guillermo has witnessed both Peru’s innovations and follies over the decades as he’s traveled between countries. In the 70’s and 80’s, birth control was very expensive, and only people of higher economic status had access to it. Read More >> Now, since Peru is a predominantly Catholic society, many Peruvians don’t support the use of birth control in general. In most cases, those in need of birth control are the ones who can’t afford it. In addition to cost, access to birth control is also an issue. According to Guillermo, Peruvians “have social services available to help, but no outreach programs since many women live in the mountains of Peru away from the capital”. Peru is also a male-dominated society, and many husbands/boyfriends “don’t believe in birth control and are against it out of ignorance”. It’s no surprise then that Peru has an extremely high rate of illegal abortions. Guillermo explained that “women die all the time” from illegal abortions; in the year 2000, 35% of pregnancies ended in abortion (Fernando Delicia, ""Clandestine Abortion in Peru""). Interestingly enough, he wonders if the design of our product would entice women to try it. The most common form of birth control in Peru is birth control pills, which are easy to identify given their recognizable packaging. Our product would grow as a yeast, and the user could press the dried yeast herself to form a pill. This process is less recognizable than normal birth control pills and may be appealing for women who face a male-dominated society that doesn’t approve of birth control use. This viewpoint hadn’t been considered by our team before, and we now hope to incorporate this angle into our development and advertisement of our new birth control method.

Misha, Former Russian Citizen
Misha is a woman who spent the first part of her life in Soviet Russia. She tried for many years to obtain any form of birth control but only received her first IUD after having her first child at age 19. She couldn’t afford to purchase condoms, and most couples opted not to use any forms of contraception. Russia’s government did not encourage or supply cheap contraceptives, but readily offered inexpensive abortions at state hospitals. Most women were aware of this and expected to have one to three abortions in their lifetimes. Abortion clinics shut down after a few years. This forced many Russian women to obtain illegal abortions, most of which were ineffective or dangerous. We didn’t realize the prevalence of illegal abortions"

Basic Flip-Flop
Introduction
Firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the evolution of the species involved in the basic flip-flop. This model is composed of a set of differential equations that relate the change of rate of the concentrarions of the different substances with the concentrations of rest of substances. These models have been then implemented and simulated using MATLAB and MATLAB's Simbiology.
To start with the model analysis, we show the reactions in which our plasmid is involved into the ‘E. Coli’ bacteria, and their kinetic laws. Due to the two expressions, each one must have the same rate law. Here we are showing a simplified analysis for every response:
We have the expression of two different proteins, expressions that are regulated by following reactions:
TRANSCRIPTION: RNAp + Promoter → RNAp + Promoter + mRNA
The mRNA production will be described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
TRANSLATION: mRNA + Ribosomes → mRNA + Ribosomes + Repressor
The Repressor production will be also modeled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
REPRESSION: Promoter + n · Repressor → Promoter_Repressorn
Finally we use a Hill kinetics model for the transcription inhibition, which offers an approximation to the cooperative action.

Here we can see all the species involved in the model for the bistable.

OD/F Device
One of our greater visions we share with the synthetic biology community is that everyone interested in biological work should have access to basic laboratory equipment. With our OD/F Device, we offer a low-cost solution for community labs, biohackers and high schools.
Advantages and disadvantes of our OD/F Device compared to commercially available devices
We compared the devices in portability, affordability, reliability, user-friendliness, capabilities, precision and accuracy.
For an economic analysis, we deal with F Device and the OD Device separately. The reason for this is the bad comparability to commercial devices. Latter do not combine the measurument of fluorescence and OD while being in the same product class of small, portable devices. With our OD/F Device, we offer a solution to combine both measurement methods in one mobile device. With the instructions provided by us it possible to either build an OD Device or an F Device or an OD/F Device. We are offering a high degree of flexibility by enabling the user to modify our device according to own ideas and wishes.
Both portability and low cost are two out of several factors that we heavily place importance on. Commercially obtainable spectrophotometers like UNICO S-1205 , for example, cost $1.250 or more, and can measure optical density only. On top of that, they are heavy, hardly portable and therefore not easy to handle. However, they are able to work with a broader range of wavelengths and show higher accuracy and precision. For measuring fluorescence, devices such as plate readers are available. Yet comparing a commercial device with our F Device is really difficult because we could not find one that is both portable and able to measure at 480 nm.
To compare our device to another commercially availalbe system we chose the OD-meter CO 8000 . This device measures the OD at 600 nm, too, but costs almost $920. Our OD/F Device can measure OD as well as fluorescence for less than $60 as shown in the chart on the left. The cost savings here are round about $850, money that could definetly be invested into other research projects or equipment instead.

If we assume the E.D. Frosti spreads throughout someone’s body and if that person drinks a lot of cold water, there is a high probability that the bacteria would instantly freeze the cold water. This could reduce the overall body temperature and eventually freeze the whole human body.  The possibility of this scenario happening is insignificant. When we swallow bacteria, they are able to survive until they get into the abdomen. In the stomach the pH lies between 1 and 2, causing the  proteins to denaturize and break down into peptides. [5] If the bacteria don’t enter the stomach, the INP will stay active and will try to induce ice crystal formation. The protein will be active but won't cause any ice crystallization because the body temperature is too high to induce this.
Toxicity- “Prevention is better than cure”
During the initial design of our project we planned to use copper ion as the inducer of the INP protein pathway. Although this system would work very well as a proof of concept, we quickly realized that eventually the copper would be found in high toxic levels in the cell debris affecting people, animals, and the environment.
Copper toxicity leads to vomiting, low blood pressure, coma, jaundice, vomiting of blood, melena and gastrointestinal distress. Living organisms like mammals have well defined and optimized processes to regulate the excess of copper within certain ranges. However the body becomes poisoned when faced with too high concentrations. There are general safety standards concerning metal pollution in Europe and U.S. which enforce strict regulations on the amount of copper in fumes, particles and aerosols. While identifying these risks we decided to use sugar based inducers, such as lactose and L-arabinose, to trigger the INP pathway. These do not pose any toxicity risks.
The ice nucleating protein occurs naturally in the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Scientists did research on the toxicity of this bacterium and proved that this bacterium is not a pathogen for humans or animals. [12] Yet we decided not to use this organism because it is proven to be a plant pathogen. [13] Pseudomonas syringae is adapted to cold temperatures, we believe if this strain was able to survive the high pressure at the surface layer of the ocean it would be able to freeze a part of it.

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Besides, we had a discussion with each other to define the different advantages and disadvantages between different system. For example, the sunlight was a determine factor of microalgae while engineering E. coli. was not sensitive with light intensity. However, microalgae successfully converted CO2 into valuable bio-products. Therefore, we concluded that different system will have different benefit depending on different demand.

Date：August. 8, 10 am.
Location：National Cheng Kung University An-nan campus
Can the microalgae survive with flue gas from the industrial?
The flue gas from CSC contained about 6~7% CO2 which is affordable for microalgae cultivation. Some species of microalgae can even survive under higher SOx and NOx condition. Therefore, the flue gas can be piped into microalgae cultivation demonstration plant directly without pre-adjusted.
How does microalgae culture control gas flow, temperature and pH?
With PE material, the air pipeline is plugged into the bottom of the culture pool. The pumped air can also help them stirr. Aspirator connected to a pore on the top to exhaust the net air. Since that the culture pool is implemented under the shade roof, temperature controller isn’t required. Besides, pH condition must be maintained around 7 while pre-culture.
Before culture the new species of microalgae, how to clean the pool completely?
First, exhaust the medium from the bottom and then jet the water to remove the microalgae attachment. Then, add some bleach to kill the rest of microalgae in the pool.
Secondly, microalgae in the effluent medium will be separated by centrifugation. The separated microalgae will be storage through lyophilization. The microalgae attachment problem in the pipeline can be cleaned through jetting water and bleached as well.
What is the value of byproduct?
The separated microalgae can be used to reed shrimp since that the microalgae is one of the important nutrient sources for shrimp. Through the shrimp farming, it can also extract Lutein which has high commercial value in the market.
How to select the specie of microalgae?
Before culturing microalgae in the open pond, we will pre-culture in the lab and test it under different conditions. Through many experiments, we can select the final species of microalgae which has the best growth condition, like heat-resisting.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," original sequence is from a bacterial host, the sequence was codon optimized for yeast in hopes of achieving the highest possible yields in protein production. Codon optimization was done by GeneArt, from where we also ordered the constructs.
As it had already shown that MlrA can be produced in E. coli in an active form, we decided to produce that in addition to our yeast constructs as a positive control. With this positive control, we would be able to test our experimental setups with an enzyme we know should function correctly. This way, we would know if any potential problems when using the yeast constructs are due to the experimental setup or the actual enzyme. We based the design of our E. coli construct on what had been used by Dziga et al. (2012) in order to have maximal certainty that it would work. We designed our MlrA insert by fusing the MlrA sequence to a C-terminal His-tag (figure 15). The MlrA sequence was also codon optimized for E. coli , again by GeneArt.
Figure 15. MlrA with 6x His tag in the C-terminal end in pET28a plasmid.
In a previous iGEM project (“Ranger amongst Enemies”, Peking 2014), the MlrA enzyme was also produced heterologously in E. coli . They had created a BioBrick (BBa_1378001) of this MlrA sequence, but they had not specified the exact Sphingomonas sp. strain they had used. We believe that the reference sequence is the same as the one we chose to use ( Sphingomonas sp. ACM-3962), as of all the available MlrA sequences we compared, no other sequence corresponded to it as closely; the Peking 2014 biobrick differed from this sequence by only one amino acid. Because the difference of this single amino acid wasn’t explained, and no other sequence corresponded better to the Peking 2014 sequence, we assumed this single difference to be a mistake either in entering the BioBrick sequence, or due to a mutation that had happened during cloning. As a part of our gold medal criterion, we decided that we would improve this part (our improved part BBa_K1907002).
In the design of the degradation part of our project, we decided not to use the Peking BioBrick for our E. coli construct as it had the unexplained single amino acid difference to the closest available sequence. For our plasmid backbones, we decided to use ones we"

After I Die
When ECHO has gone through the above two stages, the diagnosis section is completed. Triggered by high level of nitric oxide near the cancerous tissues, ECHO will express an anticancer agent for a preliminary bio-treatment of CRC and release the agent by cell lysis. In wet lab, we induced the therapeutic module with sodium nitroprusside, the nitric oxide donors. The results showed the anticancer agent can be expressed by ECHO, indicating the nitric oxide sensor function normally (results) . When it comes to the suicide module, in order to make sure ECHO lyses at the proper time, we introduced an attenuator to the gene circuit by model calculator (model) .
Fig 3.  Cell lyses to release the drug.
Dress Me up
By now, we had got the ECHO tested both in vitro and in vivo. But it still needs a load to make it a real product. Since Tongji_China chose therapeutics as their track this year, so we both needs to look for a proper pharmaceutical preparation.Therefore, we collaborated to visit Roche, the world’s largest biotech company and also the global leader in cancer treatments, and their staff gave us advice on the choice of pharmaceutical preparations (interview) .At last we have chosen two kinds of loader, the capsule and the hydrogel. (loader)
Fig 4. Taking ECHO orally.
The Real World
Since ECHO was supposed to function in human body ultimately, our HP group focuses on finding the application prospect for our project. First, they take the biosafety of ECHO into account. By reading related literatures our HP group built a set of biosafety standards and assessed the biosafety level of ECHO. Second, we built a price-health model to estimate public’s acceptance of ECHO. Then, we analyzed ECHO’s rule in countries in different financial situations. At last, we walked into classes and campus to let more people learn about our engineered systems. (HP)
By now, you have known everything about ECHO. With the passion for synthetic biology and the hope to make a little change to the world, we spared no effort in developing ECHO just like parents bringing up their babies. We really hope you like our ideas and product and it would be even more amazing if any of our parts inspire you in anyway."

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," it’s hard to control the intracellular plasmid numbers, we choose plasmids with different copy numbers to prove our system. Three kinds of plasmids are listed below.
Table 2. The copy numbers of different plasmids.
The fragments containing the constitutive promoter (Fig.8) are linked with and cloned into three types of plasmids individually.
Fig.8 The circuit constructed with constitutive promoter to simulate the situation of different plasmid losing rates.
Test result
1. Simulated the production of inhibitors with different concentrations by adding different concentration of arabinose
In order to construct the environment with different concentrations of inhibitor and find the threshold, we use the PBAD promoter to achieve this. In the wet lab, we chose the CI-PR circuit like the picture (Fig. 1) to do this experiments.
Fig.1 the circuit constructed to measure
When we added enough arabinose, the CI inhibitor could repress the pR promoter fully, so the RFP can’t be tested. Also when the inhibitor was not enough, the promoter will express RFP which stands the killer gene’s expression..
Firstly, we use the model to simulate the relationship between the arabinose added and RFP intensity. We got the curve below (Fig. 2):
Fig. 2 this curve is about the corresponding RFP intensity under the different concentration of the arabinose.
This curve describes the in-promoter activity have a relationship with the different concentrations of the arabinose. That means when we add different concentrations of arabinose, the in-promoter’s activity will be different. We regarded the concentration of arabinose 0.003% as a threshold, the corresponding in-promoter is thought just be repressed regarded as the threshold. Thus we can say the in-promoter can have different responses to the inhibitor.
After the simulation, we added different concentrations of arabinose to construct different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor in the wet lab.
After the pre-experiment, the arabinose concentrations we chose are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty pSB1K3 and the positive control is the strain containing the device in Fig.1 on pSB1K3 without adding the arabinose.
Table. 1 the arabinose concentration used in pre-experiment
The strain we used is E.coli Top10.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#History_-_-_TEXT.html," does not bear all the features of the implementation of Biotic Blue as it was developed due to time requirements before its design reached the current state.
Figure 6. Prototype of Biotic Blue
Comparative analysis
In the following Table 3 the advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue are presented, indicating the points of superiority compared to existing solutions and the features that need further development. Table 3 can be used as a valuable guide for future improvement driving through different stages the evolution of Biotic Blue.
Table 3. Advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue implementation in WWTPs.
Although Biotic Blue may not be the ultimate solution for treating pharmaceuticals in WWTP, undoubtedly, it bears significant competitive advantages against its two major competitive methods, Ozonation and Activated carbon. Our solution has a higher cost-effectiveness profile, lower operational energy consumption, does not pose any threat to its handlers and the environmental risk of degradation residues is less than Ozonation by-products.
In comparison to Activated Carbon, Biotic Blue has significant cost benefits since the magnetic beads can be retrieved in a more efficient way and they can be regenerated with lower capital demands as well. Furthermore, our solution offers lower installation costs and space requirements, making it particularly attractive for WWTP with limited available space.
However, at this point it is important to highlight that the implied capability of Biotic Blue to immobilize any enzyme on the magnetic beads, allows it to potentially treat wastewater contaminated by any mixture of pharmaceuticals. This unique tailoring capability according to the synthesis of the contaminants in the inflow is what makes Biotic Blue resource-efficient, outperforming the other solutions.
Validation
We have successfully immobilized the fungal laccase on magnetic beads. The following images show that the immobilized enzymes were functional (Figure 7) and that the magnetic beads can be captured and separated from water solution using a magnet (Figure 8).
Figure 7. On the left: Control.
On the right: Immobilized laccases showing activity (color change) when ABTS (a laccase model-substrate) was added.
Figure 8. Recovery of immobilized magnetic beads on a magnetic rack.
Impact on Society
""Our feet may stand on Stockholm, surrounded by the water of the Baltic Sea but our eyes rest on our whole planet.""
With this in mind we considered the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals as the ideal framework to show the impact of Biotic Blue on society.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as Global Goals, are a set of universal goals, targets and indicators that meet the most urgent challenges facing"

In 2013 the Tokyo Tech iGEM team created a recombinant E.coli they called E. ninja. This bacteria is capable of throwing “ninja stars”, namely bacteriophages, in response to acyl-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL). Thus, they created an inducible release system of M13 phages. Their approach consisted on changing the promoter of PII protein for an inducible promoter; in this case, the pLux. The same principle for the expression of our bacteriophage is used in our design.

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Aspects#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," not taking a formal position before the vote, and that’s exactly as it should be.
What’s really positive is that the Scottish and UK governments have agreed to what’s called the ‘Edinburgh Agreement’, so that means that the legal process for having the referendum has been agreed between the UK and Scottish governments, so that the decision will not be questioned by either side, and part of that agreement says that if Scotland votes ‘yes’, then the two governments will sit down and agree on an orderly transition from the current arrangements to allow Scotland to become an independent country.
[Going back to the issue of post-independence access to UK research funding], the argument that the Scottish government is putting forward is that Universities will continue to be able to access UK funding following independence. Professor Sir Ian Diamond, who’s the principal of Aberdeen University, has said, and I quote, that ‘there would be no question that Scotland could remain part of research councils within the UK should Scots vote yes in next year’s independence referendum’, and by Scots we mean people who live and work in Scotland, whether they are ethnic Scots or not is not important.
A: Yes, though it wouldn’t feel right for me to vote for someone else’s independence.
JE: Well I think that you’re entitled to vote; you should weigh up the arguments for and against and come to a position. My definition of a Scot, because I am sometimes asked on the doorstep as an SNP candidate why an English person should vote SNP, is that if you live in Scotland, if you work here and pay your taxes, as far as I’m concerned you’re as Scottish as I am, and you’re as entitled to have a say on the future of Scotland as anyone else who lives hear.
J: Very opened minded.
JE: It is, its civic nationalism. So going back to research, Professor Diamond is also a former chairman of the Research Councils UK Executive group, which means that he comes at this issue with a background of expertise and knowledge and understanding of the issues, the reason that I’m not able to be as definitive as I’d like is that his report has not yet been published. But once that has been published it will inform the white paper. He’s also pointed out that there’s a precedent for single research areas across national boundaries, so this is absolutely doable, if the will exists to do it. And it’s in the interests of researchers south of the border as well, to access the good networks of research and collaboration. There’s reference to a single research area that operates across Scandinavia, so there is a model there that Scotland can seek to"

show people on the front line in the battle against CF lung disease (medics and patients) how the Dundee iGEM project could be used in practice.
demonstrate the possibility of this having a lasting benefit, not just to provide much quicker diagnosis times, but ultimately giving control back to the patients.
build a bridge between Synthetic Biology and the people it can help by having patients and healthcare professionals be part of the design of the L.A.S.S.O.
Objectives
To build a device able to detect the low light levels produced by our engineered E. coli chassis and quantify this signal with known standards to calculate the amount of bacteria present.
To design a computer application capable of relaying the amount of bacteria present to a downstream user (e.g. Doctor).
To design a computer application which can simulate how the L.A.S.S.O. could be used in practice - showing how information could be easily shared between patient and medical staff (automated, letting the technology do the work).

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a C"

ZJU-China,2013,Team:ZJU-China#HumanPractice#AChessGame_-_-_TEXT.html,". Along the “nucleic road”, we meet repressor the “evil”, and enhancer the “angel”. If a player meet the enhancer, he/she may move the chessman three steps ahead; but if unfortunately he/she meet the repressor, the chessman must be moved three steps backward.
Ahead of enhancer the “angel”, we meet a sign of “coding region”, which indicates that we are now in coding region. Take care of the methyl in this area! If you are unlucky enough to step on it, you must move your chessman back to the promoter! The coding region is rather long. At the end of this area, there is a terminator drawn as a red octagon. However, this time it is lucky enough to step exactly on the terminator. If it does happen, players may move their chessmen to the RBS site through the dotted line. If players are not lucky enough to step exactly on the terminator, he/she must move backward according to the pips on the dice --- For example, if a player is just one step before the terminator, and he/she throws a “three”, then he/she must go one step to the terminator, and then move two steps backward.
Now we are at the RBS site, and we are on the messenger RNA! The first segment of this RNA is an exon, so they are to be translated. Notice that there is a “skip” sign in the middle of the RNA molecule, which act as a separation of exon and intron. Once again, if a player is lucky enough to step exactly on the “skip” sign, he/she may skip the intron and move the chessman through the dotted line. If he/she is not lucky enough, there is no way to skip the intron.
There is also a segment with loop-stem structure on the mRNA. If a player steps on one of the two base pairs, he/she may “slide” the chessman to the paired base, which may help him/her skip some steps. The termination of mRNA is a “stop” sign, and there are two paths for a transport from mRNA to polypeptides.
To make the game more challenging, he who skipped the intron before must go through “A” path, and the others go through “B” path. However, “A” or “B” is not permanent. Notice the disulfide bonds! They are bridges that connect the two polypeptides. Since the steps of polypeptide A and B are not the same, players may “slide” their chessmen through the disulfide"
BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Calendar-Main#2 July 2008_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria can then be moved around. Unfortunately, the full project could not be evaluated so further work needs to be performed.
The modelling of the chemoattractant switch is underway and the mathematics and simulation has been completed. Unfortunately, no actual parameter values have been found yet so estimates were entered. These showed that the switch seems to work as expected only expressing a single CheW/CheW* as required. Parameters need to be found for each variable, however, a more pressing matter was ensuring that a mechanics based simulation was produced to evaluate how well the method we are proposing will work.
During the questions session several important points were made. The first was that the movement that a bacteria will make will be a biased random walk and as such it may not impart the full force possible on the particle to move. This may not be such a problem if recruitment can cause swarming behaviour around the particle allowing for a mean force of the group to be imparted, however, simulations should be produced to evaluate this. Secondly, if the forces are less than initially anticipated, it will be important to damp any external influences and so vibration free tables may be necessary. This can be evaluated after the feasibility study.

Modeling PHA biosynthesis
Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology in general are powerful areas of research, but they can only realize a leap in breakthroughs when computational models involved in the Design-Build-Test-Learn engineering paradigm are standardized and implemented in the field. As part of our iGEM project, the models developed were motivated by different objectives and approaches in order to inform and be shaped by our endeavors in the lab. To do so, two different computational models were used to determine the best approaches to improve PHA yield and productivity in recombinant E. coli.
One of the ways to model a system in silico is through the dynamic model , a favourite among systems biologists. By defining a pathway (such as the heterologous PHA biosynthetic pathway) or metabolic network as a series of ordinary differential equations (ODE), dynamic behaviors in the system over time may be predicted. A considerable limitation arises from the need for highly detailed information to parameterize the kinetics of the pathway; therefore, this type of model may be difficult to implement.
On the other hand, an organism as well-studied as E. coli  enjoys a vast wealth of literature surrounding its genome and metabolic network. As a result, stoichiometric or constraint-based models such as genome-scale models (GEM) are available to be used for in silico simulations without necessitating the rigorous characterization associated with dynamic or kinetic models. Using this, we can investigate problems such as the best conditions to grow a recombinant recombinant Sleeping beauty mutase (SBM) operon-containing E. coli  and how to improve the titer of PHA.
Dynamic modeling of the PHA biosynthetic pathway for PHBV co-polymer production
Overview 
A metabolic network such as that of E.coli  may be viewed in mathematical terms: a system of equations that follow the transcriptional, translational and enzymatic activity within the organism. However, for the purposes of looking at the PHA biosynthetic pathway, we will be looking predominantly at the biochemical"

Playing games with synthetic biology
Using an engineering approach for biological systems is an important characteristic of synthetic biology. This can not only help to change the understanding of many aspects of biology; synthetic biological systems can also be used to solve well-known computational and mathematical problems. Especially during the early days in the field, a lot of mathematical problems were approached to prove the potential of the new biological systems. There are various examples from in vitro DNA computations where classic computational tasks like the maximal clique problem [1], the traveling salesman [2] or the satisfiability problem [3] [4] were solved with DNA systems. Their large size and high computational expense made these problems especially interesting for DNA computation due to its large-scale information processing abilities. Having no direct application or profit, these experiments mainly demonstrated the possibilities and potential lying within synthetic biology.
In 2003 Milan Stojanovic and Darko Stefanovic presented an in vitro molecular automaton system that is able to play tic-tac-toe against a human opponent [5]. The network consists of 23 separate logic gates which allow the system to pursuit a perfect strategy and make it invincible to its human opponents. The gates are built using 24 deoxyribozymes reacting to input oligonucleotides through cleavage and release of a fluorescent product. The human player can choose between six input oligonucleotides, representing the six fields of the game, and add them to all wells. The automaton reacts within 15min with a change in fluorescence in the well which it “decided” to play. The authors of the paper use tic-tac-toe to demonstrate the possibility to build an interactive in vitro automaton capable of different boolean calculations. They chose tic-tac-toe because of its straightforward game tree, which had already made it a classic choice for the development of new computational paradigms in the past.
In 2010 they published another example of in vitro computation based on similar mechanisms [6]. This time, the simple game named tit-for-tat was designed specifically for this purpose. It consists of only four fields within a quadrat and the goal of the game is simply that in every round each player marks one field. Whenever the automaton manages to mark a free field and only one field at a time, it wins the game. It is assumed that the human player does not make such mistakes either. To win the game there are different strategies. In a first step, the automaton is trained to a certain strategy through addition of input oligon"

We reported the effect of gene silence to our teacher. We found out some abnormal data in the diagram. Maybe we had some mistake in the step of mixing the solution. So we prepared to do the RT-PCR once again. But this time, unfortunately, we put PCR Tubes Strip in wrong way. So we plan to do the experiment again tomorrow. We believed that failure can let us go further.
We observed a strong fluorescence from the cells transfected yesterday.
Wednesday 19/8
We went to Guangdong Sheng Zhongyi hospital for visiting patients and making a survey. We communicate myocardial ischemia with the patients. We prepared some questions to ask them and we hope to get some useful references about the disease. We asked in detail about the disease and encourage them to establish confidence, adherence to treatment. On the one hand, in this interview, some patients pointed out that the frequency of taking medicine quite bothered him, and almost every patient should take with the emergency treatment drug all the time. We found that most of the patients not only had cardiovascular disease but also had diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease and so on. On the other hand, we know that the healthcare system of China were good but quite inadequate. It definitely reduced patients’ financial burden. But we found that there were still some problems in the healthcare system. We concluded four major problems, for example, low coverage, lack of unity, the high insurance beyond reality and a waste of personal account in the process of constructing the social medical insurance system. After the visit, we shook hand with patients and showed our gratitude to the doctors and nurses who gave us support.
In the progress of experiment, we detected the concentration of cGMP in the cells which we transfected the day before yesterday by ELISA. And we found that the content of cGMP in the third group increased by twenty percent.
Thursday 20/8
We inoculated the shRNA puncture bacteria in different sites, the concentration of AMP in medium was 100ng/ul.

Today we conducted the experiment of No’s positive control. We measured the concentration of cGMP by Elisa. There was a significant difference between adding cysteine 20min later and adding cysteine 30 min later.

We then tried again using PSB1C3 with Rfp for the plasmid backbone instead of linearized plasmid to make it easier for colony selection using red-white screening. Still not got our right construct. Let the challenge begin and let’s do the best for it.
Week 4
Challenge accepted, we did our 3A again. We discussed about our failure for the 3A this two weeks and got some conclusion. Finally for this trial we got some colony which was the right construct BBa_K1387002. We then found the optimum ligation composition and reaction. Ready for another construct for reporter and converter module while waiting for synthetic gene for our main construct.

Week 1
Luckily, the primers were arrived. We ordered universal and spesific primer to check our construct using PCR technique. For optimization, we used gradient PCR technique. By using this technique, we were able to get a good results. Unfortunately, many of our construct were still in pSB1K3 backbone, so we must translocate it to pSB1C3 backbone.
Week 2
In this week we are trying to make our 3A assembly again since we still have some gene construct that must be finished before our synthetic gene comes. From the 3A assembly we got several colony that ready for plasmid isolation. After the confirmation through PCR methode, we did not get the right colony yet, so we must try the other compotition in ligation compotition, because we did not face any problem in transformation. After trying any ligation reaction , we got the optimal compotition for some construct, but the other still become our big mystery. In this week, we are also want to try the construct from UC Davis for Lc Cutinase BBa_K936020 and ethylene glycol converter module BBa_K936024. We did plasmid isolation from that part and transform it to the E.coli BL21 (DE3) We try to test the gene expression and test the product through SDS-PAGE method and we can see the protein band from both of the construct but not as the thick band. We also try to sequencing the positive construct in this week.

Our target in this third week of august is to finish all of the construct except the construct that need synthetic gene due the parts submission deadline is coming. Restriction, purification gell (if needed), ligation, transformation, plasmid isolation, and confirmation is become our routine activities. In this"

ß-glactosidase assay of the Anderson promoters J23100 , J23102 , J23103 in pSBBs1C-lacZ in B. subtilis was performed. The xylose-inducible promoter with the according repressor (which has a constitutive promoter, RBS and terminator) xylR-PXyl was cloned into pSB1C3 and sequenced.
At last Bacillus was keen on integrating the pSBBS3C-luxABCDE-PcgeA!! And the clean deletions of CotZ and CgeA worked out, too!
6-10 August 2012
Germination knockouts: We created four double-mutants using resistance-cassettes to knock out germination genes as follows: cwlD::kan + sleB::mls ; gerD::cm + sleB::mls ; gerD::cm + cwlD::kan ; cwlJ::spec + cwlD::kan. See our Strains Collection . Of these double mutants, we tested three strains in our germination assay. We also created the resistance cassette knockout cwlB::kan.
Finally, the last PstI site could be removed and pSBBs3C-luxABCDE was completed.  Also, the double terminator B0014 was cloned into pSB1C3.
The final Promoter-CotZ-GFP-Terminator constructs in pSB1C3 are ready!! Our Promoter-CgeAmut constructs are finally finished too.

We looked at LO and PP on the cellulose sheet from yesterday and saw that it had lost a lot of its color probably due to evaporation of water

Spun down the 50 ml cultures at 4000 rpm for 10 min and did not see colored pellets so we resuspended and placed back into the 37 °C incubator/shaker overnight to see if color would result
●
Sent in sequencing for SO, DT, and SP
●
We performed a test in the lyophilizer with the chromoprotein-CBD-his-tag chromoproteins we placed on the cellulose sheet Saturday.
●
We started off by freezing our cellulose sheet at -80 °C for an hour and then placed into the lyophilizer for an hour. This is done to remove any excess water and see if the color change is a result of water loss or heat or both
IMG_1638.jpg
Here is our cellulose sheet with PP on the top row and LO on the bottom row before placing in the lyophilizer
IMG_0120.JPG
Here are the chromoproteins after an hour in the lyophilizer. They have lost a little of their color but not all of it. Which helps to see water loss is not the only thing contributing to color change but also heat.
IMG_0121.JPG
Here are the chromoproteins after they have been removed from the lyophilizer. They have gained a little color back just naturally from the water in the air.
●
We next performed heat testing today on the 12 chromoprotein-his-tag constructs
●
First we concentrated our purified proteins by using spin columns and placing 500 ul into each column and spinning at max speed for 10 minutes. We then discarded the supernatant and flipped the column over and spun for 2 minutes at 3800 rmp. We then used this concentrated protein for our heat tests.
●
We pipetted 3 ul of each chromoprotein into a wax well, let dry, and then added another 3 ul to each well.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," training, detailing the explosive/implosive danger surrounding work with an under pressure apparel.
A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses must be worn when manipulating the autoclave.
Liquid nitrogen
We also had a training explaining the risks faced when manipulating liquid nitrogen, and how to manage incidents.  Isothermic gloves, glasses and of course a lab coat must be worn when working with it.
NMR
We used the NMR machine that was kindly made available to us by the MetaToul platform to analyse our culture supernatant. This is a powerful but very expensive equipment, based on the magnetic resonance of the atoms. Due to this, specific rules have to be respected when working with it.
In order to protect the user, access to the NMR is not allowed for people wearing pacemakers, drug pump systems, staples on soft or hard tissue, and pregnant women.
Secondly, in order to protect the technological material, when entering the room the user should not wear a lab coat, nor have anything in his pockets, especially anything made of metal.
Legislation and French Labor Law
INSA Toulouse is a public school for engineers thus the biosafety guidelines are not specific to our institution; the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms are applied.
The regulation on workers' protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No. 94-352 of 4 May 1994) includes microorganisms, cell cultures and human endoparasites which may cause infections, allergies or toxicity.
This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5.)
The Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be set up in research laboratories (including containment), education, analysis, anatomy and surgical pathology, autopsy rooms, and industrial and agricultural facilities where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens.
The rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (and thus in all public facilities working in scientific and technological domains) are set out in the Decree No. 82-453 . This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.
The Decree No. 2011-1177 is related to the use of genetically modified organisms.

The result of the in vivo characterization confirmed the outcome of the in vitro measurements. Again, the CFP-signal was six times higher than the RFP-signal (Figure 6). We cannot name the exact reason for this result, be it a higher fluorescence yield of CFP, a higher expression or faster folding time of CFP. This reasons could be further investigated with e.g. purified protein experiments, western blot. Nevertheless our experiment shows that the CFP-unit of our improved aaRS-test system itself is more suitable for an application than the RFP-unit of the Texas part.
Figure 6: Maximal emission of CFP (cyan) and RFP (red) normalized to the OD600 of the six replicates. The samples were excited at the specific absorption maximum (CFP: 430, RFP: 505, 585).
GFP and YFP/FRET Activity of the Systems in vivo
After the characterization of the CFP- and the RFP-units of the aaRS-test systems, we started the cotransformations of the test systems with some of our aaRS. Namely the CouAA-RS ( BBa_K2201204 ), the Prk-RS ( BBa_K2201201 ) and the 2-NPA-RS ( BBa_K2201200 ). At first the cultivations of the cotransformants were done without their specific ncAA, to investigate the influence of the cotransformation with different aaRS separately.
We compared the variation of the emission signals of the test systems when cotransformed with the CouAA-RS to verify the production of the complete fusion proteins. This is possible due to the limited specificity and fidelity of artificially selected and evolved synthetases. They will always couple native amino acids to the amber tRNA and thus a proportion of the whole fusion protein will always be synthesized.
Figure 7 shows the emission spectrum of a culture of the cotransformants described above. When excited at the absorption maximum of GFP, at 485 nm, we can now measure a GFP-signal at 525 nm, which was not present when no CouAA-RS was present in the cells. Even when the GFP-signal was clear to see, and an expression of the whole RFP-GFP fusion protein was thereby confirmed, we also see a very high emission of RFP. This was caused by the broad overlap in the absorption"

Human Practices overview
Our project this year is to simplify the sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae                         mitochondrial                         genome                         and achieve de novo synthesis. This topic is completely removed from our previous entries, and                         it                         is a                         totally blank                         area for us to explore. Therefore, there are four “Bigger Pictures” that we are enormously                         curious                         about                         and yearn                         to know:
Safety is always the first. Does our subject comply with the relevant laws and regulations? Is                         our                         subject                         within                         the security framework of the iGEM Organizing Committee? How do experts in this field view the                         safety                         of                         “artificial                         life”?
Objectives and significance count. Is this an innovative yet meaningful exploration? Can the                         project                         provide a                         reference or research basis for the further study in related fields, such as artificial life                         research,                         mitochondrial                         research, gene synthesis, etc.?
We do not need to understand the background knowledge of mitochondria, including genetic                         background,                         recent                         research                         progress, etc.
It is imperative for us to understand the technology of gene synthesis, including technological                         evolution,                         the                         latest research progress, mature commercial applications and so forth.
