Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#project#wetlab#assembly#arsenic_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_J33201 (Edinburgh, 2006) to function as the arsenic sensor and to drive the production of BBa_K098994 (Harvard, 2008), which encodes MtrB. ArsR acts as a negative auto-regulator, repressing the expression of downstream mtrB. Because ArsR activity is repressed in the presence of arsenic, MtrB will be upregulated when arsenic is present, increasing the rate of electrode-reduction.
We inserted our arsenic-sensing BioBrick into the pBBRBB cloning vector (Vick et al., 2011) due to its past success in complementation studies [7]. Upon ligation, we transformed competent DH5a E. coli and attempted to transform JG700, our mtrB knockout strain. Because we had no successes electroporating JG700 with our construct, we decided to append a mobility gene and use conjugation to transfer our construct. We first transformed WM3064 with our mobility-enabled arsenic sensing construct. Finally, we conjugated WM3064 with JG700 to create our arsenic-sensing Shewanella strain.

Who are team CLSB?
Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

Casting the gel
1. Select and cast the appropriate base (separating) gel. The amounts of reagents required for two gels with dimensions 0.07 × 14 × 14 cm and containing 10% and 16% acrylamide are given in the table that follows. Do not degas the gel mixtures, because the gel buffer contains SDS. Overlay the poured gels with several drops of water. Leave the gels for about 30 min to polymerize. (Alternatively, precast gels can be purchased from vendors, and the protocol can be started from Step 3.)The freshly prepared ammonium persulfate (APS) solution and TEMED should be added last, immediately before pouring the gels, because these polymerize the gels.
2. Overlay the polymerized separating gel (10% or 16%, or 16%/6 M urea) directly with a 4% sample (stacking) gel prepared as indicated in the table in Step 1, except if resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired. If resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired, then use AB-6 instead of AB-3 for the separating gel and overlay the separating gel with a 1-cm 10% gel, made up as described in the table. The 16% separating gel and the overlaid 10% ‘spacer gel’ can be polymerized together if no glycerol is added to the 10% acrylamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious"

Accessible Science
We have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities...
-- Stephen Hawking
Although equality is a universal human right, prejudice and perceived disabilities too often exclude people with special needs from many opportunities. Especially active participation in Natural Science is much disrupted.
We decided to challenge this status quo. To have a lasting impact, and due to the complexity of this topic, we had to focus our efforts on the needs of one group of disabled people in particular: Visually impaired people.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 253 million people worldwide live with vision impairments. 217 million have a moderate to severe visual impairment and 36 million are blind. In Germany, 1.2 million blind people lived in 2002. Of these, 600 live in Marburg and 150 of them are students of the Philipps University.
That is a third of all blind students in Germany!
Marburg has taken many steps to make the city more livable for blind people. You can find talking bus stops and elevators, shopping aids in nearly every supermarket and special rooms in the library of the Philipps University. One of the reasons why Marburg has become this hub for blind people is the BLISTA. It is a nationwide competence center for the blind and visually impaired. It established the first high school for visually impaired students worldwide. Nowadays, this Carl-Strehl-School is the only high school in Europe preparing blind students for higher education. Despite these ideal conditions, visually impaired students are only rarely found in fields like biology or chemistry.  We intended to show that anyone believing blind people incapable of doing well in these fields is mistaken.
Therefore, the crucial role in our Human Practices project fell towards public engagement and close cooperation with the BLISTA (engl.: German Institute of the Blind) to facilitate equality and accessibility in Science. In the following paragraphs, you can see for yourself.

Hannah is in the process of building a higher efficiency Chemically Competent DH10B cell line. The higher transformation rate will help not only the team but is critical for her CBAR assembly of her construct for the Multiple Start Codon Project. Hannah also started planning and development of a secondary construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project to act as a control for the experiments.
Thursday, June 7, 2012
Kevin and Chris ran a gel to separate another component for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . One of the component did not run well on the gel. This component was amplified again with PCR. Kait and Victoria continued work on the Codon Optimization Project with the digestion of their plasmid, and subsequent gel extraction of the specific components. Hannah continued work on designing the primers for the CBAR reaction to create the control construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Hannah also prepped a culture in an attempt to get a stock culture of DH10B growing. Her goal is to create a higher efficiency Chemically Competent (CC) DH10B cell line to help her complete her CBAR for her Multiple Start Codon Project .

Kevin extracted components for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . from the gel that was run yesterday. Hannah worked more on the design of the primers for one of the constructs for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . Kevin completed a streak plate to create isolated colonies in preparation for the production of more Chemically Competent cells. Kait and Victoria continued their work on their construct for the Codon Optimization Project . Victoria designed primers for their construct.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Our Project#Reporter Systems#tetR_-_-_TEXT.html," As a result, RFP can be expressed in the cell, as shown in the cartoons below:
Gene expression in the cell without ATC:
Gene expression in the cell with ATC:
Here are the results of our ATC induction experiment, performed on the wild-type TetR:
The induction curves show that RFP expression increases with addition of ATC. In the absence of ATC, cells express about 2500 normalized RFUs (relative fluorescence units) when they reach a plateau, whereas at the highest concentrations of ATC we observe 25'000 normalized RFUs. There is a 10x difference between normal medium (without ATC) and addition of ATC, showing that our first readout system is sensitive to ATC concentration. Moreover, expression of RFP in cells without ATC is 10-fold lower than the values obtained for Ptet characterization alone.
We can reasonably assume that this system can be used for in vivo screening: TetR mutants that are not capable of recognizing the consensus Ptet sequence will yield more RFP than other mutants still recognizing Ptet. The 10x difference between RFU values in this experiment seems to be a useful window for characterizing our mutants.
Dose-response
By looking at the dose-response graph, we can see a significant increase between 0 and 200 ng/microL ATC; then the RFU values begin to plateau. The graph shows that the TetR-Ptet interaction has a strong impact on RFP expression. The highest RFUs measured here correspond to the levels of the Ptet-RFP construct alone (in the absence of the the TetR plasmid, see Ptet characterization ), demonstrating complete TetR suppression in our experiments.
TetR mutant characterization
With the wild-type TetR in our system, RFP is repressed because wt-TetR binds to Ptet with a great efficiency. However, mutants can potentially recognize a different promoter sequence than Ptet and thus would be unable to repress RFP expression, as seen in the  cartoons:
Gene expression with wild-type TetR:
Gene expression with a TetR mutant not recognizing Ptet:
We were able to test 6 of our TetR mutants with this first reporter system. For each of them, we inserted the mutated TetR sequence in the Pconst-TetR plasmid instead of the wild-type TetR.
Mutants individual results
For each TetR mutant tested, the individual in vivo characterization results are displayed on their respective Registry page:

When first starting with the project, we could hardly imagine how big the final instalation would have to be for our idea to work in the real world, but also how closely monitored all the parameters would have to be to ensure optimal bacterial growth and production.
AlgEn, where they grow bacteria in an open-pond system the size of a swimming pool, has to closely observe all of the factors that could influence their bacteria. The computer control system is constently measuring the speed of the mixing system, nutrient composition, saturation with carbon dioxide and oxygen, temperature, pH, biomass concentration and the strenght and consistency of their wave generator.
Up until that point, we thought we would only do the standard testing that is ushually utilised in synthetic biology. We would see if our constructs have succesfully ligated with the use of analytical restriction and colony PCR and we would see if the genes are active via SDS-PAGE and Western blot.
Howeevr, once we have seen all the measurments that AlgEn does, we realised that if we ever wanted to present our idea to the public or take it to the next level, it would be necesary to know much more about our bacteria and their growth and metabolism than only if our genes were active. We have therefore decided to envision an optimised system of bioreactors in which our bacteria would grow, and we also decided to do additional testing to see the parameters with which our bacteria would grow best and produce the most butanol.
We tested many factors that might influence the butanol production in our bacteria, measuring the best pH, temperature, biomass concentration and concentrations of butanoic acid and glycerol. You can see our results on our Project  page .

Project Design
Microplastics has been target of many iGEM projects over the past couple of years, scaling with the surge in interest from both the scientific community and the general public relating to the uncovering of the adverse environmental effects of the particles. To ensure that our project would not only meet a previously unmet need but also to optimize the chances of success, we looked at previous iGEM projects and analyzed what had been done and to what degree of prosperity. In combination with reported scientific research and input from both informed scientists and industry, we set out realize our project. We want to thank and acknowledge the following people and groups for positively shaping the course of the project design.
For a comprehensive elaboration of the impact on our project, see Integrated Practices .

3. Human Practices
Our Human Practices consisted of three main components: Summer Pathways, the JoVE Film your Research Contest, and the Circadia Synthetica Art Project. Summer Pathways was an event we held for young women interested in STEM. Its aim was to introduce synthetic biology through four interactive activities. The four activities included running food dye on a gel, a bioethics forum, a plasmid design with paper workshop, and a microfluidic design workshop using cardboard. We also entered the JoVE film your Research Contest. Our video detailed the step-by-step protocol we used to test our constructs in the cell free system. We also included a theoretical overview how the cell free system works molecularly. The final facet of our Human Practices was the Circadia Synthetica Art Project. This project’s main goal was to use art to spark conversation with the general public concerning potential applications of synthetic biology.

1. Integrated Human Practices
Our integrated Human Practices project was multifaceted. We first interviewed, Dr. Zaman, a BU professor involved in cancer and global health research, about the feasibility of our project’s future application as a cancer diagnostic. Dr. Zaman brought up two major points during our discussion with him. First, our device should be able to be used by individuals with little training and fit easily into the current structure of using diagnostics in low resource areas. Second, Dr. Zaman mentioned some technical difficulties our project would run into if used outside of the lab, such as contamination of the system by RNase. We also interacted with the microfluidic company Fraunhofer and discussed how to make our system more amenable to microfluidics. However, we found from this conversation that the current state of microfluidics would not be conducive for toehold switch experimentation. After discussing these concerns with Dr. Zaman and representatives from Fraunhofer, we decided to switch our short term focus to making our project a foundational advance.
We were able to engage with the local community at the STEM Pathways Dinner and Dialogue. We had a conversation with high school STEM educators and local community members about the potential applications of synthetic biology. When addressing recent applications of synthetic biology in these conversations, people voiced concerns that color changing flowers were not leveraging the power of synthetic biology. They felt that a heavier focus should be placed on curing disease. These concerns are addressed in another component of our integrated human practices: our Circadia Synthetica art project.  After hearing these concerns and considering our"

Oxford,2016,Team:Oxford#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"As copper is a redox metal it is both very important in cells enzymes but also very toxic because it leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Consequently Escherichia coli has two systems of detecting excess copper: the CueR-linked system that detects cytoplasmic copper and the CusS/CusR two component system that detects periplasmic copper.  We investigated both systems and by arranging the components to form a positive feedback loop hoped to improve their sensitivity over the range of copper concentrations we were interested in.
CueR linked systems
The E. coli copper regulator CueR: monomer with copper (red) and without copper (cyan) attached to the pCopA promoter showing DNA bending. (cealigned in pymol from PDB 4wls and 4wlw)(6)
E. coli cells use a protein called CueR to regulate the cytoplasmic copper concentration. CueR is a MerR -type regulator with an interesting mechanism of action whereby it can behave as a net activator or a net repressor under different copper concentrations through interaction with RNA polymerase .(7) More information and an animated version of the above image can be found here . CueR forms dimers consisting of three functional domains (a DNA-binding, a dimerisation and a metal-binding domain). The DNA binding domains bind to DNA inverted repeats called CueR boxes with the sequence:
CCTTCCNNNNNNGGAAGG.
This box is present at the promoter regions of the copper exporting ATPase CopA, some molybdenum cofactor synthesis genes and the periplasmic copper oxidase protein CueO.(4)
We constructed different promoter systems based upon the promoter for copA, pCopA:
pCopA sfGFP
The design of part BBa_K1980005
The simplest system we tested was simply the pCopA promoter in front of sfGFP. We found that this system was only weakly copper responsive. This may be because there were 500+ copies of the pCopA promoter located on the high copy plasmid compared with only a single copy of CueR expressed from the bacterial genome. If CueR is only weakly expressed then there would be insufficient protein to bind at all of the promoter binding sites and the genes could not be activated.
A BspH1 site was included at the start codon of the sfGFP so that other proteins with a compatible start (such as the copper chelators we ligated into our pBAD vector) could be ligated into this location.

Introduction
For our project, we decided to submit seven BioBricks to the iGEM Registry in the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. Our submitted parts can be divided into two separate collections (Named as Collection One and Collection Two). Collection One is associated with Engineered biofilm subunit CsgA, while Collection Two is relevant to construction of hydrogenase gene clusters.
All of the constructs are protein-coding parts have been confirmed with gene sequences, demonstrated with expected functionalities, and thus it would be easy to handle for other users. Specifically, in order to make hydrogenase expression more productive, we optimized the gene sequences of 5 hydrogenases parts with the help of OptimumGene™ (GenScript). We changed the codon usage bias in E. coli by upgrading the CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) from a low level (around 0.30) to 0.97.
Characterizations of the parts are included on the webpage of the parts section, but for more information about the submitted parts in real use, please go to Biofilm or Hydrogen page.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#genet_-_-_TEXT.html," into the nucleus of the cell, but the DNA is not integrated into the genome (Handbook, 2013).
Non-viral vectors can also be used for gene therapy. Free plasmids can be delivered into the cells using physical methods such as: electroporation, gene gun, ultrasound and hydrodynamic pressure. Non-viral methods were at a disadvantage because of their low efficiency, but with the development of more efficient vector technology, non-viral vectors are becoming more popular; they can reduce problems that occur while using viral vectors such as endogenous virus recombination, oncogenic effects and unexpected immune responses (Huang & Niidome, 2002).
Biosafety & Bioethics
As promising as gene therapy appears, there are many biosafety issues that it raises. The indisputable concerns are whether transferring genes is safe and whether the transferred genes could lead to harmful effects. Technical issues also exist. For example, the use of retroviruses raised criticism from the start. Because of transgene integration that can cause mutations, the use of retroviruses is considered most dangerous for patients. The main argument against gene therapy is that in the worst scenario, unexpected changes in the genetic makeup of the gene therapy patient may be passed down to offspring. To refute this argument, some scientists say that other therapies such as mutagenic drugs and radiation therapy can also cause genetic alteration that can be passed down to offspring. They argue that these therapies are being used without extensive biosafety concerns (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013).
Bioethical issues are also a great concern surrounding gene therapy. The first concern is that there is no clear boundary on what is a “good” or “bad” use of gene therapy. It is also very hard to determine what traits are normal and which traits should be considered as disorders. Gene therapy might also be used not only to cure a disease, but also to enhance basic human traits such as height and intelligence causing social disparity between the poor and the rich (Handbook, 2013).
Our Project & Gene Therapy
With the background information mentioned above, we have investigated the application of gene therapy for our project. It seems like gene therapy is a feasible method to deliver desired genes into target human cells. Currently, gene therapy, however, is only tested and used for incurable diseases such as cancer and rare genetic diseases (Handbook, 2013). The complication that we want to alleviate, obesity, at this current stage of scientific research is not considered an incurable disease. In fact, many people do not even consider obesity as a"

Uv-Sensitive Trigger
In the genetic Flip-Flop, the amount of LacI to set ON the memory is induced by an UV-sensitive trigger . Production of LacI molecules by UV induction can be tested by replacing the LacI gene with GFP in the UV trigger, so it is possible to have a relation of the strength of LacI synthesis measuring the value of fluorescence.
We realized two new constructs (K079049 and K079050) to test the UV induction. We used two different promoters (J23118 with 1429 strength and J23100 with 2547 strength). These UV test circuits are presented schematically in Figure 4-5.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Team#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"-dinner we got to know Natalie, Fenja and Michael better and had good discussions about several similarities in the iGEM-teams like team compositions, how to embellish the long hours in the lab and general experiences we gained in the competition.
It was not only a great collaboration, but we also had a lot of fun and are very grateful for having gotten to know the iGEM team Freiburg better. We want to thank Freiburg for their help and are very much looking forward to a great time and new experiences in Lyon together.
Collecting Soil Samples for iGEM Team Norwich
As the iGEM team of Norwich worked with the bacteria ''Streptomyces'', which can be found in soil, they wanted to collect samples from all over the world. We found their project very interesting as 'Streptomyces' are an essential organism in our indigoidine project as well. Thus we went to the forest and dug little holes at a couple of different places to collect soil in falcon tubes. All samples were labelled with date, location etc. and send to them for further analysis. It was a lot of fun and a good reason to get out of the lab and into the nature. We hope that the team Norwich could make use of the samples and discovered many interesting specimens in our Heidelberg soil.
Feedback for iGEM Team Purdue
The iGEM Team of Purdue University invited us to support their project by giving input for their plan to create a new standard for biobrick submission, which should lead to more qualitative biobricks. We were glad to help by for example providing our opinion by filling out their survey. Furthermore within a video conference we talked about the ideas of the team and how we think about them, how they would fit to our own needs and how they could implement them. We hope that our reviews were useful to them.

We created plots showing the OD absorption versus wavelength for all timepoint from 0 to 30 hours (top). The plot down left is the OD590 versus OD800. This plot should be linear for every negative liquid culture which doesn't produce indigoidine. The last plot shows the OD of the indigoidine without the cells versus the OD800 from the liquid culture, thus showing how much indigoidine is produced ind a liquid culture at a specific OD.

Our City
Newcastle upon Tyne
We are the team from Newcastle University, which is one of two universities in the North East city of Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom.
The city is famed for its rich history, and its numerous bridges that span the River Tyne, crossing to the town of Gateshead. The city is full of diverse culture, with this partly being shown by short-listed bids to gain the European Capital of Culture title. One of the cities leading museums, the Great North Museum: Hancock, is supported by the university.
Newcastle had large coal mining and manufacturing industries through the 19th and 20th centuries, and has since gained a reputation as a shopping haven and a party-city. It is also the home of a world famous soccer club, Newcastle United , and the beer Newcastle Brown Ale .
Newcastle has recently been famous for being the home, Northern Rock, of the first bank that fell during the 2007 financial crisis.
Past students
Newcastle has had a large number of famous people as past students of the Universities including actor Rowan Atkinson, and singer Bryan Ferry. Newcastle's neighbour Northumbria University was home to Jonathan Ive, the designer of Apple computers recent products including the iPod, iMac and iPhone. Even this year at Newcastle University a member of the royal family is among our freshers students; Princess Eugenie of York, sixth in line to the British throne.
If you want to have a fun time at University, come to study in Newcastle. Whether you want to have a cultured experience in our galleries and museums, party in our amazing selection of bars and clubs, eat stunning food, meet friendly people, or just have the time of your life Newcastle is the place to be!

NCTU_Formosa,2012,Team:NCTU Formosa#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"-called Human Practice, we really think that is very important. By knowing what we are doing, they will understand it can be safe if we conduct experiment properly. Issues raised because of misunderstanding will be eliminated. Besides, in terms of biosafety engineering, we can insert or delete some specific gene in the plasmid of E.coli to restrict its living condition. For example, make it live only in particular medium which can only be made in the laboratory. With combination of above suggestion, we believe that biosafety issues will decrease gradually.

Yiqi Wu
I'm Eulrika Wu, the leader of SHPH team. I introduced iGEM into our school and built up the team from scratch. My major role is to communicate with teachers, labs and team members to ensure every thing we do is on the right track.
Zidi Mu
I’m Zidi Mu and I am one of the leaders of SHPH-Shanghai. I have an interest in life sciences and appreciate the opportunity to design and conduct scientific experiments in high school. iGEM provides me with excellent practical experience in synthetic biology and biotechnologies as I spent days in a hospital laboratory amending and redoing experiments. The experience of leading a team also teaches me to schedule work in advance in order to be fully prepared.
Chuyue Zhang
I'm Victoria, a 11th grader in Shanghai Pinghe school. I’m interested in things related to nature and biology. This summer, I did the Interlab part of our project as well as some experiments in our laboratory.  I learnt a lot during this process and began to find the joy in it. I will also take part in our presentation and some of our powerpoint. I’m looking forward to sharing our result and meeting some brilliant ideas on our trip to Boston(& I hope to still have hair after the junior year)!
Yuxin Zhou
My name is Yuxin Zhou and I am a member of SHPH-Shanghai. Although I am very interested in life sciences, I am not an expert in this field. However, I am really good at communication and have a good command of the ability to promote. As a result, I will be responsible for fully presenting our project. I entered the lab for the first time in my life during the iGEM competition and it had been a fun experience for me. I learned a lot about how to cooperate with my teammates and gained a lot of biological knowledge. It is a truly meaningful experience for me.
Yihua Wang
I’m Yihua(Evon) Wang from Shanghai Pinghe School, and my main role in this team is to write the research paper after the experiments are finished. Since I would like to pursue biomedical science in the future, iGem provided me the valuable opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and bioengineering. I’ve also done other researches on Chinese Traditional Medicine"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#testtest_-_-_TEXT.html," threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.
antibiotic resistance poses a catastrophic threat. If we don't act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can't be treated by antibiotics.
Professor Dame Sally Davies
Chief Medical Officer
March 2013
The World Health Organisation’s antibiotic resistance Global Report on Surveillance, reports increasing worldwide incidences of antimicrobial resistance, in particular antibiotic resistance. This highlights very high rates of resistance in bacteria that cause common healthcare associated and community-acquired infections, such as UTIs [ 1 ]. UTIs account for over 7 million doctor visits per year. Catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are the most commonly acquired infection in hospitals, and there is a high incidence of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria that cause UTIs globally [ 2 ].
Biofilms
Major structural elements of bacterial biofilms.
Biofilms are aggregates of surface-associated microorganisms that are encased in a matrix of highly-hydrated extracellular polymeric substances, which include extracellular polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, as well as proteins [ 6 ]. Van Leeuwenhoek, using his simple microscopes in 1684, first observed microorganisms on tooth surfaces and can be credited with the discovery of microbial biofilms. ""The number of these animalcules in the scurf of a man's teeth are so many that I believe they exceed the number of men in a kingdom."" - Leeuwenhoek
We now know a great deal more about biofilms. Environmental changes are responsible for the transition from planktonic growth to biofilm [ 13 ] and cause changes in the expression of surface molecules, virulence factors, and metabolic status. This allows the bacteria to acquire properties that enable their survival in unfavourable conditions [ 14,15 ], such as in the presence of antibiotics.
The low nutrient and oxygen levels at the bottom of the biofilm give rise to metabolically-inactive bacteria, better known as persister cells. These persister cells are rendered unsusceptible to most traditional antibiotics, which rely on bacterial metabolism to exert cell-killing effect [ 7 ].
UTIs
Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of nosocomial infections and 80% of all microbial infections [ 16 ]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which"

Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Biobricks#Basic Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli, respectively. The GroEL/ES chaperone system promotes the folding and/or assembly of over 30% of E. coli's cellular proteins, is required for bacteriophage morphogenesis and has a role in protein secretion. [2] [3] However, it rapidly loses its refolding activity at temperatures below 37°C. [4] (Figure 1b) Cpn60/10, on the other hand, functions very well at these temperatures.
Ferrer et al. identified 22 housekeeping proteins involved with E. coli 's systems failure at low temperatures. They went on to demonstrate their interactions with chaperones are key determinants of activity at these temperatures. It was shown that the Cpn60 protein from O. antarctica coprecipitates with many of the proteins found in the proteome of E. coli. [5] Also, by transforming E. coli with Cpn10 and Cpn60, they've enabled it to grow even at freezing point. (Figure 1a) Their findings suggest inactivation of a few cold-sensitive key proteins causes systems failure in E. coli, and that cells may be 'rescued' by reactivating these genes.

SheDnaK
DnaK is a 70 kilodalton heatshock protein involved with many different processes. It's E. coli's primary Hsp70 homolog [6] , and its function is mostly regulated by interactions with the smaller heatshock proteins DnaJ and GrpE. It's been debated whether or not DnaK is involved with assembling the ribosome's 30S subunit, but Maki, Southworth and Culver conclusively demonstrated this to be the case. [7] It is also essential for lambda phage propagation, playing a key role in its replication by binding the lambda P protein, disassembling the lambda P:DnaB complex. [8]
Cold-induced inactivation of EcoDnaK, combined with the inability to refold it, is reported to be a causative agent of systems failure in E. coli at low temperatures. [5 ] Yoshimune et al. isolated SheDnaK from the Antarctic Shewanella bacterium"

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where"

Laboratory Safety
In our project, we used BL1 materials E. coli for cloning and BL2 materials Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells for transfection. All students in our team are well-trained. Students who worked with BL2 material received blood-borne pathogens training besides usual lab training. Before our experiment, we made a detailed protocol and communicated with our instructor to ensure that we met the criterion in laboratory. When doing experiment, we wore lab coat, gloves and gauze mask to protect ourselves and all the experiments of BL2 materials were handled in biosafety cabinets. In accordance with MSDS, after finishing experiment, we handled carefully all laboratory chemicals, especially BL2 materials, which were handled with decontamination bleach mixture under ultraviolet rays for 24 hours.
Biological Parts
We constructed 2 basic parts that encoding internal protein in human body and designed 3 scilencing devices . The most hazardous biological parts in our parts are the scilencing devices since they encode the hairpin RNA that do not exsist in human body and they may cause potential risks. We transfected the scilencing devices into HEK293 to scilence the PDE5A gene. To make our parts safer, we designed a hypoxia responsive switch, only under hypoxia situation the down stream parts will work. In our experiment we used lentivirus to packaged our plasmids so that all the transfection experiments were handled in II biological safety cabinet.
Bio-safety of lentivirus vectors
The lentiviral vectors we used in our project are self-inactivating virus, which means that after infecting target cells， virus will not infect other cells, and will not  produce new virus.Although we minimized the risk by modifying the vector design, insertional mutagenesis caused by lentiverus still cause unknowm risks. Quantitative assays have demonstrated that the risk of insertional up regulation of proto-oncogenes is directly related to the strength of the enhancer sequences contained in the vector. Thus before we use lentivirus vectors for clinical purpose, a series of cells and animals experiment should be done to evaluated the safety of lentivirus vectors."

But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say                         no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.

Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre
To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal                         hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the                         biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with                         the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,                         and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear                         farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After                         this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we                         learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese                         medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine                         hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to                         nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an                         alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent.

TARGET ORGANISM: Yarrowia lipolytica
Shortly after the introduction of the project, searching for a potential host began. Initially, we held a meeting with Tom Sousa, a 1st year graduate student in the Bioinformatics Department at UCSC, and an expert on yeast. Tom recommended that we look into using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aka brewer’s yeast. S. cerevisiae is special because it is extremely well studied and is ideal for biological research because of its short doubling time, ability to be transformed, and can be grown as a haploid.
In order to ensure that we were picking the best possible strain of yeast, a few team members continued research on different strains of yeast. Soon after, we discovered Yarrowia lipolytica, another “Generally Regarded as Safe” (GRAS) organism. Although less studied than S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica has several benefits that led us to believe that it would be a better choice for our project:
Y. lipolytica outperformed all alternative hosts in heterologous protein expression and high transformation frequency during homologous recombination of linearized plasmids.
Y. lipolytica can survive on unconventional carbon sources like milk, oil, and glycerol.
Y. lipolytica exhibits low side-product formation and high substrate specificity, which is ideal for producing a single product like progesterone.
Commonly, yeast that are chosen for engineering purposes use the DNA repair mechanism homologous recombination, because it is efficient for inserting genes. Y. lipolytica has a propensity for a less favorable DNA repair mechanism, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). To circumvent this problem, we searched for a strain that had the NHEJ mechanism, which is controlled by the ku70 gene, knocked out.
Our project also required auxotrophic markers for selective screening of our transformants, so we looked for a ura3 and leu"

Kent,2014,Team:Kent#background_-_-_TEXT.html," It converts farnesyl diphosphate into zingiberene and diphosphate in a single enzymatic reaction. Zingiberene (C15H24)  is classified as a sesquiterpene -  a terpene that is characterized by the presence of 15 carbon atoms. It is a consitutient of the ginger oil that is extracted from rhizomes (roots) and is responsible for the pleasant ginger aroma of the plant.
 
 
Use of zingiberene:
Zingiberene contributes to the scents in many commercial perfumes. This is achieved via steam distillation of the ginger rhizomes. These contain approximately 1-3% of the essential fragrant oil, where the major component is zingiberene (34%).
Additionally it also possesses medicinal properties which can be further researched such as anti – inflammatory and anti-cancer.
R-linalool Synthase:
R-linalool is classified as a terpenoid that is found in the essential oil of the Lavandula family that contributes to the lavender scent. It is synthesized by the enzyme R-linalool synthase using Geranyl diphosphate and water as substrates, producing R-linalool and Diphosphate as products (fig2). Lavender is a scent that is employed by the fragrance industry: e.g. soaps, skin lotions, cleaning products, perfumes and other products.
 
 
Production:
There are different methods to manufacture R-Linalool.
Fractional distilliation of the essential oil from plants such as Bois de rose (rosewood), shiu or coriander.
The major sources of R- Linalool are Brazilian rosewood, Chinese and Taiwanese Ho leaf. In for example Freesia, the R-linalool exists as the R-(-) enantiomer only. The chemical synthesis of R-Linalool involves reactants: acetylene and acetone or isoprene hydrochloride.
In the year 2000, approximately 12,000 tonnes of Linalool was produced out of which more than half was synthesized chemically.
Other properties of R-Linalool:
Many researchers have studied the physiological effects of these odours such as sleep, aggressiveness, muscle tension, etc. Experiments conducted by Hardy et al suggested that R-linalool has a significant sedating effect. This is because it is considered that terpenes have the ability to potentiate the GABAA receptor activity in particular regions of the brain.

We have also been invited for a two week training in his science research centre.
On the other hand, our faculty’s immunology specialist Prof. Dr. Bulent Bozkurt spared some time off his deadly full schedule to listen to our project where he asked questions that forced us to think deeper and seek answers for the unanswered questions; this enabled us to strengthen our weak points.
University
Three sets of presentations were held in our university where iGEM and our project was explained. Our intention was to enable each individual studying in our university to discover the intriguing contents of iGEM and what it feels like to be a member of such a rewarding organisation. In total, approximately 400 people including 1st, 2nd and 3rd year medical students listened to us. Many students then asked the following questions: What is application criteria for iGEM? How can I guarantee a place in next year’s team?
Congress
FATUBAT is a prominent congress which has a record breaking attendant number of 1,500 participants each year. Seeing this as a valuable opportunity, we introduced iGEM to the congress attendants and acquainted them on our previous project. Additionally, two workshops on Synthetic Biology and IGEM were held. Our intention in issuing the workshops was to gather the more interested individuals, divert and persuade them to become a member of the synthetic biology community. Different activities such as playing the Canvas Town game designed by Fatih Medical 2011 iGEM team, watching videos and holding a question-answer platform took place which enabled us to exchange ideas and maybe spark a light of interest.
The Dean and Doctors
Our faculty’s dean was only familiar to the word iGEM and nothing else. Therefore a meeting was organised with the university hospital doctors and the dean. Upon listening to our presentation of iGEM and Oncoli, some doctors offered the opportunity of working with tissues they will specially design for oncoli in"

Proof of Concept
The goal of our project was to create a bacterium that is able to bind and terminate cancer cells. Inspired by Team Harvard 2015’s design, we built our construct. The first step was binding. In order to create a bacterium that only binds to cancerous cells, we inserted a colon cancer specific binding peptide (RPMrel) into FimH protein (Kelly & Jones, 2003).
To prove our design and its effect on cancer cells, we first observed specific binding to Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells that was done by Team Harvard BioDesign 2015. Team Harvard had used a dot blot protocol in order to give an accurate image of cancer-specific binding of their bacteria.
The figure above shows the results of Team Harvard 2015’s dot blot protocol.
The second part of the project was termination and for that, we needed to find a substance that is able to eliminate cancer cells. Then, we came across a substance called butyrate. Butyric acid, also found in probiotic substances is a small particulate acid that can be secreted in our intestines that has recently started being used in cancer treatments by scientists (Hassig, Tong & Schreiber, 1997). These effects include promoting differentiation, arresting cell-cycle and inducing apoptosis of transformed colonocytes (Hassig, Tong & Schreiber, 1997). When butyrate enters a colon cancer cell, it inhibits the enzyme, HDAC (Histone deacetylase) which in turn induces p21 transcription, leading the effects mentioned above (Hassig, Tong & Schreiber, 1997). ButCoAT was our best candidate with it’s ability to directly convert Acetyl CoA into butyrate. (Flint et al., 2002).
The figures above show the processes that take place after butyrate (figure a) and vitamin D (figure b) enters the cell. This eventually leads to p21 transcription and then apoptosis. (Hassig, A. C.,Tong, K. J., Schreiber, L. S, 1997)
Our Construct
According to theses two scientific findings, we designed our construct illustrated below.

4.2.1 The effect of promoter strength
For those people who seldom pay attention to model, it is natural to believe that the repressilator will exhibit a stable oscillation. But it is not always May. Most of the models about the repressilator retain some assumptions made by Elowitz and Leibler (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000), including \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \beta_{1(i)}&=\beta_{1}, K_{tl(i)}=K_{tl},\\ K_{R(i)}&=K_{R}, K_{P(i)}=K_{P}. \end{aligned} \end{equation} However the three genes are not identical. Our characterization of the promoters showed that the promoter strengths for these three genes were different. For this reason, we treated them differently by using $i=1$ to index gene cI, $i=2$ to index gene tetR, $i=3$ to index gene lacI. The promoter strength of placI that drives cI was represented by $\beta_{1(1)}$; the promoter strength of pcI that drives tetR in repressilator and drives lacI in toggle switch was represented by $\beta_{1(2)}$; the promoter strength of ptet was represented by $\beta_{1(3)}$.
Figure 4. Dynamics and phase diagrams of repressilator model in two cases. The common parameters we used were $\beta_0=0.03, K_{tl}=6.93, K_{R}=0.347, K_{P}=0.0173$. We emphasized the differences by simulating for a very long time.

The  trajectory forms a limit cycle. (D) Phase diagram of repressilator model with $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$. The  trajectory converges to a fixed point.

5. degBamA, degOmpA, degIgA - Protein degradation rate.
Protein half-life was determined using ProtParam Tool, which uses the N-end rule [4] to determine protein half-life. The estimates given for each of BamA, OmpA, and lgA are >10 hrs in E. coli. In order to reﬂect the inexact nature of these computationally derived half-lives, we screened over possible half-lives of 10, 20, and 30 hours for each of BamA, OmpA, and lgA. Applying prior used degradation rate formula degX = ln(2)/halflife [3], this yielded degradation rates per minute of:
10 hour half-life - 1.16∗10−3 proteins per minute
20 hour half-life - 5.78∗10−4 proteins per minute
30 hour half-life - 3.85∗10−4 proteins per minute
Starting Conditions
In order to examine the eﬀects of higher initial mass of BamA RNA, 6 diﬀerent values were screened over (Tab.  2). Assuming that addition of RNA in IVTT system is between 1 and 5 µg, the masses of sense and antisense strands of BamA in kDa [6] are 830.382 and 820.8, respectively, and conversion is 1 µg = 6.022∗1020 kDa, the number of RNA molecules added can be calculated using the formula µgadded∗(6.022∗1020/((830.382+820.8)/2)).

The primary aim of this model was to identify parameters leading to rapidly-achieved and consistently high levels of BamA under conditions of co-expression of BamA, OmpA, and lgA. Prior to this it was important to identify particular parameters leading to these conditions and to examine some general trends.

Our original project idea was developed around the last example, where light (red light at 660nm and blue light at 470nm) would be used as input to induce switching between the two stable states. The initial ideas behind this was to use the bacteria to create artistic drawing or to track movement in biofilm.
Based on this idea, as well as research of biological switches and the regulatory mechanisms found in phages, we discovered untapped potential in designing a biological switch.

Why modelling?
Computational and mathematical models are useful and effective tools for understanding biology. Molecular biology experiments in vitro are very expensive and time consuming, building models of biological processes as a preliminary step helps to circumvent some of the drawbacks of performing hypothesis-testing in the wet lab. Using models could provide a faster and cheaper shortcut for biologists to gain a better understanding of the newly engineered system.Particularly with the extent of synthetic biology, many of the biological systems that are being researched could not be found in nature because they are genetically engineered, so their behaviors are unknown and need to be characterized.
Gene Regulatory Network
A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of DNA segments in a cell which interact with each other indirectly (through their RNA and protein expression products) and with other substances in the cell, thereby governing the expression levels of mRNA and proteins. Some proteins serve only to activate or repress other genes, and these are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on or turn them off, initiating the production of another protein, and so on.
GRN of I’M HeRE
For one green world, an Intelligent Microbial Heat Regulating Engine (I’M HeRE), as shown in figure 1, was designed to satisfy our needs described in the project. The engine consists of 2 systems namely the heat-resistant system and the quorum-control system.
Fig.1 The gene regulatory network of the intelligent microbial heat regulating . (a) shows the regulatory relationship of these genes. (b) is the detailed diagram of the GRN of the quorum control system.

Background
We are aiming to degrade the blockages in urban drainage systems that accumulate when fats, oils and greases are disposed of down kitchen sinks, bathrooms or drains. Fats, oils and greases are not particularly harmful to the national sewage system when in liquid form, but as the lipids cool down, they congeal and harden. The solidified lipid material is highly adhesive and sticks to the interior crown of the pipes, restricting the flow of wastewater and causing the pipes to block. The solidified lipid blockages have been nicknamed “fatbergs” by the media. Bleach and detergent use is only a temporary solution and merely cause the fatberg to develop further downstream. The fatbergs have the potential to lead to SSO’s (Sanitary Sewer Overflows), which have the potential to unleash raw sewage and contaminants such as endocrine disruptors, pathogens and pharmaceuticals into the urban environment.
A fatberg found in the sewers beneath Kingston upon Thames in July 2013, was estimated to weigh 15 tonnes and reached the size of a double decker London bus. The fatberg had reduced the flow capacity of the sewer to 5% of it’s normal capacity and had the potential to spurt raw sewage out of manholes across the entirety of Kingston upon Thames. The fatberg damaged 20m of pipes which took Thames Water six weeks to clear and involved the closure of a number of major roads in West London for the duration of the summer.
Water UK estimate that throughout the UK there are approximately 200,000 sewer blockages a year. As many as 75% of the afforementioned blockages are"
Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," itself. In both cases removal of an inducer will result in plasmid loss and selection of one of the plasmids and its colour; removal of both inducers should remove both colours. Thus we’d expect that both systems would have the same input-output table. But, there are differences. The auto-repressive circuit maintains the repressor against the surviving plasmid, and so the inducer must be kept in order to maintain plasmid survival. The cross-repressive circuit, on the other hand, loses the repressor against one plasmid as the other plasmid is eliminated. Thus after selection, the switch is permanently set, and all inducers can be withdrawn. We hope that new circuits such as these have new, interesting, and useful behaviours, above and beyond what can be done with classical transcriptional networks. As one example, replication of an auto-repressive plasmid such as the ones we have built is effectively dependent on the presence of inducer, ie the plasmid is now auxotrophic for the inducer. Were such a plasmid to be accidentally introduced into the environment, it would not be able to replicate unless the environment happened to contain sufficiently high levels of the inducer (which is unlikely for artificial molecules) forming a “kill switch” as an additional barrier to environmental contamination of synthetic organisms. Other uses for copy control include plasmid curing, positive selection and plasmid shuffling. See Safety page.
                                  
Fig 12. Alternative repression control. Auto repression: Two plasmids are initially maintained in one cell under selective conditions (Chlr+ /Kan+ /IPTG+ / ATC+). Each plasmid carrying either red or blue regulates its copy number through its own repressor. The absence of each repressor’s inducer results in the loss of the plasmid on which it resides. Cross repression: Plasmid maintenance as above. In this case however plasmids work in opposition. The survival of one demands the loss of the other.  Inputs/outputs: In either case, cells grown in liquid culture would be expected to produce 1 of 4 colours (white included) depending on the inducer input combinations. Varying the ratio of inducers would likely vary both the hue and value in ways that we would have to be determined experimentally (probably not this year).
Where are we now and where are we going?
We now have in hand, all of the parts necessary to build each circuit. We are literally one cloning step away. We also have acquired sufficient"

Granzyme B (GzmB) activity is elevated during inflammation, which can lead to excess cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in human tissue. Aside from causing damage to healthy tissues, this also exacerbates chronic inflammatory conditions, which keeps producing more GzmB and creates a vicious cycle. Our project aims to selectively inhibit GzmB in the ECM in order to prevent damage during chronic inflammation. Since we do not have the means of working with GzmB and directly testing its interactions in human test subjects, we predicted these interactions using mathematical models and data from the literature.
The Hill equation is used to model the interaction between a ligand and its binding partner, a macromolecule/enzyme – in our case, how well a GzmB inhibitor binds to GzmB. It is a function of free ligand concentration, and it returns the fraction of macromolecules that are bound. Two constants are involved in this equation: the dissoci"

We should definitely apply for the COWI fund. This will take some time since they have a lot of requirements for applying. (see http://www.cowifonden.dk/Vejledning_for_ansoegere.asp)

Birthday and fun day at the lab? (Maya, Anja, and Patrick) - 24/06/10
So today was yet another day in the lab, only difference being it was my birthday (Patrick). :D
The serial dillutions we plated of our transformants didnt seem to produce a substantial amount of colonies after having plated them yesterday, so we plated a 10-1 and a 10-2 dilution to get a higher number of colonies.
We purified plasmids from strain SP44, SP45 and SP46 using the miniprep kit, and ran the purified plasmids on a gel to check if our plasmid purification was efficient and successful. There is now a miniprep protocol in the protocol folder.
We also made some -80 freezing cultures of strain SP44-46. To keep track of the future freezing cultures we have made a document called strain bank which we should all use when we make some -80 cultures. It's in the research group-> strain and plasmid folder.
The O/N of SP58 didn't show any growth, so a new O/N was started.
Progress (Maya, Anja, and Patrick) - 23/06/10
So we started in the lab yesterday after having gotten all the needed information from Flemming concerning the FP's (fluorescence proteins).
We started constructing some template plasmids with FP's and markers, and so far its been a fun experience thanks to Hassan.
As things are now we have decided to use the fluorescent proteins mCherry and YGFP as the reporters, though the final template plasmids will include the fast-degradable fluorescent proteins of mCherry and Y"

Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#modeling1_-_-_TEXT.html," from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density (OD) were measured at t1=60 min and t2=120 min after the application of the heat pulse had finished.
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and we split the experiments in two batches. FI and OD were measured at t1=60 min, and t2=120 min for batch number 1, while for batch number 2 the heat shock was delayed 40 min with respect to the first batch. Therefore, measurements for batch no.2 were taken at t1=100 min, and t2=160 min respectively.
During the 40 min delay, the microorganism was growing. Therefore, the heat shock in batch no. 2 was applied to a larger population than in the case of batch no.1. Consequently, the measurements of FI and DO gave much higher values. This fact affects the ratio FI/DO, were the two batches can be clearly distinguished (see figure 4).
Figure 4.
Raw data from the heat shock experiment.
Our first modeling work was aimed to obtain data reconciliation. To this point,  we assumed that, during this 40 min delay, the only thing that happened was that cells grew. Growth was approximately linear in the range analyzed, as seen in figure 1 (blue data). We fitted a simple model DO=p1+p2*t. The result can be seen in figure 5, were:  p1 = 0.161573  p2 = 0.000866314 Therefore, the above ratio FI/DO can be compensated by multiplying data by the fractions (p1+p2*t100)/(p1+p2*t), and (p1+p2*t160)/(p1+p2*t). Actually, what we did was to compensate all measurements to the same time base. The reconciled results can be seen in figure 6.
Figure 5.
Model fitting for OD w.r.t. time.
Figure 6.
Recoinciled data for t=60min and t=120min.
Once we had all data reconciled, we fitted them to a static model relating the ratio between fluorescence intensity (FI) and the culture optical density (OD) with the temperature applied during the heat shock.
Since the model is nonlinear with respect to parameters K1 and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at"

Today is the moment of true!! First test for quantification of GFP induced by mercury in E. coli DH5α. We’re nervous! Will it glow or not?!?!?! We’re going to use for our analysis:
- DH5α with construction BB_Essential + E0840 not induced.
- DH5α with construction BB_Essential + E0840 induced for 4 hours on concentrations 1ug/ml, 0.2ug/ml, 0.1ug/ml, 0.02ug/ml and 0.01ug/ml of mercury chloride.
The procedures were made according to the “Quantification of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) induced by different mercury concentrations” protocol (link).
The average results with or without induction for 4 hours:
It glooooooows!!!! *-*
As we can see on the graph, the fluorescence intensity after 4 hours of mercury induction rises to 3624!! We’re super happy about it!!!
This was the first test. Tomorrow we will have a meeting to make the experiment design!

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

With the same idea, we may use the detector to immediately monitor the mosquito to take precautions against the dengue.
For the future commercializations, we have consulted the patent engineer for applying for patent of Pantide including the DNA sequence, DNA design and the protocols for preparing the effective Pantide products. We hope that the patent may help us develop well for the ongoing entrepreneurship.
Law & Regulation
Q1. Whether the Pantide using in farmlands is a kind of organic agriculture?
Though different institutes have different definitions of the organic agriculture, the main idea is the same. Organic agriculture is based on minimizing the use of external inputs, avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The primary goal is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.
The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement (IFOAM) defines four principles of the organic agriculture and our Pantide conform with all of them:
Health: To sustain and enhance the health of ecosystems and organisms. It should avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides that may have adverse health effects.
Our Pantide is a kind of biorepellent, which is natural and eco-friendly. Compare to the chemical pesticide, Pantide can minimize the harm to the environment and can make a healthier ecosystem.
Ecology: Be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them.
The main idea of our Pantide is the food chain from spiders to insects. We want to choose an ecological way to help the farming but not to harm the environment so we learn from the Mother Nature to ensure our Pantide is sustainable and safe.
Fairness: Should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities.
Pantide is oral-active so that it is only against the insects eating the crops. Also, because of the distinctive mechanism, it only works on the specific species that have adverse effect on the crops. As a result, the Pantide will not harm other organisms to make sure that we maintain the fairness among the ecosystem.
Care: Practitioners of Organic Agriculture can enhance efficiency and increase productivity, but this should not be at the risk of jeopardizing health and well-being.
Consequently, new technologies need to be assessed and existing methods reviewed. Our device can enhance efficiency due to the remote monitor. It can not only decrease the burden of the farmers but also increase productivity. Before using in the practical farmlands, we have tested many times.
Q2. What should we do to get the pesticide permit?

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," was shown to be a vital part of the marine ecosystem because it has the rare ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen under anaerobic conditions, thereby enriching its habitat and playing a crucial role as a provider of essential, bioavailable nitrogen (Coyer et al. 1996) under anaerobic conditions.
Figure 2: Diverse phages isolated from V. natriegens cultures (Zacherey et al. 1974)
Unsurprisingly, V. natriegens has its own predators in its native habitat: Bacteriophages (Zachary 1974). Studies in the 70ies found a link between different phages and the prevailing environmental conditions (Zachary 1978) . This suggests the phages employ a divide and conquer strategy, specializing, thereby limiting competition while improving reproductive success. One phage may have adapted to be effective at lower temperatures, while others prefer higher temperatures. The same applies to other conditions like for instance salt concentration (Zachary 1976). Intriguingly, that opens the possibility of creating genetic parts derived from these phages, applicable to future work with V. natriegens, analogous to the T7 system in E. coli. On the other hand, one study could show, that the phage carrying the toxins associated with V. cholerae could not replicate in V. natriegens (Lee et al. 2016), further showing its harmlessness towards humans.
In contrast to that, some strains of Vibrio natriegens seem to be predators themselves. Confirmed as being pathogenic in several marine crustacea, most notably in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus, in which V. natriegens can lead to mortalities up to 85% (Bi et al. 2016). This is especially problematic since P. trituberculatus is farmed commercially in aquaculture in south-east China. The mechanism of that infection is poorly studied and it is not clear whether all strains of V. natriegens are pathogenic to crustaceans, but it is well known that many Vibrio species cause opportunistic infections in crustacea.
On a more positive note, a recent study could show that the sponge Aplysilla rosea develops a more diverse microbiome when exposed to V. natriegens (Mehbub et al. 2018). It can be speculated that this helps to protect the sponge from pathogenic microbes that then find it harder to colonize its surface.

At present, we have designed three sizes of chips, each chip has a total size of 30 × 30mm, and the height is determined by the thickness of the acrylic. In use, the reacted biological sample is injected into the chip, and each chip can be used to detect a plurality of biological samples. Taking a 9×9mm chip as an example, the chip has a total of 9 liquid passages, one of which is used as a control when used, and the other can detect one sample.
The processing of PMMA chips is relatively simple. If only less than ten disease markers need to be detected, it is more convenient to use PMMA chips. Figure (Fig. 2) is our production process.

Detailed steps to make a PMMA based chip.
Draw a designed chip map using SOLIDWORKS and export it to DXF file format;
Use RDWorksV8 to import the drawn print files into the laser cutting machine.
Place a 2mm thick acrylic plate in the laser cutting machine, set the cutting speed to 5mm/s, start the laser cutting machine, and wait for the chip to be cut.
After cutting the layers of the chip, wash and dry with deionized water;
Arrange, align and align the layers of the chip according to the design;
Clamp the chip with two aluminum plates to make the layers of the chip closely fit together;
Put the aluminum plate and chip into the oven at 170 °C, control the temperature change within ±5 °C, and heat for 14 min.
Take out the heated aluminum plate and chip, and apply a small amount of water to the outside of the aluminum plate with a test tube brush to slowly cool it to a free evaporation state.
Place the cooled aluminum plate and chip in a ventilated place, and then take out the chip after natural air cooling to check whether the bonding is successful. If successful, the chip is completed.

Phase 1 of our policies and practices component begins with an argument for why a new organizational solution is needed to help iGEM participants continue to develop their technology after the competition. A an original graphic depicting how our solution, the Student Research Collaborative, functions is then presented.  Phase 2 presents our group's efforts to organize a collaboration with corporate entity, Anaerobe Systems. In addition to providing a summary of our experience, the case study contains a suite of legal forms future iGEM groups can use to organize their own corporate partnerships.  Phase 3 is fulfills our collaboration requirement by presenting excerpts from three former iGEM participants that have used their experience in the competition to found their own technology startups. It also presents our survey results collected from members of current iGEM teams. Lastly, in addition to the interview and survey portions of our work, our team engaged in special collaborations with iGEM Bielefield and the University of Michigan Biosoft Team.  With Bielefield, we assisted their efforts to draft a set of guidelines for minimizing the risk of a third party synthesizing date rape drugs from the disclosures made in their project. For University of Michigan Biosoft, we help them resolve copyright and trademark conflicts between their protocol database ProtoCat and a similar service offered by New England Bioscieces (protocols.io).

Entrepreneurship is not a novel concept. For centuries scientists, engineers, lawyers, and executives have combined their strengths to deliver new applications of technology to the marketplace. Many of these early entrepreneurs were seen as idealistic, arrogant, foolish, “in need of a real job”, or even a little bit crazy. Thanks to the rise of the billionaire tech entrepreneur demi-gods: Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Jack Ma, and Mark Zuckerberg, the entrepreneurs of today have an improving reputation. Especially in some places like California's Silicon Valley where entrepreneurs are seen as visionary geniuses with the power to connect people and give them more information about their environment.

After the 24 hours the desiccated spores were resuspended in distilled water,  100 uL, before 50 uL was pipetted onto LB media petri dishes to allow for growth for 24  hours.  These plates were placed in a 37 °C incubator and allowed to grow for the  full 24 hours.  Lastly, these plates were removed and analysed for B. subtilis growth.
There was either an excess of colonies seen on the plates, or no growth at all, as seen  in only two plates, long term storage spores at both temperature treatments.  The excess growth seen was likely due to the highly concentrated resuspended mixture of distilled water and spores that was used for plating, or it could be due to the presence of xylose during sporulation.   The most growth was seen under long term storage where xylose was added when bacteria was added  during sporulation.  The remaining treatments had similar growth seen.  This may mean that  providing xylose to the bacteria before sporulation and storage may enable the bacteria to be  able to survive the storage treatment and regenerate better.
