IIT_Delhi,2016,Team:IIT Delhi#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"iiA. However, as  the temperature is raised to 37 deg. celsius, the lambda repressor undergoes  thermal denaturation and thus the system starts acting an oscillator. The second  part ofour project focuses on modifying the oscillator in [3] such that we are able  to tune the frequency response. The frequency tuning is under the control of  light. Addition of an optogenetic component to the system affords us control over  the frequency by simpling shining light on the system; thus, we call the second  system ”Highly Optogenetically Tuned Frequency Modulator” or as we like to  call it, HOT-FM. We desgined the purported optogenetic system using the Ccas-  Ccar system. Simulations support the hypothesis for frequency modulation. The  Biological realization for this part of our project is still under work. Throughout  the wiki, we explain the different stages of implementation for the two systems.  We begin with a very brief review of the work done of oscillators, followed by a  detailed description of the synchronized oscillators of [3]. An increasingly crucial  component of synthetic circuit design is the use of computational resources. In  this regard, first we replicate the results of [3]; and we build on this computational  model to study the effects of our proposed modifiations. Simulations support our  hypotheses regarding the two systems that we have proposed.
Oscillator Circuits
The aim of synthetic biology is to design and synthesize biological networks that  perform desired funtions in a predictable manner. A significant chunk of workin synthetic biology has focused on the construction of two important type of  networks: switches and oscillators. Synthetic biology is at the intersection of  biology, engineering and computational mathematics. Consequently, there are two  distinct aspects to the design, analysis and implementation of a synthetic circuit:  in-silico and in-vivo validation. Under the in-silico paradigm, we forego the specific  implementational details, rather we are focused on the abstract mathematical  model and the dynamical behavior such a model allows. While for in-vivo analysis,  we work on identyfing the specific biological components that can be used to  implement the identified topology for the synthetic network. Here, we look at  both these aspects for the Danino Oscillator [4].

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

In general, the plaques for the mutagenized phage seem to be smaller than the pre-mutagenized phage. From this it would appear that we have large phage! But, it's important to make sure that we have a stable phage, so from here we will be picking the small plaques from the mutant plate and plating them out so we can observe if there is a steady result of small plaques.

UT-Tokyo,2013,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," by cloning it from E. coli BL21 strain. HpaBC catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine and produces L-DOPA (Fig.3a). But the production rate of L-DOPA was low. Then we designed sRNAs knocking down several genes involved in the pathway from glucose to L-Tyr in order to increase the carbon flow to tyrosine synthetic pathway, because the amount is thought to be dependent on that of L-Tyr, the precursor of L-DOPA [4].
We selected tyrR(encoding tyrosine repressor), csrA(encoding carbon-storage regulator, which regulates the expression of enzyme genes involved in glycolysis) and tyrC (phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase) as the targets [2]. tyrR and csrA have been shown to promote L-Tyr biosynthesis in the previous study.(Fig.3b)
Because these sRNAs are thought to damage the growth of E. coli, we tried several promoters having different strength.

Improvement of H2 Productive Capacity of E. coli
In 2012, we UT-Tokyo made ""H2 E. coli"", which produces more H2 than usual E. coli. This year we tried to improve its H2 productive capacity further by designing anti-hycA.
E. coli naturally produces hydrogen through a process called mixed acid fermentation (MAF pathway) (Fig.4a). HycA represses the transcription of the proteins of FHL complex, which produces H2 from formate.
Last year we tried to derepress it by introducing plasmids including many decoy binding sites in our project ""Inhibition without knockout"". This method has several methods. It allows to knockdown by introducing BioBrick parts and does not make scars on the candidate's genome. But it can be used only for DNA binding proteins and the strength cannot be regulated without changing the plasmid.
Though the merit of ""Inhibition without knockout"" is retained in knockdown with Hfq protein-dependent sRNAs, our new method does not have these demerits.

Acrylamide detection
Contents
1 Hemoglobin-based sensor

Hemoglobin-based sensor
The main indicator of exposure to acrylamide are adducts formed at the N-terminal valine of both hemoglobin chains. These modifications can (and have been) be detected by coating a glass electrode with human hemoglobin an measuring changes in intensity to voltage ratio (Krajewska, A. et al.). We wish to create a cheaper and simpler variant of this detection system by applying E. coli strain that produces functional human hemoglobin (a modification of BactoBlood system created by Berkley 2007) with both α and β chains fused with split fluorophore fragments derived from sfGFP (superfolder GFP) protein (Zhou, J. et al.) at the C-terminus. Constructs expressing each fusion protein would be transformed into two separate E. coli cultures, which would then be exposed to a solution containing acrylamide and lysed by inducing one of two kill-switches designed this year (see: Safety).
As the presence of acrylamide adducts at the N-terminus of hemoglobin chains results in a decrease of mutual affinity, it is also expected to lead to a significantly weaker fluorescence in relation to controls. There will be two negative controls:
detection system in a solution without acrylamide
bJun/bFos proteins (see: BiFC toolbox) fused with the same split fluorophore fragments and exposed to the same acrylamide solution. Interaction between those proteins should not be affected by acrylamide
Subunits will be expressed separately, as the formation of functional fluorophore is generally irreversible. sfGFP was chosen for this system, as superfolder mutations result in better resistance to unspecific quenching:

The precipitate formed in following step 7 does not pellet well after centrifugation in step 8, and hence the suspension needs to be removed immediately to prevent resuspension.
The inversion in step 6 needs to be done gently so that genomic DNA of the bacteria are not extracted along with the desired plasmid DNA.

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," on human subjects. This training included topics such as: .
Local Rules and Regulations
The Occupational and Environmental Safety Office of Duke University covers safety concerns and compliance. We are working directly within the Lynch lab, which are compliant with and in communication with this office, and we have completed the required safety training that they provide. The guidelines are as described in the Duke Biological Safety page.
Organisms and Parts Used
The chassis organisms used for cloning are the E. cloni strain of Escherichia coli by Lucigen, which are in risk group 1 [1]. They were acquired from the Lynch lab.
Project Risks
Duke iGEM's goal is to design a thermostable variant of griffithsin  in E. coli for lateral flow assay applications. Our objective is to produce and characterize pieces for implementation into a lateral flow assay.As such, our project mainly deals with modeling, cloning, and heat assays. After our project, the lectin we design would be used in E. coli fermentation. During the duration of our project, and in future experiments related to further characterization of our parts, active HIV/ZIKV virions are NOT necessary. The structure of HIV and ZIKV are well documented. As a result, the specific epitopes on HIV and ZIKV were isolated and used without the risk of infection.
Laboratory Risk Factors and Mitigation
The biggest risk we work with is SYBR Stain, which is a mutagen and irritant, although we use it in small concentrations. Another risk is the antibiotic chloramphenicol, which is strongly anticipated to be a carcinogen by the National Toxicity Program [2]. The E. coli that we use are derived from a K-12 strain and therefore are not particularly dangerous to humans. However, contact with bacteria could still lead to infection or illness, particularly if the bacteria are ingested. In our lab, we wear gloves, sterilize waste, and keep chemicals in cupboards.
Future Risks and Applications
The project is harmless to average real people because the product is a manufactured rapid test, meant to be self contained and non-infectious. The biggest risk of the project would be to healthcare workers administering the rapid tests to HIV infected persons. To mitigate the risk of HIV infection, administrators of the test should wear gloves and properly dispose of biologic materials and tests.

c) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
All the biological materials used in our lab are safe, and all the products of the coding sequences are innocuous to human, so the risk of malicious misuse is low.
A regular safety briefing and a lecture about the basics concerning of biotechnology and genetic engineering are basic elements of our education at the SCUT.
The handling of biological material and safety aspects of chemicals are explained.
A safety briefing was held for all iGEM students by Zhenwu Zhang who is the responsible person for our lab safety.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
a) What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
If our design works and is introduced into a commercial/industrial product, it means the E.coli which can product polyketide will be immune to certain pathogens. This might exert pressure on the survival of these pathogens. Also, pathogen-resistant E.coli would threaten the survival of natural E.coli.
b) Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
The plasmids we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"The growth of E. coli cells transformed with plasmids containing wild type tyrosyl-tRNA/synthetase and oNBY-tRNA/synthetase on LB solid as well as in LB liquid is not affected by concentrations of gentamicin up to 30 µg/ml, whereas a wild type E. coli BL21 DE3 gold is affected already at 5 µg/ml. Hence, appropriate concentration for gentamicin plates and cultures is 30 µg/ml. This observation is also valid for 50 µg/ml kanamycin tested with transformed reporter plasmids in E. coli BL21 DE3 gold.
Furthermore the combination of the two antibiotics is evaluated. Since the cells showed a proper growth rate in LB with 30 µg/ml gentamicin + 50 µg/ml kanamycin when transformed with a reporter plasmid and a synthetase plasmid the assessed concentrations are kept.
Figure 1: antibiotics test - growth on plates with gentamicin in concentrations: 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 µg/ml
Determining Concentration of Antibiotics in M9 Minimal Medium
By cultivation of cells transformed with one of the two types of plasmids (antibiotic resistances: kanamycin/gentamicin) and incubating on plates with different antibiotics concentrations the correct working concentrations were found. After having tested the growth on plates we cultivated the cells in liquid medium with the same antibiotics concentrations to also check it under this conditions. For this determination we evaluated the growth on the plates and in the test tubes. To make sure the cells kept the plasmids we performed a colony PCR (plates) or plasmid isolation (liquid) followed by gel electrophoresis.(picture) With the found concentrations we performed the same experiment but with both plasmids and antibiotics at the same time to find a proper concentration combination of both antibiotics. It was high enough to have an appropriate pressure on the cells, but was low enough, so that cultivation was  possible in minimal medium. The growth on microtiter plates was as well evaluated via plate reader.
Our chosen concentration where E. coli is growing and reliably keeps both plasmids can be found in the following list.
Concentrations used in M9  solid medium with E. coli BL21 DE3 gold:
Gentamicin 10 µg/ml
Kanamycin 50 µg/ml
Concentrations used in M9  liquid medium with E. coli BL21 DE3 gold:
Gentamicin 5"
Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#Manufacturing Considerations_-_-_TEXT.html," the whole system.
Another important aspect of quality control is safety. To minimise risks associated with our product, we have chosen a GRAS (generally recognised as safe) chassis. In addition, The E.ncapsulator's DNA is deleted prior to ingestion (Module 3). This will protect against the risks of horizontal gene transfer and colonisation.

Once media is cool, add other desired ingredients. Use the magnetic stirrer to mix, but do NOT add a stir bar now, or the media will be contaminated. (If one wasn't added before, you must do without.)
Pour agar into plates
Common additions include:
Ampicillin (stock 100mg/ml, final 100ug/ml)
Kanamycin (stock 50mg/ml, final 50ug/ml)
Chloramphenicol (stock 50mg/ml, final 10ug/ml)
To achieve final concentrations, add 1mL of stock per 1L of media, except for chloramphenicol, where 0.6mL per 1L of media is added instead.
Pour directly from the flask into sterile petri plates. Use a quick pass with a Bunsen burner flame to eliminate any bubbles that form during pouring. Do not subject the plate to continuous heat or the plate will melt, and the heat sensitive ingredients added in the previous step will be destroyed. Bubbles can allow cells to access nutrients without being exposed to the plate's antibiotic, and should be blown out immediately before the gel can set. It's a good idea for one person to pour while another flames bubbles.
Allow the plates to stand right side up overnight, or until the gel sets if they are needed sooner. Plates should be stored upside down to keep condensation from falling on the media. Store petri plates in the plastic bags they ship in, in the 4 degree cold room.

Péclet Number
We collaborated with the IISc Bangalore 2017 team, who is also working with gas vesicles,  and they informed us that diffusion plays a significant role in the buoyancy of the bacteria. Diffusion’s importance is highlighted by their Péclet number (Pe) calculation: the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity by the flow to the rate of diffusion of the same quantity driven by an appropriate gradient. This is calculated by taking the product of Reynolds number and the Schmidt number. If the Péclet number is extremely small compared to 1, diffusion is dominant over advective transfer and must be considered during our calculations.

Throughout the development of our genetically engineered machine we have also collaborated with other mexican and international teams in different ways to enrich each other's project.
1.- Meetup
The three mexican teams met in July to present our projects, get feedback from each other and plan a collaboration. This was the start of a Science Experiment Manual collaboration; a handbook that aims to introduce elementary school kids to science. This meetup helped us realize our areas of improvement to get better prepared for the Giant Jamboree. This event helped us establish closer relationships with the other iGEM teams, which consequently led to more collaborations.
2.- Science Experiment Manual Collaboration
Focusing on the importance of spreading science to the general public, and most importantly to those in their early stages in life, we collaborated with the two other mexican iGEM teams; team TEC CEM, and team TEC Chihuahua. We created a fun science experiment manual for elementary school students in which we aim to get children involved with science by creating science. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated with the proposal of 10 different experiments according to the national education plan, making a total of 30 experiments. We validated them in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities through the manual and in the long term, to increase the scientific development in Mexico and to make progress in our country.Focusing on the importance of spreading science to the general public, and most importantly to those in their early stages in life, we collaborated with the two other mexican iGEM teams; team TEC CEM, and team TEC Chihuahua.

Bacteriophage Based Biosensors
While our use of bacteriophages or their receptor binding proteins (RBPs) as a biosensor is not a novel technique, our bacteriophage tail biosensor is essential because it allows for the detection of E. coli using a colorimetric assay. Some previous studies using bacteriophages as a biosensor have required the use of fluorescence and portable flow-cytometry for detection [1]. While techniques such as these are highly sensitive, the instruments required for such detection are rarely accessible to the average person. Derda et.al. developed a technique which requires that the bacteria be infected with the bacteriophage before detection can take place [2]. However, our concept does not require and indeed it is incapable of infection. Thus, if any E. coli is present in a sample, our bacteriophage sensor won’t affect the potential signal. In addition, our sensor will rely on a substrate and the use of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to produce a detectable color change. This color change could either be observed with the naked eye on site or quantified in a laboratory using photospectroscopy. Ultimately, there is a wide variety of bacteriophage based biosensor techniques that have been documented in the scientific literature [3]. However, very few of these diagnostic techniques have made any major impacts either in water testing or in other applicable fields such as medicine, agriculture, and food science [3]. Our project simply aims to provide a fast and easy to use alternative.

Water Contamination
Two billion people worldwide are utilizing contaminated drinking water [3]. Water can be easily contaminated, so the importance of testing drinking water is crucial. Contaminated water, namely that which is polluted with fecal matter, is a critical issue because it is a source of bacteria which can cause serious diseases.
Water can be contaminated with untreated waste in a variety of ways. Storms can cause sewers"

Summer School for High School Students
In order to extensively propagandize iGEM project, we conducted several welfare activities for high school students. We carried out a public lecture in Shaoxing No.1 Middle School, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, the theme of which was about present research of life sciences and development of synthetic biology. We focused on analyzing of some well-designed projects, such as the Coilsweeper, which was presented by ETH_Zurich in 2014 iGEM Conference. Besides, we introduced a ""summer course"" for students in Zhixin High School, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. Our activities were very successful as most of the students presented impressive insights to iGEM, some of whom showed their gratitude to our enthusiasm and decided to keep in touch with us in the future.
2015 iGEM Conference Hosted by National Chiao Tung University
NCTU-Formosa successfully operated a conference last year and this year they have done better! 2015 International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference was a great success and it is a great honor to be invited.
This year, SYSU_CHINA presented in NCTU conference. We are quite excited that our project, Micro-timer, for which we prepared a presentation and designed a poster, really attracted many attenders, which arose utmost praise and encouragement to us all. The host, meanwhile, also left us an impressive thought that they have changed E.coli into probes, which was a bold design that broadened our horizon.
NCTU conference also provided us with an opportunity to communicate with other schools and teams. Thanks to the conference, we've found some drawbacks in our project when we communicated with other teams, and now we've tried to get rid of them. Besides, we've successfully established cooperative relationships with ZJU, SJTU & THU respectively. NCTU conference is a great communication platform for iGEM teams in Asian-Pacific Region. We sincerely hope NCTU conference can attract more teams and be more influential.

After the preliminary determination of the project, each The tasks of the group are gradually becoming clearer. When we communicate with each other, we all have one thing in common. Most of us have a number of positions, which also strengthens the communication between groups. It shows that iGEM is a common combination, although there are different combinations. Division of labor, but everyone does not work separately, but is always closely linked.
Through the exchanges with the iGEM team at Xiamen University, we have a better system in the whole construction process of the team, and we have more experience in the future recruiting, and all aspects are more organized.
Fudan
We received the the plasmids with synnotch and surface-expressed EGFP from iGEM 2018 Fudan Team , which constributed to the construction of our upstream circuit.
ZJUT-China
By chance, we contacted Zhejiang University of Technology and hoped to communicate on the construction of the website. The two sides mainly conducted in-depth and multi-faceted exchanges on WIKI production and writing details, and also shared some problems they discovered during the construction process, reminding the other party not to make mistakes on this issue. Later, we discussed layout development, grammar optimization, and emerging Web development techniques.
Throughout the construction of the entire webpage, with the exchanges between our two parties, there will be some places that have suddenly realized each other, and they are very rewarding and have established a profound team friendship.

We conducted a miniprep of 20 colonies from overnight cultures from the cells transformed with the naringenin operon, however bands at 2kb were observed for all except colony 19 with a 7kb band matching the size of the operon and the plasmid. Carried out a PCR using primers for the start and end of the operon and reactions for each segment, to check if the operon has been taken up in colony 19. However the primers did not bind, but sent colony 19 off for sequencing. We treated the backbone with DPN1 to clear un-circularised backbone, and repeated Gibson assembly.
Week commencing: 1/10/2018
This week we set up growth curves for Exeter iGEM team in order to help them understand how perchlorate affects soil bacteria. We incubated our 3 nitrogen fixers at 30°C in a 96 well plate with varying concentrations of perchlorate salt and recorded their growth using a plate reader.
The gentamycin resistant transformant Pseudomonas sp. was characterised to quantify the strength of resistance.
Mini-preps of a further 25 colonies showed a single colony with a 7kb band matching the combined operon and plasmid size, so we conducted a PCR of the genes within colony 23, which resulted in the primers not binding to the sequence. Result of the sequencing came back but were inconclusive for colony 19 and colony 23 was incorrect.
Week commencing: 08/10/2018
As the Giant Jamboree draws close, we cut key-rings to begin preparation for the Giant Jamboree.
We have also been storyboarding our presentation for the final in Boston. To advertise our presentation / project we have produced a flyer to hand out at the jamboree.

Duke,2010,Team:Duke#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," distinct and recurring structural motifs in isolation of spacing sequences, meaning that synthetic zippers would be produced with essentially interchangeable parts to provide them with unique specificity (11,12).
Design
The research will be conducted by generating a variety of synthetic bZIPs with unique dimerizing specificities, initially by using design methods originally proposed by Krylov & Vinson (12), then by using a variation of the Random Assembly PCR method initially pioneered by the Heidelberg 2009 iGEM team to produce a helix and binding site library ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References ).
Dominant negatives of the leucine zippers would be produced by both the original method determined by Charles Vinson (12) and by in silico design and synthesis based on specificity to dimer and binding sequences, as well as by recombining recognition sequences of existing leucine zippers. As there are hundreds of mammalian leucine zippers with independent dimerization sequences and largely conserved structure (12) this would allow for the generation of a very large toolkit of promoters regulated by uniquely specific leucine zippers.(1,4,12,15) Leucine zippers have very specific DNA binding sites, so in order to design promoters that responded to them, we would replace the cI repressor binding sites in the cI promoter, thereby preventing transcription once the zippers were bound. (10,16,17) Synthetic leucine zippers will be characterized by their dimerization and DNA binding specificities using a series of fluorometry assays tracking reporter gene expression rates, and cross dimerization between synthetic leucine zippers will be analyzed with an in vitro protein interaction assay that was initially used to characterize the dimerization properties of Fos and Jun (15). Significance: Tunable gene expression has been found to be of great use in the development of synthetic biological systems (14), and basal regulatory noise is often problematic in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology (8,9). The characterization of a toolkit to provide modular and tunable gene expression would allow synthetic biologists to design and produce complex expression pathways by making consistent and robust gene regulation methods more easily available.
High Throughput Expression Screening of Synthetic Gene Libraries
Introduction
For the application of this project and others, we are developing a gene expression screen to match the high throughput of DNA synthesis machines. This would allow us to synthesize combinatorical gene libraries of codon variants, and then characterize each variant's effect on gene expression. We hope that this would"

Ways leading to a standardized bio-engineered-world
    In 2003, the first attempt to make a synthetic biology a discipline that everyone can share about it was made. After the appearance of the first BioBrick(tm), the concept about standardization had been widely accepted. And it is a trend in synthetic biology now.
    Thanks to the standardization, biologists have developed many useful tools with the help of the standardized parts, the BioBricks. These BioBricks really contribute a lot to the research field. And they make easier for researchers to communicate with each other under the same technical standards. Due to the convenience of BioBricks, thousands of BioBricks have been created and introduced during these years. Thus the database containing these BioBricks is getting larger and larger.
    But here comes the problem. Since every one can share their BioBricks, sometimes the information of the BioBricks are incomplet when they submit. So it becomes hard for users to search for a BioBrick that they want. Although there is an RFC, RFC 52 already, but we are not satisfied. Because of the generl description of it, the database of the BioBricks is still a mess. So we want to create a new RFC to replace RFC 52.
    We want to establish an RFC to describe the minimum information for a qualified BioBrick. We listed the minimum information a BioBrick should have, and gave a short description for each of them. Especially, we want to qualify the classification of BioBricks. All the BioBricks should be organized, so that users can search for it easily.

PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σx for activation, so genes downstream the promoters will be translated only if σx is present. Hence, by using fluorescence protein as a reporting mechanism, this σx, PcelA and PcomFA promoters system could be further utilized as a specific reporter device in E. coli DH10B strain that could be used by iGEM communities.
σx-ComW mechanism
Figure 2. σx - comW Interaction Diagram
σx and ComW protein are both produced by a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for PcelA and PcomFA promoters induction, and ComW protein is required for σx stabilization. ComW protein acts as a barrier that protects σx from being degraded by ClpXP degradation enzyme, hence it increases the production of σx. The increase in σx production will increase the expression of green fluorescence protein by PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
To complete the story of competence regulation mechanism from S. pneumoniae, we would also like to integrate another positive factor involved in competence regulation which was later found out to be ComW. Prof. Morrison's lab released another research paper on the identification of a new component in the regulation of genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae. The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the quorum-sensing system and is required for a high-level of competence (Luo, Li, and Morrison, 2004). Coexpression of ComW with σx restores the accumulation of σx and the expression of late genes as ComW contributes to the stabilization of the alternative sigma factor X against proteolysis by ClpXP and is required for full activity of σx in directing transcription of late competence genes (Piotrowski, Luo, and Morrison, 2009).
Based on these findings, we tried to integrate this ComW into the mechanism to see whether and how the presence of ComW affects σx. First, we cloned out the comX gene expressing σx and comW genes from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 strain. We then used BBa_K880005 (consisting of constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and strong RBS BBa_B0034 ) from the BioBricks to express those genes.

Alzheimer's Disease
Most people have heard of Alzheimer’s disease and could probably name some symptom, like memory loss or confusion. Then again some people would also just clump together those symptoms with getting older, as if it is a normal part of aging. And since there are an increasing number of older people today than ever before, due to the average lifespan is getting longer and longer thanks to improving life conditions, more people should experience the side effects of growing older. But cognitive brain disease is not a normal part of aging. It is not a side effect, it is a disease that we should be able to prevent people from getting.
In 2015 around 46.8 million people on Earth was living with Alzheimer’s disease and a new brain is affected by the disease every 3.2 seconds.[1] By 2050 it is estimated that around 106.8 million people will be affected by the disease which is excluding the people who are secondary effected by the disease through a loved one who is sick. [2] Alzheimer’s is a kind of dementia where the patient suffers from memory lost, problem with thinking and strange behavior which means that the patient's needs constant care, and patience. The disease’s course takes time, once a person has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s they are expected to have an average lifespan of 4-8 years. [3]
It can take time before the symptoms can get noticeable but it will almost always get worse over time. The use of the word almost here is due to the fact that people get affected by the disease in different ways and it is often hard to generalize when everything about the disease is so personal. But one thing we can generalize is that there are typically three stages: early stage, middle stage and late-stage, or mild, moderate and severe stages. [4] The hard part is to determine in which stage a patient is in at the time of diagnosis.
The majority of patients gets the disease when they are 65 years or older. But there are exceptions,  types of early onset Alzheimer’s where people are in their 40s or 50s. This kind of Alzherimer’s is often much harder to diagnose since it is easily mistaken for stress. [5]

Figure 2: The wells in this gel contain the following, 0-9: hyperladder 1, Top10 FimA, Top10 FimD, Top10 FimH, MG1655 FimA, Negative control(water) FimD, MG1655 FimH, Negative FimA, MG1655 FimD and negative control FimH. Evidently, MG1655 and DH5α contain the three genes and therefore produce pili natively. Meanwhile Top10 lacks all three and so does not produce pili.
The other strain identified in the literature as potentially lacking the fim operon was Top10. A similar procedure was used as above, involving a genomic extraction and an enzymatic amplification of the genes of interest. Once more, the MG1655 strain was used as a positive control. The PCR products were run down an agarose gel and the results showed that Top10 does not contain the three genes of interest and so does not have the operon or natively produce pili.
Overall, these results confirmed that MG1655 would be ideal as a positive pili producing control and, that Top10 would be a suitable chassis for our modified pili whereas DH5α would not. In addition two further chassis strains were chosen, the E. coli K-12 FimB knockout strain (JW4275-1 from the Keio collection Baba et al) that the Harvard 2015 iGEM team demonstrated did not produce pili and the E. coli K12 FimH knockout strain (JW4283-3 from the Keio collection Baba et al) which is deficient in the gene that we specifically wanted to modify. Finally, E. coli BL21(DE3) was used to allow initial protein expression to be investigated using the T7 promoter.

The modular cloning strategy (described in the materials and methods) was used an attempt to build plasmids containing either: the fim operon under two different promoters; or six modified versions of fimH (and wild type fimH) under for different promoters.

     Because the max pooling output is the two-dimensional tensor, we will flatten the max pooling output to one dimensional tensor for further full connection layer.
     After flattening the max pooling layer, we will use the full connection layer to classified the max pooling result, full connection layer is a basic Neural Network layer that that can switch the max pooling layer output into the high dimensional space and then classified them into two classes, negative(diseases that would not happen) and positive(diseases that would happen).
     Finally, after using the full connection layer to convert the max pooling output into high dim space, the model then classified them into two classes, negative(diseases that didn’t happen) and positive(diseases that haven’t                     happened).
     However, the network output was (a number that) hard to be realized by humans , so we used the softmax function to transform it into the diseases happening probability. Here is the formula of the                     softmax function:
$$ {\displaystyle \sigma (\mathbf {z} )_{j}={\frac {e^{z_{j}}}{\sum _{k=1}^{K}e^{z_{k}}}}} $$
     So on, the model output can be easily realized by machines and humans, and next let’s talk about how we defined our model cost function and the optimizer.

     We chose the cross-entropy as the network cost function because it performed well that the exclusion classification mission. Here this the formula of cross-entropy.
     Suppose H is a cross-entropy function, y'i is the real label, and the yi the network prediction output, the cost is
$$ H_{y'}(y) = - \sum_{i} y_{i}^{'}log(y_{i}) $$
     Parameters of the Neural Network were being optimized by Adam optimizer, which is a most commonly used ways to optimize the network.
     After training, the model will be tested by independence test data, and the result was shown below.

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," connects one to employers and boosts résumés. While tangible impacts of iGEM form the basis for the rest of this paper, iGEM is at its heart an educational venture and its educational benefits should not be underestimated.
Section Three
This section lays out our analysis and interpretation of 82 publications by iGEM teams. In total, we expect a given iGEM team to publish 0.025 papers. This buttresses the point that the purpose of iGEM is primarily educational. However, iGEM teams do contribute to the synthetic biology literature to some degree, particularly those that fare better at the Jamboree by winning gold medals or being named finalist teams. When a team does publish, it is evidence of educational success far beyond what one would expect of a team of undergraduates. According to Ontario’s Degree Level Expectations, this is an educational outcome that one would expect at the doctoral level. We cannot say for certain what causes success at the Jamboree or publication- it could be that high-performing teams do well because their undergraduates are more meritorious, or have access to better resources, like lab materials, graduate-level advisors, or Primary Investigators. However, we do know that this is evidence that participation and success at iGEM provides large educational benefits, and that any barrier to participation and success- lack of interest among students, lack of access to lab space and materials, lack of funds for registration, lack of access to qualified supervisors, advisors, or PIs- should be lowered in the interest of creating a labour force with the skills to succeed in the rapidly-growing field of synthetic biology.
Methodology
We define an iGEM publication as any paper published in an academic journal that is coauthored by at least two undergraduate team members and on a subject discussed on the official team webpage or wiki. We found these papers by using the ‘onesearch’ function available to students at the University of Toronto, which searches all journals and databases accessible to University of Toronto students at once. These papers can be separated into three categories: 35 full research articles, 9 other pieces of writing (technical notes, reports, etc.), and 38 articles published in two special journal issues specifically featuring the work of iGEM teams. We define an iGEM team as any team that applied, was accepted by iGEM, and registered.

Introduction
Background
Tuberculosis (TB) ranks as the 2nd leading cause of death among various infectious diseases [1]. The fact that earlier diagnosis and treatment indicate better prognosis attaches great importance to the diagnostic services for TB patients. The current methods include tuberculin skin test, blood test and sputum culture. However, tuberculin skin test is not sensitive, blood test is risky and sputum culture needs a waiting period as long as 1-2 months which will delay timely treatment. Methods based on nucleic acid detection (NAD) are highly sensitive, safe and rapid; however, they are not widely applied to clinical practice. Why?
After consulting some front-line practitioners of TB control, we found that NAD has high false positive rate because non-specific amplification frequently occurs and current methods of NAD are not able to read out sequence-specific information; this makes them barely reliable. What' more, NAD requires expensive and clumsy instruments which are not accessible to rural areas where TB is epidemic (For more detailed information, see Human Practice). Therefore, Peking iGEM 2015 is devoted to building a new reporter system that enables NAD to be specific, reliable and less instrument-dependent.
CRISPR
To improve the specificity, we need a system that can read out sequence information directly. The first thing coming to our mind is the clustered regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, which is originally from prokaryotic immune system [2]. Cas9 is a sequence-specific, DNA cleavage protein guided by single-guide RNA (sgRNA); they form a complex and can be easily programmed to recognize any target sequence [3]; in previous studies it was engineered to"

Collaboration
Our team has collaborated with various other iGEM teams in the UK. With University College Cork (UCC iGEM), we worked together to produce a guide video on how to run a children’s science engagement activity using bacteria.
We provided Imperial university with growth data for Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. This data, unavailable to Imperial otherwise, helped in the development of their co-culture software.
In exchange for the use of Kent's Atomic Force Microscope, for imaging Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 adhesion to our electrode material, we modelled some proteins structures for them. For more information click here .
We also took part in the UK iGEM meet up hosted by Westminster University iGEM. Here we and many other teams presented our experiences so far and discussed each other’s projects.
Human Practices
Hethel Engineering: We approached Hethel Innovation to discuss our project to gauge where a project like ours could fit within the industry. We also wanted to show people working in industry the potential role synthetic biology could have within the renewable energy industry, as well as trying to build lasting links between industry and the researchers here at UEA and the NRP. To read more about our meeting click here .
SCVA Summer School: We were approached by supervisors of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts' Summer School about a painting with bacteria activity for children aged 8-12. The activities would link to their overarching theme of ‘exploring the invisible’. We took this opportunity to introduce them to the concept of synthetic biology and how it can be combined with bacteria to do amazing things. To read more about our Summer School click here .

Integrated Human Practices
Comic: While organising the Summer School activity we came across some difficulties in communicating the concept of using bacteria to address issues like renewable energy. Especially trying to explain how molecular biology works, and the solutions it has the potential to provide. We decided to make a comic to explain this to young people in an engaging way. This was displayed to the public during UEA's Open Day and at the Norwich Science Festival. This comic allows us to communicate to younger audiences that bacteria can be a force for good when used properly. To read our comic click here .
VR: We came across problems conveying the science behind our project at a molecular level to the general public, for example during our meeting with Hethel Innovation. We struggled trying to communicate the molecular approach of our project, and what exactly our project is doing on the sub-cellular level. We decided"

PHB + Coagulant (CaCl2) + settling
PHB + Coagulant (CaCl2) + centrifugation (500 RPM)
We plan to use 10 mM (final concentration) of CaCl2 as our coagulant because literature reported 95% of PHB granules were sedimentable by low-speed centrifugation after addition of 10 mM (Resch et al., 1998).
This week, we also tested an HPLC method for PHB quantification. The same HPLC column we use for VFA quantification can also be used for PHB quantification. In the proposed method, PHB is converted to crotonic acid by dissolving in sulfuric acid for 30 min at 95C. For the first HPLC run, we prepared crotonic acid standards of various concentrations to see whether the HPLC method will be able to detect crotonic acid. The run was extended to 60 minutes as we were unsure of the retention time of crotonic acid. The method was successful and crotonic acid picked around 20 minutes.
Together with the secretion team, we started working on synthetic feces fermentation experiments to determine the optimal temperature for VFA fermentation step and to see whether engineered bacteria can produce PHB from synthetic feces. The two temperatures used in the experiment were 37°C and 22°C, which correspond to optimal bacterial growth temperature and room temperature in a Mars habitat, respectively. For the experiment, we used Imperial and Tokyo phaCAB constructs and E. coli without PHB-producing genes as a control.
Week 16: August 14-18
This week we worked on creating representative PHB samples for the extraction experiments. Our bacteria would be producing PHB in the 20-60nm range, and the PHB that we received from PolyFerm is in the 0.1-1mm range. PHB was suspended in tap water to achieve 5 g/L concentration. PHB-co-HV was also suspended in tap water to achieve 5 g/L concentration. The samples were then sonicated using QSonica homogeniser. The sonication was performed on both samples at Amplitude -37 at 25-second intervals for 10 minutes. The particle size distribution was later measured on the NanoPlus HD device(Figure 2). It is clear that the finer PHB-co-HB powder was broken down better than the larger PHB particles,"

For the MerB digestion, two bands were expected: one from MerB insert (700 base pairs) and the other from plasmidial vector (2958 base pairs).
After confirm the sizes, the samples went through another digestion, at bigger volume, so we could obtain a huge amount of samples for cloning. For Mer A sample, a double digestion was proceeded expecting that the plasmid would linearize, and for MerB, a single digestion, expecting the Mer B insert to be free.
The samples underwent purification and were linked, with Mer B being embedded upstream to Mer. Then, the linking was transformed, and the transforming clones were selected and its plasmids, extracted. A digestion was proceeded with extraction and the inserted was confirmed, with the length of 2523 base pairs. It was named Mer BA.
Mer TPBA construction
For this one, the already done samples of MerTP (cloned in pGEM T easy) and Mer BA (cloned recently in pBSK) were used to this construction. Samples underwent a previous digestion to ascertain the parts, in digestion test. After this process, the samples went through a new digestion for purifying and linking of the parts. In this digestion, the Mer BA sample was linearized and the MerTP had its insert freed. Then, samples were purified, linked, transformed and the clones were selected and inoculated to extract the plasmids. The plasmids were digested as a test, intending to free the insert (~3197 base pairs) and the plasmid vactor (~2958 base pairs) This part was named Mer TPBA.
Cloning BioBricks into pSB1C3 with MerTPBA Biobrick
Changing the plasmidial vector pBSK for vector pSB1C3 attached to sample Mer TPBA
As in the plannings from Mer Operon construction, the samples would be added upstream to Mer A, as it is seen. Therefore, the plasmidial vector which would prevail in the construction might be the vector from Mer A, by then in pBSK. So,  to construct MerTPBA we had to change vectors.
To this changing, any part from iGEM parts kit, which were at pSB1C3, was used to give the plasmidial vector. This sample was digested in test and its vector, confirmed (~207"

The iGEM Team Marburg was invited to join the ""Abschlusskongress, Bilanz und Ausblick der Initiative Biotechnologie 2020+"" in Berlin, Germany.
Initiative Biotechnology 2020+ is an initiative by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) to support successful cooperation’s between academic institutions and industry to foster biotechnology. The program is new and an important objective of the congress in Berlin was to present an outlook on the first phase of the strategy process.
Dr. Helge Braun, the parliamentary State Secretary of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, opened the congress by introducing Biotechnology 2020+. Five representatives of research institutes societies in Germany led the following discussion round, which was moderated by Karsten Schwanke. Dr. Hans-Otto Feldhütter (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft), Prof. Dr. Doris Wedlich (Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft), Prof. Dr. Herbert Jäckle (Max-Plank-Gesellschaft), Prof. Axel Brakhage (Leibniz-Gemeinschaft) and Prof. Dr. Dietmar Schoburg (Technische Universität Braunschweig) presented various arguments concerning the previous activities of the Initiative Biotechnology 2020+, which pinpoint out the parts need of"

Don’t worry about money, if we come up with a good wetlab project, then it becomes easier to obtain funding to travel to the actual competition.  We have enough money to do both projects in tandem.  Call Amanda about GeneArt. We may have money to use up with them.   If we check with Courtney before purchasing anything, we should be fine with money.

Easiest way is to get the strain from the people who made that biobrick already. A different option is to do a Lac I knockout. - Rao: Faster and easier to just do GFP expression. o A blue/white screen is just a yes or no. It’s not a quantitative assay. o Can do LacZ and GFP in parallel. That’s a stronger experiment. Potential Plan - Assemble biobrick - Then introduce PUF binding site and mutated PUF binding site. Insert before RBS of Lac I, after RBS of Lac I, - Assemble last biobrick of PUF+PIN - The biobrick that we intend to make is made of smaller biobricks that we will hopefully process all in parallel. - Different assembly methods? - Rao: forget fancy PCR things, including Gibson assembly. o Need a simple"

Include a different ribosome binding site
Include Gibson ends that overlapped with the backbone for simple Gibson Assembly later with the SamR construct.
Remove an illegal Spe1 site near the end to make it compliant with iGEM requirements
Remove a promoter pC that was coded in the opposite direction to the promoter we wanted to use and would have clashed with the controllable promotion of this part
Our first attempt to Gibson Assemble the SamR  construct and IntI1 gBlock failed because there was extra code after the code for pBAD which we had not anticipated. This meant that the Gibson Assembly could not properly integrate the gBlock. We discussed numerous options to try and either get rid of the problem sequence on the SamR construct or modify the ends of the gBlock to accommodate the problem sequence. In the end it was decided that a re-design of the gBlock would be the most efficient way to solve the problem. Back to top
Inti1 gBlock ReDesign
Three major changes were decided:
Changed the code for the ribosome cut site as a base pair was incorrect
To put an Nhe1 restriction enzyme cut site between the IntI1 gene and the promoters on the SamR construct. This was done to help in the ligation of this BioBrick into the low-copy backbone pUS202.
Changing of the end sequences to accommodate the extra code present on the SamR construct
Back to top
Construction
The IntI1 gBlock was inserted into the SamR construct using Gibson Asssembly . The ends of the gBlock in the redesign were compatible with the ends of the SamR construct and after running the Gibson Assembly reaction we used a variety of methods to prove that our gBlock had inserted correctly.
These changed were performed by our supervisor Nick Coleman in consultation with Rokiah Alford. The redesigned gBlock was able to be successfully Gibsoned into the SamR backbone. To verify the presence of the insert we used junction primers which would amplify over both ends of the insert and could only amplify if the gBlock had been integrated into the SamR construct.
Junction primer PCR
Junction primers for the junction of promoter and gblock were iGEM1413 and iGEM1414 and were expected to give a fragment size of 377 base pairs.
9 out of the 12 colonies screened gave a positive result and these were further screened with a second set of junction primers on the other side of the gBlock. The junction primers for this were i"

""Jamboré"" is a ""brazificated"" word for for Jamboree, a neologism for the national meeting of brazillian iGEM teams, alluding the official Jamboree - but in a more confotable way to spell the word, at least for us! This is the second time the Jamboé was held in University of São Paulo. Like in 2013 , we gathered the brazillian teams on a single place to talk about the synthetic biology projects, make suggestions, appreciate feedbacks and, of course, have fun together. We and the other teams have given continuity to the last year Jamboré initiative expecting to strengthen even more the bonds between the iGEM initiatives in Brazil, what is decisive for showing to the involved faculties and sponsors what we are doing  and how it is important for the proper growth and development of real synthetic biology research on Brazil.
Fortunately, this expectation was completely achieved. For the second time, the Manaus team was present on São Paulo for the meeting - despite the long distance of almost 2700 kilometers! We were also very glad to have the presence of the team from Pernanbuco , first time on iGEM but already doing an impressive job on cancer biodetection. The team from Minas Gerais and even Anita Sifuentes from iGEM HQ have participated virtually (thanks Carlos Alberto and Anita!), but the internet connection didn't helped much with the videoconference. Although the technical problems limited our meeting, we transmited (in portuguese) everything online, enabling a larger audience.
On this first video we have the introduction given by Pedro Medeiros and the presentation of the USP team:

Although M.A.P.L.E. is (currently) fictional, we really wanted to know whether people would be interested in such devices. Were they excited by the idea of being able to design and print their own unique objects at home? This discussion quickly turned into a survey: If you owned your own M.A.P.L.E. device, what would you 3D print? Some of the responses can be seen below.

Celebration of Science
From 20th-28th of september Kensington and Chelsea Council hosted a Celebration of Science week. Distinguished guests from the scientific, political and academic worlds took part, as well as from the Arts. We were privileged to present synthetic biology and our project in the Isaac Newton Centre on the 28th of September.
""A team of students from Imperial College presented a  research project at the Science Cafe, held as part of the the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea's Celebration of Science. This project spoke directly to the practical concerns of a local authority,  exploring how we can be make use of our rubbish and refuse collections.  It offered a fascinating glimpse of the potential of modern biology and life sciences to make new materials, such as plastics that until now have come from oil and hydrocarbon processes are often relatively expensive. The students offered a glimpse of the manner in which biology is changing rapidly and of  the kind of innovative processes that have the potential to save all of us, including local councils, money.""

Instead, it is supposed to be applied by a healthcare professional in a medical setting (Drugs, n.d.). And since Tisseel is a fibrin sealant, it is found to be more expensive than other types of coagulants (2009).

Overall, the table shows just why our product Coagu.coli is the perfect coagulant.
Our Constructs
First Construct
To obtain our goal of an accelerated clotting process, we have deployed the venom serine protease “Cerastotin” which will act on the thrombin, bypassing multiple factors in the clotting cascade and cut long fibrinogen strands into fibrin monomers which will stop the bleeding at a greatly accelerated rate. In order for the venom to stay localized at the wound site, we have augmented a short fibrin peptide with the venom that will polymerize with the other fibrin monomers at the wound site. With the polymerization of the venom within a permanent clot and with blood pressure directing flow to the wound, the venom will not be traveling throughout the body and initiating a clot other than that of the wound site.
We chose a constitutive medium strength promoter (J23107) and a medium/strong RBS for our construct in order to produce an ample amount of venom, but also allowing our Thiol isomerase time to stabilize the multiple disulphide bonds in the venom, so the protein will fold properly and its enzymatic activity increases.
To ensure our venom protein folds properly, we have a periplasmic signal attached to both the venom/fibrin protein as well as the thiol isomerase. Foreign proteins don't fold well within the rough cytoplasm, so we sent our proteins to the periplasmic space which is a more ideal situation for our venom. With addition to the DsbC, the enzymatic activity of the venom should be significantly higher which in turn should accelerate our clotting. By having our proteins in the periplasmic space, we only need"

Mexico
We as a team, believe that exchanging knowledge and experiences with other iGEM teams is extremely important to fully understand the spirit of the competition, aiming to achieve the goals and value Synthetic Biology by producing knowledge.
Over the project course, an area we found really challenging was the Math Modeling, given that our team didn’t have the full expertise in this field. However we were able to overcome these difficulties with help of our Mexican brothers team from Monterrey University, making the whole difference in our modeling approaches.
Through the data found in the experiment, the team helped us to formulate equations that resemble the behavior seen on the biosensoring, bioaccumulation and bioremediation. These equations and models provide means for checking and evaluate our experiments before hands on. Ahead the bench modeling is proved to be a nice a start for lab preparations. The usefulness of this subject made us aware the need of interlocution with Math and Statistic departments from our own University for the next iGEM year to come.
Thank you Mexico, thank you Tecnológico de Monterrey-campus Querétaro, thank you BIOSINT_Mexico ! Building a modeling together gave us major benefit to our work in SynBio. Looking forward to meet all you guys personally at the GJ (Giant Jamboree), see you all there!

This year we had the most expressive Brazil’s participation in iGEM. Four teams representing three distinct Brazilian regions.  Two teams from southeast, one from northeast and our from north (Amazon). We all had a perception we couldn’t miss the opportunity here! People from Brazil-SP team repeated this year what was a pilot last year, the ""Jamboré"", a ""brazificated"" Jamboree. We got together and we were in iGEM’s Jamboree mood hight there in São Paulo. For us was more than 2 thousand miles to go there, but we did it and enjoyed it!

The target markets for the device include hormone researchers, the livestock agriculture industry, and medical diagnosticians. These parties are handicapped by long and costly sample analysis periods. The time it takes to test a sample for a hormone can range from many hours to days. This also poses the risk of the hormone degrading in the sample, which can lead to inaccurate results. BEAR will allow hormone researchers and diagnosticians to observe hormonal fluctuations in real-time, yielding a more detailed result that will provide a greater understanding of the hormone in question. Those working in the livestock industry will be able to quickly and safely test animals for pregnancy, growth hormones and hormones related to disease. The opportunities this new test will provide will be far-reaching, leading to the development of innovative health care practices that will enhance diagnostics and treatment of disease.
In a 2008 report, the market for both therapeutic and diagnostic monoclonal antibodies was valued at $56 billion for 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13%. 1 The global market for the therapeutic monoclonal antibody industry in 2011 was estimated at $44.6 billion annually. 2 This has nearly doubled from 2006 when the global market was estimated at $19 billion with $7.2 billion for immunoassays, and $3.1 billion in clinical diagnostics. 3 The Canadian medical device market was estimated at $6.4 billion annually in 2008. 4 The biotechnology market is also forecast to have a value of $4.6 billion by 2012, demonstrating an increase of 39.4% since 2011. 5
The business model Synbiologica is pursuing is to license out the patented technology to larger established biotechnology or medical device companies with the resources to build, market and distribute the product.
For added market value, initial prototypes will be further utilized by scientific researchers to gain greater medical diagnostic value. Synbiologica assumes that our product will reveal new behavioural aspects and lifesaving hormone diagnostics in the industry that were not previously known because it will allow researchers to quantify changes in hormone levels as they are occurring. This will add further value to the product and increase its appeal for application in medical diagnostics, resulting in further commercialization beyond the research world. Investors will have an opportunity to be part of a revolutionary, potentially lifesaving biotechnological development.

Ron Weiss joined the BE and EECS faculties as dual associate professor (with tenure) starting in July 2009, having moved from Princeton University where he held comparable rank in their department of electrical engineering and with a joint appointment in their department of molecular biology.  His degrees are double BA in Computer Science and Economics from Brandeis University (1992), followed by SM and PhD in EECS at MIT (1994, 2001).  Professor Weiss is a prominent and widely respected figure in the emerging field known as ‘synthetic biology’, with emphasis on designing molecular circuits governing cell behavior using quantitative systems modeling approaches.  He is expected to help lead MIT’s efforts in both synthetic biology and systems biology, and indeed to guide their integration.
Tom Knight is a senior research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, part of the MIT School of Engineering. Inspired in part by the work of Harold Morowitz, a Yale physicist and biologist, Knight studied biochemistry, genetics, and cellular biology, and set up a biology lab within MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science. In this lab he created the concept of the BioBrick and began creating a library of BioBricks that could be used to build biological computation structures. Today, BioBricks form the basis of the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition.
Knight continues to focus on Synthetic Biology at the Knight Laboratory.

Top agar assay demonstrates our frozen TT9907 strain does indeed contain lambda prophage that can in turn indeed by excited to lyse the its host cell.  No surprises there – that’s what we went through our selection process for in the first place (see July 31st and August 2nd entries).  Frozen TT9901 failed to exhibit plaques.  That is a surprise.  Dr. Grose recommends we set the TT9901 aside for a moment and just use TT9907 to troubleshoot.
One explanation for our last experiment could be that something in the electroporation procedure itself inhibits downstream vulnerability to lambda infection.  Perhaps the electric shock excises the prophage from the genome, or perhaps we select for E.Coli that is particularly invulnerable to lambda, or something.
Our electroporation protocol is as follows:
1) Centrifuge 1-2 mL overnight culture. Discard supernatant. 2) Glycerol Wash: resuspend cells in 500 uL 10% glycerol.  Centrifuge 1 minute. Discard supernatant. 3) Resuspend cells in 500"

Jessica Zaher is a senior and a Psychology major. She plans to go to graduate school for her Master's degree in forensic psychology. She hopes to one day work for the FBI. Jessica joined iGEM and the WLC team to lend a hand finding a survey and doing the analysis while also getting more experience working on a team. Her favorite hobby, when the time allows, is reading.
Jessica's job was to initially create a survey, geared toward the summer camp and assess the students attitudes toward science before and after participating the the camp. Instead of creating a survey, something that would be unreliable as far as analysis goes, she found a known and reliable survey that assessed attitudes toward science. After the summer camp and once the surveys were collected, Jessica used SPSS (a statistical analysis program) to enter the data and run the frequency statistics on the demographic questions of the survey.

Description
Over 2 billion people worldwide in both MEDCs and LEDCs are affected by anaemia; mainly infants and pregnant women. Iron deficiency symptoms include lethargy, heart conditions, pale skin, reduced cognitive ability and even death. Additionally, many countries give out iron tablets prophylactically to pregnant women and to children, whether they are anaemic or not (because anaemia is such an issue). Side effects of iron overdose are similarly harmful so to be able to home-test and know that iron supplements are not required would be extremely beneficial.
Our iGEM project is to create a home testing kit for detecting iron levels in saliva, which is strongly correlated with iron levels in the blood, to warn people with abnormal concentrations of this essential mineral. The kits will be in the form of slips of paper, which are cell-free systems. These include all the necessary cellular components in cell-free extracts and our genetic construct which are embedded into the paper and freeze-dried. They are easily stored and distributed at a stable room temperature and when necessary can be activated by rehydration. The current method for measuring iron is a full blood count which is expensive, time-consuming and often not available in less economically developed countries. Our test will be cheap and easy to use, making it a more efficient method of testing for iron.
In order to react to different iron levels, our construct will be promoted by the AceB gene, which can be regulated by FUR, a transcriptional repressor of genes involved in iron homeostasis. In the presence of Fe2+ ions, this protein dimerises which allows linkage to a FUR binding site to inhibit mRNA transcription of the downstream gene. To ensure an increase in iron leads to an increase in transcription we will use an inverter, which involves placing a LacI coding region downstream of the FUR regulated promoter. A second plasmid has a promoter that in the presence of LacI inhibits transcription of the chromoprotein coding region downstream. Therefore, in the presence of no iron the iron sensitive promoter allows LacI to be produced, which inhibits transcription of the amilCP chromoprotein on the second plasmid. However, in the presence of iron the iron sensitive promoter is inhibited so LacI is not produced and amilCP can be transcribed to produce a vibrant blue colour in response to iron. Different levels of iron will result in different levels of transcription of the chromoprotein so our device will be semi-quantitative. </br> <a href="" https://2017.igem.org/Team"

iGEM Exeter contacted us in early summer to organise a collaboration between our two teams. We spoke with their team over skype in order to determine what each team could do to help the other. As part of this several team members were involved in a brief video interview with regard to the following;               (i) Define a kill switch               (ii) Our opinion on gender inequality in science.
iGEM Norwich
As one of our team members, Brandon Malone took part in a research project in UEA (University of East Anglia) it was decided that we would collaborate with the iGEM Norwich team. A video series to aid future iGEM teams was decided on and the production of it began in August. These videos include background theory and experiment tutorial on basic techniques used in synbio lab such as; cloning, ligation, transformation. Our contribution to the video involved the production of the aforementioned experiment tutorial. Links to these videos can be found below.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

The higher score, the higher similarity, and the higher possibility of mismatch.     The table shows that more than 30% of pairs’ score is equal to 3, which means that the possibility of mismatch cannot be neglected.     Even if we employ the relatively loose rule to evaluate the similarity, we can still find that error rates cannot be neglected.

Why not other sticky ends?
The reason why Freiburg used these sticky ends
Failed to contact the original designers of these sticky ends, what we can do is just to find feasible advantages of these combinations.
Let's look at the TALE direpeat unit amino acids sequence:
LTPEQVVAIAS(XX)GGKQALETVQRLLPVLCQAHG（34aa）
The first amino acid is Leu, which is essential for all connection process. There are six different codons for Leu.
UUA,UUG,CUU,CUC,CUA,CUG
The 2012 Freiburg project's sticky ends:
（C）TGAC,GCTC,CTTG,GCTT,ACTG,CCTG,ACTC
The feature of Degeneracy has helped to design seven sticky ends. However, since the codons for identical amino acid are highly similar,    this feature, for experimental scientists, is a double-edged sword.
How to improve the Golden Gate sticky ends? A big Table!
Three key questions need to be answered:
1. Is it possible to find perfect match pair?
2. Can we find a certain number of sticky ends with least mismatch possibility?
3. How to make this sticky-end score table?
Key algorithms derived from BLAST algorithm
Loose rule: Match: 1; Mismatch: 0; Gap: 0
Strict rule: Match: 1; Mismatch: 0; Gap: 1
The sticky end is composed of four bases, which means that we can design 256 types of sticky ends, which are represented as a 256*256 table.
Find target groups of sticky ends
To solve the TALE parts problem, we need find seven sticky ends, and the similarity score of each pair in them are less than or equal to 1.
Figure 1.4.7 Sticky ends choices table
When we select Strict Algorithm to find these ends, it is impossible to find seven sticky ends, that each pair of them has score no more than 1. So we have to select Loose Algorithm.
Convert four-basepair sticky ends to amino acid pairs

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth

AIM: Amplification of ALDH     promoters. A PCR reaction was carried out as before with the same reaction mix     and PCR conditions as Wednesday. amplify ALDH1A1 and     ALDH2.
RESULTS: Amplification of ALDH1A1 was     successful using the ALDH1A1-Fw and ALDH-Rv primers.     The band size was as expected. ALDH 2 was also amplified using ALDH2-Fw and     ALDH2-Rv primers. 
ANALYSIS: We are pleased with developments thus     far. Difficulties in amplification of ALDH3A1 using our the ALDH3A1(1)     and ALDH3A1(2) primers was anticipated. Initial analysis in selecting an     ALDH3A1 promoter region revealed a number of different options. Additionally,     it was difficult to find commercial sequences which matched the gene sequence     identified in NCBI. Subsequent to ordering the primers, the Eukaryotic Promoter     Database was discovered. Primers for the EPD experimentally designed ALDH3A1     promoter have been ordered and will be tested when they arrive.  ALDH1A1 was initially designed to be     quite large and also includes an illegal site. An experimentally tested ALDH1A1     promoter has been identified on EPD. There is significant overlap between this     EPD promoter sequence and the one we had designed. A new forward EPD designed     primer was ordered which would give a smaller promoter and also eliminate the     illegal site.

 We have decided to try a touchdown     PCR reaction in order to try to amplify the other parts, particularly ALDH1A1.     Touchdown PCR is a faster but a more crude method of amplification in     comparison to gradient PCR"

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations#Blog2_-_-_TEXT.html," that you can patent both DNA and software code for its function, but you cannot copyright DNA code, as you could for a piece of software. The patent system that has served to protect software for decades was adopted to protect intellectual properties in synthetic biology. This worked in protecting ideas like the genetic toggle switch, or the kill gene in Gateway Assembly, both of which were patented.
Unfortunately, the patent system in synthetic biology and software does not work in all cases. Namely, the system fails when 1) a patent is so broad that other researchers can’t approach the patented technology with a ten-foot-pole without fear of infringement or 2) there is a cluster of narrower patents in a certain aspect of synthetic biology (e.g. digital genetic logic circuits) that prevents researchers from working on downstream applications due to possibility of infringement on one of the narrower patents.  These issues of ambiguity in patent law in software, and now in synthetic biology, are described as the anti-commons problem. Anti-commons is a state in which new research or development is deterred because of ambiguity or overuse of patents in property rights. It is here that software developers and synthetic biologists encounter the same problem: how can the integrity of intellectual property be protected while still facilitating a dispersion of information to the greater scientific community? How can software developers protect and profit from their ideas, while still allowing the rest of the community to use those tools to build their own software? This translates to synthetic biology as: how can synthetic biologists working in foundational research develop biological parts that are protected, but are still available to the greater scientific community for further development into real-life applications?
The answer to all of our problems is always 47!  It’s the answer to the Universe!
Just kidding. The answer came in the form of the Open Source Initiative, which was launched in 1998 as an “general education and advocacy organization… focused specifically on explaining and protecting the ‘open source’ label”. This idea of open source software fostered a community in which software developers share their creations in the public domain, and in return they can use the source code of all other people in the community. Now for our second to last definition (we promise!), the definition of open source; for a work to be considered open source, a developer must allow:
Open access to source code
Meaning, when the software is released, users must be able to obtain the code that the software was written with.
In the context of synthetic biology, that means that the genetic code and biological parts that went into making a new system must be released to the synthetic biology community.

PROTEIN EXPRESSION
GFP reporter gene was expressed and the fluorescence level was assayed to test our gene expression system.
PROTEIN ANALYSIS
Coomassie blue staining was performed on SDS-PAGE to check the expression of AOX gene.
ENZYME ACTIVITY ASSAY
H2O2 production assay was conducted as AOX enzyme activity assay, demonstrating that AOX catalyzed the oxidation of alcohol and generated a product of hydrogen peroxide.
MODELING
An electrochemical simulator was utilized to study the electrochemical properties of AOX enzyme. The experiment was performed by a collaboration with the biotech company, BIONIME CORP. who is a worldwide leader in blood glucose meter innovation.
This year, we’ve done all the experiment to prove the function of AOX and demonstrated the electrochemical activity of AOX with alcohol. Now we’re going to develop IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter) by creating an alcohol test strip to apply in an electrochemical analyzer (i.e., blood glucose meter)."

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
PCR products from 11/8/2018 was run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 5μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
This gel shows that pACYC-dxCas9-LinkerTn5 was successfully linearized (lane 8, 9 and 10), as there is a strong amplicon signal far above 5kbp, and we expected 9388bp. Amplification of the Gblock showed very faint bands at the expected size (314bp) (lane 2, 3 and 4).

Week 5 Notes
6/25/2012
- Started making TB media. Added tryptone, yeast, glycerol to make media, autoclaved. Need to add a 100 mL filter of .17 M KH2PO4 and .72 M K2HPO4. After that, need to grow 5 mL of the cells (both normal and petrobrick-transformed) in the TB along with 1:1000 ratio of antibiotic (CM) and grow it overnight.
- Extracted BBa_K157005 and pETDuet-1 from the gel. pETDuet-1 had a very faint band.
- The wrong ladder was used for BBa_K157005 so the band was not located.
- Digests were run again with NEB Buffer 3 and 2 uL of enzymes were used to cut the pETDuet-1 vector.
- Scaffold sent for synthesis through IDT's miniGene option.
- Ran gel to see if digests worked, all were successful, but not pET duet.
- Ran digests through the nanodrop and got low numbers for all.
- Went ahead and did ligation to make the following: pBAD+control eYFP, pBAD+PUF eYFP, ptet+control eYFP, ptet+PUF eYFP.
- Transformed the ligations into both DH5a and BL21.
6/26/2012
- Finished making the TB media.
- Prepared (2) 5 mL cultures of K12-Petrobrick in the TB.
- An additional two innoculations of normal K12 were prepared to grow overnight.
- Heard back from UW's team advisor from last year, Ingrid Swanson-Pultz, and she replied back with what strains of E. Coli they used. We will be fine using K12 cells because she said there wasn't much difference from the alkane production with the different cells. We will not need to order any more.
- Need to order C15 Alkanes to inject in one of the production cultures to ensure alkane production.
- Digestion of BBa_K157005 failed again with no presence of bands.
- Digestion of pETDuet-1 worked so the BBa_K157005 plasmid was run on a gel to confirm viability. The plasmid was still viable so double digestion was done again with EcoRI-HF/PstI-HF in NE"

Aug 25th 2015, after receiving the invitation of the engineer Jianping Xiang from Chengdu Biology Maker, our team went to his studio to visit. The day we coincided with Shanghai Fab Lab director, Prof. Junfeng Ding, who also came to the studio for exchange. Accordingly, we had a conversation with him. He gave us some advice about marketing and promotion of project. Hereafter, we visited the Biology Maker Studio. After getting aware of their autonomous projects, we were exceedingly interested in their 3D printer which made by themselves because of the idea that we originally hoped to find something to help make our enzymatic biofuel cell device. Listened to our request, Mr. Xiang was glad to help us. The specific 3D printing device is shown in the Results.
Meanwhile, people from Chengdu Biology Maker had a general knowledge to iGEM from us and said they hope to participant in this competition as graduates in order to communicate with varieties of worldwide superior teams about synthetic biology.
Soon afterwards, we went to the Biology Maker Space located in SWJTU Science and Technology Park to attend Prof. Ding’s sharing session. It was the first time that we got aware of Fabrication Laboratory. Interestingly, the Fab Lab is started by MIT CBA. This year the biology area is shown in Fab Lab for the first time. During this session we found that the technology innovating is not only for scientists but also for the users in our daily life. Everyone is the subject of technological innovation."
