Table 5.2. Metabolites that can be produced in a growth coupled way based on in silico simulations during darkness relying on glycogen as carbon and energy source.
Although, fumarate is not on the list of compounds on Table 5.2, we did not give up on trying to stabilize its production also during darkness.
Modeling the native metabolism under nighttime conditions
As discussed on our production page, being able to produce during the night as well as the day is a prerequisite for any industrially viable, cyanobacterial production strain. Towards this end, we continued to use FBA to analyze a variant of the iJN678 model, where the reaction corresponding to the one catalyzed by the fumC product is silenced (i.e. our in silico Δ fumC strain). In order to get an accurate representation of nighttime metabolism, we constrained our model to simulate heterotrophic growth, where the primary substrate is glycogen. Our model predicts that even under this different trophic mode, the same Y p/x of 0.848 mmol gDW -1 is obtained for fumarate production. However, there is one 'small’ caveat that our model does not explicitly address.
As a photosynthetic organism, Synechocystis ' primary metabolism has evolved towards primarily exploit the energy of light. This does not mean that it is completely metabolically inactive at night, as it still needs to produce some energy to cover certain maintenance costs. However, compared to the day, Synechocystis is more or less 'asleep' during the night, metabolically speaking [12]. So although the fumarate yield is not predicted to change, due to drastically decreased overall flux through the system, the fumarate production rate is expected to be much less during the night. In order to test if our model corroborates this expectation, we turned to dynamic FBA constrained by experimental data acquired during circadian regimes. Simulating a sinusoidal light regime and using measured glycogen consumption rates [13], we were able to get a more accurate representation of fumarate production for our in silico Δ fumC strain over a 24 hour period (fig. 5.1).
Figure 5.1. Dynamic simulation of fumarate production from Δ fumC . The grey shaded area signifies the night where the white background signifies the day. Fumarate and glycogen are both given in units of mmol L -1 , whereas biomass is in g L -1 .

Protocol for LB medium and LB agar plates
Written by Katariina Jaenes
LB Introduction
In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. LB, also known as Lysogeny broth, is a nutrient rich broth that is a standard for culturing Escherichia coli, as it allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore the proper preparation of LB will be crucial to maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to LB broth creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri dishes. We will be preparing our own LB as well as our own LB agar plates, which will be used to culture E.coli K-12.
LB Basic Terminology and Concepts
Agar vs. Agarose: Agar is used for making petri plates to culture organisms, while agarose is used for making gels, in the likes of SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis
LB Safety Precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Autoclave: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. Note that any autoclaved materials may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.
LB Materials and Equipment
Note: this recipe is for 500ml of LB, which makes approximately 18 plates. LB can be kept for 3-4 months
LB Reagents
5g NaCl
5g Tryptone
2.5g Yeast extract
7.5g of agar This is only necessary if you are making LB agar plates
500ml of dH20 (distilled water)
LB Materials

Two members of the UCL iGEM team volunteered as advisers to the UCL Academy iGEM team – Ruxi and Khaicheng , under the guidance of Aurelija Grigonyte, a member of the UCL iGEM 2012 team. During the high school team’s brainstorming process, we provided them with guidance and resources for their research. We also supervised their lab work in the UCL Biochemical Engineering department.
UCL is the first university in the UK to be the sole sponsor of an academy – a non-selective mixed state school in our home borough of Camden. UCL Academy represents a unique opportunity to blur the boundaries between secondary and higher education.
The academy is one of the first UK high schools to participate in iGEM this year, and is the only UK team so far to have attended the High School iGEM Jamboree at MIT, Boston. The team aimed to revolutionise the recycling industry by proposing a home system that converts cellulose into glucose, allowing the up-cycling of paper into a commercial product of bioplastic - polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)

Modelling
Modelling of the RelE-RelB System is Essential to Avoid Irrevocable Dormancy
Controllable dormancy is a feature that holds the potential to be applied in many different situations. However, inducing dormancy and bringing the bacteria back to a metabolic active state is like balancing on a tightrope, and to establish the basis of future implementations, the properties of this system would have to be investigated further. In an endeavour to provide this basic knowledge, stochastic modelling utilising the Gillespie algorithm was performed in an attempt to prognosticate the system and simulate the interactions between the toxin and antitoxin. The toxin RelE is inhibited by the antitoxin RelB through complex formation, and both proteins interact with their promoter in a feedback mechanism.  To consolidate the model, the capacity of the toxin-antitoxin system was assessed in an experiment, as the controllability of the dormancy system was studied through manual  regulation of RelE and RelB expression.
You can read more about the modelling here.
Figure 2. Left: The time required for the bacteria to enter dormancy varies with the expression level of RelB. The percentage of dormant bacteria, defined as containing RelE amounts above 40 molecules per cell as a function of time in minutes. Right: Only one of the tested configurations, RelB2:50-RelE:35, causes the bacteria to regain their activity within the modelled time. The percentage of dormant bacteria, defined as containing RelE amounts above 15 molecules per cell as a function of time in minutes. The data is based on the simulation of 1000 independent bacteria.

Clamping Down on Crosstalk
How can we keep genes from interfering with each other in         synthetic DNA circuits?
About this Project
Building complex biological systems with many             genes requires isolating genes. Active genes can cause nearby DNA             to become supercoiled, leading to unpredictable behavior of             synthetic biology systems. We will test if DNA clamps (made from             DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes can stop this             interference. If this project succeeds, it will allow bioengineers             to build more predictable genetic circuits.
Watch our introduction video here.
What is the context of this research?
Programming cells often requires building         ""circuits"" of several genes together on the same piece of DNA.         Bioengineers have observed that when two genes are placed next to each         other, they often unexpectedly interfere with each other's expression         in an unexpectedly orientation-dependent manner. Nobody knows with         certainty what causes this genetic crosstalk, but one promising theory         involves DNA supercoiling. The transcription of DNA into RNA, the         transcription process introduces supercoils, similar to kinks in a         tightly-wound phone cord. Supercoils directly affect the expression of         genes, turning them on or off depending on the direction of the         supercoil.
What is the significance of this project?
If successful, a DNA-binding, gene- isolating clamp         could be used in any multi-gene circuit assembly, making multi-gene         assemblies more predictable and their assembly much more efficient.         This is particularly relevant when engineering metabolic pathways to         produce chemicals like methanol, insulin, or antibiotics, where         circuits of many genes are routinely constructed. The physical layout         of these circuits can unpredictably affect production of the desired         output by several orders of magnitude, so large engineered metabolic         pathways must typically be hand-tuned or have many configurations         screened for activity. By making gene expression more predictable, our         results could greatly improve the predictability (and, therefore,         designability) of large gene circuits for metabolic engineering
What are the goals of the project?

The last point proved to be somewhat tricky. Unfortunately, as figure 1 shows, pETBlue-1 is not optimal for RFC25 cloning, since it has both NgoMIV and AgeI restriction sites. We got around this problem by using a third enzyme with the same sticky ends: XmaI. This was to be the up-stream site for insertion.  Further modifications of the pET-vector were supposed to include the deletion of all NgoMIV and AgeI sites, as well as the changing of the introduced XmaI site to AgeI, so that the vector could be used with conventional RFC25 enzymes.
The AgeI site was successfully changed using site directed mutagenesis PCR. However, the difficulty we had with expression using the modified pETBlue1.2 led us to abandon this side project.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Events_-_-_TEXT.html," the discovery of Paris, the City of Light
Increase the general knowledge about Synthetic Biology through conferences and events
From fun around a student party only iGEM
The European Experience Project
Three people from the Marketing part of the iGEM IONIS team were working full-time on the European Experience in order to turn our vision into a successful event: Alexandre DOLLET, Jessica MATIAS and Anthony RENODON. Due to the scale of the event, the required work was quite huge, and three people were barely enough. As said before, we were also working with Taman MOUMADHI, Maria BARGUES RIBERA and Alba IGLESIAS from the iGEM Evry team. This collaboration was very proficient, and allowed us to efficiently plan the event. This project has brought us a lot in skills: Project management, retro planning, sponsoring, design, communication, prospecting, contract negotiations. We also learnt how to deal with all kind issues, whether they are financial, technical or human.
Of course, one of the first things we had to take into account was the financial situation of all the teams: we wanted all the teams to come, and therefore we tried to reduce as much as possible the cost of coming to such an event. Due to the vast amount of flight companies and countries, we couldn’t really do anything about the plane tickets, but we managed to get a deal with a Parisian hotel for the teams who had no idea where to sleep. We set up an online ticketing system to ease things, and were ready to announce our event to the world !
We announced our event on April the 27th, with a logo designed by Jessica MATIAS, and reached out for every team members we could find on social media. Through this was a lot of work, it proved to be efficient. The Facebook page we created for our event kept getting more and more likes, and we soon started to receive tons of manifestations of interest from all iGEMers. The event was already promising !
One of our main concerns was the place where the event would be organized at: we had to choose a place that would be able to host everyone, easy to reach, with good places to eat right around the corner, and preferentially in the center of Paris. This seemed like an unsolvable conundrum, until the IONIS group offered us to use one of their building in Parmentier, that was just what we needed ! Even better, we had no charge on using the building. Once this issue addressed, we started looking at how we would organize"

Project Timeline
Michigan State University does not teach an iGEM course, nor does it teach synthetic biology courses at the undergraduate level. Our team was assembled in mid February, and we immediately begin having weekly one-hour-long meetings to brainstorm ideas for our project. The final topic for our project was decided in the first week of April after presenting three of our best ideas to interested faculty and students at MSU, and receiving their feedback. We chose the topic by voting among the eight team members. Lab work, modeling, human practices, and wiki editing began on May 21st and continued full-time by all eight team members until July 27th. Part-time project work continued until October 24, when our team headed to Boston for the 2018 iGEM Giant Jamboree.
Finally, we'd like to extend a thank you to everyone who helped us along the way!"

Collagen/Elastin/rAIP
Made with Benchling
Project: iGEM 2016
Authors: Anna Le, Charles Gleason
Dates: 2016-06-27 to 2016-10-15
Monday, 6/27
-Performed a Gibson for rAIP and elastin fragments, followed standard protocol and used the same timing for both (5 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes) and transformed the result into NEB5α cells and plated
Tuesday, 6/28
-Made liquid cultures for 4 colonies from the elastin and rAIP 4X dilution plates. 40X plates had no useful colonies for both, even after they were left for the morning in the incubator. rAIP plate is relatively streaky, so the 40X plate might have produced replacement rAIP colonies
-Performed colony PCR, ran a gel, looked confusing under UV and technical difficulties prevented a good scan, so gel was saved for the next day with the hopes of more success visualizing it
Wednesday, 6/29
-Tried a gel extraction on the presumed location of amplified DNA from colony 3;  NanoDrop showed no DNA so the extraction product was discarded.
- The elastin 4X dilution plate from the day before was left out on the lab bench and appears to have bacteria expressing RFP contaminating it? Weird.
-Miniprepped and made new dilutions of the 4 liquid cultures from the day before
-Nanodropped the miniprep"

Wednesday, October 3, 2018
Made overnight cultures of E.coli and cells (5 of plain DH5alpha and 6 with our gene DH5alpha NDC 001-1 in the pET21a backbone)
MINIPREP
3/6 miniprep tubes were unusable for one reason or another (one had an orange dot, we discarded this culture as it was thought to be contaminated)
From July 4 plate 3G (From tube smiley face from oct 2) Mini prep - when putting it into column, she did not take all liquid because it had dead cells floating that would not sink in centrifuge. Later, the column was dropped with our gene in it before ellution buffer. Kristina might not have put the entire ellution buffer (problem micropipetting?). We had to spin the wash buffer twice because we put the column into a mini centrifuge tube and the wash buffer could not all fit at the bottom.
From July 4 plate 3H (from tube 1 oct 2) Took some supernatant with dead cells, got all the liquid. We had to spin the wash buffer twice because we put the column into a mini centrifuge tube and the wash buffer could not all fit at the bottom.
This one took longer to do step 5 (spin down flakes)- had to redo it. But when we did the wash buffer we were able to use a bigger tube to collect the flow through and only had to spin it down once per wash.
RESTRICTION
Finished restriction with Ecor1 and Psti with all 3 tubes of mini prep, and one tube of pSB1C3 linearized plasmid backbone.  Restriction enzymes and buffers are expired.
LIGATION
Completed Ligation as well. The temperature of the water bath was around 70 degrees C for the first 5-7 minutes.
Grew overnight cultures (2 with DH5alpha NDC 001-1 and 5 with plain DH5alpha in the pET21a backbone) for mini prep and transformation tomorrow
Thursday, October 4, 2018
Added AMP to overnight cultures in the morning
Subcultured at 11am to prepare for transformation at 4pm
Group 1
MINIPREP
Did a mini prep on both overnight DH5alpha tubes with our NDC 001-1 gene in the pET21a backbone"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pLac_-_-_TEXT.html,"absence of IPTG
In the absence of IPTG, LacI would bind to lacp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing sfGFP expression to a halt. In the presence of IPTG, however, LacI would lose the ability to bind to lacp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting sfGFP expression.

Conclusion
Thinking ahead, the possibilities of creating new organisms through manipulation, reduction and modularization leads to man as a kind of ""Creator"". This opens up new ethical, social and philosophical areas of conflict. In this article the problem arising from the use of terms like ""living machines"" and ""synthetic / artifical cell"" were highlighted.
Particularly problematic is in our eyes, that there are several types of interpretation.
A science which has the possibility to improve the lives of people with new, low-cost and effective methods of environmental protection, the treatment of diseases and many other areas, should provide an unambiguous basis for an informed discussion. The fact that terms imply false and failing to reach full potential scenarios, prevents a qualified debate on opportunities and risks in this field. An example of this can be seen in the genetic engineering debate, in which, through ignorance of the topic often irrational fears are raised which prevents a professional informed debate on this matter.
It is crucial to apply a definition, which is without ambiguity and reflects real possibilities and boundaries of this field. A proposal for a solution could be ""mechanical living organism"", through which the problem of the misleading hybrid character of terms is dissolving.

The weekly notebook includes the work process of every teammate everyday. Here you can see the detailed steps of finishing the two projects for iGEM competition, and go through the days that our projects grow up with us together.
 
Week1: Tutorial of X-code
7.9
First lesson about needed softwares to build an iPhone app (Xcode, Cocoa,etc), as well as the basic functions of these tools and syntactic structure of Object C.
7.10
Learned to build UI elements by both codes and interface builder. Besides we tested how to control an interaction between the user and the interface, for example, to change the text in the screen when we clicked the button.
7.11
Learned to change the size of image by varying the value of slider(another kind of UI controls), and made simple animation. We also created a simple browser that could show the website when we inputted the URL.
7.12
Tried to build a muti-page-displayed browser. Added ""back"",""forward"",""home"" buttons for more functions. We learned agency as well, which enable us to realize functions of different class in just one page.
7.13
Achieved picture dragging and spinning functions. Also built a simple program that could show the coordinate of touched place when user touched the screen.
7.14
Learned to create a table whose every row one-to-one corresponded to a particular key (and the key could be used to search the column). We also achieved the navigation function that we could went to different page by clicking different row of the table.
7.15
Learned about memory management. We studied the way to load data from XML files, and add search function to the table we built before. That day we completed with the primary knowledge needed, then our project was started!

Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.

Summary diagram of construction steps:
We performed DpnI digest on the gel purified PCR product (insert) in order to get rid of any contamination from the original plasmid. We did Alkaline Phosphatase treatment of the backbone to remove terminal phosphates in order to decrease self-ligation of plasmid.  We transformed the ligation into NEB5 cells and we grew overnight cultures from single cell colonies. The next day, we purified the plasmids and digested 200 ng of them with Xba and PstI to screen for the right clones:
Colony #8 had the expected 4.2kB insert and therefore we sent this plasmid for sequencing. After having the sequenced it, we submitted the new part to registry as BBa_K1149051 . This construct has double P+RBS since the native P+RBS stayed there in between the new P+RBS and the operon.  We have identified a clone (from colony #6) that contains the new constitutive promoter only and submitted it as BBa_K1149052 biobrick. We are testing both the hybrid and normal constitutive constructs for PHB bioplastic production.

Figure 2: Illustration of the CRISPR/Cas-method for a knock-out/knock-in experiment. At first the Guide-RNA is bound at the Cas-Protein. Then the guide-RNA guides the Cas-protein to the specific point at the DNA, in our case the rpoZ gene, and make a cut (A). A designed DNA fragment containing the knock-in sequence flanked by two regions directly upstream and downstream of the knock-out gene is moving to the broken DNA sequence(B). Through homologous recombination the new DNA fragment interacts with the flanked regions of the knock-out gene (C) and replaced it completely (D).
The realization of such an experiment was made with the two plasmid CRISPR/Cas-system. The first plasmid encodes the Cas protein and the second the small guide RNA sequence. If the guide RNA is expressed, it can guide the Cas protein to one specific sequence on the DNA. Now the Cas protein is able to cut the DNA at this specific sequence. Under normal conditions the cell would recognize the broken genome and would begin with a degeneration process of the whole cell. However, adding the right linear DNA sequence in addition to both plasmids within the bacterium, a special repair mechanism    can cut out the broken sequence in the genome and add instead the added DNA sequence at the same place. In this experiment a DNA sequence containing the reporter was created, which is able to repair the genome after the Cas protein did a cut inside the rpoZ gene. Therefore the bacterium needs to cut out the rpoZ gene completely and has to integrate the designed DNA sequence to be alive.   Based on the beta-lactamase gene, which was implemented by the knock-in of the reporter, the cultures were plated on LB agar with low concentration of ampicillin on it. Some of the growing cultures were picked for a colony PCR validation (figure 2).
Some bands on the gel are 2,300 to 2,400 bp in size. This is the expected length of the genomic sequence of the flanked rpoZ gene. Therefore, these results are negative. However, five bands on the gel are longer with about 3000 bp.

1. Motivation
Environmental pollution by plastics has long been an issue of concern across the globe. According to National Geographic, an astounding 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced and accumulated since its introduction in the 1950s. Triggered by the disturbing facts of plastic accumulation, the world has come up with many solutions to tackle this problem, for example by degrading PET. But there has been no defined solution to tackle Polyethylene, one of the most common plastics, as of yet. The HKUST iGEM team hopes to solve this issue by degrading PE and turning it into useful resources for everyone.
2. Choosing Polyethylene as our Plastic Substrate
Through doing more secondary research from the World Wildlife Fund and ScienceDirect, we identified Polyethyelene (PE) as one of the most prevalent sources of plastic pollution and yet seems to be one of the toughest kinds to eliminate. Plastic bags made out of PE take up the largest percentage of marine debris (90% of all floating marine debris), which caused major damage to aquatic life. On the other hand, people have found it extremely hard to degrade PE, as it is essentially made up of a long hydrocarbon chain with no chemical groups for enzymes to recognize and digest. It has also proven to be very resistant to chemical attacks.
In 2015, the Hong Kong government imposed a levy scheme on PE plastic bags in order to minimize its environmental impacts. Nonetheless, some plastic bag use remains, along with past wastes which wound up in landfills, waiting for millennia to be decomposed. As such, our team is committed to tackle this problem and help fulfil Hong Kong government's vision of a cleaner Hong Kong using our genetic constructs to degrade PE.
3. Taking it a Step Further -  Converting Waste to Electricity
Our team realized, however, that simply degrading polyethylene would produce fragmented alkanes, which could potentially be harmful to the environment as well.
We wanted to turn this problem into an opportunity by using our end product to potentially solve yet another environmental issue. We realized that energy security is another pressing issue which countries face.

So in the stable reaction system the concentration of Cl^- will ascend with the beginning of the reaction. The released Cl^- can reaction with Hg^(2+) from Hg(SCN)_2 and release the SCN^-. When adding to the Fe^(3+), they will react together and produce Fe(SCN)_3, a kind of red complex compound， at the 460nm it has absorption peak.

Off-targeting Full Model
Introduction to the off-target model
Our project involves employing Cas13a for detecting antibiotic resistance genes. Cas13a acts like a detective that can signal the presence of specific RNA sequences. Its target description is provided by a specific single guide RNA sequence, denoted as the crRNA, that is positioned (loaded) within the protein. Cas13a is activated when the loaded crRNA pairs with a complementary (target) sequence. The crRNA is therefore essential in directing Cas13a towards a predefined target. Besides specific target recognition, proteins from the CRISPR-Cas family may also exhibit off-target activity. While offering possibilities to target related variants of antibiotic resistance genes, this off-target activity could also compromise the reliability of a Cas13a-based detection system. We address this problem by employing a recently proposed kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) to describe the off-target effects of our detection system for a given crRNA. As such, we are able to rank potential crRNAs - derived from our motif finding algorithm - by their reliability. In addition, these modelling efforts revealed a design flaw in one of the crRNAs, guiding the labteam towards the right crRNA sequences to utilize in our experiments.
The kinetic model we used was designed for proteins similar to Cas9, and required adjustment, as Cas13a has interesting properties that the model was not developed for. Cas13a has a seed region central to the spacer ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ), while other Cas protein variants, including Cas9, have a 3’-end seed Semenova et al. 2011 ). In addition, for Cas13a, a protospacer flanking site (PFS) – a nucleotide 3’ to the target that should not be guanine - is important, rather than a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) - a nucleotide sequence next to the non-target strand of f.e. Cas9 ( Shmakov et al. 2015 ). This can attributed to the fact that Cas13a detects single strand RNA sequences, rather than double stranded DNA sequences. As a result, we set the model’s energy associated to PAM-binding to 0. The process of target binding with a central seed region is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

In the kinetic model, loaded Cas13a can be in a number of states. It can be unbound, have formed n (correct or incorrect)"

Determined to find a substitute for the P23019 plasmid that would serve as a vector for the TetR sequence, we searched through the database looking for a plasmid with resistance to something other than ampicillin as well as a P15a origin of replication. We found four distinct possibilities, only two of which were available in the plates from the standard registry: pSB3K1 which has kanamycin resistance, and pSB3C5 which has chloramphenicol resistance (very similar to p23019).
Thursday, 7th of July 2011
Vincent and Nadine made a digestion on the minipreps from the 4 colonies that were transformed with the Gibson-extended J61002 plasmid. If Gibson was successful, only Pst1 will cut and we should have one band of 3094 bp. If Gibson didn't work, then Pst1 and Spe1 will cut and we should have 2 bands of 890 and 2060 bp. The digestion was made according to last year's protocol, with 1.5 hour incubation. The ladder on the gel is 1kb.
Colonies 1 and 4 have the expected band over 3kb, which is coherent with the observation made that they did express RFP. But colonies 2 and 3 have only one band... It is likely that in these cells the plasmid recombined in a shorter way, without RFP but with the resistance; otherwise the plasmid sequence is not what we think. We'll check tomorrow on the J61002 plasmid if we do get 2 bands on the starting plasmid. Also, we have some light smaller bands in colonies 1 and 4, indicating that the miniprep is perhaps not so pure.
Vincent and Alessandro transformed the J61002 original plasmid, since we were running out of DNA with which to compare to the Gibson assembly. In addition, they transformed the results of the previous day's registry search for convenient substitute plasmids (for p23019) using Alina's cells using 50 ng/microL concentration (Chloramphenicol Chl-SB3C5 70.6 ng/microL, K-SB3K1 67.7 ng/microL). These were plated appropriately and put in the incubator overnight.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," arguments he gave against the commons have tarnished it. Hardin postulates that one pursues its own interest and as a consequence if a resource (e.g. a pasture) were to be exploited freely by anyone, it would rapidly be destroyed as everybody would try to take the best slice out of it. Hardin concludes : “Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.”
However, Elinor Ostrom's (1933-2012) work, which led her to win the Nobel prize in economics in 2009, broadened the economists' mind on this particular topic.
The new commons
Ostrom emphasizes the fact that Hardin “was actually discussing open access rather than managed commons” (Hess & Ostrom, 2006). Using this argument among others, she pointed out the weaknesses of Hardin's thinking : contrary to his theory, a lot of resources have been responsibly managed as communal goods over many centuries in Europe, before being privatized through the “enclosure” movement from the 15th to the 18th century.
Her study made her precise the commons' concept. Throughout many examples, she ended up characterizing it as a “jointly owned legal set of rights”. Besides, in contrast to Hardin who offered only two solutions (privatization or nationalization) to the supposed “tragedy of the commons”, she distinguished this form of property and management of resources from both traditional private (market, companies) and public (planning, State) economic approaches: each community managing a commons fixes its own rules by defining a governance frameworkl and some “bundles of rights”. The latter which specifies the access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation rights are distributed to the different actors exploiting the resource in order to manage it jointly, and efficiently according to a defined hierarchy.
Ostrom insisted on the uniqueness of every case of commons she (or her students) studied. Nevertheless she succeeded in identifying a set of founding principles each sustainable commons fits.
“clearly defined boundaries should be in place
rules in use are well matched to local needs and conditions
individuals affected by these rules can usually participate in modifying the rules
the right of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities
a system for self-monitoring members’ behavior has been established
a graduated system of sanctions is available
community members have access to low-cost conflict-resolution mechanisms""
Conclusion
The huge energetic and environmental challenges every country will have to face"

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Green light producer_-_-_TEXT.html," have not yet reached that stage, but the part is available in the registry as BBa_K360010 .
In addition to the above, we created a codon-optimised mutant of the firefly luciferase, reported by Fujii et al. (2007) to be 12.5 times brighter than the wildtype. This may help to alleviate the problems foreseen with a lack of luminescence intensity failing to activate the light sensors of the corresponding wavelength.
LUCIE (LUCiferase with Intense Emission) has three mutations compared to the wild type: Ile423Leu, Asp436Gly, and Leu530Arg. This causes more efficient binding of ATP and luciferin, which are used up faster and result in increased brightness of the cells.
Strategy
The wildtype version of the luciferase was cloned into pSB1C3. The 6 extra bases between the start codon and the start codon were removed by PCR, using a forward primer starting at the start codon, and an RBS based reverse primer. The part and the vector were thus amplified, but without the 6 extra bases.
The codon optimised LUCIE luciferase was synthesised by GENEART , then transferred to pSB1C3.
Problems
Unfortunately, GENEART is often overloaded with synthesis requests at this time of year. The bright luciferase arrived at the last moment, and the photos were taken the same day as the wiki freeze. We did not have time to characterise it further.
BioBricks
Firefly luciferase was originally deposited in the Registry by Ljubljana 2007 . We modified this slightly and re-submitted in pSB1C3, along with a codon-optimised mutant and a simple reporter system.

EPFL,2016,Team:EPFL#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," and model our project around these challenges. In addition, we have to fill out various safety forms to ensure that we are not working with material that could be dangerous or used for malicious purposes. Any material we order from companies is also checked by them to control for safety, and to prevent bioterrorism.
""Have you considered the downstream effects of your research?""
We often find ourselves considering the implications of our research. Is changing the way genetic circuit already work dangerous? What about introducing new genes? What about giving people the tools to do it easily dangerous? All of these things can be dangerous. As we see it however, the risk-benefit balance has to be evaluated when new projects that have direct social implications are being considered. This is something that is already happening; ethical boards everywhere review social projects and new research before allowing them to happen. We cannot allow the small probability of a catastrophic ending to negate the colossal amount of good that a technology can create. This dilemma has been evident since the creation of fire – none of what we have would exist today if our ancestors hadn’t taken the risk of getting burned.
To return to issues germane to our project, there is a risk that “democratizing” the ability to design your own genetic circuits. However, many of the safeguards that are present in genetic research are applicable to our project. Algorithms from companies can ensure that the material that they are providing could not be used for bioterrorism. Something that is missing currently is the ability to control that the circuits that are in an organism actually do what they are stated to do. It should be possible to combat this issue by creating a software which can recognize genetic circuits and predict their output – a “reverse Cello” so to speak. One of the challenges this program will face is to distinguish new DNA and functions from that of the original genome. Once again, these risks can be mitigated, and the consensus in the scientific community is that with the potential benefits of this technology – easier drug manufacturing, the ability to cure disease in complex metabolic pathways, creating cells with new capacities to sense their environments and make calculations based on their environments – we should hesitate only long enough to ensure that this work is safe, but no longer.
Mini iGEM
On the 14th of September, we were invited to speak to two classes in collège de Candolle about iGEM. This was the opportunity to engage into an educational discussion about synthetic biology and social issues on the topic of genetic manipulation. They had no idea about the issues that the field of Synthetic Biology encounters, but after our presentation and discussions they well understood many"

Safety
Safety was a top priority for our team, especially because a majority of our research took place in a biochemical laboratory setting. The lab in question was the third floor of the Molecular Plant Sciences building at Michigan State University, classified as a Biosafety Level 1 laboratory.
Once permitted to work in the lab, the team followed the safety protocol outlined in our training, including wearing long pants, closed-toe shoes, and disposable gloves. When working in a fume or laminar  flow hood, team members wore safety glasses/goggles and lab coats. Additionally, safety protocols required that team members could never be in the laboratory if a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher,  or faculty member was not also present. Because the lab space was shared by four different research groups, supervision was rarely an issue. On a day to day basis our research team wore nitrile lab gloves, long pants and closed toed shoes as PPE. Additional PPE of a lab coat was worn when running gel electrophoresis to protect from ethidium bromide. All bacterial work was performed in biosafety cabinets. We worked with Trichoderma spp. and Fusarium spp. in a laminar flow hood because of their high propensity for contamination of other fungal cultures.
Safe Project Design
The team made sure to use a safe, non-pathogenic chassis for our project. We transformed chloramphenicol resistance, GFP and the acds gene into our chassis Enterobacter ludwigii. This species is most closely related to Enterobacter hormaechei which is considered a risk 2 organism. We chose Enterobacter ludwigii for its lack of the acds gene, relatively quick growth, lack of innate resistance to chloramphenicol, and transformability. We decided not to include a kill-switch device in our organism because that would have required us to genetically engineer the plant it was applied to and spray a chemical onto the plants to induce endophyte cell death.
The bad news: no colonies growing. The good news: we stayed safe by wearing disposable gloves!
Erin displays proper safety by working with bacteria in a biosafety cabinet.

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," water. In order to search for the best methods of inserting E.coli into the system, we visited the Taunton Aquarium Centre and purchased a fluidised media reactor, forming one of the next components of the filter, the metal binding reactor. The use of a Design of Experiments approach, along with numerous experiments we conducted on the Reactor, provided us with required information including the optimal volume of the Reactor or the type of media the bacteria should grow on. The filter is also equipped with components ensuring quality and safety of the whole process, including bactericidal mechanisms preventing the transfer of GM organisms into the natural environment. The design of the filter, at all stages of its development, was carefully discussed with potential stakeholders, including the South West Water company, to ensure it would meet the current standards.
In order to optimize the performance of our filter system and to measure its efficiency in various conditions, we constructed a mathematical model . The model, when given information about the metal to be extracted, initial concentration, flow rate, metal binding reactor volume and target efficiency, calculates the expected efficiency, output concentration of the metal, time required to run the water through the filter and the mass of the metal reclaimed. It determines whether the whole process, assuming the variables given, would be successful and if there is no need for any changes in the initial settings.
We did not want our work in the laboratory to be insular. Over the course of the summer we liaised with a number of researchers, stakeholders and NGOs, all of whom became significant parts of the iterative progression of our project. Their influence and inspiration reminded us that scientists have an interdependent relationship with society and should consider themselves part of a larger community. All of our Human Practices have been executed according to the Responsible Research and Innovation Framework.
We have released a mobile phone app that can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. The app is a simple visualisation of biological fundamentals underlying the design of our research and it contains trivia related to the world of synthetic biology as an educative function.

In the second step, this activated intermediate reacts with oxygen to create a transient dioxetane that breaks down to the oxidized products, oxyluciferin and CO2. Upon mixing with substrates, firefly luciferase produces an initial burst of light that decays over about 15 seconds to a low level of sustained luminescence. This kinetic profile reflects the slow release of the enzymatic product, thus limiting catalytic turnover after the initial reaction.
The popularity of native firefly luciferase as a genetic reporter is due to the sensitivity and convenience of the enzyme assay and tight coupling of protein synthesis with enzyme activity. Firefly luciferase, which is encoded by the luc gene, is a monomer that does not require any post-translational modifications; it is available as a mature enzyme directly upon translation of its mRNA. Catalytic competence is attained immediately after release from the ribosome. Also, luciferase has a very short half-life in cells (approximately 3 hours). Combined, these properties make luciferase an extremely responsive reporter, far more so than other commonly used reporters.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
One major task for every iGEM team is the creation of a wiki describing their project. For this reason the MIT is hosting a MediaWiki and every iGEM participant is allowed to create wiki pages on this server. The great advantage of this setup is that no team has to run their own server for hosting their wiki. On the other hand, team members are not allowed to change any MediaWiki settings, such as changing the skin of the wiki or installing extensions. As a part of your ""Beyond the Lab"" project we want to help other team getting started on their wiki. Therefore we will show how to create a team wiki that is easy to use and can still be customized as desired. Furthermore, we will also explain how to use this wiki even if somebody else of your team created the wiki. After running through this tutorial, you will have a basic framework that can be extended and enhanced later on.
The tutorial will be divided into two parts:
Part I describes how to create and setup a team wiki at the first place. This part should be read by members in charge of the layout and design of the wiki and will require basic computer"

Welcome to KIT-Kyoto wiki page
KIT, Kyoto Institute of Technology, is a national university in Kyoto, which had been the capital city of Japan for more than a thousand years. KIT was founded to do research on silk and textile, important for artistic kimono industries for Kyoto.   Though its name has 'technology' in it, KIT is a fusion of science and arts. KIT has been committed in the genetics more recently. A good example is the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC), which collects stocks of Drosophila, an essential model organism in life science research, from laboratories around the world. There are only two other such centers in the world. The institute has also collaborated actively with industries in Kyoto and beyond.   KIT's competence is beyond science. It also has arts and design courses.   KIT is a place of robust science and creative arts.  We will exert our strength As students of KIT, we are very proud of competing with wonderful students in other universities in iGEM. We will show you what you will get when arts and science merge. See you in Boston!

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate"

Proof of Improvement
Liquid cultures of the inoculated red colonies showed a bright red color after one-night incubation, as can be seen in Figure 4, where cultures with the original BioBrick (BBa_I13502) and our improved version (BBa_K2835000) are shown side by side. To prove that the introduced mutations did not affect the fluorescence of the protein, absorbance measurements were performed. A wavelength of 600 nm was used to check the cell density, while 584 nm (excitation peak of mRFP1 [3]) was used to measure the red fluorescent protein. The results showed close to identical absorbance for both versions of mRFP1, with values of OD584/OD600 = 1.058 for the original BioBrick and OD584/OD600 = 1.068 for our mutated version. These results, together with sequencing results confirming the introduced mutations, prove that our mutated BioBrick is an improved version of the original part. It has equal fluorescent properties and is compatible with assembly standard RFC25. RFC25 enables in-frame protein assembly, which could be beneficial when this BioBrick is used as a fluorescent reporter linked to another protein.

SAMURAI and Future iGEM teams
Now to the question: Can the SAMURAI technique be a valuable resource for future iGEM teams? We believe so! The strongest argument for this is time. As we have experienced, one of the most limiting factors in the iGEM competition is the short time frame of the project. SAMURAI is a quick site-directed mutagenesis technique, especially when you wish to introduce point mutations in different parts of a gene. Another argument is specificity. When performing site-directed mutagenesis with conventional methods there will most likely be some wild-type DNA not containing the mutations left in the mix, and lots of samples have to be sent for sequencing due to this. By elimination of the uracil-containing wild-type DNA not including the mutations, the chance of keeping any non-mutated products is significantly lower. The third argument is low cost. Not only will the method drastically reduce the number of samples having to be sent for sequencing, but all the reagents needed, except"

Safety Measures
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
All our work is supervised by PhD students, PhDs and professors of our university who are very experienced in laboratory work and are currently working at the Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry (IFIB). Their expertise reaches from genetics over molecular biology to structural biology.  We document our work in our laboratory notebook to enable replicability.  Our project does not pose any dangers to researchers or the public: we are following widely used laboratory protocols in an appropriate laboratory facility (biosafety level 1 laboratory, S1), as requested by German law (""Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (GenTG)"", German Gene Technology Law).
Joining regular briefings concerning laboratory safety is an essential element of our education at the University of Tuebingen. In addition all members of our team heard a special talk about biosafety. The organisms used in our project, namely Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are well-known and considered safe. These organisms are specifically optimized to not carry out any pathogenic, toxicogenic, or colonising activities and due to the harmless nature of our parts we do not foresee any security concerns. In case of success in yeast, we try to test our system in higher eukaryotic cells, such as MEFs or human cancer cell lines. We do not plan to experiment with any other organisms. Our project is intended to be used inside the laboratory. We are working at a S1 laboratory, which implies several methods for guaranteeing safety to researchers and environment are constantly enforced but research is limited to well known and nonhazardous species.

The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston.
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. An activity that is going to be explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), the centre where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity, we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There were 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.
In the afternoon the time was taken to take a tour of the tourist centre of the city and ended up having"

BioMarvel,2018,Team:BioMarvel#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". From this point of view, HAPPI could be very meaningful as it gives people the opportunity to diagnose heart failure early.
However, the biosensor chip seems to be expensive. NT-proBNP levels are usually measured from about 50 to 100 US dollars. It would be much more expensive to invent this diagnostic device to a chip. If it is commercialized, the unit price will be lower, but it may become more expensive depending on the demand. However, I think it could be popular if a kit comes out in the market at an affordable price with high accessibility. If a low priced chip is developed, it could be used widely in developing countries.
The implementation of the U-healthcare system in the diagnosis of heart failure will be a great advantage to the current diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. Nevertheless, more research is needed to ascertain if it even affects mortality. It should be verified through scientific evidence as to tell whether the mortality rate is reduced.
What we learned
Overall, professor Wook Bum Pyun has provided invaluable advice on numerous aspects of our project. He has commented not only on the medical aspects of HAPPI but also on practical ones, such as economic and social perspectives. Moreover, his use of specific data in describing current heart failure mortality and pricing of NT-proBNP measurement allowed us to ground our project on reality. As a result, we were able to analyze some obstacles related to the practical aspects of our device, which helped us to improve our project. Thanks to professor Wook Bum Pyun, we were able to address both the medical and practical aspects of our device.
3. Heart Failure Patient Interview
The main purpose of our team’s project is an advanced diagnosis of heart failure. Therefore, it was essential for our team to hear from actual patients who have been suffering from heart failure. By doing so, we aimed to discuss the reasons why individuals acquire such diseases and to relate the difficulties they face in their daily lives.
Through a contact with a medical institution in Seoul, our team had an interview with a middle-aged, female patient who has been suffering from heart failure since 2016. The patient had been working as an office worker for nearly 30 years since her twenties and admitted that the main reasons for the disease she acquired were her lack of exercise and poor diet schedule. When we inquired about the symptoms that she had noticed before she was diagnosed as having heart failure, she said that the symptoms were the shortness of breath and swelling of her ankles and legs.
Through the interview we had, our team reinforced the main purpose of our project with the creation of the"

Lethbridge,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of this device will occur this summer at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with neuroscience researcher Dr. Gerlinde Metz.
Ward said the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.
“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said.
“iGEM is run out of a student-operated lab provided by the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at the University of Lethbridge and coordinated by Dr. HJ Wieden. We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”
Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly’s father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.
At an event held on Wednesday, June 12 in Lethbridge the Community Futures Lethbridge Region hosted an event that acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.
Lethbridge-based Ladybug Arborists took first place, while Strathmore business Kindred Companions and Lifesavers Designated Driving (Lethbridge) shared the runner-up awards.

1. Additional Characterization of part BBa_K325909
Improving upon the work of the Cambridge iGEM team 2010 and NTNU Trondheim iGEM team 2017, we performed additional experiments to add further information and build upon the characterization of part BBa_K325909. As this part is provided in the 2018 Distribution Kit, we tested the effectiveness of the arabinose induced lux operon-encoded enzymatic pathway for light emission in part BBa_K325909 by transforming it into E. coli, incubating overnight and subjecting it to different final concentrations of arabinose over a course of five hours. Reflecting upon the previous characterizations, we chose a temperature of 29℃ to perform our experiments, since by looking at the information presented by the NTNU Trondheim iGEM team 2017, it seems as if 29℃ may provide us with the brightest results.
Luminometric and photometric measurements were taken with a Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flask 4.00.53 every hour throughout the experiment, and the data was recorded on the raw data table provided below.
The data is analyzed using the formula: (Average Luminescence/0Hrs Luminescence)/(Average Abs/0Hrs Abs) for each concentration of arabinose, and the graphs are plotted below, with part BBa_K325909 abbreviated as 4L:
From the graph, even though the relative luminescence of the bacteria are similar during the first four hours, there is a significant increase in relative luminescence during the fifth hour at a concentration of 0.1M, therefore we have concluded that inducing part BBa_K325909 with 0.1M arabinose will result in the most intense light emission.
2. Construction of the Composite Part BBa_K2836002
To increase the light output from part BBa_K325909, we used de novo synthesis to create an additional luxG gene from a different strain of the same species of bioluminescent bacteria (Aliivibrio fischeri), which codes for the flavin reductase used in"

Summary
Goksel analysing the bands seen in the gel photograph
Today we decided we should redo the minipreps from last weeks biobricks using the overnight cultures we set up yesterday. For the miniprep procedure we followed the extra guidelines that Chris advised us about. The final rehydrated plasmid minipreps were put into the -20 freezer in the 'iGEM plasmid minipreps' box. We also did a restriction digest of the two miniprep samples for biobrick C0178 and ran this on a 0.8% agarose gel. This went well, both samples having the fragment sizes expected.  Tomorrow we will be carrying out another restriction digest of todays minipreps, however to save time tomorrow, we poured a gel and put it into the fridge ready to load the samples tomorrow. In order to make sure the prepared gel did not dry out, a small amount of 1% TAE was poured onto the gel, which was wrapped in cling film, clearly"

Moreover, in order to test the efficiency of mazF. We transformed the constructed PcspA-mazF plasmid into BL21, added 1 mM IPTG to the plate, and cultured at 16℃ for 16 h (Figure 11A). We then cultured BL21 transformed with the PcspA-mazF plasmid overnight at 37℃. After diluting to OD600=0.02 on the next day, the cells were cultured at 16℃(Figure 11B) and 37 ℃(Figure 11C), and the OD value was measured every hour for 9 hours. From Figure 11, the kill switch worked efficiently at low temperatures and indicated that mazF enable to cause cell death even at a low expression level.

We also compared the fluorescence of Spinach2 and Spinach2.1 with excess DFHBI, to determine if Spinach2.1 folds as well as Spinach2.
Spinach2 and Spinach2.1 RNA was produced and the concentrations were measured:
Spinach2: 40 ng/µl
Spinach2.1: 14 ng/µl
Excess of DFHBI-1T was added and fluorescence was measured:
Spinach2: 306.9
Spinach2.1: 116.2
Because of the low RNA concentrations we chose to use all the RNA we had produced, instead of using equal concentrations, as we wanted to make sure that fluorescence was detectable. The low RNA concentrations also resulted in a fairly weak signal compared to measurement noise. The above fluorescence signals are means of 9 successive measurements.
Figure 2 shows the fluorescence intensities divided by the RNA concentrations. The error bars denote the standard error of the mean. The two different Spinach versions show comparable fluorescence per concentration, and we conclude that our generated mutant Spinach2.1 folds as well as the existing Spinach2.
Figure 2: Fluorescence values normalised by RNA concentration for Spinach2 and Spinach2.1. Error bars denote standard error of the mean, obtained from 9 successive measurements on the samples. Fluorescence units are in arbitrary units.
It would have been ideal to make triplicate measurements of fluorescence of both Spinach2 and Spinach2.1. However since we had complications with producing high concentrations of RNA in vitro we chose to use all generated RNA in one sample. We conducted multiple measurements on each sample, where the standard error is obtained from. We conclude that the two spinach sequences function equally well. Spinach2.1 has been submitted as a BioBrick (see our Parts page) and we have only used Spinach2.1 in the rest of the project. After learning that Spinach2.1 worked as we had hoped we decided not to investigate the function of the other mutant, mentioned in experimental design further.
Note: We observed that fluorescence from Spinach was strongly dependent on temperature, with lower temperatures giving higher fluorescence. Therefore all samples have been chilled on ice before being measured, to ensure high signals and to minimize variation.
Construct of strains
We constructed a library of DH5α strains with promoters of different strength in front of the Spinach2.1 flanked by the tRNA scaffold. We intended"

They borrowed pet28a plasmids from us to construct their parts but could only provide us with the bacteria, but not the purified protein product we wanted due to time limitation.
3 Meet up
We participated and presented our project in two very meaningful IGEMers Meet-ups, one local, the Shenzhen IGEMers Meet-up hosted by @SCIE and @SFLS; one national, CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) , which is the largest IGEMers Meet-up in China with both university and high school teams as participants.
The Shenzhen IGEMers Meet-up was much smaller, but we were still able to learn about the competition as well as the projects of the teams around Shenzhen. First, Dr. Zhang Haoqian, the CFO of Bluepha, taught us the essence of IGEM competition: Innovation and responsibility for developing the project; Originality + roundness for presenting our project; Sophistication when designing the bio-circuit. He also reminded us of the importance of several competition requirements, especially the judging form. Then he talked about his own experience with IGEM and encouraged us to work as an efficient team in the following months before the wiki freeze. We presented our project for the first time in this meet-up, and discovered several points we could improve on. The other teams’ presentation inspired us a lot and we continued to perfect our presentation for the CCiC meet-up as well as the Giant Jamboree. Dr. Zhang called us to pay attention to highlight the distinguished feature of our project comparing to the Peking 2015 project to make our story more complete. This was a truly valuable advice.
Besides the project presentation in Shenzhen College of International Education, we had the opportunity to enjoy the delicious food around the campus + the special gifts we received from the team members:
4 NUDT-China
In the August of 2017, we went to FAFU CCiC (Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University Conference of China’s iGEMers Community) and had a meet-up with team NUDT-China. We took advantage of their parts (sHRPN-dcas9 and sHRPC-dcas9) design of last year and tested the function of those parts. Their parts reduced our time spent on plasmid construction and improved our efficiency in signal transformation (from the target DNA concentration to lumines"

NYU_Abu_Dhabi,2017,Team:NYU Abu Dhabi#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," RMSD over the whole run indicate that the structure at 1 ns is slightly different from the initial structure, due to the energy minimization.
The radius of gyration, which measures a protein’s compactness, indicates that the protein is stably folded over the 1 ns production run. The plot shows reasonable variation and, along with the RMSD plots, show that this protein is very stable in explicit solvent solution (Figure 5).
glgC16 (glgC with G336D substitution) ( BBa_K118016 )
This part was designed by Edinburgh 2008 and is a protein from E.coli JM109 with the substitution G336D. 2017 Team NYU Abu Dhabi ran an in silico experiment of part BBa_K118016 which is the glgC (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) from E. coli with mutation Gly336Asp.
In Silico Validation
The properties of this mutation were compared to the wild type by running MD simulations using GROMACS with the CHARMM36 forcefield. We ran an energy minimization for 500 ps using the steepest descent minimization algorithm with a stopping condition of maximum force less than 1000 kJ/mol/nm. We found that the energy was minimized in this time frame as shown by the steady convergence of the potential energy (Figure 1).
The minimized structures were solvated with water >12 A away from the protein surface. Potassium and chlorine atoms were added to neutralize the system and mimic experimental conditions of approximately 30 mM concentrations. We equilibrated in two phases, first under an NVT ensemble and then under an NPT ensemble. Both were found to equilibrate within 150 ps as shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. These adjusted the volume to 1 bar and temperature to 300K with restraints on the solutes.
The last frame of the NPT equilibration was extracted to start NVT simulations. A short animation of the protein run for 1 ns is attached. RMSD and radius of gyration analyses were run in order to determine the stability of the protein. The RMSD plot (Figure 4) shows the RMSD of the wildtype and G336D backbone does not fluctuate dramatically over the 1000 ps run, indicating that the structure is stable. The backbone of the G336D is overall more stable than the wildtype in the 1000 ps run. The increased stability may facilitate the increased activity of glgC in the absence of its activator observed during experimental tests.

Intro: Today I delved into the specifics of resuspending newly synthesized DNA once we receive it from IDT. Phil and I discussed primer design in more detail. We will order the cage gene flanked by the iGEM prefix and suffix, then use one round of PCR with primers overlapping the cage gene itself and including the NdeI and XhoI sites. Additionally, I designed amplification primers for the cage gene itself. Phil and I researched which sequencing primers to use for the pET22b vector.

Cage Amplification Primer Design: I used the PCquad 2.0 benchling file that Phil created by altering some of the optimized codons for preferred primer design. My primers amplify just the cage gene itself. They are 20 and 21 bp long, both with Tms very close to 55C. After analyzing them primers using IDT's OligoAnalyzer 3.1 ( https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer ) I determined that the two primers formed a heterodimer with a deltaG of -6.21 kcal/mole. However, Phil and I decided that this was fine since anything greater than -9 kcal/mole should be alright. We tried to run heterodimer analyses of each primer against the cage gene"

We calculated the cost to run the enzyme assay using the native substrate analog crotonyl-CoA, and calculated it costs 67 cents. A report published in 2002 by the American Association of Physics Teachers recommended that the budget for high school laboratories to be $1 per student per week[20]. Assuming this is the recommended budget for other laboratory courses, students would be unable to run our assay more than once in a given week. We calculated the cost of our enzyme assay:
and found that 89% of the cost actually came from crotonyl CoA.  In addition to being expensive, Coenzyme A (CoA) is not very stable in solution. Sigma has reported that solutions stored at -20C are only stable for 2 weeks! [21]
In order to implement our device in a high school laboratory setting, we wanted our assay to be under 10 cents to run. This would allow a student to run our assay ~ 10 times. We couldn’t change the cost to produce the enzyme, nor its cofactor NADH, but it seemed feasible to try to find a cheaper substrate to use that did not involve CoA. Just like our enzyme screening process above, we needed to understand the chemistry behind how crotonyl CoA reacted in order to find cheaper substrates to use. We knew the reaction involved the reduction of the C2-C3 double bond. Rafferty et al first proposed the mechanism in which a hydride from NADH transferred to C3, which formed an enolate anion on the carbonyl oxygen. A proton transfer from tyrosine then leads to a keto-enol tautomerization [25][26]. In vivo, crotonyl is covalently bonded to acyl carrier protein, but coenzyme A is used as an analog. The purpose of these two molecules is to carry acyl chains through the cytoplasm (Acyl refers to CH3-C=O groups) [27].
We therefore designed a chemical biology screening based on two parameters: functional group similarity to the crotonyl moiety and to mimic CoA’s role as an acyl carrier. We wanted to explore a large chemical space to increase our chances of finding a hit. We weren’t completely sure if FabI only reduced carbon-carbon double bonds, so we tested valeraldehyde to see if Fab"

For the fermentation processes, pressed and dried quince pomace that is composed of 28.8% glucose, 55.7% fructose and 10.1% sucrose based on dry mass was used instead of glucose (Deniz et al. 2015). After quince pomace and LB were mixed aseptically, fermentation was carried out at pH 6 with automatic KOH additions in the field to avoid pH levels lower than 6. Solids were separated via centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 min at 5°C and supernatant was used to calculate ethanol and reduced sugar. (Deniz et al. 2015)
Total soluble reducing sugar content of quince pomace was obtained by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method in which absorbance was measured at 540 nm and ethanol concentrations of test groups were determined by using a Gas Chromatograph. (Deniz et al. 2015)
How our parts would work in different systems?
By modifying E. coli strain KO11, we have actually designed bacteria that can cope with reactive oxygen species, free radicals and furan byproducts without interfering with the NADPH metabolism (Höck et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011).
Thus, our parts would be also feasible in other conditions in which toxins such as ROS or inhibitors such as heavy metals exist  (Ask et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). This genetical improvement is due to GSH, which is an antioxidant that detoxifies free radicals and such types; and FucO which is an oxidoreductase that transforms HMF and furfural to non-toxic alcohols without getting in the way of the bacteria’s own metabolism (Ask et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011).
Although these two genes highly contribute to systems on their own; for a more efficient production of bioethanol and bacteria with higher tolerance, such systems and mechanisms are in need of them both at the same time. This is an inference from the fact that an increase in GSH enhances tolerance to furfural but not to 5-HMF, while FucO on the other hand, is in need of GSH as it provides a longer lifespan and deals with the interactions of radicals (Kim & Hahn, 2013).

UIOWA iGEM 2018
We are the University of Iowa's 2018 iGEM Team (International Genetically Engineered Machine)! This is our second year competing in this competition.The competition provides students like us—from diverse majors and backgrounds—the opportunity to collaborate, grow teamwork skills, and carry out real-world experiments that have a substantial impact.
Our team will spend the summer working in the lab designing and conducting experiments. Although we are working with faculty advisers from three different departments here at the UI, this project is primarily student-driven and will demonstrate the excellence of Iowa research and the potential of Iowa undergraduates on an international scale.
Our project is to create a 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) biosensor, allowing us to measure the amount of 3-HP in a culture via fluorescence. 3-HP is a precursor molecule of bioplastics, that can be used in many ways including the production of acrylics and other chemicals. There are few organisms that produce relatively high amounts of 3-HP without killing itself off due to 3-HP’s high toxicity. To maximize production, we aim to take a promoter sequence from a Pseudomonas organism to insert into E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. The reasoning behind measuring with fluorescence is so that we don't stop E. coli or B. subtilis growth while producing 3-HP. We will be measuring 3-HP production in real time.
To successfully continue this project from last year, our goal for this summer is to create a Bio-Brick that functions properly, and to finish all required materials in order to receive a gold medal at the iGEM competition that is held in October.

The genes that were amplified in the first PCR (NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs)) were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit from Thermo Scientific. The purified products were digested with the enzymes EcoRI  and PstI, using 2 μl of the product. These purified and restricted products were loaded on gel, see figure 2. It was then discovered that the genes were  barely visible on gel. The restricted genes were purified with the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit and the concentration was measured with the NanoDrop 1000. The clean, restricted products were too low in  concentration to be suitable for ligation.
 
4 - 10 August
 
Because the PCR products of NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were lost during the purification and restriction in the week of 28 Juli - 3 August, the PCR was repeated for this genes, together with the genes that could not be amplified yet. This time a PCR was used that did not lower in  temperature, like the touchdown PCR, but that increased in temperature  with each step. This way it was hoped to get over the huge gap between the annealing temperature of the primer in the first cycle and the annealing temperature of the primer when the flap of the primer can also  anneal to the first PCR products. The temperature was set to increase from 40 °C to 60 °C in 20 cycles. Then, an additional 20 cycles were done at 65 °C. The PCR was performed under standard conditions as was done before, together with a series of PCR that contained GC buffer (supplied with the Phusion DNA polymerase by Thermo Scientific), and a series of PCR with GC buffer and 1.5% DMSO. This time, with the help of Lisa, the PCR was finally successful for all genes, see figure 3.
 
11 - 17 August
 
The PCR on the BioBrick of the combined genes NisR and NisK was repeated because the yield of this product was very low after the PCR in the week of 4 - 10 August. The mixture of the previous PCR reaction was used as the template. The PCR was performed under standard conditions, with an annealing temperature of 64 °C and 1 μl, 2μl and "

Although this is the aaRS with the least amino acid exchanges of our toolkit, it turned out to be the most specific. We proved the incorporation of PrK through this synthetase with our screening system for the incorporation of ncAAs. The results from our screening system, which compares the incorporation efficiency and specificity, are shown in Figure 2. For more details of our screening method, please refer to the part improvement page .
Figure 2: Comparison of the incorporation rate of PrK and native amino acids through the evolved PrK-aaRS. The negative score results from the emission quotient CFP(475 nm)/YFP(525 nm) when cultivated without the specific ncAA. The positive score results from the emission quotient YFP(525 nm)/CFP(475 nm) when cultivated with the specific ncAA. The mean rank allows the combination of the negative and the positive score to compare the efficiency of synthetases among each other.
Figure 3: Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the evolved AcF-aaRS and the wildtype TyrRS from methancoccus jannaschii.
Due to recommendation of our expert Iker Valle Aramburu , we decided to use only one ncAA to label our test protein and label the second fluorophore through maleimide labeling to a cysteine. This labeling strategy could only be used for proteins that are cysteine-free or in which all cysteines could be replaced. Because this is only possible in a few applications we decided to provide a second evolved aaRS for the incorporation of AcF in response to the rarely used leucine codon CUA. The sequence of the synthetase is similar to the aaRS described by Kim 2012 to incorporate AcF in response to CUA .
Construction of the Expression Plasmid for the Sup35 Test Protein
For our test protein, we decided to order a gene synthesis of the NMregion of Sup35 . The NM region is 250 amino acids long and responsible for the prion forming function of Sup35. The test protein contains an amber codon at position 21 and one cysteine codon at position 121.
According to our expert Iker Valle Aramburu, the incorporation of two noncanonical amino acids lowers the yield. He recommended us to use only one non-canonical amino acid and one cysteine, which could be labeled in a maleimide coupling reaction.  Mukhopadayay et al. 2006 showed that mutants of Sup35 containing no cysteines are still able to form"

Gillespie Algorithm Simulation
Gillespie Algorithm, a Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), can simulate biochemical reactions with small number of molecules accurately. Reactions in cells are full of random fluctuations due to low number of molecules present. For instance, there can be only one or two copies of a gene in one cell. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm for more details)
An example simulation result of our script using Gillespie Algorithm. 100 cells are generated in this figure. We can see how the state of the cell (represented by protein level in this case) change with the flow of time.
We use this algorithm to generate hundreds of sample trajectories at high and low inputs, each representing the dynamic changes in the amount of protein in a single cell. Afterwards, we find a time point when all reactions in cells have reached steady state, and ink down the states of the cells at that very moment. The approach resembles the flow cytometry experiment, in both of which we get a sample composed of cells with dissimilar protein levels.
From the simulated data, we can use methods in experiment data processing to calculate channel capacities.
We use ${k_{on}}$ and ${k_{off}}$, two parameters of dimer forming and disassociation, to characterize the process of dimerization. For split EBFP2 without intein, kon is relatively small due to low affinity, and ${k_{off}} > 0$. For split EBFP2 with intein, kon is larger and ${k_{off}} = 0$ because once they interact, they will not fall apart.
Under suitable parameter set, we obtained the following results shown in the table below. When ${k_{off}}$  comes down to zero, channel capacity increases in accordance to experimental results.
We computationally scan the two parameters in two-dimensional parameter space to explore the impacts of those kinetic constants.
In the heat map, warmer color stands for higher channel capacity, vice versa. The figure on the left stands for the case where both halves are driven by inducible promotors, the right for that where one of them is driven by constitutive promotor. The latter resemble chemical titration, so we legend it as above.
The lower left part of the map is warmer. In this region, ${k_{on}}$ is high and ${k_{off}}$ is low, which means that two peptides are prone to associate. This is the very district where the state of split EBFP2 with intein lies in.

The abundance of carbon compounds on earth
Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas emitted by human activities. As part of the Earth’s carbon cycle, carbon dioxide is also naturally present in the atmosphere: It is constantly exchanged between the atmosphere, ocean and land surface as it is produced and absorbed by many microorganisms, plants and animals. But human activities affect the carbon cycle by adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and by damaging natural sinks, for example forests which would otherwise remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Nitrous Oxide, like carbon dioxide, is also naturally present in the atmosphere as it is part of the global nitrogen cycle: Nitrogen circulates between the atmosphere, plants, animals and bacteria breaking it down in the oceans and soils. Even though it has a variety of natural sources, human activities such as wastewater management or nitrogen fertilization increase the amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. These molecules stay in the atmosphere for about 120 years but can be removed by certain types of bacteria or even destroyed by chemical reactions or ultraviolet radiation.
The proportion of methane emissions from various natural sources.
In contrast to other greenhouse gases, fluorinated gases do not have natural sources and only arise from human activities. F-gases are emitted through different industrial processes and many of them have a very high global warming potential in comparison to other greenhouse gases. Therefore, even very small atmospheric concentrations can have great effects on global temperatures. Additionally they have very long atmospheric lifetimes, lasting up to thousands of years. F-gases are removed from the atmosphere only when they get destroyed by sunlight in the far upper atmosphere. In general, fluorinated gases are the most potent and longest lasting sort of greenhouse gases emitted by humans.
Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas. It is emitted by several natural sources such as wetlands but also by different human activities like leakage from natural gas and livestock farming. Methane can be removed from the atmosphere by natural processes in soil and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. As its lifetime in the atmosphere is, compared to other greenhouse gases, quite short (~12 years), targeting methane emissions as a means of reducing the overall greenhouse gas emissions in a relatively short period of time is a reasonable approach to reduce global warming.  Globally, around 60 % of all methane emissions originate from human activities like industry, agriculture and waste management.
Chronological emission trend, considering different sources of carbon dioxide
Even though the total methane emissions decreased by around 10 % between 1990 and 2012 the emissions associated with agricultural activities did not. This is mostly due to the intensification of"

Beta-lactamase PCA colorimetric assay
To quantify the amount of active beta-lactamase in the periplasm of an E. coli bacterium and thus validate our mathematical program in this aspect, we performed an [osmotic shock] and a beta-lactamase PCA colorimetric assay (André Galarneau et. al 2002). The osmotic shock leads to the disruption of the periplasm and spreading of membrane proteins. To yield the maximum amount of active beta-lactamase an osmotic shock is used that does not use detergents that are harmful for the activity of beta-lactamase (Jalalirad 2013). With the beta-lactamase PCA colorimetric assay we determined the amount of beta-lactamase through the reduction of Nitrocefin. When Nitrocefin is split by beta-lactamase it changes its color from yellow to red like in figure 5. To measure how the beta-lactamase production changes over time we cultivated E. coli with a beta-lactamase plasmid for 6 hours and took probes every hour. Afterwards we did a lysis and a Nitrocefin assay. The results can be seen here:
Figure 5: Nitrocefin assay.
From left to right: water control and time points t0 to t6 of a E. coli cultivation.  During a cultivation period samples were taken from the culture every hour (t0 to t6). Cells in this sample were lysed, and measurements with a Nitrocefin assay were conducted.
Figure 6: Growth curve of a culture, which carries a beta-lactamase plasmid.
In figure 5 it can be seen that the beta-lactamase concentration rises with proceeding cultivation. Also we measured the beta-lactamase concentration of the whole culture at every time point and computed with the use of the OD (figure 6) the beta-lactamase concentration for one cell. 1 OD is converted to 8 * 108 cells. One cell comprises around 1.27848 * 10-6 M beta-lactamase in the periplasm. We adapted our system accordingly.

1.The development of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition in China the latest decade
Synthetic biology is a fast moving interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering. To educate the next generation of synthetic biology scientists, the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition was established. In the past ten years, many Chinese teams have participated in this event, but no thorough review and analysis have been carried out. We collect a lot of the Chinese teams’ data and information from the iGEM website and analyzed the number of teams, the performance of these teams. From these analysis, we envision the iGEM competition will continue to promote the innovative education in China, especially for those undeveloped areas.
The number of Chinese teams in iGEM competition
In Figure 1, we catalogued the number of teams from the globe or from China. From the iGEM website data, we take the teams at the “Accepted” status as the officially teams participated in the iGEM competition. In 2007, there were 5 teams from China. They were Tianjing, USTC, Peking, Tsinghua and Taipei. But in 2016, there were 73 teams from China, which surpassed all the other countries in the iGEM competition. We also calculate the ratio of Chinese teams among all the teams, and we found that the ratio increased from 9.6 % (2007) to 26.8% (2016). It took 6 years to increase from 9.6% (2013) to 22% (2013), while it took 3 years to increase from 22% (2013) to 26.8% (2016).
Figure 1a The number of teams from the globe or China and the ratio of Chinese teams
We also sum up all the times that all the teams participated in iGEM competition, and we found that in the past 10 years, there were 303 teams from university or institution participated in the iGEM competition all together. We also place their numbers in different provinces, direct-controlled municipalities and special administrative districts. We found that most of the teams were still from the developed areas, indicating that the these teams participated early in the i"
