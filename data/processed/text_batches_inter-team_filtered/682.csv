Abstract
We developed the fluorescent proteins with degradation tags which accelerate the reporter turnover. This provides better temporal resolution of gene expression profiling in single cells.
A central goal of synthetic biology is to explore the design principles that embedded in the architecture and operation of biological systems. To understand how biological systems are genetically assembled, synthetic biologists need tools to quantitatively describe the gene expression in model organisms. Fluorescent proteins(FP), along with modern microscopes, allow real-time gene expression profiling at the level of individual living cells. Though the detection of FPs benefits from their stability, this advantage turns awkward when we are monitoring the dynamic cellular events which required measurements at higher temporal resolution. One approach to achieve such demand is specific and accelerated reporter degradation. Thus, we focus on the design of fusion proteins with degradation tags. Previous studies suggest the LVA tag has hitherto been most efficient tag to shorten the half-life of tagged protein in Escherichia coli. We added LVA tags to the C-terminal of different fluorescent proteins. Our results indicate that the half-life of fluorophores are significantly reduced. Therefore, we improved the temporal resolution of reporter proteins. This provides a promising tool for studying transient gene expression in the future.
Motivation
How can we improve the temporal sampling of biological assay? We applied destabilized fluorescent proteins to achieve this goal.
Fluorescent proteins, for example, green fluorescent protein (GFP), are now widely used to visualize a protein’s distribution and dynamics in a subcellular compartment. The remarkable feature of the fluorescent proteins (FP) is that the fluorophore forms spontaneously (Chalfie et al., 1994) without the need of any substrate or cofactor (Heim et al., 1994). In addition, FP variants can be fused to virtually any protein of interest; thus, they can be used in many species for detection purposes within single living cells. FPs, together with modern microscopes, has become essential tools for studying spatial and temporal dynamics of cellular processes at high"

Introduction
This year, SZU-China has in-depth collaboration with three university teams: FAFU-CHINA, SUSTech_Shenzhen, SYSU-CHINA and two high school teams: BGIC_China and SMS_Shenzhen. The communication and cooperation with each team is shown as followings.
Our team began collaboration on June 17th, 2016 at SynBioBeta Activate, an international conference held in Shenzhen. Famous synthetic biologists all over the world gathered at the conference to share their latest discoveries in particular focuses. Some other iGEM teams from southern China also attended the conference. There, we encountered and communicated with the members of FAFU-CHINA, SUSTech_Shenzhen, SYSU-CHINA and XMU-China. After the conference, the members of the five teams had a professional and academic communication in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). As the discussion went really well, we decided to have further and deeper cooperation with each other in the future.
On the second day, June 18th, 2016, we SZU-China invited members from FAFU-CHINA，SYSU-CHINA and XMU-China to Shenzhen University to deepen our collaboration. During the conference, each of the four teams presented their projects and raised questions on others’ projects to identify the problems. At the end of the conference, we agreed to offer help as possible as we could if any of the four teams encountered difficulties. It will be a promising, continuous collaboration among us.

Fatty acids
Fish normaly provides a great amount of essential fatty acids. We wanted to clone ∆9, ∆12 & ∆15 fatty acid desaturases into separate plasmids by the use of USER cloning. We wanted to use USER cloning to save some time and to ease the cloning process. Ahead of this  cloning, we needed the desaturases separately.
We tried running several USER PCRs on ∆9 desaturase iGEM part but all were unsuccessful.
We received the ∆12 desaturase (FAT-2) which originated from Caenorhabditis elegans. We ran a PCR which was successful. Thus we cloned it into a PSB1C3 plasmid and it can now be found in parts registry under BBa_K1475002 . Afterwards we tried running USER PCR on FAT-2 which was unsuccesful.
We tried to run a colony PCR on the bacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, with Phusion polymerase, in order for us to get the ∆15 desaturase. Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful.
After several failed attempts to run USER PCRs, we realized that we needed to prioritize and continue without cloning ∆9, ∆12 & ∆15 into the separate plasmids, with the use of USER cloning"

It is possible because the reactant may be a complex, such as complex of LacI tetramer and plasmid with promoter LacI (we call it pLacI:LacI4 below). Only the products of the replication reaction will be repressed with a certain rate. In this example, pLacI:LacI4 would not be repressed since it is not among the products of its replication. Via MoDeL language, we design a template reaction with no reactants, two modifiers and one product. The two modifiers are template species containing a certain plasmid backbone (say pSB1A3), and binding state is allowed for both. The product is also a template species containing pSB1A3, however, it has only one chain and no binding is permitted. Hence, modifiers have Chain-Node structure ANY--pSB1A3--ANY, while product has its structure ANYUB--pSB1A3--ANYUB. The listOfTransferTable makes parts transfer from part ANY of either modifier to its corresponding part ANYUB of the product. The reaction rate is <math>-k_{g}C_{mod1}C_{mod2}/C_{max}</math>, where <math>k_{g}</math> is the same as that defined in the replication reaction, <math>C_{max}</math> is the max concentration of plasmids containing pSB1A3 as backbone, and <math>C_{mod1}</math>, <math>C_{mod2}</math> are concentrations of modifier1 and modifier2, respectively. The negative sign in the rate law indicates a repressed effect to the replication of the product.

Overview
In the design of our Campylobacter biosensor we decided to employ a genetic logic circuit. This would require the presence of two transcriptional input signals from Campylobacter-associated molecules before an output signal in the form of GFP fluorescence could be produced. We aimed to build and characterise two genetic AND-gates; one based on a split-GFP fluorescence system; and the other based on a splitting the Enterobacteria phage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP). We wished to quantify the responsiveness of both AND-gates with well-characterised small-molecule regulated promoters from the iGEM registry, and then proceed to utilising our own Campylobacter sensing transcriptional systems to drive the AND-gate biosensor. Both split-GFP and split-T7 RNAP gates were constructed from BioBrick parts and tested, however DNA sequence errors appear to have prevented the proper function of either system.
Introduction
After brainstorming our Campylobacter biosensor project idea, we began investigating any molecules that are present within - or secreted by – Campylobacter. In an ideal scenario, we would detect a small molecule that is associated with gastroenteritis-causing Campylobacter only - not in any other non-pathogenic subspecies of the"
Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#CassieNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"rit finally told us to give up on the zSpace aspects of the project for now, and just focus on functionality. We got cards to spawn in a carousel shape and the carousel spins around to allow users to select different cards.
July 14th
Story of my life:
Mostly we worked on basic functionality for the zTree project. We get the most entertaining errors when trying to make things not collide. We've been developing with functionality in mind. Getting the zSpace to work with the program hasn't been going well, so we're working in 2D for a while. The mouse can click on cards, which spawns a new carousel. As a placeholder, I've been using numbers to represent the cards and whichever number is clicked on corresponds to the number of cards spawned on the next carousel. The carousels spin so you can look through your options. A struggle we've been facing is optimizing the camera viewpoint and the colors. We have all of the carousels lining up underneath each other in a centered and even way, which allows them to be easily read.
July 19th
This week flew by. Today is Yoav's last day so we've been trying to get him as much coding experience as possible this week. I've been making him drive a lot.
We split up the work between Dan and I in an attempt to get more done. He's working on the back end stuff, gathering all of the data from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts from the internet. Yoav and I have been working on getting the front end in order and making double carousels happen. In order to do this, I had to spend a whole day changing all of the data structures over to lists of lists. Ironically, we're avoiding tree data structures in Unity, as C# doesn't have any Tree classes without us writing our own. I think it's easier to think of things as lists of lists and it gives us the option in the future to make more than just two carousels spawn with very little additional work on my part. The day Yoav was absent was the day I did a lot of the switching over and I started getting double Carousels to work. Thursday and Friday we worked on many smaller projects that we thought could get done in a short amount of time, considering we had other things going on this week, such as meeting up with BU. Yoav got many useful features figured out. He adjusted the camera appropriately and made things change colors when they're clicked on.

A final test involved adding the various sugars to the M9 medium in the bottle as opposed to either adding it to the plate before pouring the agar on top or adding them into the well on the plate. 5x100ml M9 medium bottles were prepared as before and autoclaved. The sugars (1ml) and thiamine hydrochloride (3.4 ml) were added to the bottles prior to the agar getting poured, with two bottles having no sugar added to them. After the agar had set, the plates were inoculated as before. One of the no sugar plates had solid citrate added to its middle, as before with the solid glucose and sucrose, to test the growth of C. freundii on this medium that gives it its name.
For the liquid cultures, M9 minimal medium was used, supplemented with various sugars at a 1% final concentration and chloramphenicol20. The bottles were inoculated with cells containing pSB1C3 grown overnight, and incubated overnight at 37°C Close the method.
Results - Plates
The results of these experiments can be seen in Figures 1 and 2 below.
Figure 1 - M9 plates with sugars added to wells in the middle of the plates
Figure 2 - Sugars were added to the agar before the plates were poured
From these results, it can be seen that C. freundii SBS197 grows less well on lactose, sucrose and citrate but both strains grow equally well on glycerol and glucose. The E. coli + sucrose hydrolase cells grew well on sucrose even without there being any arsenic (the inducer of the sucrose hydrolase gene) on the plate. For some reason, all bacteria grew weakly on the lactose plates, this might mean that our lactose stock quality needs to be checked.
Liquid Media

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#Gender Study_-_-_TEXT.html," would drastically raise the awareness of young men and women about the gender problem in science. Having an up-to-date database is also a great way to see improvements in a quantitative manner. It would allow  a direct assessment of the effects of an active gender policy which would be a unique example in science. iGEM could become a leader in that fight and prepare the new generation of scientists to finally get rid of the gender inequality in science

Calgary_Software,2008,Team:Calgary Software#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," the future of synthetic biology. It is my hope that I can be a part of this emerging technology that will change the world.
My interests outside of school include sports, especially basketball and hockey, books, and video games. Sports is a big thing in my life. Whether it is playing the sport, or watching the sport, I am very competitive and enjoy the thrill of the game. The Calgary Flames are my team all the way!
Boris Shabash
4th year Bio-Informatics student at the University of Calgary and loving every second of it!
My participation in iGEM is motivated by the fact I see iGEM as the beginning of something much, much bigger. Synthetic biology is going to become the new motivating force for pharmaceutical research, medical practice, biochemical engineering and many more applications we can't even probably imagine.
With the advancements of synthetic biology, systems biology and the bio-informatics world will be a new field with a brand new perspective on the computational science and natural science nexus. As essential as computer aid is in engineering and the medical fields, it will also become a fundamental component in synthetic biology.
I plan to be one of the people at the centre of this computational revolution. The power that new programming paradigms (e.g Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Strategies) can offer to synthetic biology is something that I consider needs to be harnessed at this point, at this day and age, and I'm here to aid in that reframe.
Most of the time I spend outside of writing code and studying I dedicate to latin dancing, martial arts and friends. Exercising your brain is pretty important, but exercising your body is even more important. And social dancing and martial arts are both awesome.
Kent Thachek
I am a 3rd year bioinformatics student in the Faculty of Medicine, Bachelor of Health Sciences Honors program.  My primary interests span from computational algorithms to genome annotation, as well as biochemistry.  The application of computer science in biology is a truly astounding study to me.  It is my intention to gain a broad range of generic skills, applicable to many different aspects of biology.
My involvement with the University of Calgary iGEM Software Team began this year and I assisted with the analysis, design, and programming in the EvoGEM project.  I had background experience in programming and was just introduced to many of the modern heuristic strategies over the summer, namely Evolutionary Strategies and Agent-Based modeling.  This project was intuitive and interesting, so I was naturally enthused about aiding in its development.  I hope to continue in such endeavors.

PCR products run on 1% agarose gel.
There were some non specific bands, but the appropriate bands were present. However, the bands were kind of off.  I think this is due to the samples running weird on the gel.  B/c the first two lanes were the exact same sample, just aliquoted, and they ran fairly differently.

Flux-Variability Analysis for Optimization
Flux-variability analysis (FVA) was applied to optimize the bioreactor system of OSCAR for the newly incorporated metabolic pathways ( Decarboxylation , Decatecholization , Desulfurization , and Denitrogenation ). FVA combines the framework of metabolic pathways with experimental enzymatic data to provide a computational platform for predicting what changes in metabolite levels will result in increased end-product. We developed a model using MATLAB computer language for predicting what metabolites could be added to your growth media to increase production of hydrocarbons in the E. coli chassis. We also created a graphical user interface called the OSCAR Optimizer to make the the FVA program user-friendly and to allow current and future iGEM teams/scientists to input their own synthetic pathways into the FVA for analysis.  Finally, we validated this model in the wet-lab"

Hangzhou-H14Z,2015,Team:Hangzhou-H14Z#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,". 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but also they provide historians and archaeologists with solid historical evidence.
        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," was engineered that did not only show photoswitchable fluorescence but also oligomerization behaviour [Zhou 2012] . This mutation is lysine-145 to asparagine and it is located within the beta strand 7 of Dronpa, that is part of the oligomerization interface [Mizuno 2008] . Because a change of the fluorophore state within Dronpa also affects beta strand 7 [Mizuno 2010] , the oligomerization behaviour of 145N Dronpa can be controlled by illumination [Zhou 2012] .  This control over quaternary protein structure can be used to control the activity of engineered proteins. Fusion constructs of an enzymatic or effector protein that carry a Dronpa protein at both their N- and C-terminus were shown to be inhibited as long as the Dronpa copies were fluorescent and olgimerising, but regained their activity upon turning off the Dronpa fluorescence [Zhou 2012] .
Cre
The DNA recombinase Cre is a very useful tool for researchers who want to change the genomic makeup of living tools. We choose the Cre recombinase for its ability to cut a DNA region flanked by the loxp recognition sites, which allows us to use this permanent change in the DNA for our memory system. While this application of the Cre recombinase is rather novel, the proteins has been used for years in engineering of genomes especially for the generation of knock out mice [Nagy 2000] . In eukaryotic cells the activity of the Cre protein can be inhibited by preventing it from entering the nucleus up to a certain time point. This can be achieved by fusing the Cre protein to a tamoxifen inducible receptor domain like ERT2 [Graumann 2000] . These variants of the Cre recombinase are very useful for the generation of conditional knock out lines that offer many more options to researchers.
Our goal is to apply the caging mechanism with Dronpa as described earlier to the Cre recombinase (compare figure 1). We needed a light activatable protein for our project, because the system should be able to take the momentary state of the sensor and immediately write it into the DNA. This is only possible through light induced activation of the writing process.
Further on a light inducible Cre recombinase would be very useful for researchers working with the Cre recombinase system, e.g. in mouse knockout models. While inducible tissue specific knockouts are already possible

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 1).  They are composed of a heptad repeat of amino acids that form a coil structure that is able to interact with each other. These coils are able to interact with each other in an anti-parallel fashion, making them useful for applications such as peptide capture, protein purification and biosensors. For our project we decided to make use of the IAAL E3/K3 coils ( BBa_K1189010 , BBa_K1189011 ) due to the balance they offer between affinity and specificity (Table 1, Figure 2). These parts were already in the registry, however the DNA was never received, so we built, sequenced and re-submitted them.

Figure 2. The two constructs used for the E coil ( BBa_K1189012 ) and K coil ( BBa_K1189013 ).
How do These Coils Work?
These E3/K3 coils are able to form heterodimers due to the hydrophobic residues contained within the heptad repeat. In our case these heptad repeats are composed of isoleucine and leucine residues. These hydrophobic residues form the core of the binding domain of the coils, indicated in Figure 3 by the empty arrows. In order to prevent the homodimerization of these coils, charged residues are included in the design. For example, the electrostatic interactions between glutamic acid and lysine residues prevent an E coil from binding with an E coil. We selected the use of E3/K3 coiled-coils over other synthetic E/K coils, as the isoleucine residue present shows a significant increase in the heterodimerization over valine found in other coils. The alpha-helical propensity of the residues outside of the core interacting residues is also increased by utilizing an alanine residue instead of the serine residue found in ISAL and VSAL E/K coils. This selection maximizes the stability and specificity of the coils used in our system.

SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#project#indigo_-_-_TEXT.html,"ized to indigo. But indigo cannot be used in dying for that indigo cannot be embedded in the voids of fabric fibers. In industry, indoxyl products must be reduced by a reducing agent before dyeing, then it can be used. To prevent the step which will make a lot of pollution, we want to prevent indoxyl from oxidating into indigo.
To achieve the goal, we need to produce UDP-glucuronosyltransferaseii (UGT) in our E.coli which can protect indoxyl by changing it into indicant(Figure 11).
We insert the coding sequence of UGT into the pET21a plasmid by enzymes digest and ligation and it is induced by IPTG. Then we successfully detect a 43 kDa protein with his-tag by western blot after induced by IPTG and we believe that this is UGT (Figure 7).
The molecular weight of UGT is expected to be about 43 kDa. Our Western Blot result shows that we had successfully expressing the UGT in E.coli which means it has the potential to be used into the industry.
BGL
In order to take advantage of the protected Indican, we should deprotect. In this way, indoxyl can get access into fiber, after oxidation, can dye the clothes. Even the enzyme BGL can work to deprotect, we chose a better enzyme BGL-A as our deprotection enzyme according to Hsu, T. M et al., BGL-A is the enzyme function in the midstream of the environment-friendly indigo synthesis. Gene we used this year is the originally found in Bacillus circulans. It is a beta-glucosidase which would de-protected the indican and then release the final product, indigo. Similar enzymes can also be detected in E. coli strains which may cause the advanced hydrolysis of indican to a certain extent. After synthesis the gene by GENERAL BIOSYSTEMS, we first constructed the BGL-A in pET21-a and then transformed DH5 alpha with the plasmid (oligos and detailed plasmid sequence can be found in supplementary material). Then the E. coli BL21 was used as our expression system. However, after several attempts to optimizing the expression condition, we didn’t get a complete protein. Our instructor Hongbin Yu noticed that codons were not well-optimized for E. coli BL21, thus a relatively short product may be synthesized instead of the real product. New BGL-A sequence is still under experiments and please make the presentation"

Overall project
Synthetic biology is the creation of new functions using existing existing biological systems. In order to assist synthetic biologists, the 2009 Illinois tools team is trying to create a web-based open source program that outputs a theoretical pathway to synthesize a desired chemical product given an input and an output compound. This network will meet several constraints such as maximal reaction rates and mass balance. The ideal network will consist of known reactions taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)database, which consists of well-studied organisms. The capabilites of our program will be exemplified by establishing a network for the synthesis of biofuels from various input compounds.
Our program is modular and has 6 major components. The first aspect is obtaining reactions from the KEGG database via KEGG API and determining the shortest paths from the starting compound to the ending compound. The second is taking our theoretical outputs and running them through an a program like Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis(COBRA) to optimize the reactions. The result from this would then be graphed using Networkx or pyDot. After the optimal paths have been determined, the program will look for the necessary activators and promoters in the biobrick registry and give the location of those. The sixth aspect of our program is to log our results.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression of the desired protein begins.
The Lon protease
The Lon protease derives its name from the phenotype of E. coli lon gene mutants that form long undivided filaments upon UV irradiation (Simson et al. 1964) . It is a component of the protein quality-control systems and degrades misfolded and unfolded proteins in an ATP dependent manner (Chung & Goldberg 1981) and is also involved in the degradation of certain regulatory proteins like SulA, which is a component of the SOS system and an inhibitor of cell division (Mizusawa & Gottesman 1983) , Huisman, (D'Ari et al. 1984) ).
The OmpT protease
The other deleted protease OmpT is an aspartyl protease localizing at the outer membrane of E. coli. It is suggested that OmpT is involved in the pathogenicity of E. coli. More than 30 years ago is was shown that OmpT catalyzes the activation of plasminogen to plasmin (Bowles et al., 1981) . This function seems to be physiologically relevant for the virulence of clinical E. coli isolates (Lundrigan & Webb 1992) and other pathogens like Yersinia pestis (Subrahmanyam et al., 1992) . Additionally the level of OmpT expression was shown to increase in response to the induction of recombinant protein overexpression (DeLisa et al., 2000) . For T7 expression strains, the deletion of this protease is urgently required because it was also shown that OmpT is degrading T7 RNA Polymerase (Grodberg & Dunn 1988) . According to NEB (New England Biolabs Ipswich, Massachusetts) strains that are deficient in both proteases Lon and OmpT are more amenable for the production of proteins
Our vision is to create a strain similar to E. coli BL21 and maximize the protein yield to an optimum by not only integrating the T7 system into V. natriegens but also deleting proteases to decrease protein degradation during the purification process.             This way we will design an optimized strain for high-speed and high-level protein expression. Making VibriExpress accessible for everyone, we would like to accelerate your research and support you all, making the world a better place.

We miniprepped the things that we glycerol stocked. We also PCR screened the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase construct that was sequenced for the aerobic mutation and we added the deletion fixes. We will run the gel of it tomorrow. We also looked at all of our plates from the mutagenesis and marked which had growth, lawns, or no growth. Mutant sequences showed no mutations. Performed another transformation on fourth SDM PCRs using varying concentrations, spins some down, using various competent cells and using different resistance plates.
Wednesday September 12th
More sequences were received of the multi-set SDM reactions for J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase , and B0034 + Reductase + B0015. These yielded only one set of mutation changes and therefore another SDM was set up for these samples to introduce one additional change. Our goal changed to mainly fix the reductase deletion and the dehydrogenase mutation. The additional change for the aerobic reductase mutation was set as a secondary priority after building the construct. The  SDM reactions were then digested and transformed, and will be prepared for further sequencing tomorrow. Another genomic library of the Strain E-15 EG3 was prepared in hopes to send off for genomic sequencing. The process was halted after the purification step and will be continued with the gel purification tomorrow. Growth seen on some plates. Screen run on successful transformation results. Tranformations on T96A and Y127A done.

Pathogenic Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli serotype O157:H7 is a major source of foodborne illness worldwide. In Alberta, we experienced a pathogenic E. coli outbreak in late 2012, this outbreak was the result contaminated beef and led to the largest meat recall in Canadian history (Cross, 2012). Outbreaks like these cause death, hospitalizations, massive economic losses and an overall loss of consumer confidence in food safety. Ruminating animals such as cattle and sheep can harbor pathogenic E. coli asymptomatically and are a major source of contamination in many cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). However consumption of pathogenic E. coli by humans can induce abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea requiring hospitalization, and in severe cases cause death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Pathogenic E. coli is a major issue in the developing world where the consequences are exacerbated by the poor sanitation and rudimentary health network, the greatest risks are associated with children, the elderly and HIV positive patients (Okeke, 2009). Quick detection of the pathogen is critical to reduce waste, stop the spread of illness, and ultimately save lives. Current testing methods take a long time to complete due to the time it takes to culture E. coli and require lab equipment to amplify the target gene sequences.
One of the factors that amplifies the risk of E. coli outbreaks is the lack of a rapid, on-site detection method. In response, our team is using synthetic biology to develop a system to rapidly detect the presence of EHEC in the beef"

Edinburgh,2008,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook#Project summary#01 July 2008_-_-_TEXT.html," cellulase secretion page updated.
Paris '07designed what they call ""synthetic multicellular bacteria"" (SMB). This involved reproductively capable ""germline"" cells which were dependent on diaminopimelate (DAP), a metabolite produced by reproductively incapable ""somatic"" cells. Low concentrations of DAP triggered the transcription of Cre-recombinase (under the influence of DAP-sensitivepromoter), which caused the removal of a gene required for bacterial reproduction by site-specific recombination (SSR), and resulted in the activation of a gene for the production of DAP by them.
We could adapt this system to cause some cells to produce cellulases and then lyse to release them into the medium. However, a simpler method could by-pass the need for SSR and could be as follows:
Our cellulase genes could be under the influence of a promoter sensitive to glucose concentration (activated by low [glucose], inhibited by high [glucose]). Low glucose would, therefore, cause the production of cellulases in some cells.  We could engineer a reporter gene just downstream of a cellulase gene (under the influence of the same promoter), which could act as a transcriptional activator for lysis genes.  So low glucose concentration would cause some cells to produce cellulases and the lysis gene transcription factor. Thus the cells would lyse, releasing the cellulases into the cellulose growth medium. The cellulases would work ex vivo to break down cellulose into glucose, which could then be taken up by other cells and converted into starch until the glucose is depleted to insufficient levels.  This seems to be one of those ideas that, if it works, would be very ""elegant"", an abstract term that biologists seem to love! It might also provide some more interesting modelling opportunities than the very linear metabolic pathways, and we shouldn't need so much data to model this idea. (I still think that secretion of cellulases would be better though - it would be more straightforward, if possible.)
Next step along this train of thought: Find a promoter that is repressed by glucose!
Glucose-sensitive cellulase synthesis
E. coli has loads of glucose-senstive genes, most of which are positively regulated by cAMP:
The action of adenylate cyclase is repressed by glucose. Low [glucose] results in an increase in the activity of adenylate cyclase, which converts AMP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP associates with the cAMP receptor protein (CRP, also known as the cAMP activator protein, CAP)."

INSA-Lyon,2010,Team:INSA-Lyon#Safety#Ethics#Medias_-_-_TEXT.html," closed to people's concerns, this subject doesn’t seem to interest them. According to an investigation realized in the US, more than 70% of the interrogated people had never heard about Synbio. Ignorance is one of the main problems of Synbio because it scares people and make them cautious about the subject. Their principal concern is the ratio benefits/risks . Moreover, media does not always emphasize the entire truth and they focus on incidental anecdotes. This can be prejudicial for Synbio and genetic modifications. People have been informed of some scientific failures and then they seem already well aware of the limits and the safety of Synbio even if currently nobody can tell if Synbio is safe and have limits…
In our opinion, people are badly informed and that makes them reluctant to scientific progress.
Reading people interviews, Synbio appears like the new craziness of the scientists, who want to play God and don’t care about ethics and people. Man always wants to control life, which is a great power. And we know how much Man loves power… Not only scientists by the way, the consequences of Synbio is everybody's concern, from politicians to citizens.
That’s why ethical framework is important to surround scientific researchs and to build the dialog in between society and scientific community in order to consolidate trust in science, and especially biology. All the polemics about Genetically Modified Organisms should be avoided. It’s time to have a new start, and make Synbio a way to develop an integrative science, with the help of the political community.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and in Turkey, 37% of passenger cars use it. On a large scale though, only 1.2% of vehicles worldwide are suitable to run on propane. This may seem discouraging, but in reality converting a gasoline motor into a propane one is quite simple and inexpensive. DIY converter kits are sold online for less than $500. In Canada, depending on the vehicle type, conversion done by a third party costs somewhere around 2500-6500 dollars .
On top of its use as a transportation fuel, propane is also a popular cooking fuel in developing countries. It’s more commonly used in urban areas, as access to propane can be difficult in rural areas. Nevertheless, according to the International Energy Association (IEA), about 20% of household in the rural areas of Botswana use propane as their source of energy. In the urban areas the usage is around 60%. Expensive infrastructure is in place for example in Brazil, where 98% of households have access to propane due to government funded efforts. One major goal of promoting propane is to replace currently used biomass fuels, including wood. Wood consumption is often unsustainable and threatens the local ecosystems. Additionally, the traditional fuels (biomass and coal) produce high emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter. IEA suggests that these impurities are responsible for more premature deaths than malaria in developing countries.
Propane can be considered a clean fuel , as it emits less CO\(_2\) than gasoline or ethanol and, when compared with traditional biomasses, has significantly smaller emission factors based on both mass and energy delivery. Thus, propane is a viable option for replacing traditional biomasses as cooking fuel, although currently the price is not competitive without government subsidies.
Figure 1. Comparison of various fuels by delivered-energy-based CO and particle matter emissions (EF, g/MJ). The y axis is shown in the log scale.
However, the propane we are currently using is produced as a side product of the petrochemical industry. This essentially means that propane is a fossil fuel, emitting stored CO\(_2\) into the atmosphere without a way of returning to the natural carbon cycle. This contributes not only to climate change but also ocean acidification. This endangers the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people directly or indirectly dependent on the marine ecosystems.
We want to make the use of propane as a fuel sustainable. We want to design an Eschericia coli capable of producing propane from cellulose.

Binding: Zhang Zijian&Meng Liuyi
An important improvement was constructing by these two members. They tested binding efficiency between E.coli and cyanobacteria. Equipped with fluorescence microscope, they calculated binding efficiency of protein-algae and E.coli-algae interaction.
Killing: Yao Lanqiu&Lu Xiaoyu
Killing cyanobacteria is the core of our project, so YAO and LU spent a lot of time searching for a weapon. Finally, lysozyme was chosen from tens of candidates. They measured cyanobacteria growth curves under different conditions. Killing effects on different species of cyanobacteria were tested by them, which showed the wide applicability of our project.
Degradation: Jin Yuji&Zhang Fengyu
Algae toxins are serious threats from algal bloom. Degradation group found a enzyme MlrA that can degrade it. A sophisticated experiment assay was established to test degradation efficiency.  Several signals were tried for the sake of secreting MlrA outside cells.
Suicide: Wu Jie
Considering biosafety, a suicide system was introduced into our E.coli. Wu Jie made effort transferring induction suicide system into E.coli. He tested growth curves of E.coli under variant inducing conditions.

Feedbackloop via EPO
The natural release of EPO from the kidneys depends on the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. If the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood decreases due to a lack of red blood cells, more EPO is released. This leads to an increase in red blood cell production, leading to a higher population of circulating red blood cells and a higher partial pressure of oxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen and the number of circulating red blood cell are therefore assumed to be proportional.
The amount \(E^{end}_{in}(t)\)  of EPO released by the kidney can be estimated by the use of the total population of red blood cells \(RBCs(t)\), which consist of all circulating red blood cells. The equation that governs the natural release of EPO uses a scaled red blood cell count with TBVbeing the total blood volume, and is shown below:
$$ EPO^{end}_{in}(t) = \bigg(\frac{(a_3 - b_3)}{1+e^{k_3 \times \tilde{M}(t) - c_3}}+b_3\bigg)\ \times \frac{1}{TBV} \tag{37} $$
$$ \tilde{M}(t) = 10^{-8} \times \frac{RBCs(t)}{TBV} \tag{38} $$
Figure 19. The effect of red blood cell population on the release of EPO from the kidneys. The units of EPO released from kidneys is mU per ml per day.
The behavior of the endogenous EPO concentration Eend(t) in plasma is modeled by the following ordinary differential equation:
$$\frac{dEPO_{end}(t)}{dt} = EPO^{end}_{in}(t) - k_{deg\,protein\,extracellular}EPO_{end}(t) \tag{39}$$

PSB1C3T7-HNS/HNS-T108I / PotB59/PomA CLONING
As we didn’t very satisfying results from our functional assays, we checked everything about our experiments. Then we noticed that even one amino acid change in a protein can cause a difference in protein activity. We noticed that His-tag was added into the proteins when we cloned the genes into pET45-b. Hence we cloned these genes into our own design PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, in order to produce required proteins without any addition. For this cloning, we removed the gene sequences from PSB1C3-HNS, PSB1C3-HNS-T108I, PSB1C3-PotB59/PomA plasmids with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with BamHI and SalI enzymes.(XhoI and SalI enzymes occurs a scar when their cuts ligate)We transformed ligated products into BL21 bacteria strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with Verify Forward and verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be at 503 bp line, but if colony PCR worked, then bands are expected to be at 906 bp line for HNS and HNS-T108I, 2204 bp line for PotB59/PomA.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method"

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html," considered a success since the colony PCR appeared successful and the sequencing results confirmed a correct assembly. pSB1K3-T7-EC  however, was not correctly assembled, as indicated by the sequencing results and the work with it was not continued.
Generally, a very low number of colonies was observed when transforming ligation products whereas the positive control worked fine. This likely indicates that the ligation product itself is not of a very high quality or quantity. For any following experiments, both digestion and ligation should be analysed carefully to make sure that high-quality ligation product can be transformed. Additionally, to optimize the ligation a couple of different insert:vector ratios could have been tested.
Demonstrating expression of EB in E. coli
In order to express recombinant Esp, BL21(DE3) cells containing the construct pSB1K3-T7-EB were induced with IPTG, triggering the protein production. The cells were lysed by sonication, the samples were spun down and the pellet was resuspended in PBS. Thereafter SDS-PAGE was run to confirm the expression of the protein of interest. Supernatant and the resuspended pellet were run separately on the SDS-PAGE since the solubility of Esp is unknown to us and an insoluble protein might require re-folding in order to be functional. In following results the samples from the supernatant is referred as “soluble fraction” and the samples from the pellet as “insoluble fraction”.

While we keep fighting against our naughty bacteria and the ""standard"" parts, we're also testing the biobrick T9002, developed by the Cambridge Lab in 2005. Ana is helping us to plan the experiments.
Wednesday Protocols
IMPROVED PROTOCOLS
Ligation
We are going to assemble small DNA fragments (inserts) with  plasmids, so we will use bigger amount of inserts than os plasmid. Our ligation mix contains:
- 1 μL of 10X ligase buffer. It´s important to keep it on ice and also to resuspend it very well before using it. (Ligase buffer must contains ATP).
- 1 μL of ligase(It must be the last thing you add to the mix). You must not sink the tip too deep in order not to carry much glycerol. KEEP IT IN THE FREEZER, even when you use it.
- 1 or 2 μL of plasmid.
- 7 or 6 μL of insert.
Keep at room temperature overnight.
Double Digestion
20 μL must be the final volumen of our digestion mix. We must add:
- 2 μL of buffer
- 0,5 μL of each enzyme (We use EcorI, SpeI, XbaI and PstI). This amount of enzyme must be individually determine depending on the amunt of DNA you are going to digest
- 16 μL of Milli-Q water
- 1 μL of DNA sample
It´s important that you shake the mixture using the centrifuge. 1 minute at medium speed must works.
Transformtion
1. In the same tube, mix:
- 25 μL of competent cells.
- 1 μL of DNA sample (the amount of DNA depends on the concentration of your sample)if yor DNA is pure. If not, use aproximately"

2.NKU_China
This year, NKU_China constructed a plasmid containing fimS. In E. coli, the expression of the fimbriae component, FimA, is controlled in a binary fashion through the inversion of a 314 bp DNA segment (fimS) that contains the fimA promoter. The inversion of fimS is performed by the DNA recombinase FimE, which binds to two inverted repeat sequences (Inverted Repeat Left and Right, IRL and IRR, respectively) that flank the fimS element. FimE has different binding affinities for IRL and IRR depending on the orientation of fimS, as a result, FimE is able to efficiently cause recombination only when the promoter faces IRR. Therefore, switch inversion is permanent and heritable.
Based on E. coli fimbriae control system (E. coli fimbriae (Fim) phase variation system), NKU_China has finished the switch design, to whose ends both GFP and RFP have been linked. This modified switch has been transformed into BL21 and we helped them to prove it is feasible.
We added 150μl bacteria into two conical flasks containing 150ml LB medium(30μg/L kan+).And we incubated cultures in a shaker until the value of OD600 reached 0.3. Then we added 150μl IPTG (100mM) into one of the conical flasks for induction. After incubating overnight, the value of OD600, red fluorescence and green fluorescence of the two strains of bacteria were measured by a microplate reader.
The results are as follows:

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," easy selection. The plasmid backbone, the promoter, and the constitutively expressed RFP PCR products has been ready for several weeks, but we lacked the primers for the constituvely expressed lacI gene until now. To generate the DNA for the constitutively expressed lacI gene, we took BBa_K081005 (const. promoter+rbs) cut with only SpeI and  BBa_I732100 (lacI) cut with only XbaI, and ligated the two together, and then did a PCR on the ligation. It worked beautifully.
The primers also arrived to isolate the VMA Sce-I intein, and Alina provided yeast genomic DNA. The PCR was done successfully. However, upon further reflection, it appears that we forgot to DpnI digest the original template for the plasmid backbone on which we were going to add this part, and we actually did not have any product for it. Another PCR needs to be done, and DpnI digests will be done before running it on a gel.
A previous potential part, ArgE, was restriction confirmed, and will be sent for sequencing at the soonest convenience.
The PCR for yddg was finally a success. The part has been restriction digested, along with the pSB1C3 plasmid, and a ligation will follow.
We finally received the DszA forward primer, and did a restriction digest on it as well. It will be ligated as well in the near future. It has several Pst1 sites, which limits some of the reactions we can do with it, but we can still place things before it by cutting with EcoRI and/or XbaI.
In an effort to see how much amino acid each type of cell in the co-culture will produce, we have been harvesting supernatants of our normal cultures as per the protocol in Kerner et al. Once we have supernatants of the cultures at various ODs, we are going to grow the auxotrophs in this supernatant, and then look at the growth rate and final OD. The list of which supernatants we have can be found in the lab.
Joe has found inconsistent results with his fluorescent proteins on the various promoters, and we have plans to standardize the promoter and rbs for the fluorescent proteins that will be used. Additionally, there is some overlap between YFP and GFP that is proving difficult to account for, so we are going to try to switch one to either BFP or CFP.
We also wanted to grow three of the consortia"

Figure 1: Microplate reader measurement of fluorescence over time. Measurements were taken every 90s during approximately 6h (with a quick shake between each measurement). The samples were hold at 29°C.The positive sample is a cell-free                       expression of sfGFP template. In the negative control sample, the plasmid stock solution volume was replaced with nuclease free water.
This is the maximum fluorescence intensity we have gotten, that is, around 200 000 RFU (Relative Fluorescence Units).

HexaHistidine Encapsulin cell-free expression and purification
In this section, we show some results of our trials to express HexaHistidine Encapsulin in our cell-free systems, as well as heat purify it.
The cell-free expression were done following a standard protocol: 8 to 12h of expression at 29°C with shaking (600rpm).
Figure 5: Standard heat purification method for heat stable proteins. Full protocol can be found here (LINK). After the centrifugation step, the heat stable proteins can be found in the supernatant of the solution. The others, which                       have been denatured, aggregate and are found in the pellet.
Right after the end of the expression, we performed standard heat purification. Our protein of interest, HexaHistidine Encapsulin is extremely heat stable and should be found in the supernatant of the sample after heat purification.
We observed the cell-free expression products before and after heat purification thanks to SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining. The full protocol can be found here.
Figure 6: SDS-PAGE gel after coomassie staining. B: before heat purification S: supernatant of the sample after heat purification
Before heat purification, in the sample expressed with HexaHistidine Encapsulin DNA template, we can distinguish a band at around 31 kDa among many other proteins. This band being absent in the negative control lane, might be Encapsulin                       monomers. We also see a band at higher molecular weight, also not present in the"

Yeast We Can!
Abstract As our iGEM project, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is planned to be modifed in such a way that the yeast cell should function as a biosensor for the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). This hormone is produced in the body during pregnancy and consequently, the idea for the biosensor is to function as a simple pregnancy test. We also plan to introduce genes for bio-indigo production which will be the output signal of the pregnancy test. Below you can see in an illustration how our bio-pregnancy test should function. You can find more details about our project here .
News 26th of Sep: We have been very busy with the summary, analysis and the discussion of our results. Finally, you can find our achievements in the result section .

Recorded a demo of MoClo planner, doing a walkthrough to show the interactions. Talked with Kathy and Nicole about changes to search/backend - how to get more information, what more info to get (esp. on CDS), and how to optimize it? Turns out search is churning down on all the source code five times over, one for each class. Worked with Madeleine and Veronica on integrating the primer designer; now you can spawn in draggable fusion sites and we've worked out an idea for the data structure of parts and their respective fusion sites. And most importantly TONIGHT THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.

Presentation for CS/Math talks as part of our summer research program. Lots of technical difficulties (ironic given our lab is 75% CS and CS-related majors). It went alright, I think? Sometimes the audience was quiet, but we got some insightful questions. Back in the lab, I worked on Primer Designer more. Implemented dropping of fusion sites and automatic doubling (a fusion site for each end of two adjoining parts) and storing data for use in the next page.
User Studies 1 (July 22 - July 28)
23 - 26 Jul 2012
Lately I've been working with Veronica to fix the Primer Designer: we managed to get the primer tests integrated and their results displayed in the Primer Designer, but it took forever to figure out what was going wrong! With some judicious application of command line testing and breakpoints (at least 50% of the time spent on test backend integration must've been spent hitting F5 and F11 over and over), plus some of Nicole's genius, we managed to get the code working properly and returning useful values. It was very staisfying! I don't think things have been this difficult to overcome since struggling to create a sortable ListBox for the Level 2 modules, but we definitely got it done a lot faster this time.
After that, we spent some time on the UI. Fusion sites were only cloning once and became un-draggable afterwards, and they showed up scattered all over the place in the library instead of in neat rows"

Several enzymes are tightly regulated by the cellular balance between the oxidized and reduced form of NAD+ and therefore regarded as a potential target for therapeutics ( Sauve, 2008 ). Indeed, NAD+ acts as a substrate for a wide range of proteins including NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases and several transcription factors ( Houtcooper et al., 2010 ). A disorder of the cellular NAD+ level has usually relevance in symptoms and diseases like stroke, cardiac ischemia, epilepsy, huntington disease, wallerian degeneration, cancer, type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM), neutrophil survival, longevity, obesity as well as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease ( Sauve, 2008 ; Houtcooper et al., 2010 ). The regulation of NAD+-dependent pathways may have a major contribution to oxidative metabolism and life span extension ( Houtcooper et al., 2010 ). The biosynthetic pathways for NAD+ are proposed as promising novel antibiotics targets against pathogens ( Bi et al., 2011 ).
Figure 2: NAD(P) physiological function (taken from Bi et al., 2011 ).
Biosynthesis of NAD+
NAD+ is embedded in the cellular metabolism and has a great impact on essential cellular processes. The biosynthesis in most bacteria and plants starts with the anaerobic conversion of the amino acid aspartate to quinoline. Alternatively, in yeast, humans and some bacterial microbes the quinoline derives from tryptophan in an aerobic manner (fig 3). This is a crucial step that leads under consumption of nicotinic acid to the nicotinate ring system via formation of nicotinic acid monoculeotide (NAMN), respectively ( Sauve, 2008 ). After conjugation of adenosine mononucleotide (AMP) the NAD synthetase forms nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Additionally, it has been recently reported that in humans exists an nicotinic acid-independent reaction catalysed by the enzyme nampt/PBEF, which uses directly nicotinamide as a substrate ( Rongvaux, 2002 ). Diet or pharmalogical agents can thereby serve as a source for nicotinamide or nicotinic acid ( Sauve, 2008 ). Fundamental processes as the cellular energy metabolism"

We talked about the software MGEC finished by the team Edinburgh _2008, which was designed for biologists to establish genetic engineering circuit model more easily based on modeling and data analysis. Another piece of software we discussed is BioBrick Manager_2010 which is mainly designed to connect Biobrick parts, and then to save as XML file. We also analyzed their disadvantages that need to be improved.
Room 341 Yifu Building   Friday  May 24, 2013
In this meeting, we discussed some pieces of software of the iGEM competitions before. For examples, Synthetic Biology Simulation Software: measuring the efficiency of the terminator; Digital Synthetic Gene Circuit Software (which can not perform large-scale optimization), then we thought about what we can do about it. USTC 2012 Software: Anti-circuit design was also introduced.. This time, we discussed a relatively new paper on anti-SD sequence, and the question that whether we can create a piece of software on codon optimization. So after the meeting, we should research this literature intensively to understand how to use the anti-SD sequence to achieve codon optimization and whether someone has already done similar software. Then we should study the corresponding data on RBS site, and grasp the information from compared sequences. More details will be finalized in next meeting.

Aix-Marseille,2018,Team:Aix-Marseille#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the fungus and the deaths of infected bed bugs. When a bed bug is in front of a trap, the program colors the bed bug in orange and set off a timer. It represents the life time left to the bed bug from its infection and this is unique for each bed bug. When that timer is finished, the bed bug dies and colors the patch below in yellow. That patch, the corpse of the bed bug, can also infect other bed bug and contribute to the propagation of the infection.
Another particular situation is when an infected bed bug dies next to the nest. In that case, the fungus will spread to bed bugs inside the nest, adults and younger individuals (like eggs). In order to model this, we give the nest a value, representing the number of time the nest can withstand the death of an infected bed bug next to it. Each time a bed bug dies this way, this counter is decreased by one, and when it gets to 0, the nest is destroyed, representing the infection of every individuals inside the nest.
Simulation routine
The Netlogo environment can be downloaded on it website, at the Nothwestern University [3] . The source file of our program is available here: File:T--Aix-Marseille--Bedbugs F V english version.zip
Initialization
When the program is set up, 4 types of agents are created:
bedbugs: each of them will have 2 major features. The lifetime available after the infection, the amount of time the bed bug will be immobilized in front of the nest. They are all created inside the nest.
traps: they will diffuse pheromones and start the infection of bed bug.
furniture: impenetrable obstacles for any other agents
nest: location where the bed bugs go back after exploration
During this step, the program also computes the effective diffusion coefficient, and prepares the environment for diffusion.
Running Cycle
During a run, the program computes the quantity of pheromones in every patch and colors it accordingly.  The more pheromones are in the patch, the redder the patch is.  Thanks to this computation, the bed bugs can guide themselves towards  the higher quantity of pheromone.
After this calculation step, the program manages the specific interaction between bed bugs and the nest. Following this step, the bed bugs move through the environment.  Finally, the infection and deaths mechanisms are setted up.
Results and perspectives
Our observations of the simulations have shown that the delay between infection and death of bed bugs is critical for ensuring the eradication of the nest. Our modeling thus"

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Project#echo_-_-_TEXT.html,"1.3 How does the system work?
In ecology, the predator-prey system often serves as a wonderful example to describe population dynamics. In the system, a predator feeds on its prey, resulting in the decline of the prey population, while the lack of prey will lead to the death of predators those who depend on preys to survive, consequentially an opportunity for preys to reproduce. This system indicates the co-existence of nature, and to give a more detailed description of the up and down of the populations, we call it oscillation. Another oscillating device is known in digital electronic circuits, named Ring Oscillator, which is composed of an odd number of NOT gates attaching in a chain, with the last gate is fed back into the first.
Figure: a predator-prey system
Figure: ring oscillator
Though in different field, these two oscillations do have some commonality, that is, the feedback (or ‘echo’).
When the idea is applied in the synthetic biology, we use two populations of E.coli to construct the system, in which CELL-B represses A and A induces B, just as predators feed on preys and preys feed predators. Of course this system have a feedback network. Then, theoretically, the system will oscillate, and light in red (RFP in CELL-A) and green (GFP in B).
Then, how’s the interrelationship between RED and GREEN, is RED negated to GREEN, or just the very same? It seems contradictory when we take the first glance of the interaction, that is, A increases the population of B while B decreases A. But after taking the delay of biological reaction into consideration, it’s easy to get the answer, which has already been stated in the title: homochronous.
1.4 What does ‘homochronous’ refer?
The prefix ‘homo’ represents ‘same’, while ‘chrono’ means ‘time-related’. As a jargon of Information, the word ‘homochronous’ describes the relationship between two signals that their corresponding significant instants are displaced by a constant interval of time.
Here we use this term to depict the relationship between CELL-A & B. That is to say, in the process of oscillating, the AHL expression rate of CELL-A and that of B (also RED and GREEN fluorescent signals) share the same period, or fluctuate in a same pace. In addition, the interval of two signals remains constant, so the RED signal comes out while GREEN fades away at the same time, and vice versa. Consequently, time goes, RED and GREEN flare"

Our last month in the lab!
September has been a rather exciting month for the team. The initial goals of our research phase                                                     went according to schedule. We had successfully produced                                                     our bacterial strains in the previous months, which meant that this month we could focus more on completing the loose ends of the project and we started the analytical phase. Unfortunately, we also                                                     had                                                     to move out of our ‘own’ lab this month. Now we share                                                     a new lab space with multiple PhD researchers, who are kind enough to share their space with us.
In the lab, we mostly focussed on creating evidence and demonstrations of our product for the Jamboree at the end of October.                                                     Furthermore, our strains that contain handcrafted plasmids                                                     (small pieces of DNA that are separated from chromosomal DNA) were isolated this month and sequenced. DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of the bases of our                                                     plasmids.                                                     This process is done by a company in Amsterdam.
The results are send to us by email during the night and we can verify our plasmids the next morning. It is mandatory to sequence                                                     our DNA before submitting it to iGEM. We have produced                                                     many different strains of bacteria that all need to be tested before the submission deadline. Charlotte and Marjolein were mostly responsible for these verifications.  
Tim and Carli were in charge of testing the bacterial strains with different types of stress, to                                                     check the responsiveness and effectiveness. We have found at least 6 strains that showed interesting results. Lastly, Jazzy made beautiful agar plates which demonstrated the potency of our project (see picture below). The dark line around the clear                                                     circles are                                                     bacteria that produce a “blue/grey” chromoprotein in                                                     response to DNA damage, proving that our project works!

Interlab study - Aim & Results
The goal of the interlab study is to obtain GFP fluorescence data from the iGEM teams all around the world for about twenty constructions. This will permit to observe the result repeatability across technics, strains and teams.
There were two sub-parts in this study:
The mandatory one: obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP and compare them.
The Extra Credit assignments: we choose to study the entire Anderson library of constitutive prokaryotic promoters (J23100 to J23119) .
This library corresponds to 19 constitutive promoters containing some nucleotide mutations on the -35 and the -10, as shown Used Biobricks and plasmids .  The idea is to compare the expression strength of promoters according to mutations, from the maximum amount of fluorescence data in order to have significant results.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," We worked on developing activities that would appeal to the interests of a young audience, as well as making the activities as interactive as possible. We believed that it was important to ensure that the lessons involved low-resource activities that could be shared and used by teachers in schools, since this would enable the education of a wider cohort of school students. We also wanted to demonstrate that synthetic biology is an accessible field that all school students should feel able to pursue, and did not want to create artificial barriers by suggesting that synthetic biology could only be understood and accessed with specialist knowledge and equipment.
The structure of our lesson plan involved a brief introduction where we explained the principles of synthetic biology, followed by a carousel of activities where small groups moved around the room to participate in different stations. Each station had a task with a specific learning objective to ensure that the teaching and discussions were structured and focused. We believed it was important to demonstrate the range of tasks involved in synthetic biology and iGEM, including workshops explaining the structure of proteins, the use of Snapgene, modelling and the assessment of ethical issues associated with synthetic biology.
Station 1: Proteins and Pymol (20 minutes)
Station 2: Snapgene (20 minutes)
Station 3: Modelling (20 minutes)
Station 4: Ethics (20 minutes)
In line with Kuddell’s advice that all teaching about synthetic biology “should include sociological aspects”, we devoted an entire station to the discussion of the ethics of synthetic biology. We created a workshop containing examples of scenarios where genetic engineering has been used, and created a series of questions to prompt discussion and debate among the students. This workshop effectively addressed Kuddell’s four aims of synthetic biology teaching, since the relaxed, informal platform for debate enabled students to articulate their views on controversial scenarios and  focus on a variety of issues, such as safety and possible risks imposed by the use of genetic engineering in each scenario.
The outline of our workshops on Proteins and Ethics can be viewed below.

Feedback
Student satisfaction is an important factor determining the engagement, student understanding and success of teaching. We spoke to students and course directors after our teaching sessions to gain feedback, and acted upon this to improve our future lessons to different summer school programmes.
Feedback from initial lessons:
Some students felt that the content was difficult to understand if they didn't have an educational background in biology.
The first lesson overran quite significantly, and there wasn’t enough time for the students to complete the last station’s activity.
Some groups of students were very engaged in the Ethics station, but some groups remained reticent and"

Reflection
Targeted ablation of adipose tissue blazes a new path for obesity therapy, but the road is sown with thorns. We need to conduct vigorous monitoring at metabolic level after the mice are injected with our drug, and drug efficiency should be evaluated in the long run. If this drug is to be put into application in the future, safety assessments should be strictly executed. Our aim is not only to remove the fat issues, but also assure other tissues remain intact.

In May 2017, we participated in an academic debate competition held in China Pharmaceutical University, which was about the better use of biotherapeutics. And later in August, some members of our team attended the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC-2017) held in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. During this meeting, we shared the ideas and experience of our project with other iGEM teams all over China together, learning useful suggestions from each other.

Two months ago, a patient who had suffered from obesity type II diabetes for many years accepted our interview in Nanjing Military General Hospital, helping us to further understand the real situations obesity patients were confronted with.
When talking about the best method of losing weight, the patient gave most credit to the treatment of useful medicine, compared to other ways like diet or exercise. Our interviewee believed it was subcutaneous drugs that helped him reduce about 20 kilograms while battling against Type Ⅱ diabetes in the past few years. And as for the suitable methods of medicine intake, he thought it doesn't matter whether the drugs are oral or injected, valuing medicine efficacy more than other aspects.

SCUT-China_A
In March 2017, SCUT-China_A team sent members to have a meet-up with our team. During this meet-up, they gave us experience of establishing a new team, and they clearly demonstrated the medal judgements of iGEM. Besides, they illustrated what is modeling, and how to do basic mathematical modeling. Furthermore we shared our projects, and set up the collaboration relationship.
In April 2017, both our team and SCUT-China_A team were invited to attend the bio-festival in Sun-Yet-San University. We shared the concept of synthetic biology and iGEM competition to the students in Sun-Yet-San University, together with SYSU and SYSU-Software team.
In summer 2017, both team gave help to each other. During InterLab study, SCUT-China_A team failed in transforming devices into E. coli. We offered help, and they managed to finish the InterLab study.
Nevertheless, SCUT-China_A team offered theoretical help during our biobrick assembling, and We have helped them to construct a model of β-galactosidase release and catalyze oPNG degradation. The degradation rate of extracellular oPNG can be deduced from the concentration of intracellular β-galactosidase.

Chassis selection for in vivo DC target
For personalized therapies based on our prediction of target antigen, we need a customizable chassis to present this antigen to the immune system. We went through a selection process for the chassis presenting the best features to deliver the patient tumor antigen to the immune dendritic cells (DCs). We chose to target DCs because they are considered the best candidate for T-cells activation against cancer (8). The chassis must be immunogenic to serve as an adjuvant for the antigen, because immature DCs presenting a tumor antigen without danger signal will induce T cell tolerance. Micro-organisms are natural adjuvants bearing the danger signal as well as the antigen targeted. In addition, they can be standardized and target DCs in vivo, thereby reducing production costs. However, skeptic shock or cytokine storm must be absolutely prevented.
Bacteria are well-adapted vector for in vivo therapy with Dendritic Cells (DCs). First, they naturally increase tumor immunogenicity because their toll-like receptors induce an inflammatory cytokine response that attract DCs. Second, they are able to deliver tumor antigens to DCs through variant mechanisms. However, they raise safety concerns for virulent reversion in patient. P. aeruginosa, a human pathogen, has been designed to inject directly the tumor antigen with its type III secretion system (T3SS) in DCs cytosol (9). In a curative assay on mice with melanoma, injection of the vaccine vector after tumor implantation led to a complete cure in five of six animals (10). This virulent bacterium is attenuated with the killed but metabolically active (KBMA) method. While this system has shown to attenuate toxicity both in vitro and in murine model, it also reduces antigen presentation by 70 % in comparison with the live vector, raising both safety and efficiency problem  (11).
Listeria monocytogenes is a natural choice because this intracellular pathogen has the ability to enter DCs and to activate MHC I Pathway. Once inside the phagosome, it releases a"
BGIC-Union,2017,Team:BGIC-Union#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", when a pair of sgRNA are designed properly close in target sequence, the two complexes would approach to each other so that two split luciferase attached to them would reassemble and generate bioluminescence signal. NUDT of IGEM 2016 had a similar design. [2] Although intended to detect microRNA, their split-HRP-dCas9 design can also be utilized to detect ctDNA. The reunion of split HRP will convert the presence of target DNA into visual output signal by adding substrates such as 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
Figure 4. Schematic representation of split HRP PC report system of NUDT[3]. Each fragments of split HRP(sHRPN and sHRPC) will bind to dCas9 protein, and they will together form a sHPR-dCas9-sgRNA complex. Like PC report system of Peking University, the split HRP will reunion in the presence of target gene. It will then produce visual signal by adding substrates such as 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).
However, there are still several possible improvements in those systems. First, due to its reliance on luciferase, it need other materials like fluorescein to function. Also, it is only able to produce one type of output -- bioluminescence. Most importantly, the system cannot amplify signal. In order to deal with the problem of extremely low concentration of ctDNA in blood, we created a system similar to the previous but using T7 polymerase.
Paired dCas9-T7 Report System Paired dCas9-T7 report system is a more efficient and precise PC report system with flexible outputs and signal amplifying ability. Like Peking University, we split the T7 polymerase and connect it with dCas9 protein via a linker. We call each complex NT7-dCas9 and CT7-dCas9.
Figure 5. The schematic illustration of paired dCas9 system(1). dCas9 is connected to one of the piece of split T7 RNA polymerase(NT7 and CT7). They will combine with sgRNA beforehand and constitute the split T7-dCas9-sgRNA complex.
Each complex by itself is inactive, but when the two complex attached to chosen target sites for identification of special sequences, they will reassemble to form a completed active T7 polymerase and start transcription in the presence of T7 promotor in cell free environment.
