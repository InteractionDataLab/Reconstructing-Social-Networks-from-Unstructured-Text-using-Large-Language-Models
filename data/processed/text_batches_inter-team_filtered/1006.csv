Our Time in Boston
Being a first-year team, we couldn't wait to gain the full iGEM experience we had heard so much about from our fellow iGEMers. Our first Giant Jamboree was everything we could possibly have imagined and much more! Not wanting to miss a minute, we kept busy watching other team's presentations, attending workshops, and exploring/presenting at the poster sessions. Even with all of these activities, we found time to tour the city. Here's our journey:

Digestion
DNA Digestion
Summary
DNA digestion, or DNA fragmentation, is a basic protocol in synthetic biology. This is typically performed prior to analysis of the DNA sequence, or in order to perform further protocols. Restriction enzymes are mixed and then incubated with DNA in a buffer solution. This yields DNA fragments cleaved at specific sites according to the enzymes used.
This microfluidic chip design performs DNA digestion. The desired DNA segment, restriction enzymes, water and buffer solution are inputted and mixed. The resulting solution is then sealed in an incubation chamber on top of which a heating element is placed. After the designated incubation time has passed, the liquid can then be transferred from the chip using a pipette.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

Being the team with the most amount of experience with iGEM over the past years, iGEM Team IIT Delhi had the task to explain about the completion, jamboree and sharing our experiences with the others.
Enactus:
Enactus IIT Delhi is basically related to Social Entrepreneurship, and deals with the various issues of social importance. Presently, they are working on project ""Aanch"", where there primary focus is to reduce the smoke coming out from the ""Chulha's"" used for cooking in rural areas. ""iGEM IIT Delhi"" has collaborated with ""Enactus IIT Delhi"" in spreading awareness about the harmful effects caused by the smoke emitted from the ""Chulha's"".
OUTREACH
NSIT Visit:
Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, is a leading institution of higher technical education in India. Our team went there to display our iGEM project, apart from preaching the idea of Synthetic Biology. It was an eye opener for most of the students as most of the concepts were new for them. They took deep interest and participated actively. We also conducted a survey with a different questionnaire and handed a copy of our documentation on Pollution, so as to make them fully aware of entire issue. Finally, we gave them an insight into the working of iGEM IIT Delhi, and encouraged them to be a part of our team next year. The spirit and enthusiasm shown by them was a sure indicator of the influence our visit had on them.
Online Mentoring :
We have been mentoring the idea of Synthetic Biology for a very long time, using our Facebook page. The basic motive was to make people aware of the ongoing research in the field of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. Our target was to make people realise the importance and the potential of synthetic biology.
Pollution
The following is a documentation of ""Pollution""; containing the causes and effects of pollution. It also contains detailed statistical analysis of pollution in some of the major cities in our nation. We sincerely hope that it will prove beneficial. You can check it at: Click Here

Traveling to Edmonton for aGEM!
Our team attended the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (aGEM) competition alongside the 2012 University of Alberta, University of Calgary and Lethbridge University iGEM teams. aGEM consisted of a jamboree-style presentation by each team and feedback from a judging panel. We obtained a lot of constructive advice from the panel regarding our presentation. Overall, the judges found our project to be very exciting and applicable industrially, and thought that we needed to present our story more coherently and confidently! We are looking forward to meeting with the teams from Alberta again at the West Americas regionals and hopefully the Worlds Championship.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," receiver population would contain a GFP indicator in the pSB4A5 backbone so that receiver cells could be selected using ampicillin. Currently, the sender and receiver cell populations are in the process of being established so that the co-culturing experiment can be performed.
The filtrate experiment was the second experiment proposed by our team. Conjugation requires cell-cell contact so by filtering the sender cells out of the media and using the filtrate to infect receiver cells, message transfer would only occur through M13 viral infection. The filtrate experiment was performed but no colonies were observed on the plates. It is believed that the cells were too dilute when plating on agar so the experiment will be repeated and optimized, possibly using E. coli JM109 F+ strain as the sender population.
In addition to the experiments proposed above, we devised a plaque assay that allows us to visualize M13 infection of the receiver cells. Although M13 virus does not undergo the lytic cycle, its infection of a cell population slows its growthreference. If plated onto agar, an area of diminished growth would be observed at the site of M13 viral infection, creating a turbid plaque. We proposed to use E. coli JM109 F+ receiver cells containing a helper plasmid and infecting them with the filtrate of E. coli JM109 F+ sender cells as described above. Receiver cells that become infected by the M13 virus would gain the messaging phagemid and then produce more virus (since they contain the helper plasmid), which will then infect neighbouring cells, thus creating a zone of diminished growth. This experiment is still in its preliminary stages but we hope to achieve positive results.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

""Biomedicine majors take the road of discovery into the human body. We bridge the gap between the medical and scientific worlds. A biomedical researcher develops new medicine by looking at diseases on a molecular level, discovering what makes us sick and how to cure it. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2050 antimicrobial resistance will cause 10 million premature deaths, making it a bigger problem than cancer. I am working to demolish these predictions. The microbial world has a huge toolbox that we are beginning to open in synthetic biology. I just want to apply these tools to make something to save mankind- nothing big you know :)""

“It was January of freshman year when I was first introduced to synthetic biology in the Silberg Lab. Before this experience, I didn't realize that my love for proteins and DNA could be more concretely translated into a love for synthetic biology. One of the most rewarding aspects of lab work is seeing positive results, and when experiments work, the results never cease to surprise me. Unique to synthetic biology is the crossroad between basic science and engineering. This collaboration allows us to tackle real-world problems and potential applications by creating explosive sensing devices or pills that help dogs eat chocolate. Science blends the optimism of future advances with the reality of experimental failure, but these failures provide just another valuable challenge for me to make an alternative plan to counter the unexpected. I love synthetic biology, and I will never stop questioning since characteristics like insatiable curiosity are important to me. It doesn’t matter how much I'm paid or what others are doing. If I am serving for the right purpose with my passion, I will be happy.”

“This is my first year doing iGEM. Honestly, I did not know much about synthetic biology before I joined iGEM, but I must say that now I love it! You can do so many different things, like engineer bacteria to produce synthetic proteins. I believe that it is a great field that will keep expanding and developing in the future.  What I get most out of research is a sense of fulfillment. However, starting research was not easy for me. When I first started a year ago, I felt really daunted because I had no experience at all and was surrounded by experts. I did not want to let anyone down. I hardly felt any fulfillment; in fact, I felt like I was causing more trouble in the lab. Despite all that, I slowly improved and learned more. I realized that as long"

So P-atp2 can correspond the change of environment and start the expression of FimE. FimE recognizes IRL and IRR, then catalyze the inversion of J23119. The weak acid would be generated at that time. For the environment, due to the production of the weak acid, it would turn neutral gradually.
Basic circuits model
○ Overview of Basic model
Modeling of basic circuits is divided into two parts: resistance subsystem model and regulation subsystem model. The main processes analyzed in models include promoter induction, transcription, translation, catalytic process of enzymes and the effects of products on environmental. Differential equations are applied to simulate the concentration change of all substances. Factors considered in our model are reversible reaction and materials production and degradation.
○ Resistance Model
In resistance subsystem, the constitutive promoter J23119 is applied, and we focused on the efficiency of three functional genes (Fig.1). GlsA encodes glutaminase which can catalyze the transformation from glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. Ammonia will neutralize the intracellular H+. The alkali-resistance functional genes NhaA and NhaB encode two types of Na+/H+ antiporters. These antiporters catalyze the exchange of sodium ions for protons and therefore maintain the homeostasis of bacteria.
Fig.1 Basic resistance circuit of pH Controller.
In resistance subsystem model, three key processes considered are the transcription and translation of two functional genes and the degradation of their products.
Three resistance devices’ models were constructed separately. To prove the function of these devices, we set up initial intracellular pH to 3.0 in program to examine the function of GlsA, while the initial pH was set to 9.0 to examine the function of NhaA and NhaB antiporters.
Results show that resistance subsystem can regulate intracellular pH to a suitable range (Fig.2, 3, 4).
Fig.2 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of this device, initial pH is set up to 3.0 in program. pH can effect activity of GlsA, while GlsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized to a suitable level.
Fig.3 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance device led by NhaB.  NhaB is not effected by pH, and can assist NhaA to regulate alkaline environment. Here we assumed that"

Theory-testing sequences
Our experiments were designed around synthetic DNA sequences with modified numbers of predicted hotspots. We custom-designed sequences to test specific hypotheses about sites that modulate a gene's risk of mutation in response to ultraviolet irradiation and oxidative exposure. There were synthetic and applied sequences in this methodology. The synthetic sequences were developed to have a certain susceptibility to mutations as increased number of pyrimidine dimer hot-spots or consecutive guanine residues. This set up of artificial genetic constructs allowed for testing of the hypothesis in a rigorous manner. Applied sequences were sequences that were actually genes, and were used in our experimental methodology in order to observe a realistic example of mutation rates.
Synthetic sequences consisted of constructs designed for irradiation with ultra-violet and oxidation. To generate this artificial DNA sequence, we wrote an algorithm that modified a seed sequence until it met parameters for the number of di-pyrimidine sites and other constraints to make it compatible with current DNA synthesis restrictions. These constructs were in the range of 25, 35 and 50 di-pyrimidine sites and were used to test the effects of UV-irradiation on increasing pyrimidine hotspots. A similar approach was used to construct synthetic sequences that had a consistent number of guanine residues while alignment of residues varied in order to test rate of oxidation with respect to guanine superadditivity. These sequences took the form of G-90 (sequence with 90 guanine residues interspersed), GG-45 (sequence with 45 guanine pairs), and GGG-30 (sequence with 30 guanine triplets).
Applied sequences
The experimental approach also tested applied sequences for both oxidation and UV-irradiation. These are actual genes that were either optimized to have lower or higher number of mutations via the algorithm developed. As there were separate synthetic sequences testing for oxidation and irradiation, similarly we had a mCherry construct for oxidation and GFP for UV irradiation. To optimize mCherry construct resistant to oxidation, an artificial DNA sequence, we employed the algorithm for modifying gene sequences to eliminate mutagenic sites. At these motifs, synonymous codon substitutions were made to eliminate oxidation-prone nucleotide sequences and replace them with ones"

The first few days, the group sat through a boot camp, where we learned about biobricks, the basics of Biology such as DNA transcription and translation, and how to use Clotho tools. As exposure to the more computer science aspect of the project, the group learned how to write a Clotho application.
As a test run, mini preps (protocol link) were performed on a few samples of biobricks that were previously plated and transformed. Most of these samples unfortunately did not yield a high concentration of DNA, except for a few. After quantifying the samples, the samples were loaded on a gel next to a ladder to confirm the DNA that was present. However, most bands did not appear on the gel after exposed to the UV light. This concluded that there was no DNA in the samples that were being looked at. Next, several transformations were made for biobrick parts such as RBS, RFP, and constituent and inducible promoters.
The transformations produced several cultures that were both dark and light in color. Plasmid preps were made of the dark and light cultures of the UV promoter."

Diagram of the chemotactic pathway in E. coli. (Figure by MIT OCW. After figure 4 in Falke, J. J., R. B. Bass, S. L. Butler, S. A. Chervitz, and M. A. Danielson. ""The Two-component Signaling Pathway of Bacterial Chemotaxis: A Molecular View of Signal Transduction by Receptors, Kinases, and Adaptation Enzymes."" In Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol. 13 (1997): 457-512.)
In bacteria, cell motility are a consequence of flagella rotation (in flagellated bacteria), which let them move in liquid mediums, and sometimes in solid mediums (agar plates). The name of these processes are swimming and swarming. However, there are others types of movements like: gliding movements (when cells have no cilium or flagella), twitching movements (intermittent, directionless and uncoordinated movement). Pseudomonas motility is due to the rotation of an only flagellum, H. salinarum motility is caused by a bunch of polarized flagella, but Escherichia coli, Salmonella y Bacillus subtillis have lots of flagella that are randomly spread out all over the membrane. Most of the time all flagella rotate in the same direction, provoking straight movements called run, but when the direction changes the bacteria begin to go round (tumbles).
Chemotaxis is a widespread phenomenon in organisms, because their natural tendency is approach to beneficial environments, according to their requirements, and avoid from damaging ones. Although it seems a very basic and easy process that only involves changes in speed and direction of rotation, actually it is a complex behavior that involves the continuous integration of extracellular stimuli and their intracellular coordination to respond fairly accurately.
Many bacteria use the chemotaxis to interact with both animal and plant hosts and chemotaxis plays an important role in the fitness and virulence of bacteria. Most plant-associated bacteria have swimming motility, which let them reaches plant tissues and causes invasion and colonization. Pathogenic bacteria are specifically attracted to diverse amino acids, sugars, aromatics, secondary metabolites and organic acids, natural component of plant exudates, that may act like chemoattractants. For example, sugars attract Rizhobium leguminosarum, Azospirullum brasilense and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, but not Erwinia amylovora or"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Modeling-content_-_-_TEXT.html," other gases, we can assume that the reported release of approximately 300 g methane per day also corresponds to 27 % (v/v) methane in the eructation [9]. Due to the balance between ruminal and released methane based on the solubility of gases in each other, the degradation of methane immediately affects its release into the environment. Thus from the very first second less methane will be emitted.
The final application of our project is ideally the introduction of E. cowli into the cows rumen referring to a degradation of methane at its source. Contrary to previous approaches the internal microbiota of the cow is not affected. However an important issue of this approach is the viability of E. cowli inside the rumen. To overcome this issue an immobilisation of E. cowli inside calcium alginate beads was performed. The calcium alginate matrix mainly consists of water, therefore a diffusion limitation was neither visible in the experimentally obtained data nor in literature [10]. However a decrease in methane degradation after immobilization was observed compared to free bacteria in suspension.
Figure 4: Decay in methane concentration of free and immobilized E. cowli in varying media. Purple: Immobilized in NMS-media, green: Immobilized in ruminal fluid and red: free bacteria in NMS-media.
Degradation of methane took 3.5 times longer if E. cowli was immobilized (see figure 4).  Based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics and our mathematical model an initial concentration of 2.3 µM was estimated corresponding to the amount of active enzyme. In comparison, the amount of initial, active enzyme in non-immobilized E. cowli has been 2.4 times higher. However, this was not unexpected. The beads were manually produced via polymerization of the alginate. Residual alginate as well as natural product loss led to the reduction of used cells and ultimately to a loss of enzyme. This was quantified by subsequently weighing of residual alginate. The loss amounted approximately 32 % due to an unoptimized method and a high viscosity of the  alginate solution. Moreover, a possible explanation for the loss of activity lies in the variation of pH between the media. The activity of sMMO has been reported to be highly dependent on the milieu [11].  Fortunately, the pH of ruminal fluid fluctuates between 6.7 and 7.2 [7]. The measured pH values of the ruminal fluid and the NMS-media were 6.7 corresponding to a 36 % loss in"

Auxin
Finally, we decided to analyze 2011 London Imperial College team’s project Auxin . Team Imperial tried to solve the soil erosion problem. The main problem here is that a plant's, which grows in very dry environment, roots can not reach water in soil. Then, obviously, it can not grow.
The project was divided into three modules. Module 1 – Phyto-Route – bacteria access into the roots (in this case bacteria produce chemoreceptor PA2652). Module 2 – Auxin Xpress – involves expression of IAA, which is essential for root growth. And module 3 – Gene Guard. Here we focus exactly on module 3. The team suggested Gene Guard system, which prevents bacteria spreading in the environment. Gene guard is based on toxin-antitoxin system, where anti-holin is engineered into genome and acts as antitoxin, and holin together with endolysin on plasmid DNA acts as toxins. Toxin-antitoxin system is efective, when horizontal gene transfer occurs. With our system Auxin project could be improved.
Bacteria is programed to produce PA2652 and IAA for the exact amount of time and then die. Horizontal gene transfer would be not necessary. And also it is not necessary to produce IAA and PA2652 all the time, but only when plant is growing and until it reaches deep waters. Production time can be calculated, knowing how deep water is in the exact area, characterized by dry soil. It would be huge improvment for plants, that could not grow, because of lack of water.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description-backup_-_-_TEXT.html," ]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which causes an inflammatory response of the urothelium. It is estimated that approximately 40% of women have had a UTI at some time in their lives [ 10 ]. UTIs may be caused by a variety of different organisms, most commonly bacteria. The most frequent cause of UTI in adult women is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85% of community-acquired UTIs and 25-50% of hospital-acquired UTIs. Nosocomial infections may involve more aggressive organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species.
The Solution
Break down bacterial biofilms to liberate the bacteria encased within and reduce the dose of antibiotics required
Breaking down bacterial biofilms and kill the bacteria encased within to provide an alternative to antibiotics
Overview
Our solution is focused on providing a treatment for UTIs because conventional antibiotics are unable to treat these and other biofilm-associated infections. Given the prevalence of such infections, there is a growing need for alternative therapeutic agents that can specifically degrade biofilms and kill the bacteria encased within. The use of synthetic biology to produce enzymes is the most effective way to achieve this specificity based on current technology. Our solution aims to investigate how bacterial biofilm disrupting proteins and antimicrobial proteins can be exported from E. coli and subsequently retain their antibiofilm/antimicrobial function. Using this secretion device we seek to create a system that offers persistent protection against biofilm formation.
We have designed a device that can exert antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa, the two leading causes of CAUTIs [ 4 ]. A nonpathogenic laboratory strain of E. coli is used as the expression host for the production of these enzymes as a proof-of-concept. The antibiofilm enzymes that we are using are Dispersin B and Micrococcal DNase, and the antimicrobial proteins that we are using are Art-175 and Microcin S.
Degrading the Biofilm
Prof. Malone-Lee stressed to us that sensitivity is a greater problem than complete antibiotic resistance. “Many more strains of bacteria are just insensitive to low doses of antibiotics, many can be overcome by high doses over long periods of time. Resistance is definitely not absolute.” Breaking down the biofilm increases the sensitivity of the bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.

  Then why do we choose SQLite?
  
  Because SQLite provides the function we need! The answer is simple but true! Network independent, very efficient , and it can store what you search in cache therefore you can get the same search result faster next time.
  
Xcode
  For us, the programming tool is Xcode. Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. First released in 2003, the latest stable release is version 4.4.1 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for Mac OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion users.
  
  Similar to other programming tools, Xcode can support many different programming languages, like C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python and so on. However, the major language we use is Objective-C.
  
  What makes Xcode unique is that it includes interface builder. Interface Builder is a software development application for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. It is part of Xcode, the Apple Developer Connection developer's toolset. Interface Builder allows Cocoa and Carbon developers to create interfaces for applications using a graphical user interface. It is very user-friendly. There are many components, like buttons and sliders, listed beside the main window, users can just drag the components into the main window, and then these components can be showed when running the program. If don’t use Interface Builder, users will have to write lines and lines of statements to set a component, but now, just dragging can simply set its properties. Moreover, if users set a link between the component and statements, then this component can be controlled by the program.
  
  Xcode also provides lots of libraries and classes, users can use a large sum of ready-made functions to program. These libraries and classes are contained in frameworks. Users can add different frameworks to the program to use different functions. Frameworks are conductive to the communication between programs, because these functions are the same. They are universal and reusable, which make them to be very convenient.
  Xcode help page is really beneficial, too. Users can look up for many functions and classes. It also provides many example codes for users to download"

ModD does not show sequence similarity to any gene product in current databases and its role in transport is unclear. Two more genes, modEF, are also involved in molybdate transport. The modE gene encodes a regulatory protein that effects molybdenum-dependent repression at the modA promoter [6–8]. The exact role of modF is not yet clear [6].
The mod operon encodes a very high affinity(Km=15 nM) molybdate transport system. The low K values agree well with previous results obtained with the enteric diazotroph K. pneumoniae ([1]; Km=20 nM, J. Imperial, unpublished results). and adequately explain the high molybdenum scavenging capacity observed with most bacteria[11].
ModA, the periplasmic binding component of the mod system. had a K for molybdate of 3–5 mM. This is one of the highest substrate Kd values reported for any periplasmic binding protein [9,10] and contrasts with the low Kd values for molybdate uptake The Structure of modA[14]

The blue mesh represents a 2Fo-Fc omit map contoured at a level of 2σ and shown only around the 5 atoms of the tungstate ion. Note that the tungstate and molybdate binding sites are indistinguishable at the current resolution, which reflects the similar ionic radii of the two ions[2,3]

Beside the recombinant characterisation we also created a transgenic moss transformed with a receptor containing PP1 in its extracellular domain. The recombinant protein production was carried out in E. coli BL-21 which was grown in 2 L of LB-media. The protein production was induced at OD 0.8 by addition of arabinose to a concentration of 5 mM. The cells were harvested after 4 h and subsequently resuspended in 20 mL SA-buffer with 5 mM 2-mercapto ethanol. Cell disruption was performed using ultrasonic sound. The dialysed cell extracte was applied to a streptavidin affinity column which was washed until a base line was reached and was subsequently eluted using SA-buffer containing 5 mM of biotin and 5 mM of 2-mercapto ethanol.

These amplified bands explain that the synthetically designed primers were not specific enough. HT-1 fragment size is 1105 bp, and HT-2 fragment size is 864 bp. The indicated arrows showed the expected amplified fragments.
As a means of collaboration, we desperately tried to contact iGEM NTU for help of ligation cloning of HT into commercial expression vector pcDNA3 on August. Coincidently, Angelysia went back to Jakarta, and we met each other for further discussion in cloning the respective gBlocks. The gBlocks are sent to NTU Singapore on the mid of August. We gave our highest gratitude for team iGEM NTU in helping us to clone the completed linear HT fragment into pcDNA3. The samples arrived back to IHVCB lab on the mid of September. Additionally, iGEM NTU also offers to clone several designed parts of our project related with FRET system into commercial vectors.

We have started to do re-clone traditionally using EcoRI and PstI into pQE80L expression plasmids, and successfully obtained the pQE80L-HT (figure 4).
However, we tried to clone the HT into pSB1C3 and fail twice since both DNA have the same fragment size, and it would be difficult to be done in traditional cloning (figure 5). Therefore, iGEM NTU offers us help in cloning the leftovers HT complete fragment into pSB1C3 while our lab team could start to characterize the HT part along with BFP and DiphTox.
Figure 4. Gel analysis of PCR colonies on pQE80L-HT transformed BL21(DE3) strain E. coli. The subsequent 600s bp bands were found in all of the following colonies, indicating that the HT fragment was successfully inserted.

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Restriction Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html," in an accumulation of RhaS. RhaS then acts as the L-rhamnose-dependent positive regulator of the rhaB promoter.
The genes rhaBAD are organized in one operon which is controlled by the rhaPBAD promoter. This promoter is regulated by two activators, RhaS and RhaR, and the corresponding genes belong to one transcription unit which is located in opposite direction of rhaBAD. If L-rhamnose is available, RhaR binds to the rhaPRS promoter and activates the production of RhaR and RhaS. RhaS together with L-rhamnose in turn binds to the rhaPBAD and the rhaPT promoter and activates the transcription of the structural genes. However, for the application of the rhamnose expression system it is not necessary to express the regulatory proteins in larger quantities, because the amounts expressed from the chromosome are sufficient to activate transcription even on multi-copy plasmids. Therefore, only the rhaPBAD promoter has to be cloned upstream of the gene that is to be expressed. Full induction of rhaBAD transcription also requires binding of the CRP-cAMP complex, which is a key regulator of catabolite repression.[ 11 ]
The pRha sequence was containing an EcoRI restriction site, so we had to disrupt it in order to use pRha as a biobrick. In order to decide which base pair to modify, we used the UCSC Microbial Genome Browser . We compared the pRha sequence in E.coli and similar species, and identified that the at the position is sometimes replaced by a in some species, so we decided to replace it in a same way. We ordered a gBlock with the pRha sequence having the mutation, and this is the sequence we used and submitted.
Considering these candidates, we decided to clone the following constructs in low-copy vector pSB3C5 to use it in our experiments, all with a medium RBS B0032 :
pBad & RBS & I-SceI
pRha & RBS & GFP

CAT-Seq dynamic range assessment
Before the activity of earlier generated control libraries could be measured a control experiment was carried out. The role of such experiment was to test the sensitivity of nanopore sequencing as a tool for reading the information encoded with the DNA as a ratio of incorporated cytidine and reference nucleotides. For this, multiple displacement amplification reactions were carried out in 50 pL droplets containing the circularized CAT-Seq esterase gene and different ratios of substrate, reference and product nucleotides:
1) 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines;
2) 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM substrate nucleotide;
3) 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM regular cytidines;
4) 300 µM regular cytidines.
The amplified DNA was extracted and prepared for nanopore sequencing. By applying data preparation and analysis pipeline discussed above, the mean probabilities for every k-mer in the sample DNA were filtered and extracted for 5’-methyl-cytidines and cytidines in all the sequencing reads. The mean methylation score (the reference nucleotide count) was then assigned to each of the sequenced products.
Figure 19. Mean methylation score (reference nucleotide count) assigned to DNA amplified in 50 pL droplet MDA reaction with 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines; 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM substrate nucleotide; 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM regular cytidines; 300 µM regular cytidines.
We then performed scaling by subtracting the baseline of Cyt 300µM sequencing reads, which corresponds to zero methylated sites and normalized it over 300µM 5mC sequencing reads (corresponding to fully methylated sequence) to obtain the final score displayed at Fig. 20.
Figure 20. Normalized mean methylation score (reference nucleotide count) assigned no to DNA amplified in 50 pL droplet MDA reaction with 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines; 300 µM 5-methylated cytidines + 25 µM substrate nucleotide; 300 µM 5-m"

The Digest was purified using QiaGen Nucleotide Removal Kit. Unfortunately I dropped 2/3 onto the table... The final DNA concentration was 47.5 ng/ ul according to NanoVue. Standard CPEC assembly was performed in the old broken BioRAD cycler which didn't cool down to 53 °C but only to 58 °C for the annealing step. Hopefully it worked. TOP10 cells were transformed with 5 ul of CPEC master mix.
Transformation was successful. Ten colonies were screened using primers VF2 and KH6 in a 20 ul iTaq Master Mix according to standard protocol (50 °C).
Probes number x to x were purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit and digested with NEB DpnI, EcoRI-HF and SpeI-HF over night to see whether pRB22 is really free of those restriction sites. The result was put on an AgaroseGel.
Lanes 1 to 4 show a slight smear beneath 200 bp. Lane 5 (probe 10) doesn't show that smear and the
specific band runs maybe 300 bp higher. So maybe the first four lanes contained restriction sites and
the last one didn't. We put probes 1 and 10 in 40 ml culture for midiprep. The midiprep will then be
digested as well so that we get certainity about the restriction sites. In parallel we did a colony PCR from probe 10 with KH3/4 using Phusion Flash HF to already have our
fragment for pRB23 for the T-Domain-exchange.

East Chapel Hill High School iGEM Team
This year, our iGEM team collaborated with the East Chapel Hill High School iGEM team to hold a conference geared towards other teams across the Southeastern United States. While we had a small start, three teams participated in the event. During our conference, we discussed our individual projects, and offered each other advice and criticisms and suggestions for improvement. We also invited a few guest speakers to participate, and they told us more about careers, ethics, and advancements in the field of synthetic biology.
Reddit Page
Later on during the conference, we chose to create a page on Reddit geared towards discussion of synthetic biology and ethics. Teams and individual iGEM members from around the world would be encouraged to research and take a stance on different topics, such as morally questionable experiments within the field and how science fiction influences the public’s opinions on synthetic biology, among others. Our teams also created a discussion-based game, influenced by the “Building with Biology” forum kit. Instead of discussing the malaria, however, our teams decided the Zika virus was more relevant.

Outlook
Chitosan is a derivative produced from chitin. As previously mentioned, chitosan's properties and bioactivity are heavily dependent on three factors: degree and pattern of deacetylation as well as its degree of polymerisation. The first two characteristics can be influenced and controlled via chitin deacetylases. Bringing variability into the length, however, is easiest done by implementing chitinases, whose ability to break down chitin would mean shorter chitosan molecules in turn.
Since chitosan is such a versatile molecule, the ability to select the influencing factors beforehand, means a great advantage over normally used methods.

Upscaling
Participating in the manufacturing track, scaling up the production of the desired monomers glycolic acid and ε-caprolactone as well as our biopolymers PLGA and PLGC constitutes an essential part of our project. Therefore, we are considering possibilities on how to further increase the product yield.
Choice of Organisms
One of the major opportunities for improvement of monomer production and upscaling processes involves the selection of a suitable organism, as the production strain should comply with certain requirements. It should be able to produce our three monomers with maximal titers for minimal costs, in less time, with less waste materials [1] . Most well-established model organisms have some shortcomings of sorts. The organism in general comprises various criteria which are necessary to be fulfilled for our purpose, without running into troubles with interfering cellular mechanisms [1] . We have chosen S. cerevisiae and E. coli, since they are well characterized and currently applied in a large variety of biotechnological processes. Both of them bear the possibility to be genetically modified using standard molecular-biological methods, thereby constructing complex synthetic pathways that subsequently result in product formation.
The combination of easy handling, widely understood metabolism, high tolerance to solvents, and high resistance to oxidative stress [2] also makes Pseudomonas putida one of the current host candidates, suitable for our monomer production [3] . The organism is classified as a gammaproteobacterium and closely related to the widely used model organism E. coli.
It was previously shown that glycolic acid can be directly synthesized from glyoxylate in S. cerevisiae [4] . To adapt this approach, we aimed on overproducing the natively encoded glyoxylate reductase "

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," evolution by the much easier PREDCEL protocol developed by us later on. But first things first.
The engineering approach our team used to reach our goal was to first divide the in silico and in vivo evolution problems into their basic components, work them out independently and validate them thoroughly before finally combining them into a united workflow. We quickly realized that the general components required for the in vivo and in silico directed evolution systems conceptually identical:  Evolution always consists of a closed cycle running through three major steps: (i) reproduction, (ii) mutation and subsequent (iii) selection of sequence variants. The corresponding in vivo evolution counterparts in PACE are well described and hence easy to identify:
Reproduction is achieved by propagating M13 bacteriophages on E. coli host cells.
Mutation is achieved during phage replication by expression of mutagenic genes.
Selection is induced using synthetic circuits that couple the expression of geneIII (an essential M13 gene) to the function (“fitness”) of the phage-encoded transgene to be evolved.
All three steps were tested individually by (i) propagating geneIII-deficient M13 phages on E. coli host cells in a PACE apparatus in the absence of selection pressure and mutagenesis; (ii) overexpressing mutagenic genes in E. coli and investigate the spontaneous formation of resistant colonies due to the mutagenesis-induced genetic drift; and (iii) comparing the propagation of phages with known transgene “fitness” on corresponding synthetic circuits
Figure 3: Overview of the PREDCEL protocol
Finally, we all three steps were successfully united into a completed PACE cycle to evolve improved split T7 polymerase variants.  The corresponding in silico evolution cycle counterparts were practically not existing and had to be invented from scratch. To this end, we designed an innovative software suite named AiGEM , for Artificial Intelligence for Genetic Evolution Mimicking. AiGEMs core functionalities thereby precisely correspond to individual steps of a typical directed evolution cycle (see AiGEM website for details on the implementation):
We mutate parental sequences using GAIA, the Genetic Artificial intelligence algorithm, which introducing random errors in a parental protein sequence/sequence pool; note, that errors can also be limited to selected sequences windows

SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY IS MAKING MEDICAL MARIJUANA DRUGS CHEAPER
Marijuana is best known for its use as a recreational drug. The substance comes from the leaves of the Cannabis plant, and is made up of a number of compounds; most of these are compounds known as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are a group of compounds which act on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain, and at least 85 cannabinoids are found in marijuana collected from the Cannabis plant. These cause a variety of different effects between them; of these compounds, tetra-hydro-cannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most abundant.
Cannabinoids exert their effects by binding to cannabinoid receptors, of which there are 2 types. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is found at the synapses of the central nervous system; primarilt sensory neurones. It is the most abundant GPCR found in the brain, and is also found in other tissues such as muscle, liver and adipose (fatty) tissue. CB2 is found primarily in the cells of the immune system.
It is illegal in the UK and most US states to smoke marijuana, both recreationally and medically. However, the UK Home Office and the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have both approved the use of certain cannabinoids from the Cannabis plant to treat medial conditions. This is because determining the effects that one or two cannabinoids have on the body is much easier than testing the effects of dozens at once (i.e. direct from the cannabis leaf). Medical trials have shown that the cannabinoids THC and CBD can have positive medicinal effects, as I shall describe later.
As a result, a number of pharmaceutical companies are making money legally by growing Cannabis. Unfortunately, the process of getting these target cannabinoids is very time-consuming and low-yielding. First, the plants must be clutivated for months in government-inspected facilities; then, the low quantities of target cannabinoids (THC and"

This promoter uses the E. coli native enzyme NsrR which inhibits the expression of the PyeaR promoting sequence. [Link] HJ Beaumont et al. Expression of nitrite reductase in Nitrosomonas europaea involves NsrR, a novel nitrite-sensitive transcription repressor in Molecular Microbiology Volume 54, Issue 1, October 2004, Pages 148-58[3] Nitric oxide in the cell inactivates this enzyme, thus increasing the rate of transcription of any downstream genes.
BBa_K381005 Testing     The PyeaR promoter ( BBa_K216005 ) from the 2009 Edinburgh iGEM team was the part we wanted for our Nitric Oxide sensing device. To test if this promoter works, we used the BBa_K381001 ( BBa_K216005 + BBa_E0840 ) part made by 2011 BCCS-Bristol iGEM In order to test the promoter, we transformed the DH5-α with BBa_K381001 and measured the fluorescence with a plate reader after being induced with varying concentrations of potassium nitrate (0 mM - 40 mM) at OD = 0.4.
Figure 1. Fluorescence of cultures when PyeaR promoter was induced at varying concentrations of potassium nitrate.
Fig. 1 shows that at after around OD = 0.4, fluorescence becomes higher in the cultures containing potassium nitrate compared to the culture with no nitrate. On another note, no large increase in fluorescence was seen from increasing the concentration of potassium nitrate beyond 5 mM,      suggesting that 5 mM potassium nitrate is enought to induce the promoter to maximum strength. Surprisingly, the cultures with 5 mM and 10 mM potassium nitrate had a generally stronger induction compared to the 25 mM and 40 mM cultures.
Accelerative Antagonistic Anxiety
There are several different kinds of anxiety and panic disorders. One common feature of these diseases is the occurrence of panic attacks which are caused by a sudden surge in epinephrine. It has also been shown that patients with panic disorder have an elevated level of arterial epinephrine even at rest. [Link] Wilkinson D. et al.

Introduction
BBa_K1357009
BBa_K540001
-----* Introduction *-----
We also improved the characterization of two existing BioBrick Parts although we've participated in the InterLab Measurement Study . The parts we tested are BBa_K1357009 and BBa_K540001 .
-----* BBa_K1357009 *-----
The fluorescent protein is used widly as a reporter, such as GFP and RFP. To enrich the kinds of fluorescent proteins, the iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden supported some other colour proteins like BFP and YFP which are from the coral Acropora millepora, amilCP. In this year, we want to verify the characteristic of BFP.
Firstly, we got BBa_K1357009 from the 2017 DNA Distribution Kit Plates and transformed it to the E.Coli DH5α. After a one-week incubation, a big bacterial colony grew on the plate.
Secondly, we extracted the plasmid from the bacteria, digested with XbaI and PstI, cloned it into plasmid BBa_J61002 with the promoter BBa_J23100 , then transformed into E.coli DH5α again. We observed the strong blue just one day later. The result shows that BBa_K1357009 works well.
-----* BBa_K540001 *-----
Meanwhile, we also tested BBa_K540001 using the reporter BBa_I13504 . The Cobalt induced promoter BBa_K540001 was added before the reporter BBa_I13504 , then the constructed plasmid was transformed into E.coli DH5α to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD600
The result shows that there is not a specific relationship with the concentration of Cobalt. There might be some problems with this promoter.

Vanderbilt,2016,Team:Vanderbilt#Software#Performance_-_-_TEXT.html," effectively removed at a high rate (80% on average, with a mode of having ~100% of runs over 5bp removed).
In addition, we benchmarked the software’s performance when handling these sequences as a realistic use-case. For an approximately 1000 bp sequence, the optimizations specific for a one mutation type will complete in 0.8 – 1.1 seconds on an Intel i7 processor. An overall optimization that checks every mutation type takes approximately 3 seconds. These speeds easily accommodate most lab workflows, and there is considerable room for further speed optimization (for example, compiling the program into cython) if larger datasets are being used.
Conclusions
Both metrics of our software’s performance scored well in our testing, including how well it can optimized sequences and how computationally effective it implements its optimization. Our software can eliminate high percentages of mutagenic sites with only synonymous changes that retain efficient codon usage, and at speeds fast enough to accommodate bioinformatics analyses such as the comprehensive gene characterization we performed on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. In the process, we generated a large amount of new data characterizing the mutation risk of thousands of genes encompassing most ORFs on the Registry that is resource for future researchers."

Chemotaxis module
We performed several assays to demonstrate the chemotaxis ability of our engineered Bacillus subtilis strain to move towards N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), the base unit of chitin. The ability of the wild-type strain to move towards glucose was the positive control.
1. Petri dishes Test
The first chemotaxis assay was done in Petri dishes filled with a growth medium containing 0,3% agar. This semi-solid medium was supposed to favor bacterial motility. A paper disk soaked with the attractive compound was placed in the middle of the dish, then cells were loaded into the medium (see Figure 1). This protocol was adapted from the Imperial College 2011 iGEM team .
Figure 1: Petri dishes chemotaxis assay. (A) A pipet was used to inject cells into the semi-solid medium. (B) Bacteria would move toward the attractive compound diffusing from a paper disk.
With this assay, we however failed to see any chemotaxis of the wild-type control toward glucose (Figure 2-A). As B. subtilis is attracted by many other glucides and amino-acids that can be found in rich medium such as in LB medium. Therefore, with the hope of improving the experimental conditions, we have challenged the cells with paper discs soaked in LB medium containing glucose (Figure 2-B).
Figure 2: Chemotaxis test with paper discs soaked in either a Glucose solution (A) or in Glucose containing LB medium (B) as attractive compound. Paper discs soaked with water were used as negative controls.
No difference was observed between the Petri dishes with or without glucose. With glucose containing LB medium, a large halo around the"

Even though we used approximation for the value of all the constants (Ki , di …), we achieved an expected curve equilibrating the enzymes and metabolites as well as maximizing the PLA production. This astonishing results obviously suggest that, natural behaviour of each part is dramatically more important than the value of each enzymatic, interaction or regulation (thermodynamic and kinetic constants). However, in order to model the circuits more precisely, and include more details, the necessity of associating the exact values is unavoidable. Nowadays, there are many computational and practical methods for measuring these constants. It must be emphasized that, using electrical circuit modelling, one will consider more details such as gain, delay, amplification and even memory, along with applying different electronic equivalents as mentioned before.

Integrated Human Practice: We took into account every aspect of human practice into our project, firstly, we integrated HP into the work by backing up every scientific research and lab experiments with an upstream human practice study. In addition to that, we have been careful to thoughtfully implement our work in the actual context, to make sure it addresses current concerns of our society. In the process, we were careful not to skip any step and to develop our project in a didactic manner, that hopefully can be built upon by others (all of our research and methods can be found in the wiki). Finally, we spread the word about our team and our project as much as possible, and we got very positive feedback (from school pupils, high school students, scientists and the general public, and hopefully our project and our team has inspired some of them. (evidence) Education and Public engagement:Our team focused a great part of the work on education and public engagement, in an attempt to reach the most various public possible starting with middle school and high school students, through game-like activities followed by animated debats.

One of the many brilliant parts about iGEM is that besides being in the lab you get to do outreach projects. Considering the impact of your work, further consequences and safety is an essential part of scientific work.
At this point in time the phrase “synthetic biology” often invokes the image of mad scientists trying to play god or destroying our beloved nature. When people think about genetic engineering they see spooky laboratories and some form of witchery being done behind closed doors. This makes outreach an inevitable part of iGEM. We think that iGEM gives us, young students from all over the world, the opportunity to change this image! Without any doubt risks and safety have to be considered, and this is another big part of iGEM as each team has to fill out safety forms and be considerate about their work.
But right now people are still doubting all the advantages of genetic engineering. We thought it might be a great idea if as many teams as possible joined forces and created a simple thing which reaches a big community.
This is where our postcards fit in. We wrote to a whole lot of teams to get them to take part and tried to get as many teams on board as possible. Fortunately, many teams were as enthusiastic about this as we were!
Last year's iGEM Team Duesseldorf started a postcard campaign which included seven german teams and the postcards were a great success. This year we wanted to create an even bigger campaign. At first we wanted it to be all over Europe, but after we put our campaign up on the collaboration page of iGEM, teams from all over the world asked us if they could join. We were quite surprised but loved the idea of a worldwide postcard campaign. In total, "

Theoretical Considerations
What is a model?
The answer will differ among communities of researchers. In the broadest sense, a model is an abstract representation of objects or processes that explains features of these objects or processes. Is important to remember that we are not only going to assign a model, we are going to simulate it as well to see if it explains the real biological process.
Steps to succes modelizing a system
Assumptions
Probably the most vital role that the modeler plays in modeling is in exercising his scientific judgment as to what assumptions can be validly made. Obviously an extremely rigorous model that includes every phenomenon down to microscopic detail would be so complex that it would take a long time to develop and might be impossible to solve. A modeling compromise between a rigorous description and getting an answer that is good enough is always required. This has been called “optimum sloppiness”. It involves making as many simplifying assumptions as are optimum usually corresponds to a model which is as complex as the available computing facilities will permit. The assumptions that are made should be carefully considered and listed. They impose limitations on the model that should always be kept in mind when evaluating its predicted results.
Model Assignment is not Unique
Biological phenomena can be described in mathematical terms. It is important to note that a certain process can be described in more than one way.
• A biological object can be investigated with different experimental methods.

""The chronic arsenic poisoning in West Bengal represents the single largest environmental health problem the world has ever seen, other than that associated with the Chernobyl disaster"" - D. Chakraborti et. al., Elsevier, May 2002
Introduction
""Did you know ?"": The Great Napoleon who survived even the adverse Russian winters, could not survive arsenic though.
Arsenic has been called “The king of poisons” and “The poison of the kings” owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another. A Group-A carcinogen on WHO list, arsenic in all forms is also ranked at the top of the list of hazardous substances by U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry. Now imagine if your food and drinking water had been contaminated with arsenic enough to kill you but slowly by gradual accumulation in your body over years, what a miserable living that would be! This is the plight of the millions of inhabitants in West Bengal, India and Bangladesh.
Origin of Arsenic in Bengal Alluvial Plains and Underground aquifers
The sedimentation of Arsenic on the plains of Bengal started 15,000 to 12,000 years ago with the melting of glaciers at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. The water on the Himalayan slopes eroded the exposed arsenic laden rocks from the Indus ophiolite belt and the high grade gneisses solvating the arsenic minerals and carrying them downstream along the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers. Upon reaching the flat lands of Bengal, the river waters start deloading their carries depositing heavy alluvial sediments along with high concentration of eroded arsenic salts on these plains. When rain and accumulated water seeps into the ground through such arsenic contaminated soil layers, it solvates the inorganic salts on its way down to the aquifers. This in turn leads to arsenic pollution of groundwater aquifers with contamination increasing steadily over years as more deposits are laid upon by the rivers and more water seeps through the soil reaching the underground stores.
Problem severity in West Bengal
WHO allowed levels of Arsenic in drinking water for it to be deemed safe is 10μg/L, while the government national standards for India and Bangladesh are 50μg/L. In comparison to these recommended figures, let us compare the average arsenic concentrations in groundwater in the six most badly affected districts of"

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Policy and Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," followed by an idea development exercise, where the students were to pair a global problem with an element from synthetic biology. Prior to the workshop the students were provided with a list of global problems within different categories such as human health, climate and environment and the future increase in population. With this the students also received a list of elements often applied in synthetic biology such as different proteins, organisms and reporters together with a definition of the individual elements (the toolbox). The students were encouraged to pair elements from the toolbox to develop concepts that could act as (part of) a solution to one or more of the presented problems. During the exercise the students were also encouraged to add problems or elements to the lists and to use their knowledge within other scientific fields and imagination in order to pair up seemingly unrelated elements.
Some of the examples the students came up with are listed below:
Lotion containing lipases against obesity
Bacteria emitting light when oxygen level decrease in lakes due to pollution
Remedy against loss of hair, hair producing bacteria
Bacteria producing D-vitamin. strengthen immune system
Trees as lampposts that stop photosynthesis and lighten when it becomes dark
Squared fruit
Inverted yeast cells for hangovers
Sun filter for the skin containing bacteria producing the active compounds in sun screen
Drug delivery using the technique like primers for a PCR reaction and find specific target DNA
A bandage containing penicillin fungi preventing inflammation
Trees with different colors so painting is no longer necessary
Tasty algae to prevent hunger
Genes from electric eel incorporated bacteria for bio batteries.
Algae turning salt water into drinking water
Paper production from bacteria instead of trees
Cells acting as filter to clean salt water
Bacteria producing vitamins
Bacteria degrading nuclear waste
Bacteria detecting radioactivity and send out a fluorescence signal when radioactivity is too high.
The workshop concept and material will be passed on to future DTU iGEM teams to enable them to make it a part of their initial idea development phase, as we experienced that especially this part of an iGEM project can be challenging. We emphasised this point to the workshop participants, and it thereby worked as a motivation factor.
During the workshops we naturally ended up discussing the release of GMOs into the environment, as many of the solutions proposed by the students were of a nature that would require the release of GMOs. This initiated a talk about safety in the laboratory and the national as well as regional restrictions associated with GMOs. Please take a look at our pages about safety and ethics if you are interested in our approach on these subjects.

How Does Light Regulate BeeT?
In this part, we show the design of a regulatory system that connects the toggle switch and the light kill switch by means of light (Figure 10). The toggle switch controls expression of the BeeT’s toxin between an off-state and an on-state, which can be switched with two stimulus, guanine (or vitamin B12) and blue light. Our mite sensor is based on two types of riboswitches, one causes transcription termination and the other prevents transcription initiation by locating on the 5’ UTR region of the mRNA attenuating gene translation after binding a metabolite 2 . The light sensor makes use of YF1 and FixJ. YF1 is the fusion of the LOV (Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing ) protein with a histidine kinase 3 . In the absence of light, YF1 can activate FixJ by phosphorylation resulting in the activation of the Fixk2 promoter. In the presence of 480 nm wavelength light, YF1 can no longer phosphorylate FixJ due to the change position of a salt bridge on the LOV domain, leading to the deactivation of the Fixk2 promoter 4 .
Changes on the guanine or vitamin B12 and light conditions result in different situations on the bee hive.
Situation 1: No Mites Present
Initially, in the brood cells, the expression of the BeeT’s toxin is inhibited by the LacI repressor since the phosphorylation process between YF1 and FixJ takes some time to activate Fixk2 and produce enough TetR repressor to inhibit  ptet (promoter driving the expression of LacI). On this situation the system remains in  the off-state (Figure 10a). At the same time, MazE is constitutively expressed from the light Kill Switch preventing the death of the cells.
Situation 2: Mite Present
When mites are present in the brood cells, they produce and release guanine and vitamin B12 into the microenvironment of the brood cells. The binding of these metabolites to the riboswitches on the 5’ UTR of the LacI mRNA will attenuate translation of LacI (Figure 10b) resulting on the stop of the inhibition of the FixK2-plac hybrid promoter and initiating the expression of TetR and BeeT’s toxin (Figure 10c). At this point the system has switched to on"

Hello, my name is Corinna Krüger and I am currently in the second semester of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master at the University of Göttingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology 2011 also at this University. Last year after my Bachelor, I was doing an internship at the University of Göteborg, Sweden. This is my first iGEM participation and I am really glad being a member of the team. All of us are very motivated and we have a lot of fun doing our experiments. I think that iGEM offers the possibility to work independently and to learn organizing experiments. I am really looking forward to the jamboree in Amsterdam. I hope to get to know other teams from different countries and that we can exchange our experiments in lab work.

As well as all the others around, I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry master´s program at the University of Göttingen. Currently, I am in my second semester. I finished my bachelor in August 2011 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM Team for the TUM in 2011. Their stories stunned me very much and I wanted to join a team by myself as fast as possible. I worked for my Bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at the Faculty of Life Science (TUM), where I had a lot planning and working on my own. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM project.

pBad-pTet RFP Characterization with atc and arabinose
For the pBad-pTet construct, we used the same controls as mentioned above. According to literature, the pTet-pBad construct has not previously functioned as suspected. This was possibly due to position-dependence interference [1]. Conversely, our flow cytometer data showed that pTet-pBad had a greater range of fluorescence than pBad-pTet. We will need to do further investigating to find out why this was the case. Unlike results in the literature, our pTet-pBad construct worked well, but the pBad-pTet didn't show anticipated function. We are predicting that the arabinose concentrations were too low for this experiment and the atc concentrations were too high. We are planning to run another flow experiment before the jamboree with new small molecule concentrations. We hope that this will improve function (fluorescence expression) and reduce the error bars.
Figure 2: Flow Cytometry graph for pBad-pTet level 1 construct with RFP for three conditions: atc (red), arabinose (blue), atc and arabinose (purple)
Testing of p15A origin of replication
Flow cytometry testing of the p15A origin was performed with the flow cytometry workflow using constitutively-expressed GFP and RFP controls . The similarities in fluorescence between the transcriptional units with the pMB1 and p15A origins were not expected, as only approximately 10-25 plasmids should be present per cell with the p15A origin in contrast with the pMB1 origin, which allows for over 100 plasmids per cell. This result may be due to the use of strong promoters and RBSs in the experiment, which may have caused overexpression of the fluorescent reporter and overshadowed any change brought about by changing the origin of replication.
Figure 3: Flow Cytometry graph for the p15A and pMB1 origins of replication with constitutively expressed GFP and RFP.
Alternatively, these results may be due to a deviation in the protocol necessitated by poor cell growth - on day 2 of the flow cytometry workflow, the 8-hour liquid cultures were grown in contaminated deep-well plates that resulted in no cell growth. The transformed colonies had to be re-picked and grown after this delay, which may have affected the folding and expression of the fluorescent proteins. This experiment will be repeated with freshly-transformed cells and a weaker promoter and RBS, and its results will be presented"

Conditions:
Excitation: 460 nm
Emission spectra: 500 nm
Measurement Mode: Time course
Sensitivity: High
Temperature: 37 °C
Results: First, the Blanks are not changing significantly over time. Further results indicate a decrease of the fluorescence which increases after 30 min if ATP and Apyrase are contained in the buffer. Towards the end of the reaction the fluorescence of the RNA reduces again. If an inhibitor is added to the reaction the fluorescence stays at one level without steeper decrease.

I am Ekin Saglican, a third year student in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at METU. I also have a minor program in Logic and Philosophy of Science. This is my first year in IGEM as a part of the lab-team. I’ve really enjoyed working in the laboratory and gained a lot of experience. For new IGEM teams, this is not an easy competition and you should work very hard, but i believe it will worth working for.

I heard about iGEM two years ago, in my first year at METU and I became interested in synthetic biology. That’s why I want my future studies to be in the field of synthetic biology.                                 It was great to be a part of an iGEM team because I learned so many new things and of course I had so much fun. That’s why for the new iGEM teams I can say that, work hard but don’t forget to enjoy every minute of this competition.

This is the first iGEM experience for me and I am very enthusiastic for the following years :) I mainly worked on modelling part of project. I am very happy to be a member of iGEM team because while I was learning so many things I also had lots of fun. In this competition we are in charge of project and I think that is very important. iGEM is also a very important opportunity to learn how to overcome obstacles during a study and how to be a team.

Hong_Kong-CUHK,2017,Team:Hong Kong-CUHK#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Ts), can only identify influenza A viruses but cannot subtype it (14). Traditional influenza A subtyping method rely on qRT-PCR (15). Although the technique is highly sensitive and specific (16), it is not suitable to be relied on during the spread of disease, since it requires a long period of time, and cannot perform in poor condition where expensive equipment and technical expertise are not available. Failure of immediate respond to the spread of disease may result in pandemic (17). Meanwhile, a novel type of riboswitch, namely toehold switch, shows its potential in detecting viral RNA on-site with short detection time and low production cost.
RNA toehold switches
The artificial RNA biosensors that we use is called a toehold switch, which is first developed and published in 2014 by Green et al. (18). It is a motif in mRNA that allows the translation of downstream protein coding sequence when a specific trigger RNA binds to it. The trigger RNA binds to the switch at the toehold domain and removes the secondary structures of the switch. Then the Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) is released from the loop, which allows ribosome binding. Ribosomes can then read along the coding region of the toehold switch, and hence giving off a signal. (To know the exact structure of RNA toehold switch we used, please visit our modelling page )
Cell free system
Cell free system is a mixture of cytoplasmic and nuclear components from E. coli for in vitro transcription and translation (19). Recent studies revealed that cell free system can be stored at room temperature after freeze drying (19). Activation of the freeze dried synthetic genetic network can be done by adding water. It has also been demonstrated that complicated genetic network can function on a paper with cell free system (19). Our toehold switch technology will be combined with cell free system to allow on-site detection for influenza A. It has a high potential to be used widely in, but not limited to animal farms and border inspections wherever expertise and laboratory equipments are not readily available. Recent findings showed that toehold switches can be used to detect Zika virus and Ebola virus (19, 20). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the up-to-date research has shown that toehold switch can be used to subtype Influenza A while existing technology shows limited advantages on Influenza A diagnosis.
Altogether, the project aims to apply toehold switch technology in influenza A subtyping and offer a more convenient tool to facilitate the design of toehold switches. We hope that our"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," our coordinators (Prof. Dr. Johan Robben and Dr. Veerle De Wever). We also invited different PhD students, professors, ex-iGEMers and people from the industrial sector to our brainstorm sessions. They have a lot more knowledge about the specific topics and could help us greatly with our decisions. Once the project was in progress, we also contacted a lot of people with questions about the possibilities. For instance we talked to the company Perseus (Partner in Regulatory and Safety Services) to discuss the possible hurdles we would face and which safety aspects we need to incorporate. All these people had another view on our project and helped us taking into account different issues about the safety of our project: the molecules that our bacteria will produce, release into the environment, etc ...
Environmental safety
If our project would be used outside the laboratory, many parameters would need to be determined. As stated earlier, the pheromones produced by the BanAphids are not harmful for our health unless available in high concentrations. So if the BanAphids would be spread across acres of land, the concentration of pheromones could attain a high level. The ceiling of this production would need to be determined to see whether it could be a harmful concentration for our health. Insects however do not need as high of a concentration as humans do to develop a reaction. Therefore the disruption of the ecosystem would need to be considered as well. As with most products released in the environment, its bioaccumulation needs to be at a minimum.
(Norcal)
Bacterial safety
In all our experiments, we used non-pathogenic E. coli strains. These strains are not harmful for humans, except when they are inhaled or swallowed. The chemicals that are produced by our genetically modified E. coli strain are natural molecules and are not harmful for the environment. An accidental release of our bacteria into the environment could have unexpected effects on the ecological balance. As suggested by Moe-Behrens et al., 2013, containment through engineered auxotrophy so that BanAphids are unable to synthesise an essential compound required for their survival, is the most reliable method currently for biocontainment. We also believe that providing a bacterium with an advantage eg. antibiotic resistance, provides bacteria with the opportunity to mutate into even stronger bacteria. We therefore propose the use of a tryptophan auxotrophic bacterium.
In the second model we have designed, the bacterium would be free in the environment and thus not contained in an enclosed container with medium. Therefore, an auxotrophic mechanism would not be applicable."

Fasih Ahsan | Junior | MIMG & Bioinformatics
[Why iGEM?] I am truly fascinated by our ever-growing ability to harness the power of biology and shape it for our own uses and designs.  Being a part of iGEM opens the door to independently exploring and discovering new paradigms of synthetic biology.  I am thrilled to begin unearthing these hidden secrets with UCLA iGEM!
[Favorite Hot Sauce?] Sriracha mixed with Cholula and a couple drops of Tapatio!
Phillip Nguyen | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity,diversity, and autonomy. Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones. Being that it is primarily undergraduate, I have the impression that everyone has a bigger voice in project directions compared to a conventional university lab.
[Favorite Molecule?] Phosphatidyl Choline
Kane Nania | Junior | Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
[Why iGEM?] The idea that we can engineer life to do practically anything, the idea that that we can abstract this engineering through iGEM and the standardization of genetic parts, is pretty awesome. The potential of synthetic biology is massive and I want to be a part of that.
[Favorite Hairstyle?] Bald with a mullet. Preferably if they have a beard which connects with the mullet. Preferably yet if the beard is of the chinstrap flavour.
Andy Wang | Junior | Biology
[Why iGEM?] What I most enjoy about iGEM is the process of conceptualization and creation—specifically, extracting scientific knowledge and applying it to innovate a potentially useful product. I would like to explore how to functionalize silk as a potential drug delivery system, and learn more about the techniques that can be developed to study this subject.
[Favorite Sport?] My favorite sport is cycling because I find it soothing yet exhilarating to ride along the coastline on weekends, enjoying California’s beautiful weather and scenery.

Hi there! I am a Biotechnologist about to start a PhD in systems biology and ""-omics""-based approaches to bioremediation.
I was trapped by iGEM (and SB in general) 3 years ago, when I was part of the iGEM 2009 Valencia  Team .      Now, I'm very happy to repeat such an amazing experience as advisor.
The thing I like the most (apart from working in the lab, of course...) is travelling and meeting people from other countries, so I hope to see you in Amsterdam and Boston!
Alejandro Vignoni
I'm an Electronic Eng. and I'm doing my PhD in Control Systems oriented to Synthetic Biology.
I play Guitar as hobby (although I studied almost all my life) and I like      traveling, biking, swimming, rock climbing, yoga, taking pictures and many things more...!!!.
I was iGEMer in 2010, and now I'm back as Advisor, so it seems iGEM is      something good, what do you think?
but I don't have time to fight Entropy... Take a look to my iGEM2010 user page or      to my web page.

The plasmid provides also to constitutively generate the GFP and host a kanamycin resistance.
Generation of: PromLasI - RBS - Glucosidase - terminator
To build up this plasmid we used the following parts:
-Promoter Las I BBa_R0079 - 157 bp
-RBS BBa_J15001 + Glucosidase BBa_K392008 composite Biobrick - 1681 bp
-Terminator BBa_B0015 - 129 bp
The double terminator BioBrick (BBa_B0015) has been resuspended and then amplified through transformation into DH5α competent cells. The plasmid was then extracted and digested (EcoRI/XbaI). The RFC10 compatible RBS-Glucosidase plasmid (BBa_J15001 + BBa_K392008), a gift from Dr. C. French (University of Edinburgh), was transformed into DH5α, extracted and digested (EcoRI/SpeI). The glucosidase was then ligated inside the BBa_B0015 vector and transformed into DH5α. The transformed colonies were screened with colony PCR (primers: Vf and Vr2), using the following protocol: 93° 5' | 30x(95° 30"" | 50° 30"" | 72° 60"") | 72° 7' | 4° ∞ As seen with other constructs, the first ligation made with the constitutive promoter was not successful: the DNA sequencing confirmed that. The construct was then built again from the beginning.
Unlike PromTraI-Glucosidase, the EcoRI/XbaI-digested RBS-glucosidase-terminator vector was ligated with PromLasI, previously cut with EcoRI/SpeI. Different ligation strategies were attempted and later DH5α were transformed. We then performed a colony PCR with the following protocol (PromTrFw and PromTraRev): 93° 5' | 30x(95° 30"" | 50° 30"" | 72° 70"") | 72° 7' | 4° ∞ Positive colonies were expanded and their plasmids extracted.                                 We then proceeded with the quality control: the plasmid was control-digested with EcoRI/PstI and checked on gel electrophoresis, showing the expected pattern with"
Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Results#Operon_-_-_TEXT.html,"6, DH5α cells were transformed and in plates 7-8 TOP10 cells were transformed (Figure 18). Dpn1 digestion had been implemented. This resulted in over 40 colonies on each plate for DH5α and 2-3 colonies of TOP10 transformed cells on each plate. Following the same procedure as before; plasmids were extracted from 8 colonies, however only the 2 kb backbone was present following analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 19).
Figure 19. Agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmids extracted from transformants where Dpn1 had been used in the preparation of the Gibson assembly mix, subsequently used for transformation. 2 kb bands can be observed corresponding to the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone.
Results
Conclusions
Two colonies obtained through transformation using a Gibson assembly of the naringenin operon, were found to contain a 7 kb plasmid. This corresponded to the size of the operon and pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. However, sequencing of these two plasmids did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm their correct assembly. Future experimentation should attempt to assemble the gBlocks one by one into the plasmid backbone and gain sequencing results that show full alignment. Following this, BL21 expression cells should be transformed with the 7 kb plasmid to produce naringenin. This would be extracted using ethyl acetate and analysed using HPLC. HPLC should be conducted using a series of known naringenin concentrations to create a standard curve. Following successful assembly of the operon under constitutive expression, Q5 site directed mutagenesis could be used to replace the J23100 promoter with the inducible T7 promoter. The same method could also be used to introduce the BG51 and BG28 promoters, suggested by the naringenin biosynthesis pathway modelling. This construct could be introduced into the chassis organism Pseudomonas sp.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test999999_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM Uppsala has had a close collaboration with iGEM Stockholm (from KTH), something that is very advantageous to sustain due to the similarities between the teams, not to mention the geographical distance. This year we have two social events planned with the teams, one in Uppsala and one in Stockholm. In addition we have the panel discussion which has been previously mentioned. This year we hope to get the team of Lund Technical University involved as well.
Aalto Hensinki
New for this year is the WIKI and graphical design collaboration with Aalto Helsinki, where a common SLACK channel has been set up for close communication between the members responsible for the WIKI and graphical design in respective team.
Nordic iGEM Collaboration
iGEM Uppsala 2018, also participates in a common SLACK workspace for the project manager of each Nordic team, something that has been proven to be very useful in the sense of advice and support from people in the same position. Besides an easy way for direct communication, this year iGEM Uppsala has participated both in the Biobrick Tutorial Weekend arranged by the Technical University of Denmark and the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund. Both events have been very useful and fun, socially and practically. In summary, both events proved to be wonderful opportunities to connect with other nordic teams.
Another collaboration that we are planning on with other iGEM contacts is a webinar later this summer. This would give us the chance to train in presenting our projects as well as share our experiences from working on iGEM. The general public would have access to the webinar as well.

Collaboration
We have collaborated with iGEM Paris Bettencourt 2011 by sending them videos of the debate that we have organised with the participants of our test, made to evaluate the impact of our educational flyers.
During this debate our participants explained and gave their point of view about: What the synthetic biology evokes for them?
In return, their collaboration is to repeat the same test of our evaluation flyers with a large number of students in Paris.
The Quiz conditions were similar to those of the Quiz in Grenoble except that for practical reasons, we prepared a numerical answer grid that we sent to Paris team.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," big part of many daily routines. Biodegradable plastic, produced by E.coli, has a huge potential, because it can possibly replace conventional plastic. The main thing that withholds this from happening, is the price. PHB is today far too expensive compared to the traditional production. Nevertheless further improvement in mass production of biodegradable plastic offers a wide spectrum of usage, e.g. in the agricultural and horticultural sector, for food, medicine packaging and much more "" PlasticsEurope "" . Hopefully, this breakthrough will happen within the next 10-20 years and thereby change the plastic market drastically. The price of one kilo Polystyrene (used commonly in today’s tableware) is between 0.50-1.29€ "" Plasticker"" . PHB’s price is however, very high at the moment. A price around 1.5 - 2€ pr/kilo may rise the interest of PHB for future investors.
Our contact with several plastic companies gave us hope for this to happen, but they also pointed out, that it is the customers that should be convinced if they were going to implement PHB in their company.
Ideas from high school students ( Top )
We asked the students to imagine how our project would be incorporated in 50, 100 and 150 years in our everyday lives. They were especially very interested in the future prospects of bacteriocins. Some of their ideas are presented here.
50 years
Bacto-Aid can prevent scar tissue creation
it will be possible to buy Bacto-Aid at the local pharmacy and grocery stores. Hospitals will use it and it will be a part of people’s first aid kit
Bacto-Aid will be in spray form
Bacto-Aid can treat people with psoriasis
100 years
bacteriocins could be a composite of makeup, shampoos and creams to prevent infections
bacteriocins could be applied on door handles to prevent bacteria to spread
disinfection gels will contain bacteriocins. Hans Jørn Kolmos also told us that resistance towards disinfection gels has become more common. We are therefore obliged to invent a new alternative
Bacto-Aid can now be bought as a cream and in a tablet form. The tablet will be able to cure internal infections
the bacteriocins will be incorporated in bedclothes
apply bacteriocins in chewing gum
Bacto-Aid as a special bandage for people with amputated bodies

To estimate the number of cells calculate the CFU/mL using this formula:
CFU/ml = (# colonies counted)*(dilution factor)/(mL of culture plated)
10. FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENTS TO TEST PROTEIN EXPRESSION
Follow the same protocol used for growth characterization.
After induction leave the cells at 37C for 4 hours (or desired amount of time).
Take a 1.5 mL aliquot of the uninduced and of the induced culture every hour to measure fluorescence intensity.
Spin down the sample at 4000 RPM for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 1.5 mL of PBS. Place the sample in a cuvette and take a fluorescence spectrum using proper excitation wavelength (i.e. GFP 485 nm)
Leave the sample at 4C O/N to allow proper folding of GFP. The day after measure again the fluorescence.
11. NINHYDRIN ASSAY
To test for the presence of cysteine we used a modified version of the Gaitonde test (Biochem. J., 1967, 104, 627).
Prepare a Ninhydrin stock solution by dissolving 250mg of ninhydrin and 10ml of a solution composed by glacial acetic acid (60%) and HCl (40%). Vortex the reagent until complete solubilization. The stock solution should be made fresh each time.
Mix 500µl of ninhydrin reagent 500µl glacial acetic acid and 500µL of the culture sample to be tested.
Leave the solution in a 90°C bath for 10 minutes and wait for color development.
Measure absorbance with a UV/VIS spectrophotometer between 600nm and 400nm. Maximum absorbance peak for cysteine is at 560 nm.
A standard curve for quantification is built with cysteine in a concentration range between 0 and 0.5 mM.

plasmid 3
This plasmid is for confirming the new concept, terminatome, works or not if the promoter is changed to ADH1 promoter. We chose 3 terminators for this experiment, RPL15At, PGK1t and GIC1t. As GIC1t includes Spe1 restriction site, we did not submit this part. The alignment of RPL15At and GLC1t is here . By measuring FI of GFP in each transformant, the strength of terminators was anticipated to be decided easily like interlab .

Plasmid construction
This year we submitted 3 basic parts, 2 terminators and 1 promoter, and 2 composite parts. Here, we show how we constructed these parts.
To construct plasmid 3, we amplified 3 terminators from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We designed  primers below to perform PCR.

We utilized Prime STAR max DNA polymerase(Takara bio,  Otsu, Japan) and amplified the region following the protocol of the polymerase. The picture below is the result of PCR. We confirmed all terminators were amplified as expected.
To clone HXT3 promoter and kozak sequence, we used IDT free synthesis service of gBlock. Here we cloned two kinds of artificial genes to construct plasmid 2. As usual part, this two sequences include prefix and suffix. A-ko stands for ADH1 promoter-kodak sequence-SF-GFP alignment. H-an stands for HXT3 promoter and antisense-GFP.

Vacuum was applied until all liquid residues were drawn through the column. Afterwards 750 μl buffer PE were added to wash the column and vacuum applied. Te remove residual wash buffer the QIAquick column was put into the provided 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). The MinElute column was placed into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20 ml water (55°C) were added toe the center to elute the DNA. After 1 minute incubation the tube containing the column was centrifuged for 1 minute. The microcentrifuge tube now contained the eluted DNA.
Plasmid-DNA isolation
Miniprep
Plasmids were isolated by the use of the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit. According to the instructions included, all necessary solutions were prepared and steps conducted. First, overnight cultures (1-2 ml) have been pelleted by centrifugation at >8000 rpm
(6800 x g) for 3 min at room temperature (15–25°C). Supernatant was discarded and pellet resuspended in 250 μl (procedure 2: 200 μl) buffer P1 in a microcentrifuge tube. Afterwards 250 μl (procedure 2: 400 μl) Buffer P2 were added and the tube inverted 4-6 times to mix the solution until it became clear. The sample was lysed for 2-3 minutes before adding 350 μl (procedure 2: 300 μl) buffer N3 and inverting the whole solution 4-6 times. Following the neutralization, the sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. Supernatant was decanted to a QIAprep spin column and vacuum applied to the manifold until the solution was drawn through the column. To wash the column 500 μl Buffer PB were added and again vacuum applied. In addition the QIAprep spin column was washed by adding 750 μl Buffer PE and applying vacuum. To remove residual wash Buffer the column was transfered to a collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min. Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20-30 μl water (heated up to 55°C"

20th October 2011, 7-9pm, Dana Centre, London
Team E.coili presents: Machine or life: a paradigm of synthetic biology
Showcasing existing collaborative and interdisciplinary practice across the arts and sciences helps to provide new thought in both fields. Our exhibition will provide stimulation and thought provocation in new directions that otherwise would not be accessed through only discussion and debate.
We have investigated how iGEM as a paradigmatic phenomenon is influencing the culture of scientific research and the implications this has for the world ‘external’ to science. Through a showcase of art works and film we aim to provoke thoughtful reflection in a broad audience. This reflection will culminate in a question and answer session and the opportunity for visitors to record personal reflections on video. The art will provide a basis for new ways to examine the social cultural and ethical impact of synthetic biology, the event will have two main themes; Garage biology and the language of synthetic biology.
The ‘garage biology’ movement that has arisen alongside synthetic biology demonstrates that science is breaking from the confines of the lab, and in the future this may have a democratising effect on scientific discovery. Equally the ‘garage biology’ movement has caused concern about security and related ethical issues; such concerns have been amplified as synthetic biology has grown up in a post 9/11 culture of securitisation. Our exhibition will allow the audience to consider both the positive and negative implications of garage biology as a movement and indeed we will consider if there is a ‘garage biology movement’ at all.
The social and cultural effects of language used in science communication are key in forging perceptions. Specific sets of language are used within MIT’s synthetic biology that often describe life using mechanical words. These words are a legacy of synthetic biology’s close association with engineering. Are we experiencing the reductionism of life on a similar scale to that seen in the enlightenment? If so, should we expect reaction on a par with the romanticists? In fact, if we are experiencing such similarity in historical paradigm of thinking, can we learn from the lessons of the past? Is due consideration for the outward image of science being applied? Finally after exploring the intricacies of such linguistic subtleties from a historical and societal perspective we will be able to make an informed answer to the question: Are we really considering the lessons of the past to inform"
