Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Given that the sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies is an emerging technology, errors in sequencing do occur. To overcome this, and to make our approach much more accurate, our two pronged-solution includes highly specific detection based on antibody recognition. Overall, we have successfully generated an approach that is robust in the detection and identification of potentially harmful pathogens which is generalizable to a multitude of situations around the world.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," biology, a discussion began between the students with what a possible project could be. No ideas were too “out there” and Tenna, Lina, and Jacob tried to develop on the ideas and illuminate the feasible aspects of them.
Of course, it should not be too heavy for the fleeting minds of 9th graders, so we not only made sure to keep it interactive, with questions for the audience, but we also held a fun Kahoot quiz where the students’ listening skills were put to the test. To keep them on their toes a question about Fortnite and Shawn Mendes was thrown into the mix.
The students were thrilled and the teachers all agreed that they would like this to be an annual event with the future DTU iGEM teams.
After the success at the first school, interest grew among other schools. After a short period we were in contact with Lina’s old school, Sankt Annæ song-school as well as the private school Skt. Knud Lavard, near DTU.
It was great to see that it was not only the teachers we had inspired but also a lot of the students since some since then, have decided to learn more about synthetic biology and its role in society. Inspired, a group of three boys from Sankt Annæ approached Tenna and Lina for help answering questions for their final project in ninth grade where they had decided to work on the ethical aspects of GMO.
At the end of the iGEM-project, we had visited three schools and had plans to visit one more school.
It was an overall great learning experience for us and we were all extremely pleased having had the possibility of establishing this project. Being at university-level, it can be hard to remember what is interesting to elementary schoolers. Many of the pupils surprised us with great ideas and pre-knowledge of biotechnology and it was a great learning experience in compiling an appropriate presentation for your audience.

The bands this time were clearer to see, whereas still there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, we searched the internet and reviewed some literatures of a reliable protocol for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected we processed the experiment the third time.
Fig. 1.3 SDS-PAGE of extracted membrane proteins
Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); lane 2-4, the sediment of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the second time; Lane 5-7, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the second time; Lane 8-10, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the first time. Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.
From this result we can conclude that there were some differences between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed these differences had nothing to do with our objective product. So it came out that we failed another time.

Therefore, it’s a pity that we failed to detect those two proteins, but we were able to give some opinions to BIT-China about this detection through our experience:

Key Partnership
We have to establish several key partnerships with multiple parties. First of all, the suppliers of raw materials can be considered as important key partners. Among them there are, for example, companies that deliver the required mediums, nutrients, etc. With those companies we will have a buyer-supplier relationship, motivated by a need to acquire key resources. Another key partnership is with the suppliers of production equipment (reactors). With these companies there will be a longtime relationship. For example, a service contract could make them responsible for irregularities, while we guarantee them mondly revenues. It is important to analyze which companies are irreplaceable. For example, are there companies that produce a specific raw material that is only produced by them?. In that case, we are very depending on that specific partner and this could be a risk. When the company, for instance, is not able to deliver the products or even goes bankrupt this can result in production problems. Therefore, it is important to analyze those possible risks and, if possible, to find alternatives in order to reduce them.
Key Activities
The company has two possible main activities, the manufacturing of the MLAs or being a licensor of the MLAs. As manufacturer we will produce the MLAs and sell them to a specific- or multiple different solar panel manufacturers. It is important that the production pathway of the company, and the final product is adapted to the solar panel companies. As producer we have to decide what production process we will be using and decide on the right technologies, machines, inventory management system, etc. Furthermore, we have to think about aspects such as the right production capacity, quality, cost control, etc.
A second option is to be a licensor. Then, an external party will get permission to produce their own biologically MLAs. A solar panel manufacturer could for example prefer to produce the MLAs by themselves, instead of buying them from us. As licensor you have to think in detail about the legal aspects of your further licensor/licensee relationship.
Key Resources
It is important that we patent our product to ensure the exclusive right to produce and sell it. The intellectual resources are therefore the"

2. Tests for uptake of bacteria into roots
Wednesday, 3 August 2011
One important part of our project is uptake of our bacteria into plant roots. The observation that this occurs (albeit under controlled lab settings) is new and was only published last year. We attempted to replicate these findings.
In preparation, we met with Dr Martin Spitaler who advised us on how to prepare samples for the confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy is much more precise than conventional light field microscopy as it eliminates background light by focusing the laser through a pinhole (Mark Scott, oral communication). The confocal microscopy will focus on imaging GFP expressing bacteria inside Arabidopsis roots to show that uptake of the bacteria takes place.
Staining of wt roots with DiD, a lipophilic dye that stains the plant membranes and does not interfere with the absorption or emission spectra of GFP and Dendra, was unsuccessful. However, natural fluorescence was measured in a root in a spectrum that does not interfere with measuring GFP. We should therefore not need to dye the roots before imaging.
Stack of wt Arabidopsis root. The root can be imaged at around 488nm. Imaging carried out by Dr Martin Spitaler.
We may also try to stain the roots with propidium iodide, which is also a strong indicator of cell wall break down.
Thursday, 4 August 2011
We prepared the GFP-expressing bacteria for plant infection. They were spun down and media was exchanged prior to incubation at 37°C to reach exponential phase. Bacteria were then spun down and resuspended in wash buffer (5mM MES) to reach OD 30. 8ml, 4ml and 2ml were added to separate flasks, containing 100ml of half-MS media each. 4ml and 6ml of wash buffer were added to the flasks containing 4ml and 2ml bacteria, respectively. 8ml of wash buffer was added to the negative control. Ten Arabidopsis seedlings were distributed into each of the flasks. Incubation was carried out for 15 hours prior to imaging.

This shows that the activity of the lambda promoter does increase when the temperature is shifted up, so the thermoinducible construct ( BBa_K098995 ) does become activated by higher temperatures.

The efficiency of PiggyBac transposon system ranged from 2% for one transposon to 0.5% for five transposons [1] . Consequently, it’s quite possible for us to screen out the cells with single or low copies of Neomycin-loxp.
In practical experiments, we totally test 18 different single colony genomes. The lowest copy number of those selected CHO-K1 cell transfected with Neomycin-loxp is around 4, which was not good enough. The reason may be that the designed primer was not so satisfying. Also, the contamination during real-time PCR was hard to avoid. To get cells with single copy of Neomycin-loxp, we still need to design better primers as well as paying attention to the experiment operations.
3. Transfect the cells with mutated TRPC5 by Cre-loxp system
After we’ve selected the CHO-K1 cell transfected with single copy of NeoLoxp, we could transfect mutated TRPC5 into the cell’s genomic DNA using Cre-Loxp recombination system. Then we would use fluorescence activated cell sorting(FACS) to select the cells with high intensity of GFP after long term stimulation. To realize high-throughput screening, we designed a device as shown in the figure below. Cells are seeded at the larger area side of the bottle, and the bottle is fixed above vortex through a holder and foam. Then we are going to place this device in cell culture incubator with vortex running for 20 hours, to fulfill long term mechanical force stimulation.

After the first round of mutation and screening, we still need to continue mutation based on the previous result. We will extract genomic DNA of the screened-out CHO-K1 cell, performing"

UCL,2016,Team:UCLouvain#Experimental_-_-_TEXT.html," a sequence including only histidine codons for heavily degenerated primers. The figure 3 illustrates the effective design of lightly degenerated primer for our first library (Library 1 on figure 2).
In comparison to a fully randomized mutagenesis approach, our “semi-rational targeted mutagenesis approach”, as we decided to call it, should proportionally yield a lot more valuable mutants. We haven’t seen any project using this kind of approach and we wanted to show that, even in a short amount of time, random mutagenesis can be a wonderful tool for synthetic biologists. It is, as we found, a very interesting way to work on protein design problems.
Once the libraries were created, all we needed was a strong selection design and the time to reduce our diversity down to a few mutants that would fit our needs.
Figure 3: Design of the degenerated primers
Selection method
Our selection method was based on the work of Spagnuolo et al. (2010) as explained in the background section of this wiki. Its particularity resides in the fact that through two different selective growth media we’re able to select the open phenotype on one hand and the closed one on the other hand.
Selection of the open phenotype is achieved with a minimal media, containing maltose sugars of polymerization degree 4 through 6 as sole carbon source in a ΔLamB strain of E. coli.
Selection of the closed phenotype on the other hand is achieved on regular LB Growth medium with vancomycin.
To select an inducible opening or closing of the porin, we compared viability on the two previously mentioned media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+). If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it possibly contains a porin for which the gate opening or closing is regulated by Zn2+ or Ni2+. The mutants selected through this step should be further investigated and characterized.
These successive steps of selection are illustrated on figure 4.

Here is our selection process in a table form:

Bio-policy in China
Synthetic biology is one the most dynamic field in Life Sciences not only all over the world, but also in China. Except the teams participated in iGEM, other scientific organization mostly are supported by the governments. It is also among the 22 key strategic technologies in Innovation 2050: Technology revolution and the future of China. (CAS roadmap, 2007) It brings us opportunity to solve environment and health problems, but also brings us potential risks to us. In bio-policy part, we investigated the existing effective regulations in China, interviewed law expert Mr. Wang and gave our suggestions.
1. Review of Biosafety Regulations
Regulation is a complex concept in China, which includes laws, administrative laws and regulations, judicial explanations, industry regulations. This part will give deep discussion on how they regulate researchers ‘actions in China and the insufficient of them.
Biosafety is an old topic for America and a young one for China. It originated between 1950s and 1960s in America. (Qi, 2006) People pay attention to it because they want to reduce the accidents among labs. In 1984, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) published Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories and it became guidance document in America soon. It even became popular around the world.
However, Chinese realized the importance of biosafety later than that. In December, 1993, State Science and Technology Commission promulgated genetic engineering safety regulation, but the second article restricted the scope of genetic engineering within ""directly inducing heterology DNA"".
Legislation process is slow, but the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS) triggered people and administrators’ attention in 2013 and speed up the legislation process, because some of the researchers were affected with it. (Yang, 2006).

We built the whole xylose metabolism in our engineered E. coli,                                              which help us calculate the rate of xylose will go into CO2 utilization bypass.                                              The result of this model shows that CO2 uptake affect the production of pyruvate.                                              We can confirm that our engineered E. coli successfully uptake CO2 while the increase rate of pyruvate production followed the experiment data.                                              To see"
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with killer gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

Before baking:
After 4 hours and 40 minutes:
31/7/2018
Baking of boxes: Ice tray taken out after being baked at 100°C for roughly one hour.
Small bricks: New ice tray inoculated with spores suspension. Same method as last time. Incubated in fridge at 4°C.
2/8/2018
Death test: After baking we need to make sure the mycelia in the bricks are actually dead. That's what we're doing here.  For the large bricks: Tape is touched onto brick to catch potentially alive mycelia or spores and touched onto plate afterwards.  For the small bricks: Blue inoculation needles are touched onto the brick and inoculated on plates according to marks from 20/07.
Test of contamination found in boxes: Turned out to be nothing of interest.
3/8/2018
Baking of boxes: As the large boxes from 20/07 had been unprotected while they were in the office (after their baking) spores from the office may have landed on them and started growing. They are baked again at 100°C for two and a half hours.
Death test: Another death test in which the small bricks are broken in half and the inside is touched slightly on a PDA plate to see if the inside is dead as well.
Drylab Overview
This week Mathias returned and Hannah went on holiday. The DIY hydraulic press was completely finished and ready to use. Nicolai restarted the mission architecture and brick design. Mathias reached out to a polymer expert (Mika Torkkeli, Postdoc) to discuss the role of the network structure/interconnectedness in the strength of polymer networks, it was confirmed that the sparse mycelium network could perhaps be analogous to the network structure of vulcanized rubber. But because of the macroscale of the network and the sparseness of the network the effects might be less drastic than those found in rubber. Another challenge was that the only gene that was identified that might increase hyphal fusioning also affected mycelium density negatively. It was deemed to be too uncertain if we could control these effects away and whether or not the effect size would be worth it.

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," coli we chose a cell-free approach for our tissue to prevent contamination of the     environment. This consideration takes into account that cells in the tissue lower the performance of our     azo-dye based muscle as the cells in the tissue will not be contracted but remain as buffer likely     preventing a strong contraction. In the dielectric elastomer actuator tissue the E. coli cells will not     survive the mechanical stress in the tissue, which will rapidly lead to ruptures in the device. A     further aspect to work with a cell-free material is to prevent damage to the material by the bacteria     themselves as they may consume a significant amount of the proteins.
To obtain this cell-free protein material lyses of the E. coli cells is necessary followed by     purification via nickel NTA column chromatography. This procedure leads to pure protein solutions, which     can further be manufactured to the desired tissue.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," last school year with an internship. She was interested in working on our project and with students, and not teachers, because she wanted to have the possibility of asking as many questions as she could without being afraid of a teacher’s judgment. Thanks to iGEM, she is now comfortable with lab experiments and she says herself that the team taught her a lot, and that she really loved working and learning with the team members.
In addition, we have continued a project initiated last year by the Evry Paris-Saclay 2017 team members called “BioLab Evry”. Indeed, we wanted to create an open-lab where people could practice and learn synthetic biology. Genopole, the first biocluster in France, is supporting us in this project and will accommodate it in its own building. We are currently looking for a manager and as soon as we find them, we will be able to open the doors of the lab to the public.
The BioLab has three key objectives: to teach synthetic biology to interested students and to give a new life to our previous iGEM projects by facilitating them to be advanced further by these students. This lab is also dedicated to school teachers who would like to learn from previous iGEM projects and share this knowledge with their students. Finally, It will host the iGEM teams of Evry and it will be a place where iGEM teams from the area will be able to meet and talk. We want this BioLab to be a place where ideas are born and where students and teachers learn from the past projects, to make a new one or to improve one.
OUR INTERVENTION FOR SENIORS FROM 75 TO 86 YEARS OLD
With the iGEM GO Paris-Saclay team , we were at a Seniors’ Residence to speak about synthetic biology, bacteria and medicine. 14 residents came to see us, aged from 75 to 86 years old. A senior even came with her grandson.
While our team presented synthetic biology and iGEM, showing the importance of bacteria and explaining why “the antibiotics are not automatics” (that is a headline from a french campaign against the abusive use of antibiotics), the iGEM GO Paris-Saclay team was in-charge of a presentation on the production of insulin using synthetic biology.
Of the different public groups we met, the Seniors turned out to be the most prejudiced against bacteria and GMOs. They saw bacteria only as bad bugs and thought GMOs were “bad things, only used by the big farmers enterprises”. But we were happy to see that, at the end of"

These meet-ups helped us in two ways. First it was a great opportunity to have a feed-back from our peers. Then, we met there other teams working with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology which conducted us to collaborate with them.
Responsiveness
What did we learn?
On ethics:
Leading a project on fundamental biology involves to work a lot with stakeholders. In a RRI vision, a fundamental project is an opportunity to think about the responsability of science, in our case the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We learned we should follow the principles of RRI to have the strongest connection between innovation and the societal needs.
The we saw that the potentiality of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology was huge. This leads to two things:
It’s very difficult to define precisely what could be the impacts, thus a harder work must be furnished on the subject;
Vulgarisation for the public is a key issue.
The CRISPR-Cas9 technology is easy to use, even by students and has big consequences. We should define the purposes with more rigor and strengthen the safety part.
Using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology requires to know about the gene before we can mutate its functions. This requires to work on genes we already know about or to have a strong research on the gene.
In the ethical field we should always balance the advantages and the disadvantage. Even if it seems obvious, it is fundamental to do this and to present the balance to the public opinion.
On law:
About the law on ethics the CRISPR/Cas9 technology challenges the traditional process-based law and results-based, because when you see the final results you cannot always say if it comes from a natural mutation or from an action of genome editing. About intellectual property we understood that to ways to think about patentability exists and are are strongly opposite. We have either to make a choice about how we see innovation or try to bring those two positions closer.
RRI Test: the answers of the iGEM teams
We asked iGEM teams to fill to our test. 18 teams answered to it, and thus helped us to see how the principles of RRI are respected in the iGEM competition. Their answers gave us new ideas to spread this principles, but also make us thought on how to improve the knowledge of this principles. Firstly, we saw that the RRI principles were not really known among iGEM teams: only 53% of the teams knew what it is.

Столетиями верили алхимики в существование философского камня, таинственной субстанции, способной не только превращать простые металлы в благородные — серебро и золото, но могущей даже исполнить самые дерзновенные желания людей: омоложение и бессмертие.
И хотя философский камень так и не был найден, его поиски побудили алхимиков исследовать в своих лабораториях множество веществ, их взаимодействия, заложив основы фундаментальных знаний, формировавших сегодняшнюю химию, металлургию, фармакологию.
У нас, живущих в двадцать первом столетии с его лихорадочной погоней за знаниями, вера в философский камень увяла. И всё же мы, как и прежде, в поиске решений не только дающих человеку долгую, здоровую жизнь, но и устраняющих экологические проблемы, которые мы создали сами в процессе модернизации. Не в пример прошлому мы верим сегодня, что следует не просто искать магические субстанции, таящиеся где-то в Природе, но скорей вдохновляться ею и давать новые ответы на активные вызовы и запросы нашего общества.

Figure 1 - Rationale behind our AND gate.
Figure 2 - We designed a lactate and iron (Fe2+) AND gate as a way of detecting the contaminated blood. (A) Our biosensor device composed of generators of DtxR (BBa_K2486004) and LldR (BBa_K2486007), a PdtxR inverter based on tetR () and a reporter module with a hybrid promoter regulated by TetR and LldR ().
Once we were able to sucessfuly transform P.  agglomerans with pSB1C3 vector we designed our  detection module inside pSB1C3 plasmid. Our designed plasmid, the pTROJAN, is composed by 4 modules: (1)a DtxR  generator, (2) a LldR generator, (3)a TetR-based DtxR inverter and (4) a  reporter module that processes lactate and Fe2+ presence through our  designed promoter and it's cis-elements.
Figure 3 - The pTROJAN vector, a Fe2+ and Lactate and gate circuit.
We decided to firstly characterize our new promoters and parts before appling our time and resources in the construction of pTROJAN. So we designed 3 devices that would be used to validate our new parts (figure 4).
Figure 4 - Our 3 validation circuits for (1)DtxR system wich works as a Fe2+ biosensor circuit . (2)LldR system wich works as a bionsensor circuit for lactate. (3)TetR system wich works asa biosensor circuit for tetracycline
Figure 5 - BBa_K2486019: The presence of LlldR and lactate affects the circuit as expected, repressing it in the absence of lactate.
Figure 6 - BBa_K2486020: The presence of TetR and tetracycline worked as expected too, sugesting that the part could work with both regulators.
Figure 7 - BBa_K2486021: Promoter activity (GFP/OD600) under different concentrations of Iron Chloride (Fe2+) shows a decrease in promoter activity when (Fe2+) is added to the system, wich is expected by the funciotn mechanism of the regulator. The binding of the DtxR protein to iron enhances it's affinity to the DNA repressing the GFP expression.

Workshop
Part of the iGEM experience is the exchange of information and knowledge between the different teams. Workshops make it possible, by getting together instructors of all the region’s teams and the heads of iGEM. This unique situation allows to provide feedback between the contestants and the organizers, and to improve the competition each year. Also, each team has the chance to give a small talk on their project and see what the others are working on. These meetings are the breeding ground of new ideas and collaborations, so why not organising one ourselves? This way our team’s undergraduates will then have the chance to meet the actual creators of synthetic biology and the heads of other teams.
The European iGEM Workshop was finally hosted in Carmona, a town near Seville, where our university has the infrastructure to held big meetings. The location is provided with near accommodations in a privileged landscape. More than 50 scientists finally assisted and participated in the different talks and discussions, in what constitutes the first meeting of this new biology field in Andalucía, and among the few that have taken place in Spain.

V Original parameter set of the model
VI Results of model
1. Results under original parameter sets:
    As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the response of the warrior. Therefore, from this original parameter set and result, we can see that there is no distinguish between the response of warrior I without with warrior II, so orthogonality is not good. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has high amount of LacI even without warrior II and thus almost no CmR. Therefore, it has no resistance to chloramphenicol and will be killed by itself.
    However, how could this happen? Intuitively, we may hypothesize that TetR actually not inhibit the expression successfully when its expression is activated by C4HSL-RhlR. So we may solve this problem by increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS afterPrhlof TetR in warrior I.
2. Increasing the maximal expression rate of TetR in warrior I
    From the results of the model, we are delighted to see that warrior I just respond when there is warrior II.(Fig.4) Therefore, the orthogonality of gene circuit is satisfied!
    However, if the level of TetR is too high, we will see thatwarrior I cannot respond with or without warrior II.(Fig.5)
    In conclusion, the core is that we can make the gene circuit orthogonal by regulating the TetR level to a moderate level. This can be easily achieved by change the RBS after Prhl of TetR in warrior I.
    According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.

Alternatively, the ligand can be designed using ""Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification"" (SMILES) or manually using tools such as Avogadro , as we did. In the next step, the ligand file is used      to create a conformer ensemble that is in turn used to create a Rosetta parameter (“.params”) file. In addition to the specific names of all atoms present in the ligand, this parameter file also       stores all bonds between the individual atoms, including the binding angles and binding distances. Rosetta cannot generate the conformer ensemble by itself, so an additional tool is needed.        Different tools are capable of creating the conformer ensemble automatically, but it is best to manually define constraints for the chi1, chi2 and backbone psi torsion angles that define the orientation of the ligand in the binding pocket. For this, we know of three tools: The first is OpenEye Omega , but the full license is very costly and the academic free version is hard to obtain.        The second tool is Accelrys Discovery Studio , but Accerlys does not provide a free license. The third tool is TINKER , which is free, but poorly documented and depends on a specific keyfile,        which requires a high amount of chemical expertise to generate. Conformers might also be generated without constrains, for which different tools are available, in our case, we used ConFlex .        Conformers need to be stored in one file (“.sdf”, “.mol”, or “.mol2”).
“.pdb”-file: The input-file for the scaffold, in our case the tRNA synthetase, can be downloaded in PDB format from Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is then necessary to delete the natural ligand from the PDB-file,      as we need to incorporate our own aaRS. Additionally, it is advised to relax the  preferably, the structure should be relaxed in order to allow for flexibility with regards to the simulation outcomes.      For further details, see the ROSETTA Relaxing documentation.
“.cst”-file: The .cst-file defines the potential hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the amino acid. For example, the code block  characterized by the tags “CST::BEGIN” and “CST::END”, specifies the orientation or      catalytic function of the enzyme. More specifically, the first record of the block begins with “TEMPLATE::ATOM_MAP”, followed by either “atom_name” or “atom_type”, depending on whether a specific residue or a specific type of residue is"

Next, EPO (130ng/µl) was added in two different transposome:EPO volume ratios, namely 1:1 and 3:1 in total volume of 10µM. Finally 12.5mM final MgCl2 concentration were added. The samples were incubated at 55°C for 10 minutes and stopped by adding final 1% SDS. The integration products were analysed on 2% TAE agarose gel. The gel was stained with sybersafe and imaged with GelDoc system. The resulting gel is shown on figure 1.

Figure 1 suggested that the staining of the gel was poorly done as bands that was supposed to be present on the first and last lane were not visible. The smear on the rest of the lanes suggested the possible integration of adapter, creating bands of smaller sizes. However, more negative controls should be done to confirm this further.

Wednesday 20th
Apparently we aren't going to get to keep our lab next month, so we had to spend much of today preparing to move to Chris French 's lab.
Thursday 21st
Elize continued work on the film, the presentation team focused on getting a first draft done, and the lab team kept on labbing.
Friday 29th
A practice presentation was given before the rest of the group - reception was cautiously positive. Let's hope the other UK teams agree next week.
We finished off the last official week of lab work by miniprepping out some population control plasmids for an experiment tentatively scheduled for Freshers' week.
Weekend 30th-31st
Saturday was spent splicing together the second version of our film, and editing it in the super advanced Windows Movie Maker.
Rather more excitingly, Sunday was our great expedition. We caught a plane at the break of dawn and arrived in London at 9am. The iGEM meetup wasn't until tomorrow, so we got to spend the day as tourists.
September
September kicked off with an excellent two day conference with the rest of the UK's team. We got to present our project, catch up on what the other British teams had been up to, and generally enjoy London.
But then semester started, lectures returned, and the strain of continuing iGEM amidst all this became considerable. Many of the things we had wanted to do in this time proved impossible.
We did however manage to secure a collaboration with UCL at the end of the month
October
The wiki-freeze loomed, the actual final presentation had to be put together, and writeups had to be completed. Not all the sub-projects got finished, and not all the sleep we might have liked got... slept, but we put what hours in that we could, and achieved a respectable end for our project.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Collaborative Report_-_-_TEXT.html," GMO and if these products were labeled as GMOs, they would still by them. However, they do not consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue than GM food.
On the opposite, the respondents who answered that GMOs are harmful to health and the environment, charts 3 and 4, said they would not trust a product synthesized by a GMO and if these products were labeled as GMOs, they would not by them. However, they do consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue than GM food. This means that they consider drugs have more risk towards health and environment thant GM food.
In between, the rest of the respondents who had a neutral attitude towards GMOs, chart 6, have a balanced position on those questions, saying they do not know if they would trust biologically synthesized adrenaline, most of them would buy products labeled as GMOs and they do not consider biologically synthesized drugs a different issue than GM food. Finally, the majority of all respondents considered it would be best to label GMO products and they already knew that several products are produced by GMOs or are GMOs themselves.
From the results of our survey, we can infer that those who do not consider GMOs as harmful also do not fear them. Considering that a majority of respondents in our survey are students who have a medium (37%) or high (44%) level of knowledge in biology, we can also suggest that those who are educated on that matter do not fear the resulting technologies of that field.
Another survey of public attitudes regarding synthetic biology found that nearly two-thirds of respondents supported continued development of the field, including additional research on its possible effects on humans and the environment [31].  There was a strong correlation between self-reported awareness of synthetic biology and support for ongoing research, as 80% of those who had heard a lot about the field believed it should move forward, compared to only 52% of those who had heard nothing about it. Overall, 73% of those surveyed reported having heard “just a little” or “nothing at all” about synthetic biology. These data indicate both the need for broader public engagement regarding synthetic biology and the positive impact of such efforts on public support for novel technologies.
In another vein, there are oppositions to synthetic biology that come from important areas of religions and ethics. Unlike the debate regarding human embryonic stem cell research, the Catholic Church do not oppose to synthetic biology. Following the publication of the Venter Institute’s paper, an official from the Catholic Church praised the development as “a further mark of man’s great intelligence, which is God’s gift enabling man to better know the created"

User Interface
The UI is an intuitive web application that enables the user to interact with TERRA. The interface is designed so that it takes the necessary experiment information from the user and sends it to the device. The user will enter how many outputs their microfluidic chip has, the flow rate on the microfluidic chip, and properties about the fluid itself (density, continuous vs droplet, etc.). Given this information we are able to use our TERRA droplet predictive model to calculate a dispense time. The user can then select which wells each output should be dispensed into. This information is sent to the Arduino and enters the back-end software components. The video below demonstrates how an experimenter would use the UI.
The UI is able to facilitate communication between the user and TERRA through the use of Peripheral Manager, a daemon that runs on the workstation and facilitates communication between cloud-based applications and hardware connected to the workstation. This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral Manager takes advantage of this protocol for serial communication with the Arduino.
Designing the User Interface
When initially designing TERRA our team knew that we needed some sort of platform for the user to interact with our system. During the designing and testing phases of the individual hardware components, a simple Serial Monitor was enough to communicate data via a microcontroller. However, a Serial Monitor is not an ideal platform for users to interact with devices, so we decided to create a user-friendly web application to use as the user interface for TERRA. In addition to the UI, the website also contains full assembly instructions, component descriptions, and other any other relevant documentation for the user to access. The goal was to create a one-stop website for users to help streamline their experience.
The first step during the UI design process was to plan how it would look and create the static page via HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. The initial design, pictured below, was the first iteration of the UI. On the left side the user would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by"

    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:

SDSZ-China,2017,Team:SDSZ-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,": I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say                         no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.
Q: Yeah. It is indeed very brutal. Well, thanks for your time Mrs. Zhou. We really appreciate                         your help.
A: No problem! Have a good day.
Q: You too.
Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre
To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal                         hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the                         biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with                         the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,                         and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear                         farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After                         this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we                         learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese                         medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine                         hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to                         nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an                         alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent.

Czech_Republic,2015,Team:Czech Republic#Practices#GMO survey_-_-_TEXT.html," the academic field however quite a few people in the public have also gained information about GMO from articles. Most people of the public agree that they have not obtained enough information about GMO to really understand it and make rational decisions about it. On the other hand most academics claim they have obtained enough information.
Almost all academics knew that GMO can be used in more than crops while only half of the public, both in Sweden and in the Czech Republic, knew about this. Generally, people of the public are more reluctant towards using GMOs in food and crops but more positive about using it in medicine, fuel and other materials. Both academics and the public mostly agree that it’s important to do research on the effects of GMO.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Presentation_-_-_TEXT.html,"[Slide: Interviewees - names/pictures]
A number of key themes emerged.
Concerns over the technology - will it work and is it safe?
Concerns over who benefits, and whether anyone is exploited.
Concerns over sustainable sourcing of raw materials for the biorefinies.
One particular issue several people raised was a fear technology such as this would become a tool that rich nations use to clobber the world's poor; for example with crops grown in the Third World only to be shipped off and turned into ethanol or high fructose corn syrup.
However, there was a general acceptance in our interviewees that synthetic biology has a major role to play in humanity's future. But several people warned us against the view that technological problems alone could solve the world's problems.

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#hospitalInterview_-_-_TEXT.html," as we expect, and many people don’t have any public or commercial health insurance. They cannot afford the overwhelming medical fee, so someone has no choice but to wait for death with everyday deterioration. The current therapy do bring patients and their family too much psychological stress and huge financial burden, which worsened the doctor-patient relationship and social turbulence. Thankfully, these patients give us a great trust and encouragement, and they hope we can make it.
Mr. & Mrs. B
Gender: Male
Age: 68
Disease: Myocardial ischemia
Duration: ~5years
Therapeutic regimen: Medication
Gender: Female
Age: 68
Disease: Myocardial ischemia
Duration: ~5years
Therapeutic regimen: Medication
This example proves that although patients are given the same therapeutic regimen, the effect varies from person to person. Dramatically, one couple we interviewed have born on the same day, and they are both 68-year-old. They were even examined suffering from myocardial ischemia at the same time. They both chose medication instead of operation, but the effect divers greatly.
Effective and safe as the imported medicine is, taking for a long time stilcannot avoid a series of untoward effects. Some people can tolerate them while some may have a bad reaction. Therefore, the only way to solve the problem is to change the medicine. It also means that they have to take at least one week to adapt to the new medicine. For instance, the grandma takes Plavix that has a remarkable effect initially to prevent thrombus. However, with the amounts of Plavix accumulating, she appears some bad symptoms such as skin allergies, urine with blood, inflammation of the stomach, vessel hemorrhage and so on.
The grandpa using the same medicine can tolerate the side effects and still takes it regularly now. The grandma also said that she felt uncomfortable, allergic and absent-minded after taking the medicine. But she cannot change the medicine if the symptoms are not serious. She also mentioned that many of them, the old, were always afraid and unwilling to have surgery. They are more willing to take conservative method instead of the risky one. This experience reminds us of a very important thing that is the individual difference. Our project may still face the same question in the future: Can your method be effective to the problem of the majority? Therefore we should do more experiments to prove this question.
In conclusion, like hypertension, cardiovascular disease needs treating by taking medicine for the whole life once it is found. No matter how expensive the medicine is and how uncomfortable and inconvenient he"

Kyoto,2012,Team:Kyoto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," base mismatches between primer and cDNA(Fig.1-1 B). As a result, we could get mutated FT cDNA, which are not cleaved by iGEM restriction enzymes, and then we added prefix and suffix to FT. Finally, we could make new BioBrick parts of FT (Fig.1-1 C).
Fig.1-1
A : Necessity for mutation of FT cDNA. FT sequence had two cleavage sites of iGEM restriction enzymes.
B : Inverse PCR Method
Inverse PCR is a measure of mutating FT gene segment. Inverse direction of primers and designing those including mismatch residue leads to mutation of the original plasmid.
C : Standardization of FT cDNA. We had mutated and added prefix and suffix to FT.
Confirming expression of FT
We constructed the plasmid shown in the Fig.1-2. One was FT gene with T7 promoter ( BBa_I719005 ) and 6His tag, and the other was FT gene only with T7 promoter. T7 promoter is a strong promotor regulated by T7 polymerase. In our strain of E.coli, the expression of T7 polymerase can be induced by IPTG. 6His tag, which is used in later steps, enabled us to purify FT protein from E.coli using affinity chromatography.
We needed to confirm that E. coli can express FT protein, because there was a possibility that E.coli can not translate FT or FT is unstable or toxic in E.coli.
In order to confirm the expression of FT protein, we performed Western blotting using anti-FT antibody.
As a result, we observed FT and 6 His:FT bands at the expected molecular weight region(Fig.1-2).
So we successfuly confirmed the FT expression!
Fig.1-2 Construction of FT generator and the results of Western blotting against FT and 6 His:FT protein
Expression of T7 polymerase is regulated by IPTG. In both of constructions, left lane shows the band NOT induced by IPTG and right lane shows the band induced by IPTG.
We succeeded in  confirming the mutation and the expression of FT and 6 His:FT protein in E.coli!
2.SECRETION
The second step is SECRETION. We want E.coli to secrete FT protein to outside of the cell.
Now our E.coli can produce FT protein, but a big issue still remains:  how they can transport proteins to the outside of the cells? Many people might think cell"
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the concentration of inhibitor decreases further, the killer gene can start to work. Conversely, more inhibitor remains, the killer will be repressed harder. Thus we can say the ""in-promoter"" can have different responses to the inhibitor.
SECOND step: The relationship between the inhibitor and arabinose.
Meanwhile, the concentration of the inhibitor is the most important factor connecting with the ""in-promoter"". So under different concentrations of the arabinose, how can we know the concentration of intracellular inhibitor? In order to make the model simulate the real condition better, we use another circuit to model and combine it with the experimental results to improve it.
We use the same inducible promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor protein and replace the gene locus of inhibitor protein with RFP.
Fig.6 The circuit constructed to find out the relationship of the concentrations of inhibitor and arabinose.
The main reaction is similar with the first part, after adding different concentrations of the arabinose, the AraC protein will combine with the inducer. Then the complex will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the inhibitor. The reaction direction is from the DNA → mRNA → inhibitor protein.
Fig.7 Then the complex of arabinose and AraC protein will combine with the PBAD promoter sequence to positively control the expression of the inhibitor.
According this mechanism, we modeled this circuits to build the relationship between the inhibitor protein and the arabinose. Main considerations in this model are the process of repression, induction, transcription, translation, degradation and catalysis.
The assumptions we made are:
(1) AraC protein is enough to combine with the arabinose.
(2) The concentration of repressor protein will not change while some are combined with the promoter sequence
(3) When the arabinose doesn’t exist, PBAD promoter can be completely silent
The reaction processes of circuit are described as below:
PBAD promoter activity:
And groups of differential equations are:
The initial values and description of variables are:
So we can get the curve describing the relationship between the inhibitor and time under the different concentration of arabinose.
Fig.8 The concentration of inhibitor protein expressed by PBAD promoter changes with time, induced by different concentrations of inducer.
After this, in order to get the relationship between the protein intensity and the concentration of arabinose more intuitive, we also got this curve about the relationship between protein intensity and arabinose when the protein intensity was stable
Fig.9 The concentration of inhibitor expressed by PBAD changes with different concentrations of inducer.
From this curve, we can clearly"

The specific BPA degradation rate per cell qD is about 50 % higher when using the fusion protein compared to the polycistronic bisdAB gene. This results in an average 9 hours faster, complete BPA degradation by E. coli carrying <partinfo>K525517</partinfo> compared to <partinfo>K525512</partinfo> as observed during our cultivations . The fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB improves the BPA degradation by E. coli.
Interpretation of the results
Misfolding seems to be a problem when expressing BisdA and BisdB in E. coli. To reduce this, the cultivation conditions were improved for the BPA degradation with the polycistronic bisdAB gene in E. coli first, compared to the literature ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ). Problems with misfolding of BisdA and BisdB could be reduced by lowering the temperature and growth rate and by using a weaker promoter for expression.
When degrading BPA with E. coli using the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein, both domains (BisdA and BisdB) are active and correctly folded because otherwise there would be no BPA degradation measured and no BPA degradation products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol could be detected, which could definetely be identified via MS-MS. The about 50 % higher specific BPA degradation rate in E. coli expressing BisdA"

-also on this gel picture is the IAA-Gibbson-Assembly of 4.10.17 (band size shpuld be 4kb, is at 4-5kb, but less concentration that shoudl be when comparing with the strange of the 1kb band that also should have 50ng like our IAA-fusion-fragment)
-therefore we repeat th Gibbson-Assembly with of IAA-fusion in pSB4A5 with the two-folde amount of IAA-fusion:
-2,5µl pSB4A5 + 4,54µl IAA for Gibbson + 2,96µl H2O + 10µl Gibbson-Assembly-Mix
- --> 15min at 50°C
-might be that there are more than the IAA-fusion-fragment inside of the sample, beacuse on the gel picture there were 2 bands directly stacked, that would be an explanation why the concentration of our IAA-fusion-fragment is lower than the measurement shows

4. Religion
“Does the commission face opposition from major representing institutions of religions across Europe?”
Religious groups, like any other group in the society, express their views on these topics. The EC is also involved in the debate; the commission has an independent advisory body called ‘European group on Ethics’ (EGE). Its advice has no direct legal impact but nevertheless the EC takes notice of their opinions. This EGE groups 17 people and it’s very trans-disciplinary: it is composed of scientists, ethicists, lawyers, social scientists and people with a religious background.
This body advises on specific developments, with a focus on science and technology. Thy also gave their opinion on synthetic biology called the “Ethics of synthetic biology”.This was actually the first major international document on the Ethics, Legal and Social aspects of synthetic biology. One of the things they asked the commission to do was to stimulate a proper dialogue about this field.
Religious organizations can also voice their opinion via a platform, independent of the EC, for dialogue between different religions. In this way they can participate in European debates and like any societal group they are free to express their voice and raise issues either directly to policy makers or via the media.
5. Do It Yourself Community
The 'do it yourself community' is a new development that is seen now in synthetic biology. It can be said that there is a continuum between biotechnology and synthetic biology from the scientific, policy, legislative, and even from the ethical side. But what is really the new element is the idea of informal networks doing scientific research without any oversight and control.
Biotechnology research is much regulated, much institutionalized, there is a full gamut of bio-safety regulations that labs need to conform. So far we haven’t had any major incident in the field of the life sciences, thanks to this extensive regulations. But nowadays people start to experiment with life in their backyard. Up to this point it seems to be fairly innocent, but the open source nature of synthetic biology can be a dangerous new development. This is really limited but obviously it raises issues about bio-safety and bio-security and it’s not only the innocent amateur that does this. This concern of amateur scientists comes about with the field of synthetic biology and can also be stated back to the GMO area. The idea of having this advanced LEGO to play with raises the question about “What to do with biosafety legislation?” One enters a whole new situation where it will be a big challenge for formal regulation and for policy makers to deal with these concerns.
“How"
Washington,2009,Team:Washington-Software#Challenges_-_-_TEXT.html,"-D Polar Coordinant System can be difficult. Here, any position on or above the well can be described in terms of x, y and z offsets from a fixed origin. In our Model C, the robot is built with three 2-segment robotic arms with 5 physical constants (See the section on Mathematical Modeling ). Trying to determine the 3 angles that Motor 1, 2 and 3 must rotate to position itself to any point in 3-D space is nontrivial. Fortunately, we are able to simplify the reverse triangulation process by repeated application of a 3x3 rotational matrix.
Pneumatic Control and Mutual Exclusion
We use a single pneumatic tubing for 3 different pipette operations: aspirating, dispensing and cleaning. To do this, we developed a 3-way switch which is controlled by one of the motors. We also developed the software to acquire and release mutex (mutual exclusion) and prevent deadlocks.
Master Slave Synchronization
This part is extremely tricky, because of a limitation that is imposed by the hardware. For those of you that are familiar with NXT bricks, you will know that each brick can only be connected to a maximum of 3 motors. For this project, we need to use 6 motors, and hence we have 2 separate NXT bricks, ALPHA and PHI. The two bricks are connected using blue-tooth wireless technology. Implementing the Master Slave Synchronization between the 2 NXT modules using RobotC is quite tricky because RobotC uses a non-intuitive function and because when you attempt two-way communication, messages are lost. In our implementation, ALPHA serves as the Master Module, while PHI is the Slave Module. When ALPHA positions itself correctly at the right well, it will send a message to PHI so that it can perform the appropriate pipette operations like aspirating, dispensing or cleaning.
Robust Design to enable Multiple Plug-and-Play Modules
We want to design the software system to be extremely robust and it is able to work well with different physical implementations. As a proof of concept, we have implemented 2 different physical instances of ALPHA, (ALPHA-120 and ALPHA-90, where the inter-arm angles are 120 and 90 degrees respectively). These are 2 different pipette head assemblies with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. We have also shown that our same software works seamlessly on both instance of ALPHA. We can interchangeably mount either instances of ALPHA on the BETA frame, and it will work (see video here ) A flexible plug-and-play design is extremely important because it enables different iGEM"

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

WHU-China,2014,Team:WHU-China#Footages#team_-_-_TEXT.html," prepared for any kind of challenges. Synthetic biology is a very hot subject these days so I joined WHU-China to learn something about it. I believe it must be a very interesting experience.
Hey guys! I'm Li Yuwenbin from Wuhan University, a team member of Whu-China. My job in our team mainly focuses on proving the function of E7 lysis protein as well as integrating it into our formaldehyde-terminator system, so that those functional enzymes can be secreted out into extracellular space to degrade formaldehyde more efficiently.  Besides biological research, I have a strong passion for various kinds of sports, like cycling, badminton and even x-game. I also have a special taste for music, poems and animation. iGEM jamboree has a lot of fun and it's so great to meet new friends and exchange ideas with each other in the competition. See you guys at MIT^ ^!
Hi there, this is Tianxing Zhai, a student of College of Life Sciences at Wuhan University. As a team member of WHU-China, I was responsible for the functional verification of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (spectrophotometry), some molecular cloning, and other non-experimental activities (e.g. ordering uniforms and badges). I am interested in making science more interesting and more widespread. If you and I are like-minded, please contact me. My Email is txzhai@whu.edu.cn.
Hi, I'm Bei Liu. I was in the lab of proteomics in Wuhan University. I did some experiments of biochemistry in the early stage. I also helped Haoyuan in organizing the team and putting up some ideas. Besides synthetic biology, I'm also interested in proteomics and neurogenesis. Now I'm doing an internship in UT Southwestern medical center in Dallas. It is really cool to participate in the giant jamboree in Boston, because Dallas is just like a large valley, while Boston is the true Big City. I hope I could spend some time visiting the city in the spare time during the jamboree.
I am Yao Chen, I still remember the first time I knew something nabout iGEM when I was a freshman, my classmate joined this team whereas I could only listen to his proud talking. Until last November I participated in the iGEM team for my dream. We experienced the hard Saturday night brainstorming and staying up late for presentation of our project and finally our sub-team project became the only project in the team. First I even could not understand what we would do but thanks for the"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"_K1315002 (rpfC)
This is the coding sequence for the RpfC (regulation of pathogenicity factor C) protein. It is the sensor in the two-component signal transduction system of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris that activates the regulator RpfG (BBa_K1315003) in the presence of DSF (diffusible signal factor). RpfC eventually leads to the activation of the manA promoter (BBa_K1315006).
Usage and Biology
Quorum sensing and bacterial cell signalling are mechanisms known to be utilised by bacteria to regulate their virulence. The RpfC-RpfG sensory system has been found to activate the production of virulence factors like extracellular enzymes and polysaccharides in Xanthomonas campestris. It has been also suggested that this system is involved in linking environmental stimuli, including DSF, with pathogenicity in Xanthomonas campestris. DSF is a cis-unsaturated fatty acid from the DSF family. The RpfC-RpfG two-component system is the most well understood one and is present in all Xanthomonads.

A Collaboration: Ivy Tech Improvement of Wheat Germ DNA Extraction Lab
This is the first year that IvyTech from South Bend, IN has an iGEM team! The team reached out to Carnegie Mellon University in order to collaborate with us and help us out in any way that we needed. Since school had started up, the outreach duo could not take the time to experiment with dyes we wanted to incorporate into the wheat germ experiment if only for the simple reason that we wanted the DNA that kids can visualize at the end to contrast more against the solution in the tube. Sending out one of the kits to IvyTech was a brilliant way to get results, have another team help, and encourage camaraderie. IvyTech was able to tell us whether the dye should be added before or after the isopropyl alcohol, as well as give us different color examples and the concentration amount needed to achieve the desired effect. The results looked great and we were able to confirm that we want to include dyes in the kits for visual aide and how high the concentration would have to be in order to get the optimal visual. Now, whenever a wheat germ kit is being borrowed from DNAZone, a pro-mega (blue and orange) or methyl orange dye will be included in the teacher’s kit to give to the students should she or he wish to do so. Thanks IvyTech!

Materials and chemicals keep appearing in big cardboard boxes full of styro-foam pieces (we're storing it all in the hopes of filling a bath next month and having some fun).
More good news: our transformed cultures have grown as expected, as have the B. subtilis strains. At the end of the day we make inoculums of them all so that they grow o/n and tomorrow we can freeze samples and do yet more mini-preps (we have only just started and we're already sick and tired of that kit...)
We need to discuss which assembling method we'll use with the BioBricks. It takes us some hours, and in the meantime, Andrés faces the personal challenge of making competent cells from the DH5-a inoculum with the new protocol. Tomorrow we'll see who has won the battle...
And Pedro isn't wasting any time at all, he's just found out these racks are stackable, like Lego. This discovery has changed his life, look how happy he is!
After deciding how we'll build each BioBrick, and counting all the ligations we need to do, we finally tackle the digestions with the different restriction enzymes. Mastermix kits this time. More protocols. GREAT.

June 15: Our first interview
This morning, we had an interview with a professor about the electronic lab notebook. We interviewed Christopher Arumainayagam, the head of the Wellesley chemistry department. He held a lot of the same perspectives as many of the professors quoted in the literature. He was generally hesitant to move away from paper and go digital but he was will to consider the possibilities. One of my favorite features that he suggested was a troubleshooting tree that would allow a researcher to input a problem that he ran into during an experiment and the solution he used to get around this problem. This tree would be able to be referenced anytime in the future so that if the problem occurs again, the solution will be well documented. After the interview, the lab went on our weekly food run to Chipotle again which was great. The remainder of the day was spent doing research on digital pens.
Jun 18: First glance at MoClo
Today we began to do extensive research on the MoClo technique. MoClo seems to be a revolutionary biological technique for designing multigene networks. I read the paper today and it was extremely dense but this seems to be a consistent them amongst biological papers. Beyond this initial research, we are also continuing to do research on unique modalities for an electronic notebook. We are focusing our research on modalities to headcams, digitial pens and stylus. At the end of today, we had to present all of our findings on the electronic notebook and explain why we thought that this was a project that we should pursue for the rest of the summer. Personally, I think that the electronic notebook is a rather vague project with a lot of modalities being beyond our technological reach. I felt like most of the lab felt the same way by the end of the day.
Jun 20: MoClo Continued
Brainstorming at BU
Research on the electronic notebook has essentially been terminated for the summer. I am now working on creating a MoClo Planner. This planner will be used to make the design of multi-gene networks using this technique simpler and more intuitive.  One big emphasis in our lab this semester has been using standard tools and languages that have been established by the synthetic biology community.

Finally, the middle between both neighboring CDS is calculated and a DNA sequence is drawn from the fasta files which includes 1000 bp both-sided and saved, representing the homology flanks. This sequence can either be used to design PCR primers for amplification of the homology flanks directly or for creating an alignment with the genome sequence to check for the local genomic context.
An integration can affect the genes next to it. Because of this it generally is unsuitable to integrate next to essential genes. This made it necessary to characterize the genes next to our integration sites. The sequence 8 is surrounded by polA, coding the DNA-polymerase I and the GTP binding protein, which is involved in the normal cell division and septation. His depletion leads to a reduction in growth rate and extensive filamentation with a block beyond the stage of segregation.
Behind the possible integration site 9 lies hupR1, which codes for a hydrogenase transcriptional regulatory protein, a member of the two-component regulatory system ZraS/ZraR and pcpR, coding for the PCP degradation transcriptional activation protein.

Safety
Please visit the Safety Hub to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?"

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  However, this was not the case:
PCR repeat results
We might try doing touchdown PCR or raising the annealing temperature to get more specificity in the future.  It may also be worth ordering oligos to represent the other 5 subpools of targets and cross test the primers with each DNA subpool to make sure that the primers are specific enough to pull out only one subpool.  In the end though, this specificity is not critical to our success, and so it is ok if it doesn't eventually work.
Preparing for another CB bottom miniprep
Today we seeded 4 tubes of culture with 100 ul of CB bottom bacteria at saturation.  Each tube carried 4 ml of culture.  The tubes were put on the shaker at approximately 6:30 pm, so they will be ready for miniprep tomorrow morning after the lab meeting.

Optimizing PCR reaction for pSB4K5:
The gradient PCR did work, but the yield was still very low. We will try a few different approaches to increase our PCR product.  All these reactions were done only with 3:11P (since 2:17H showed no product in the gradient).
1) Gel Stab PCR:
We ran out more of the gradient PCR product (see image below) and used it as the template for a new PCR
Gel stab went into 20µL H2O; 66 C annealing, 3 min elongation; pSB4K5_F+ZFBhl and pSB4K5_R+URA3hl primers
Results: unsuccessful. Perhaps the gel stab did not give an adequate amount of template.
7/29 pSB4K5 gradient samples for gel stab
pSB4K5 gel stab PCR results 8/1/11
2) Reverse Touchdown PCR:
Because the primer initially anneals with 20 bases and then with 60, we will start with a low annealing temperature and then raise it as the overlapping region grows.
58-66 C annealing, changing 1 degree per cycle (9 cycles); the rest of the 25 cycles were done at 66 C
3 min elongation
Results: one of the four reactions worked. This is very strange since the reactions should have been identical.
pSB4K5 reverse touchdown 8/1/11
3) Template concentration gradient PCR:
The primer dimers may have been forming since there wasn't enough template to compete with the primer-primer interactions.

The insight we gained helped the product development further understand that the direction they are going with the milking shell is feasible, but simultaneously allowed them to find out what other components of the milking machine they would have to consider. We also learned that farmer feedback is essential to making sure that our project as a whole would do well in the market. As a result, we launched into contacting as many farms as we could to garner that feedback.

Muranda Cheese Company
3075 NY-96, Waterloo, NY 13165
With sketches in hand from product development for the milking shell, and outlines of the CS app, we launched into a series of farm visits to garner that feedback that Milkrite had emphasized so strongly. We went to the Muranda Cheese Company located in Waterloo, NY, and talked to Blane Murray, who is in charge of 90 milking cows at the dairy farm. Blane told us that our idea as a whole was valuable because it is a preventative measure for mastitis. We showed him our proposed sketches for the customizable shell with various modules, and he suggested that the most useful modules would be the temperature sensor, UV light, iodine spray, and cooler. With respect to our app, Blane said that bigger and more technologically advanced farms would find it more useful. One important point that Blane pointed out about marketing our product to farmers was its cost effectiveness. Farmers want to know that our device works, and whether they are going to get a return on their investment. Throughout the farm visit as we were explaining our ideas and he was providing us with feedback, Blane was highly interested in trying our product once we built our prototype. With these suggestions in mind, we went back to make improvements on our product idea and app before reaching out to two very different farms that Blane had referred us to.

At this point, it had been nearly two months since our last visit with Daryl Nydam of Quality Milk Production Services. He had given us a plethora of valuable information while we were still in the beginning stages of the project, so we chose to go back and talk to him again once our ideas were more fleshed out. We talked to him about the progress of our bacteriocin research, and Dr. Nydam lent us a field guide for mastitis that gave us a solid foundation of how we should move forward with bacteriocin testing."

Testing different transfection methods with different cells
For optimizing transfection in different cell lines transfection methods and different concentrations of the transfection mixtures were compared. The experiment was done with mouse cells (NIH3T3), hamster cells (CHO) and human cells (Phoenix). As transfection reagents lipofectamin and PEI were used in different concentrations.

UNIFI,2017,Team:UNIFI#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," interesting clue: given that we associate science art, which is visible, to music, we could also be able to bring blind people closer to biotechnology. This being the possibility, we immediately contacted the Blind Institute in Florence and Prato because we were amazed by this new horizon offered by the “simple” E. Coli!
Statistical analysis
During the conferences in schools we distributed a first questionnaire before the project presentation and a second one after it. Since we met four different schools and numerous classes, we obtained enough data for a statistic elaboration, such as graphics design and the calculation of affirmative answers percentage in three questions of particular interest:
11 ) Did we achieve what you think is the science art’s aim?
15 ) Were you interested in our presentation?
13 ) Do you think it is morally acceptable to use simple organisms (e.g. bacteria) for art purpose?
In greater detail, we analysed questions number 11 and 15 together (because of their correlation) and question number 13 separately.
The percentages of affirmative answers in 11 and 15 are 87.40% and 92.09%, respectively. We calculated the same kind of percentage for a larger cluster of questions, which included 11 , 15 and three more:
In your opinion, how commonly are industries taking advantage of science nowadays?
In your opinion, how much is science important in everyday life?
What do you think about spending finances for science art?
We compared the media of all values ( 11 , 15 and the three more questions) with the percentage of the questions we wanted analyse ( 11 and 15 ). Our aim was to reduce the probability that affirmative answers quantity in 11 and 15 was something like a “false positive”, since survey participants often tend to confirm what they consider to be the researcher’s opinion.  As you can see from data, question 15 obtained a higher percentage of affirmative questions than the media, so according to this criterion the value 92.09% can be considered more realistic than the others. In contrast, question 11 achieved a slightly lower percentage of affirmative answers than the media, a result that doesn’t improve the veracity of the question, even if it doesn’t devalue the data.
Working in the same way, we compared the affirmative answers percentage of question 13 with a cluster that included 13 and other bioethic (or similar) questions:
Do you think it is useful to invest resources in science art?
Do you think it is morally acceptable to use superior organism (e.g. fishes, cats, rabbits) for art purpose?
Do you think it is morally"

It was funded in 1811 and has more than 27 000 students and 6000 employees. The University lies in the capital of Norway, Oslo, and the buildings are spread all over the city. But the largest part is located in a ""Blindern"". We have our lab located at Blindern, Kristine Bonnevies house, Department of Biosciences.
Oslo is the capital of Norway, but also Norway's largest city. It has more than 650 000 inhabitants; this include many students that move to Oslo to get an education. Students in Norway are very fortunate; We study for free! Everyone can get a scholarship or a student loan.
Collaborations
Collaboration with K-Res in Tromsø
We were so fortunate to collaborate with scientists at the Center of National Expertise Service for the Detection of Antibiotic Resistance (K- res). We received clinical isolates of different ESBL-strains, accompanied with their ESBL-genes sequence information. These strains were used to test our detection method described in the “lab-section” of the wiki.
Nordic iGEM Conference
We joined the NiC which took part in the end of June 2016 in Stockholm. The conference was hosted by the winning team of last year NiC mini jamboree - iGEM Stockholm. Not only was this a great platform to exchange ideas between teams, but also a valuable social event where the Nordic teams also get to become friends. We attended workshop regarding ethics and speculative design where we at the latter got to think outside the box about synthetic biology. During the mini-jamboree we got valuable feedback from the judges, interesting question from the audience, and important experience by presenting our project. Good luck this year winner, iGEM Leiden, with hosting NiC"
