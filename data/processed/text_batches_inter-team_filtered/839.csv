EXPLORE NEPTUNE
An end to end design suite for
continuous flow microfluidic devices
GET STARTED
SPECIFY & DESIGN
FABRICATE
CONTROL
Begin by defining which inputs and outputs your microfluidic chip will have. Declare any limitations in terms of port size, channel width. Neptune will efficiently place and route the features of your chip. The mapper (MM) tool within the place and routing functionality has been made completely by the iGEM Team.
Check and visualize your device layout using the Neptune graphical user interface. Edit the design if you so desire. Establish a control sequence to move fluids through the microfluidic chip.  The interface has been made completely by the iGEM Team.
Assemble your microfluidic system. Import our design files into a 3D Printer and CNC mill to make the chip and the pump setup.  Change the setup using our parameterized designs to fit your specific needs. The design of the setup is BU iGEM work, whilst the chip manufacturing is the work of our mentors.
OUR PROJECT
Neptune is a specify, design, and build tool for the development of continuous flow microfluidics. With Neptune, users can specify microfluidic devices through a high level description of liquid flow relations. Our application will automatically place and route the design schematic of the microfluidic and, when used in conjunction with low cost and readily available CAD tools, a user can build their custom microfluidic system in-lab.
The Boston University 2016 iGEM Hardware Team is encapsulating this entire workflow through a graphical user interface. Users can write files that specify the function of the microfluidic, preview and edit their microfluidic design generated by the application, use this application directly with CAD tools such as a CNC mill to fabricate their device, and physically control valves and ports on the microfluidic chip. The iGEM team is also complementing this workflow by developing and releasing open source designs of our hardware, including parametric 3D print files and firmware for microcontrollers that actuate the microfluidic valves. Finally, the iGEM team is also involved in the development of the place and route software that converts a high level description of liquid flow relations into"

All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective primary prevention for NSCLC [6] , as smoking is responsible for 90% of cases. [7] In the UK, the government has implemented numerous policies to reduce rates of smoking. These include heavily taxing tobacco, banning TV advertising and requiring cigarette packets to have “smoking kills” branding.
Rates of smoking are declining [8] , although they are still sufficiently high for lung cancer to remain as prevalent it is. Primary prevention to secondhand smoke has also been implemented as far as impossible - with smoking banned in enclosed workplaces, public buildings and on public transport. [9] However, no further measures can be taken to avoid exposure by going outside.
The other risk factors for cancer are less well known - as there are a myriad of carcinogens in the world we live in - the food standards agency works to minimize carcinogens in food, drugs and cosmetics, [10] while NICE ensures that medical radiation exposure is minimized.
The screening test should be simple, safe, precise and validated
As we are using a cell free system, our test is safe. Our test would comprise a blood test, followed by miRNA purification and fluorescence measurements which are all relatively simple. These steps do not require the expertise of radiologists that are needed for CT scans. However, for our test to be shown to be precise and validated, further characterisation is required with the miRNA biomarkers and validation with a large data set of patients.
There should be evidence that intervention at a pre-symptomatic stage leads to better outcomes
NSCLC is far easier to treat in its earlier stages. The same is true for almost all cancers, as once a cancer has metastasized it can only be treated palliatively. Early stage tumors can be surgically excised and treated adjuvantly with curative intent.
The test should be acceptable to the target population
From a patient’s perspective, our sensor would just be a blood test. As such there should not be any issues with it. We are using a cell free systems which is sterile and abiotic - there are no bacteria involved which could potentially give rise to objections.
There should be a policy on further diagnostic investigation of those with a positive test result.
There should be agreed policies covering which individuals should be offered interventions and what the the appropriate intervention offered is assurance standards
We have investigated this in silver human practices - those with a positive result would go onto have a CT scan and move onto the standard NICE"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Stochasticity_-_-_TEXT.html," had to redesign using inducible promoters governing Hin invertase expression. We used the promoters pSpac and pxylA (Induced by IPTG and Xylose) to test our system. We include cut sites around these promoters in order to replace them with SigmaA promoters once the construct has been characterised.(See sequencher diagram above)
Degradation controller
In order to have another level of control over the orientation of the promoter within the flipping region we added a degradation tag to the Hin invertase protein. The following paper describes how proteins including modified ssrA tags can be located to the ClpXP protease by an Sspb protein. This means that inducible Sspb expression can requlate degradation levels of the tagged protein.
Inducible protein degradation in Bacillus subtilis using heterologous peptide tags and adaptor proteins to target substrates to the protease ClpXP
We decided to put the Sspb protein under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter as the following diagram illustrates. We also included a region of the sac gene in our construct, so that the region will integrate into the Bacillus genome at a region other than amyE.
We added a modified version of ssrA degradation tag onto the C-terminus of the Hin protein. Expressed proteins are therefore degraded by ClpXP. However mutations on the ssrA tag weaken the recognition by ClpX, and the modified tags require the SspB adaptor protein to be recognized. When the SspB protein is expressed the proteins tagged with modified version of ssrA tag are targeted for degradation. Otherwise they remain stable.
In B. subtilis there is no sspB orthologue and SspB from E. coli works in B. subtilis.  By regulating the levels of SspB by arabinose, we implemented an inducable protein degradation device.
Hin vs SspB according to the speed of degradation by ClpXP
The wild type E. coli ssrA tag is AANDENY-ALAA (SspB recognition site – ClpX recognition site). As suggested in the paper, we took one of the modified ssrA tags to use in our system.
AANDENY-SENY-ALGG (SspB recognition site – SENY +4 Linker - ClpX recognition site)
This tag works well in B. subtilis. However, degradation tags can affect the activity of proteins. Different degradation tags may effect the activity of different proteins. It has been shown that this"

Art, Science and Engineering
Beakerhead brings art and science together in downtown Calgary for everyone to enjoy. Organized in part by Jay Ingram, the first annual event featured everything from a robot band to engineering competitions. Our participation allowed us to reach the broader Calgary audience . We hosted an interactive booth where anyone could take a few minutes to extract DNA from a banana. Visitors to our booth got to learn about DNA and actually see what it looks like. We also took the opportunity to talk about synthetic biology and some of the interesting experiments that can be done with simple manipulations of DNA. One example we gave was the green fluorescent protein (GFP) which was originally found in jellyfish, but can now be added as a part in other organisms. Our booth attracted a lot of people and it was great to get people's opinions on our project. in general, people were very interested in the idea of detecting pathogenic E. coli especially in the meat industry.

Talk with LanZhou, Talk about iGEM
    At 9:00 pm on October 10,             we held a Live chat entitled ""Talk with LanZhou,             Talk about iGEM"" in the Northwestern Polytechnical University.
Brief
     In this activity, we have adopted the most popular network video             media way - live, so that viewers are no longer confined to 50 on             the scene, but a total of 1100 +, which is the 22 times of the number             people presented. We promote iGEM in time with a very common device             (a pixel-friendly mobile phone and a self-portrait shot) through our             webcast platform, introducing our projects and interacting with the             audience, answering their questions, discussed specific topics.
Figue1,In just one hour, we got 1100+ hits, 3,6000+upvote.
Why organize such activities?
     NWPU and LanZhou is the only two iGEM teams in the northwest of China.             Because of the limitation of time and money due to geographical distance,             we came to an idea of using instant messaging software to discuss and             communicate with players. ""Why not put this live exchange process of             discussion online? So our friends, classmates and teachers can take this             opportunity to understand what we have done! We only need a mobile phone             to realize it."" So, we began planning this.
Hardware and software requirements:
     Two sub-venues (classrooms), at Northwestern Polytechnical University and Lanzhou University.
     Each sub-venue has a projector (which classrooms in university now have), a cell phone camera (pixel as high as possible, good configure, such as iPhone6).
     A live video software. In China, almost every person who surf the Internet will have a QQ account or micro account number, we use popular QQLive software. Our friends can directly use the QQ mobile client to watch live and participate in interactive easily, in addition he or she can also transpond, let his friends to watch and interact.
Process:
    In the live broadcast, each sub-venue of the mobile phone will"

From our predictive modelling, we predict the Winsulin will be a short acting insulin. We also believe that our Winsulin will not fall into the ‘biosimilar’ category, as it is not simply an adaptation on a current market therapy, but an entirely new design altogether.
Our Final Project Design
As you can see, developing human insulin as a therapy became a lot more operational and useful following the discussions with Neil, which showed that insulins do not need to be refrigerated to maintain levels of activity. Furthermore, we developed a series of expression systems to compare the relative yields, and costs of purification, to determine whether or not we could optimise human insulin production. But ultimately, with the blessings of Dr Peter Arvan, we were able to develop our own Single Chain Insulin, and Len Mancini was able to confirm that our optimised Winsulin is in fact outside of all patent claims.
Applied Design
Our Original Applied Design
As technology is evolving faster than therapies can develop, we originally wanted to design an insulin pump to go along with our Single Chain Insulin. This is so that all diabetics are able to utilise our new insulin, and we are not forcing individuals to start injecting themselves again. Furthermore, we assumed that clinical trials would be required in the future for both of our Human Insulin and Winsulin, and that ultimately want to pursue a single one due to the extreme costs of clinical trials. We were also only considering an open source project, as this seemed to fit the most with the international collective movement of Open Insulin.

We’ve done a little research into how we could approach the issues of insulin accessibility and affordability, but we aren’t quite sure how we should be approaching them.

In our opinion, coaxing generic manufacturers to produce your insulin will be a hard feat considering the impassable barriers to entry , including a Good Manufacturing Practice certification for insulin production.

Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMPs for short, are licenses required by a manufacturing plant to produce a therapeutic drug to be sold commercially. This makes sure that the processes used by a plant are meeting quality standards and product specifications. These generally cost around US$"

""The project seemed like a great opportunity to get some laboratory experience and I hoped for an educational experience by participating in an official research project.""
Sigrid Kristensen,
Bagsværd High School
It was important for the team not to exclude anyone from getting the opportunity to learn a lot during the summer and being a part of our team. This is reflected in the background of the three high school students, who are enrolled at three different high schools and had various experience with laboratory work and biotechnology in general.
""I would like to experience the laboratory work in projects like this and improve my competences.""
Tobias Bertramsen,
Borupgaard High School
Common for all of them, though, was the eagerness to learn, their enthusiasm about the project and their ability to ask questions and challenge us on our basic biotechnology knowledge and skills.
We asked Sigrid, Tobias and Rasmus after the summer: “What was the best part about joining the DTU BioBuilders' team?”
They all agreed that the great insight in synthetic biology and laboratory work were very valuable for them. Especially the high degree of freedom they had, due to our believe in them succeeding with guidance, helped the students with gaining confidence within an relatively unknown scientific field.
What we are most proud of on the team are the feedback we got from them about our team spirit and willingness to share our knowledge and further that their participation have opened their eyes for this very exciting field of study.

This year each team member from DTU BioBuilders received a diploma for showing extraordinary skills and contribution to the project. Being a DTU Blue Dot project is great honour which shows that DTU acknowledge the potential, impact and importance along with the huge amount of work we have put into our project.
“The name ""Blue Dot"" refers to the Earth, which - although it is huge - looks like a small blue dot when viewed from space. While big ideas can appear simple and tangible when seen from the outside, from the inside they are often rather intricate and complex. The name ""Blue Dot"" thus also refers to an engineer’s ability to remain focused and see the big picture while simultaneously"

I then plated on A,C and K and left for overnight growth.  I also spent a large portion of my day testing out the plate reader.  I made serial dilutions of the ovenright cultures that I had made of a constitutive GFP circuit, a constitutive RFP circuit and B0015.  I tested these all as well as a negative control of just LB broth and our 4 constructs of I0500-B0034-E0040 that have been induced with arabinose.  Today I also filled more pipette tip boxes and autoclaved a bunch of necessary lab supplies like pipette tip boxes and 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes.

Our first main challenge of the summer was to determine which organelles we could easily and distinctly target in order to produce our MiCodes. We referenced the YeastGFP database of global analysis of protein localization studies in the budding yeast, S.cerevisiae, which was compiled by the O'Shea and Weissman labs at UCSF.  This database consists of microscopy analysis and characterization of GFP tagged to every ORF in yeast.
We found proteins that localized to various organelles, PCR 'd them off of the genome, then tagged them with a fluorescent protein. After analyzing their specific localizations through microscopy, we narrowed our choices hoping to find consistent morphology and geometry.
We chose four organelles from a list of over ten candidates based on the following criteria:
Existing targeting proteins or signal sequences in the literature.
Visible distinction from the other chosen organelles.
The following were our final four choices:
H2A2-Venus The localizing protein is H2A2/YBL003C, a H2 histone protein that is essential for chromatin assembly. C-terminal protein fusion to H2A2 will localize the complex to the nucleus.
Registry Part: BBa_K900002
mKate-CIIC The C-terminus CIIC signal sequence is derived from the Ras protein, a signal protein located in the plasma membrane that activates in response to extracellular signals for growth and differentiation.
Registry Part: BBa_K900005
ABP1-Venus Actin-binding protein of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, important for activation of the Arp2/3 complex that plays a key role actin in cytoskeleton organization; phosphorylation within its PRR (Proline-Rich Region), mediated by Cdc28p and Pho85p, protects Abp1p from proteolysis mediated by its own PEST sequences.
Registry Part: BBa_K900004
ZRC1-mTurquoise The localizing protein ZRC1/YMR243C is a vacuolar membrane zinc transporter. C-terminal protein fusion to ZRC1 will localize the complex to the vacuolar membrane.
Registry Part: BBa_K900003

Chinese government officials plan to grow R&D spending from 1.5% of GDP today to 2.5% in 2020 (Pei, Schmidt, & Wei, 2011). In addition to funding from the state, provincial and municipal governments are the other constant sources that contribute to the budget for research. Compare to the abundant industry or private funding in the US, there are only a few private sources in China (Pei et al., 2011). An example of private company in china is Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT), which is in cooperation with Royal Dutch Shell Group and Boeing Inc. for the development of biofuel.
Regulations for Synthetic Biology
One of the most reliable regulations on transgenic organisms, Regulations on Administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety was published in 2001 by Ministry of Agriculture (“Regulations on Administration of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms Safety”). Other safety assessment and regulation on export and import Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) were also formulated. Since organisms synthesized by synthetic biology are also considered as GMO, it is likely that the government will use these laws and regulations to govern the use and development of synthetic biology.
The difference between synthetic biology and more traditional genetic engineering do exists. Using synthetic biology, scientists will be able to generate novel organisms that possess designed functions for specific use. In this case, it is hard to define if novel organisms are risky or unsafe. Complete laws and regulations that encompass all aspect of synthetic biology can create sustainable and safe development of synthetic biology in China.
Perception of Synthetic Biology
Recently, the Chinese government and many Chinese scientists’ interest in synthetic biology is growing. Many conferences were conducted in the past few years in China, discussing how synthetic biology should be further explored. In February 2008, the Xiangshan Conference on synthetic biology was held and it was the first of its kind in China. In July 2009, the Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology of Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) organized a forum on the design of drug and energy products based on synthetic biology techniques (Zhang, Chang, & Wang, 2011). More forums were held in the following years, where experts and scholars were invited to discuss the current status and development strategies of synthetic biology, with the aim of promoting its further prosperity in China.
Meanwhile, research centers about synthetic biology were established with the financial support of central government, including the Systems and Synthetic Biology Research Center in Tianjin University, Key Laboratory"

D. aromatica cld : BBa_K2695010
This part codes for the enzyme Cld from Dechloromonas aromatica to catalyse the second step of our enzyme pathway to reduce perchlorate to oxygen.  Chlorite dismutase catalyses the reduction of a chlorite ion into a chloride ion and oxygen. In 2016 Leiden's ‘E. coliniser’ project added D. Aromatica cld part ( BBa_k1938004 ) to the registry of standard parts. Through email correspondence we discovered that they had difficulty building their final construct and were therefore unable to characterise it. They were planning to insert the cld into one plasmid with the pcrABCD operon and an additional three genetic elements.
Due to the pcrABCD being such a large operon we decided to insert the operon into one plasmid and construct the D.aromatica cld with a T7 inducible promoter in a seperate but compatible plasmid. Splitting up the part made it easier to build and we were successful in protein expression and in assaying activity.
The successful cloning of Cld was shown by gel electrophoresis (Figure 1), expression was confirmed with a Western blot (Figure 2), and by measuring oxygen production using a Clark electrode we demonstrated enzyme activity (Figure 3). More detail on how each of these assays were performed can be found here .

Assuming that indigoidine production inhibits cell growth due to its toxicity, we concluded that TOP10 produced the most indigoidine among the strains we tested. We used E. coli TOP10 for the following experiments.  b) Comparison between different PPTases concerning overall indigoidine production The Figure shows ''E. coli'' TOP10 cells co-transformed with indC and four different PPTases (sfp, svp, entD and delC), respectively. The image bottom left shows ''E. coli'' TOP10 cells without additional PPTase and the negative control is TOP10 without a plasmid.
Figure 7: Modified variants of indC with replaced T-domains We replaced the indC T-domain with both the T-domains of other native NRPS modules (entF, delH, tycC, tycA, bpsA, plu2642 and plu2670) and synthetic T-domains. The figure shows the five modified versions of indC that remain the enzyme function, thus resulting in a blue phenotype of transformed ''E. coli'' TOP10. The cells have been co-transformed with a plasmid containing the respective engineered variant of indC and a second plasmid coding for the PPTase sfp, svp, entD and delC. The figure shows representative results; the total 85 transformation results can be found in the indigoidine notebook, week 17.
Figure 8: Determination of required domain borders for T-domain exchange a) Definition of different domain border combinations for T-domain exchanges The figure shows a sequence alignment of the indC and bpsA amino acid sequences. The alignment was created using clustalO (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) with standard parameters. The lines marked A, B and C reflect the borders we used between the A-  and the T-domain, whereas those marked, 1, 2, 3 and 4 reflect the borders between the T- and  the TE-domain. In total we tried all twelve combinations of a domain border {A, B, C} and a  domain border {1, 2, 3, 4}, replacing the sequence inbetween with the respective part of bpsA.  b) E. coli TOP10 co-transformed with modified versions of indC and the PPTase s"

Method - Spatio-temporal gene expression
This protocoll was adapted from Müller et al., 2013.
3.5*10^6 CHO-K1 cells were spread in a 10 cm culture dish.
After 24 h the cells were transfected with 12 µg of tetR-pif and vp16-phyB and 8 µg of mcherry reporter.
A change of culture medium was performed 4 h post transfection.
Again culture medium was exchanged after 24 h with culture medium containing 15 µM of PCB under safe green light.
After an incubation of 1 h in dark the plate was illuminated with red light at an intensity of 0.02 - 0.5 µE for 15 - 60 min. To gain a spatial resolution different edit formats were used. These edit formats contain of glass masked with black tape containing specific gaps.
Thereafter cells were kept in dark for 20 h.
To conserve the cells and stop gene expression the cells were washed with 10 ml ice cold PBS (containing Ca++ and Mg++), fixed with 3ml of ice cold 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA), incubated for 10 min on ice and covered with 3-4 ml of PBS (containing Ca++ and Mg++) after removal of PFA.
The cells can now be kept in dark and at 4 °C for several days
Results and Discussion
Testing the uniBOX with a well characterized red - light system
At first we measured the spectrum of our LED light chain bought in a common home improvement store ( Figure 1 ). As this LED light chain is built on a RGB color space three different LEDs were used: Blue, Green and Red. For the measurement of the spectrum the LED light chain was set to white light. Three peaks were measured. One at 459.33 nm corresponding to the blue LED, one at 519.59 nm corresponding to the green LED and one at 632.6 nm corresponding to the red LED. It is obvious that the red LED with its peak has not the optimal condition for performing light experiments. Therefore we had to do some experiments to test whether the TetR-VP16 activation system will also be inducible at 632 nm instead of 660 nm.

Dry Lab
Rick and Nicole did an unremitting job aligning Plasmodium sequences with great endurance for the design of primers and probes for our qPCRs.
As a first prototype for the application of our diagnostic device David and Rick elaborated a hardware system to easily perform our rapid test under real-life conditions. Later David created a hardware system based on this concept.
But how can we further improve our system? Annabel made the attempt to work out, how RPA (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification) could be applied in our device as a promising alternative to qPCR, which guarantees the enormous advantage of isothermal amplification without a thermocycler.

Since it is our first year participating in the iGEM contest, we joined the mentoring program and received a lot of support and helpful advice from our mentoring partner, team Munich. The members of our organising team, Nicole, Rick and Annabel were responsible for the communication and checked the monthly mentoring documents. We thank team Munich, especially Enikö and Dominic for their effort and the beneficial exchange between our two teams.
Annabel stayed in touch with Vic from Tuebingen to get familiar with the iGEM contest within the first months of our project. This contact provided us with valuable information for the submission of various forms and official documents.
Wiki
Annabel and Johannes created a filing system to work on the texts for the wiki. They wrote and reviewed together with Rick and Nicole most of the content to be displayed at our website. Lukas then used his coding skills to complete the wiki and upload the files.
Design Presentation and Poster
A professional-looking design is essential when presenting your work to the public. Maga put her passion for graphics design in our project and created a marvellous design for our logo and sponsoring brochure. Together with Annabel she designed our T-shirts and worked on the wiki-design.
Rick and Nicole used their inkScape skills to create our posters together with Annabel. Proofreading was conducted by Johannes.
Our presentation was created by the Giant Jamboree Delegation of Annabel, David, Johannes, Nicole and Rick.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," were eager to learn about synthetic biology along with the CRISPR-Cas9 system and were ecstatic to play the games we had prepared for them.
TECBio & DiSCoBio
This year’s iGEMers also presented to Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TecBio) and The Drug Discovery, Systems and Computational Biology (DiSCoBio) programs at the University of Pittsburgh. These two programs are for college students wanting to gain first-hand experience in the field of systems and computational biology. Even though these students were already knowledgeable in the field of science, we were able to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology, demonstrated the outline and functionality of our research, and illustrate how synthetic biology and CRISPR are applicable to all fields of science and that they can use this information in their own work. Here, the college students from around the globe were able to ask thorough questions that made us analyze our project. Presenting to these students was beneficial because it prepared us for the types of in-depth questions we receive.
Central Catholic High School
Through our connections with presenting at Camp BioE, the iGEM team was invited to a local Pittsburgh school, Central Catholic High School. The team presented to two honors Biology classes along with one Advanced Placement Biology class. Here, we presented more advanced material to the high schoolers, going more in-depth about the function of our project. We also provided resources to local Pittsburgh iGEM opportunities and the growing field of synthetic biology. The team also incorporated games to tie together the material we presented in a more learnable setting.
Integrated Human Practices
Throughout the course of our research, the team reached out to various experts and knowledgeable individuals about CRISPR and biology to help advance our project and understanding of synthetic biology. It is important for us to gain a wide range of different viewpoints to consider in our project.
We also want to thank these specific individuals for taking the time to listen and answer our questions.
Santiago Molina
Santaigo Molina is a sociology Ph. D candidate with the University of California Berkeley who interviews scientists to determine how certain organizations work, how practices change, and how specific scientists interact with each other. We discussed how small groups of scientists regulating themselves behind closed doors led to the initial public distrust of genetically modified organisms. He advised that it was not okay to rely purely on technological expertise as the basis for deciding public policy. Instead, we agreed that keeping the public informed of our intentions was an appropriate measure. As a result we made an effort to include intuitive information about our project in every presentation afterwards.

Explaining the Principle of Recombination
Even for an experienced biologist, it can be very difficult to imagine how recombinases work in three dimensions. In fact, we are often told by our lecturers in genetics that teaching genetic recombination is one of the most difficult things to do. This is because just looking at static PowerPoint slides is usually not sufficient for students to understand the dynamic, three-dimensional activity of recombination.
Given how difficult it is for even biologists to explain recombination, we thought it was essential for increasing the accessibility of our project to provide tools so that anyone interested could understand the mechanism of SSR. Indeed, we often found that a large part of communicating our project to non-biologists required a lengthy introduction of the concept of SSR.
Therefore, we have produced unique animations that demonstrate how our randomizer construct works. Furthermore, we have created a longer video where recombination is described step-by-step using three-dimensional Claymation. These resources will be useful for those just being introduced to the concept of recombination and more experienced biologists alike.
Click here to watch our three-dimensional explanation of how SSR works, using Cre/LoxP as an example!
Hardware
SMORE should be accessible to every researcher who likes to use it. One of the barrier is the use of cell sorters.                 Cell sorters are integral to our randomiser strategy. If a series of randomiser constructs were able to produce a hetergenous cell population, this heterogenous population would need to be screened and sorted in some way. The most straightforward method to do this would be to use a cell sorter. However, cell sorters are expensive and might be a deterrent                 to some researchers. For example, second-hand flow cytometers costs approximately 2,000 – 3,000 USD.
We hope to produce an affordable and accessible cell sorter. Our ideal"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2015,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#HumanPractices#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," GMO
As a lot of people (not only in Lithuania) are discussing the pros and cons of genetically modified products, we decided to check the most popular myths about GMOs. Are you into horror, or better – science fiction? Well, look no further. Here are the top 7 craziest urban myths about our beloved GMOs (a.k.a. Genetically Monstrified Organisms):
GMO is OMG (Oh My God!) spelled backwards.
Well, technically it’s not a myth, but we assure you no OMGs were involved in creation of the word GMO, in fact (for those who might have been living in a cave for the last several decades) GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism.
And for those who think this is an absurd point to make, marvel at this .
The Desperate Bee.
Some people say that the recent collapse of the bee population is due to increasing use of GM crops. In fact, the recent drop in bee population was not due to the increased usage of GMOs, but to some nasty microbes that attacked bees. In legal terms this claim is an example of guilt by association!
The Safe Haven.
There are some that believe that Europe is the safe haven from all the ‘life-threatening’ GMOs. While it is true that in most European countries GMOs are not grown, we assure you that many foods, eaten by Europeans, are imported from abroad and are in fact made from GMOs.
My Sign is Cancer.
Some GMOs critics argue that food that is made from GMOs causes cancer. Though there was a study that claimed that GMOs has caused cancer in rats (a very untrustworthy study to say the least), other studies have not found a link between eating GMOs and incidences of cancer. Sorry to disappoint you on that one as well!
The Curse of Frankenchicken.
{...} Kentucky Fried Chicken has become KFC. Does anybody know why? We thought the real reason was because of the ""FRIED"" food issue. It's not. The reason why they call it KFC is because they can not use the word chicken anymore. Why? KFC does not use real chickens. They actually use genetically manipulated organisms.
This myth that KFC has been using meat that no longer qualifies as chicken has been around since 1995. However, it is stunning how the myth still gains popularity from time to time.
More on the story.
McAIDS.
Well KFC is not the only devious corporation out there, it appears that McDonalds is no less guilty of using genetically modified meat, to quote: """

After 18 hours of cultivation the maximal OD600 of 9.63 was reached and the glycerin was completely consumed. At that time the cells were just entering the stationary phase. No further data for OD600 were measured. The cells have been harvested after 22 hours of cultivation. In the review, to leave the cells longer in the stationary phase could have been a better procedure concerning the yield.
Since Regionals: Purification of TTHL since Regionals
The harvested cells were resuspended in Ni-NTA- equilibration buffer and mechanically disrupted by homogenization . The cell debris were removed by centrifugation and microfiltration via Millipore Pellicon XL 50 . The supernatant of the cell lysate was concentrated with Millipore Pellicon XL 50 with 10 kDa and loaded on the Ni-NTA column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 cm-2. Then the column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) Ni-NTA equilibration buffer . The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing Ni-NTA elution buffer step elution from 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazole) with a length of 50 mL, to 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazole) with a length of 80 mL and finally to 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazole) with a length of  80 mL. This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 3 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak. A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . The chromatogram of the TTHL elution is shown in Figure 4:

As can be seen in Fig. 2 the aminoacylation  of the tRNA by the PylRS is specific and selective to the latter substrates[3].
In Fig.2 tRNA were incubated with various lysine derivatives and PylRS, Next all samples were subject to acidic PAGE and stained with methylene blue. All samples that have 2 bends have been aminoacylated with the relevant lysine derivative. In our study proparagyl-lysine (figure 1, (8)) was used as a model amino acid. PylRS Structure: The crystal structure of the entire protein still eludes structural biologists but the crystal structure of its catalytic domain has been recently solved (Fig.3). The PylRS catalytic domain structure analysis reveals that it utilizes a deep hydrophobic pocket for recognition of the Pyl side chain (The pocket binds both tRNA and the amino acid and catalyzes the aminoacylation reaction between them) [4].
This Biobrick is the coding sequence for the Pyrolysyl tRNA synthetase enzyme from the archaea Methanosarcina barkeri str. fusaro. As mentioned earlier, the enzyme selectively 'loads' the amino acid, pyrolysine (and other synthetic substrates) onto its cognate tRNA for subsequent incorporation into proteins during the translation process in the ribosome. The tRNA synthetase is part of the unnatural amino acid (UAA) incorporation machinery along its cognate tRNA molecule (BBa_K1223014).

This biobrick is the DNA coding sequence for the tRNAcua pyl of Pyrolysine from the Archaea Methanosarcina barkeri str fusaro. This tRNA is a part of the machinery that is used to incorporate pyrolysine (and other substrates) into proteins in bacteria. The PylRS that charges the tRNA with pyrrolysine can be found in biobrick BBa_k1223013. The tRNA naturally contains the anticodon CUA (Fig.4) – Thus it recognizes TAG as its sense codon when incorporating the UAA. With the introduction of"

Statistical survey of herbicide market
We collected data from National Bureau to finish statistics and analysis. Results shows recently, owing to the supervision of pesticides and increased public awareness towards environment protection, supply and demand of traditional pesticides both reduced. This gave us confidence to continue on our bio-pesticide, and we believe it would be dominant in the market one day.

The limitation of the global pesticide market
1. The international trend
The study released from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) showed that glyphosate could hurt eyes and it is toxic to aquatic organisms. In addition, it would impact the environment in a long term. However, according to the data was released by IARC, glyphosate was registered in more than 130 countries in 2010 and it was one of herbicides with the usage amount in the world.
2. Reduction of generic pesticides
In the past, generic pesticide is a serious domestic problem. But in recent years, with the increasing awareness of protecting intellectual property rights in new pesticide products, the supervision of pesticides has severely cracked down on infringement and production of generic drugs, therefore, domestic pesticide enterprises have been unable to produce profits through selling of generic drugs., cheap but harmful generic drugs can’t be bought in the market..
Recently, the newly-legislated, regulations on pesticide, strongly supported the innovation of pesticides, meanwhile, the higher requirement for pesticide innovation was proposed.
3. Environmental factors
Influenced by environmental supervision, the pesticide market has to face the shortage of original medicines, rising costs of preparations and many other plight. In March, 2016, the Ministry of environmental protection issued the 2017 air pollution prevention working program in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province and surrounding areas, which brought a series of problems to the pesticide market. Many manufacturers have begun to limit production or even to stop production.
Current pesticide market situation
According to the survey, in the April 2017, China's herbicide production decreased to 11%. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in April 2017, Chinese chemical pesticide production is 333131 tons, and the total yield of herbicides was 141129 tons, accounting for 42."

Julia Goupil
Julia is a rising junior majoring in Biological Engineering at MIT. She’s excited about this year’s project, developing a genetic circuit to detect endometriosis, a complex disease that is poorly understood. She looks forward to carrying out the project from start to finish while gaining wet lab experience. Outside of iGEM, Julia plays for the MIT Varsity Women’s Soccer Team and enjoys reading, hanging out with friends, and eating lots of ice cream.
Maya Kaul
Maya is an MIT sophmore from Tetazoo.  She is (by current calculations) majoring in bioengineering and plans to minor in EECS, while maintaining a decent fangirl standing for mechanical engineering.  She is interested in gene editing and delivery systems to make applications of synthetic biology more viable.  Current topics that pique her interest involve an alternative to FBS, cultured animal products, and cell penetrating peptides for gene delivery.  In whatever time she steals violently from the work she should be doing, she appreciates janky carpentry, janky electronics, and very not janky ropework.  She likes exploring, writing, and finding fun people who will tell her stories.
Wangui Mbuguiro
Wangui is a rising senior from Maryland studying Biological Engineering at MIT. Wangui was drawn to iGEM by the prospect of being able to design a project from start to finish. In the past, Wangui has lived two separate research lives. In one life, she explored her curiosity through research in the fields of neuropathology and oncology. In another life, she created and repaired devices as a student in Health, Sciences, and Technology and later as a Biomedical Equipment Technician. She is excited to be fusing the curious and creative sides of her to create a genetic circuit to detect endometriosis, a condition that affects 1 in 10 women. In her spare time, Wangui loves reading, writing, and running. Her other passions include planning events for Black Women’s Alliance, a community that has always supported her, and fundraising for Expediting Access to Standard Education, a club that supports education projects in developing countries.

Intellectual Property and SynBio
What is Intellectual Property? Before the main topic, we let you know basic information.
What is IP?
IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they   invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest,               the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish. [1] .
What is Patent?
A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor. Patents are granted for new, useful and non-obvious inventions for a period   of 20 years from the filing date of a patent application,               and provide the right to exclude others from exploiting the invention during that period. [2]
SynBio and Patents
Patenting FAQ
Q. How can I do to gain knowledge on academic patenting?
A. Actual experience on it could be an effective way of patent learning. However, if you don't have such a chance, you can substitute it with   researching previous case.
Q. How much do I need for patenting?
A. In Japan, about 400,000yen is required. It varies from country to country
Q. Who should I consult if I want to file patent?
A. Patent attorney or company which are strong in researching would help you.
Q. In which country should I apply for patent?
A. It depends on what kind of study you do. Since Patent is not applicable to the whole world, you have to select country to apply.                 The need is in where the field of research thrive. [3]
Left: Yoichi Muratomi  Right:>
Things you MUST NOT do
talk to someone in cafeteria
spread the information thorough SNS
publish the idea including at academic meeting or in papers
winning grants
file patent with incomplete study
Some countries have time period for patenting after your disclosure (ex, 1 year in the U.S.)
Things you SHOULD do for patenting
search for previous case of patent
present your ideas or studies in BROAD outline with no details
gain knowledge on how to write application form of patening (the result could be changed even at   the point of the written style)

Because when the bacteria die, it may float on the surface. There is a question, do the bacteria floating on the surface die or not  So we made a microscopic examination. We use a vital stain to examine the bacteria die or not. Dead bacteria can’t decompose the stain, so they appear blue, while the living cells turn to be transparent (Figure 11 and 12).
Figure 13 and 14.  The left picture shows that most of surface bacteria are living because there are few blue spot here. The right picture is dead bacteria as control. We can see that, almost all the bacteria are dead.

Under the microscope, we use the blood count method to observe the different liquid layer cell capacity, the left is from the liquid layer on the surface of the samples taken from the experimental group, and the right is middle layer of fluid samples. Through the under the microscope observation can obviously observed as the cells expressed in the gas vesicle that cells in the culture solution of concentrated in the surface layer of fluid.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics#fuben_-_-_TEXT.html," the short span of a lifetime. People don't care about its direction, because nature which has been so benign to us has no understandable reason to suddenly go mental and evolve us back to a mollusc. Artificial evolution, however, is totally opposite. People seem to not trust it very much, because they are afraid that something will go wrong, despite the best effort of the scientist to control the potential danger. And besides, it is happening too fast for people's understanding to catch up; people can feel like the woman reported in the news who suddenly gave birth to a child on the train and she hadn't realized she had conceived. This is the issue that lies at the heart of conflict in the debate of artificiality vs. naturality: about fear and trust.
     Our project builds a rewirable circuit that can automatically rewire itself into another circuit adapting to its environment. This is an attempt at the imitation of natural evolution, and with human engineering, we were helping the circuit evolve. Like the analogy we used to describe our project: what synthetic biology has been doing is constructing cars from scratch, and what we are trying to do is evolve this car to be a bacterial amphibian vehicle, or a fancier name, bacteria transformer. The concept is thrilling enough: transformer? It is a very fitting analogy, and it sounds marvellous if it succeed.
     However, there is also an unaddressed problem: what would this transformer do once come into being? Being the ""Autobots"", or the ""Decepticons""? And what if the rewire somehow goes haywire, and the whole circuit end up being a stupid mess or worse, a malignant mess?
     To answer these questions would be much, much more difficult than constructing the thing that raised these questions in the first place. Since our project is more a proof of concepts than its next step, real applications, we don't need to worry about the problem as long as we use the parts we are using already which do not contain nefarious or toxic materials. However, just a proof of concept is just a first step towards more real-world applications. The output signals are not yet real functionalities but fluorescence intensity, so the worst that may happen will be some abnormal flashing of the fluorescence. More technical details are discussed in our safety section, and it can be safe to say that, our rewirable circuit is a safe one AT THIS STAGE.
     However, we wouldn't dare to say so if we change the components, especially the output signals, to ones that may likely to have a more concrete effect on its environment; or when the output signal is changed"

Project
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically.

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html,"3 PCRs still were annoyingly problematic for reasons we simply could not work out. Fortunately, we managed to complete a PCR of luc (hunderds of bp) and transformed luc in E. coli.
Week 4
Pfet3 PCRs remainded a huge problem - nothing we tried seemed to work out. Also, we have produced new chemo-competent cells and tried to test the pTUM-vectors by ligation with some of our parts. We also tried to amplify a full fragment of luc (after successful site-directed-mutagenesis). After many experiments we have finally found an ideal protocol for gelelectrophoreses that does not include expensive post-staining: we basically use more loading buffer and make the wells full to overflow!
Week 3
The first thing we did in this week, was a control restriction of last week's ligations. Unfortunately, not one single ligation was successful thus this whole step had to be repeated. Our work with luc (i.e. luc quick-change) continued, additional PCRs went well, and we made plans how to control luc's quality once both restriction sites were eliminated.
This week, we received a package containing pTUM yeast vectors from TU Munich's iGEM Team ! We need the pTUM vectors from pTUM100 to pTUM104 in order to add missing BioBrick restriction sites to some of our parts.
Week 2
Further PCRs of Panb1 and Pfet3 were more promising but Pfet3 still made lots of problems because there were only very faint Pfet3 stains on our gels. We transformed pSB1C3 and RFP into E. coli and our first plasmid extractions of these parts went pretty smooth. We yielded pretty good amounts of DNA and after some restriction digests we were able to ligate Panb1 into pSB1C3!
Week 1
We started out our iGEM project with several unsuccessful PCRs of Pfet3. We also tried restriction digests and ligations of Psuc2, rox1, mig1, and the mPRs into pSB1C3– without positive results. Unfortunately, we had massive problems (smiling marker) with staining our gelelectrophoresis gels thus had to start off our project with trouble-shooting. After some experiments we came to the conclusion that post-staining would be an expensive way to solve our gel problems. Due to better gels we could prove the successful PCRs of Panb1 and Psuc2 and promptly started ligation"

Delft University of Technology is currently thinking about opening a VR learning center, which we hopefully brought a little closer with this idea. We pitched our VR laboratory to all study program coordinators of our faculty and have collected great interest. Hopefully, in this way, we will soon have safer, less expensive and more encompassing laboratory training. We would like to thank Arno Freeken, Luuk Goossen and Arend-Jan Krooneman from the Department of Architecture at Delft University of Technology for aiding in the development of our VR laboratory.

EurAsian Meetup Bioethics Workshop
Apart from developing a tool to teach students how to work in the laboratory as we did with our VR, we believe (young) scientists should also be taught about their ethical responsibilities that stretch beyond the laboratory. Therefore, we organized a workshop during the iGEM EurAsian Meetup with the topic: Bioethical dilemma’s across borders. The goal of this workshop was to increase the awareness of bioethics in the participants and to trigger reflection on the bioethical questions of their own projects.
Figure 3. Impressions of the bioethics debates at the EurAsian Meetup
We combined elements from the iGEMmers Guide to the Future (2017) , advice given to us by Mr. Virgil Rerimassie, co-creator of this tool, and elements discussed by bioethicists Mr. Hui Kang and Britte Bouchaut, MSc. in their talks prior to the workshop. In mixed break-out groups, we discussed two topics with inherent ethical dilemmas that iGEM teams can face or have faced in the past: bioluminescence and gene drives. In the final round, the iGEM teams got together again and discussed how the same questions of the first two rounds could be applied to their own project.  We received positive feedback from the teams, many naming this workshop as one"

6. CAT-Seq data processing and dynamic range assessment
The final step of CAT-Seq workflow is sequencing the prepared DNA library embedded with biomolecule activity using the Nanopore.
Movie 7. Nanopore DNA sequencing.
Data processing and pipeline preparation
For every analysis, the sequencing reads were basecalled using ONT Albacore v2.3.1 and demultiplexed using Japsa Package ( https://github.com/mdcao/japsa ). The demultiplexed reads were binned to different folders using our NanoCycler.sh script. To identify whether a cytosine base is methylated we used a forked version of SignalAlign (Rand et al. 2017) tool (GitHub branch: kmer_event_alignment). First, we trained our own HMM using a control sequencing run of a CAT-Seq Esterase gene amplified with only the reference nucleotides (dATP, 5’-mdCTP, dGTP, dTTP). The resulting HMM was used for all the downstream analyses involving methylation basecalling.
After demultiplexing, every sample is analyzed using SignalAlign and our prepared HMM to estimate probabilities that a k-mer in the sample contains product cytosines. Since the probability that a methylated cytosine will be incorporated at a specific site is uniform, the posterior probability distributions of having a methylated cytosine for every kmer are bimodal, with one peak close to 0, and the other close to 1 (Figure 18).
Figure 18. Example density plot of posterior probability frequencies for all kmers of different samples to have methylated cytosines.
However, this does not cause problems when calculating the mean for the same kmer. Ideally, if our sequenced molecules were uncut, we could calculate the means for every long read kmer and estimate an error, however due to this limitation we are only able to calculate errors between technical replicates.
To decrease noise in our analysis pipeline, for every experimentwe select k-mers that differentiate well between the control runs, where either only reference or the product cytidine was used. The thresholds for good differentiation are selected as an average probability for the sample kmers to have product cytosines, in the range of 0 - 0.2 for the reference and 0.4 - 1.0 for the product cytidine control samples. After filtering for the selected k-mers we then extracted the mean probability for every sample and"

Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," not normally transported extracellularly. It can promote the expression of downstream target genes by interacting with the transcription factors originally present in the cells, without the need to transfer additional proteins to help it. After reviewing the literature, we found that there is a cI protein in λ phage, which can achieve both the promotion and inhibition of a same promoter by binding DNA sequences at different positions on a specific promoter. Thus, a DNA sequence that binds to a cI protein resulting in transcriptional activation is fused to other promoters and subjected to some artificial design, such that the cI protein significantly enhances expression of the downstream product of the promoter. According to this principle, the protein has even been applied to the construction of a prokaryotic two-hybrid system, and its effect is expected to be significant.
Fig.13 A)The gene circuit design of the experiment group, with Plac promotes the transcription of CI and Plac/CI promotes the transcription of GFP. Both the promoters are activated by IPTG and Plac/CI is additionally activated by CI. B) The gene circuit design of the control group, in which CI is absent. C) A general view of the structure of CI, emphasizing the functional domains.
Module 6 : T7 RNA polymerase and its promoter
The T7final part we constructed contains the lactose operon, GFP, T7 ploymerase, T7 promoter, GDH, and ampicillin resistance genes, of which GDH and T7 ploymerase are coupled to express by TGATG structure. Our experiments focus on how to use positive feedback regulation to ensure the expression of the target gene on the plasmid by the growth-promoting effect of gdh. The specific mechanism is to couple GFP to T7 RNA Polymerase gene by TGATG structure. That is, to express GFP, the corresponding T7RNA Polymerase gene will also be expressed. But since the ribosome will have a certain probability of detaching from the mRNA when it encounters the TGA stop codon of GFP during translation, the translation of the T7RNA Polymerase gene will be less than the translation of the GFP gene, at the same time, the T7RNA Polymerase produced specifically activates the T7promoter downstream of the plasmid, allowing the gdh gene behind it to be expressed, and gdh promotes the growth of the bacterium. The result is that in the bacteria the more GFP is produced, the more T7 RNA Polymerase is expressed, and more T7 promoters will be activated to express more gdh which enables the high"
BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," simulate the concentration of plasmids losing on different levels. Three kinds of plasmids, pSB1k3 (100~200 copies), pSB3k3 (20~30 copies), pSB4k5 (5~10 copies), are chosen and constructed with target fragment. By observing our system's working conditions, we can finally prove its function of controlling plasmids number.
Goal
(1) Simulate the plasmids losing on different levels
(2) Prove that our system is functional
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.6.
Fig.6 The gene circuits of threshold device with constitutive promoter.
(1) We constructed the circuit on different plasmids with different copy numbers.
(2) The locus of constitutive promoter will be replaced by another constitutive promoter which has the similar strength as PBAD promoter.
We assume that:
When the number of plasmids is less than N, inhibitor is not strong enough to inhibit the in-promoter totally, so the killer gene will express triggering the death of bacteria. On the contrary, if the number of plasmids is higher than N, the bacteria won't die.
We expect that in the high copy number plasmid circuit, fluorescence gene will express, and in the low copy number plasmid circuit, there will no fluorescence.
Forth step
The threshold of plasmid number is decided by the relationship between inhibitor and in-promoter. To achievement the goal of build a controllable system, we decide to use different RBS (B0034 B0032) and promoters (J23119 J23116 J23109) with different strengths to change their concentrations. Thus we can finally change the threshold of plasmid as we hope.
Goal
(1) Adjust the threshold of plasmids by substituting different biobricks.
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.7.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," genetically                                 modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with general                                 physical or chemical measurement approaches.
Consequently, we originally established CACCI based on chemotaxis and interference to                                 make a larger level of antibiotic molecule detection, even a detection for other                                 chemical molecules. So, the mechanism and construction of CACCI can be divided into the                                 following schedules:
Chemotaxis Modification: to increase the bacterial mobility, modification based on E. coli chemotaxis related to the parts cheZ will be introduced into bacteria.
Permeability Improvement: Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic circuit is very difficult. Consequently, CACCI is also established with systematic permeability reconstruction to increase its capability on molecules absoprtion.
Adhesion: According to our modeling, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface. Theoretically, when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria containing cheZ parts--occurred on the film, interference will be observed.
In order to make bacteria firmly adhere to the film, two strategies for strong adhesion are taken into consideration, which including electrostatic interaction using polylysine(PLL) and covalent interaction by modifying bacterial transmembrane protein, which is based on the principle of clickable chemistry. Polylysine containing positive charge binds to gram-negative bacteria owing to their negative outer membrane. Consequently, strong electrostatic interaction between polylysine and bacterial membrane will take place theoretically. Moreover, covalent ligation will be established between the bacteria and the film to ensure stable adhesion. In order to achieve covalently adhesion, modification on bacterial transmembrane protein is necessary.
3.Package: In order to let everyone use the integrated improvement bacteria, CACCI in a more convenient way, we will provide CACCI in powder. We hope one day, iGEM could not only share parts, but also share device, a nanomachine with mature functional system.
Chemotaxis Modification                                 Module
What is Chemotaxis?
Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specific cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules. As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on the bacteria membrane, which enables the bacteria to 'sense' the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings. Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial"

Malek, Lena, Lisa and Elia performed all research relative to cell lysates and toehold switches and were helped by Natalija in their investigation of toeholds.
Malek and Lisa performed the trigger modularity experiments in PURE and cell lysates and tested the software output in vivo.
Software and wiki
Everyone in the team participated in the     writing of the texts for the wiki page of the team. The design of the logo was     imagined by Felix and improved with the help of the rest of the team.
Lena and Tim provided the     MATLAB graphs sustaining capital information about our research. Matteo provided the R graphs for the binding saturation curves of the aptamers.
Matteo and Lena facilitated     the comprehension of the theory behind our manipulations by drawing complementary schemes.
Natalija focused on building a solid foundation     for our wiki page and on displaying all of our data on it; in addition to that,     she managed to nearly single-handedly encode the     toehold design program of the team and compute a novel toehold later proven functional.     We thank Prof. Dr. Alexander Green for his feedback on the designed software.
Human practices & Scientific outreach
Many members of the team participated in several conventions     and contributed to make the knowledge they acquired during the competition accessible     to as many people as possible:
Malek and Lisa joined a summer school in     Davos, Switzerland, proposed by EPFL in which they presented the scientific investigation     pursued in the lab.
Jonathan and Tim represented iGEM EPFL 2017 in the     iGEM European Meet-Up held in Delft, Netherlands.
Lena, Lisa and Felix flew to Cambridge, Great Britain,     in order to attend the Open Plant convention.
Elia prepared the mini-kit, guaranteed its biological safety,     its user-friendly facet, and wrote the associated protocols.
Jonathan reached out to professors and administrators of     distribution platforms in order to review and ensure the proper distribution of the kit after     the end of the competition.
Elia and Tim made contact with Medisupport in order to have inputs from the industry of diagnostics.
Collaborations
Lena was responsible for the numerous     collaborations of the team with other iGEM teamslocated at different places across the world.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," at the frequency of once a day, the microbiome could report to us and remind us when that frequency is off.
When we interviewed Professor March, we discussed the possibility of using our system as a safety valve for ferritin nanoparticles so that they do not trigger during sustained heat or fluctuations of waves. Ferritin nanoparticles are normally used to present antigens or drugs to target cells in response to an external stimuli, such as heat. If these nanoparticles were to be placed in bacteria and then exposed to heat, it would cause them to express the antigens or drugs before they have reached their target cells. To address this concern, we would introduce the ferritin nanoparticles into the cells of frequency-sensitive bacteria. When we wish to have the ferritin nanoparticles carry out a specific task in the body, we would then use ultrasounds to heat up the bacteria to particular frequencies for selective expression. Though Professor March suggested applying this idea in environments with temperature fluctuations and gave us the aforementioned application ideas, he also challenged us to find our own comprehensive application for our project, as our work should not simply exist in a vacuum.
When we interviewed Professor Varner, he introduced the prospect of cell-free synthesis, the formation of cellular products without the actual cells. In essence, we would take the cellular machinery involved in the production of, for example, proteins, and mix them together in a beaker with the frequency-sensitive bacteria. We would then add plasmids to the solution as an alternative to traditional cellular DNA and produce the desired reporters. The process would be modulated by the specific frequencies aimed toward the beaker solution. When the bacteria in the beaker pick up on the appropriate frequency, the desired products would be produced until the frequency is removed. During our discussion with Professor Varner, he mentioned the possibility implementing our biocircuit for cell-free synthesis implants for in vivo therapeutic production of proteins. In these, we could non-invasive control protein expression levels, allowing adaptability to dynamic patient needs.
Group Brainstorming
In addition to the feedback from the professors, our Policy & Practices sub-team held a large brainstorming session on September 15th during our weekly team-wide meeting where we opened the floor to our team members to collect a wide array of ideas for possible applications of our project. We received a huge range of suggestions from food storage to applications in space. Each idea had potential, as well as their respective advantages and drawbacks, so it was difficult for us to settle on one single idea. However, we were eventually able to narrow our results down to five main categories: co-culturing, process control, biological clocks, medical devices"

Charles Green
We spoke with Deputy Commissioner Charles Green of Virginia’s Department of  Agriculture and Consumer Services to discuss the effect of GMO’s on Virginia’s  economic and social policy. Within iGEM, many teams develop projects that solve key  problems in society, but fail to establish methods in which their project can fit into policy.  It was our hope that, through discussion with Deputy Commissioner Green, we could  find a niche within state legislation that would benefit from our technology, or in some  way be improved by opening up the floor for discussion.
Deputy Commissioner Green spoke toward the differences between state and  federal legislation toward synthetic biology. The issues of development and deployment  of synthetically modified crops has been dealt with as an economic issue within the  state. As such, most focus has been focused on the import and export of GMO’s, as well  as local labeling regulations to deal with growing social movements within the state and  country. According to Deputy Commissioner Green, regulation is performed on a federal  level by agencies such as the EPA and USDA, depending on the product being  produced.
An interesting point brought up in our discussion with Deputy Commissioner  Green was that of international standards. A major issue facing synthetic biology  legislation is that of maintaining a reasonable and internationally accepted standard.  Two major roadblocks exist, that of varying levels of regulation, and different paces of  countrywide legislation. The first point details cases in which a GMO is accepted in one  country but not another, leading to difficulties with trade and commerce. To address this  point, we hoped that opening the floor for discussion of a global standard for GMO’s  would help facilitate trade and partially eliminate this issue. The second problem exists  between countries with different methods of regulation, such as China and the United  States. A product in the U.S can pass through regulations quicker than in China due to a  well-established infrastructure. This delay in approval sometimes results in large losses  to exports, slowing down trade and causing additional issues between countries.
Overall, our discussion with Deputy Commissioner Green gave us a greater  insight into the interplay between federal and state law. We learned more about the  depth of the legislative issues surrounding synthetic biology, including economic, social,  and international considerations. This interview helped us to consider the importance of  an internationally accepted standard for synthetic biology. His insights greatly informed  the creation of the policy proposal .

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Presentation_-_-_TEXT.html,". Enzymes can be placed on the cell surface using Ice Nucleation Protein (or INP), which seems to automagically transport itself to the outer membrane. We used a synthetic INP gene created by the 2009 UC Davis team.
[Slide: Cell display schematic]
By creating a fusion of a cellulase to Ice Nucleation Protein, it should be possible to have that cellulase carried to the outer membrane. A fully working system would incorporate multiple cellulases, displaying at a number of up to 100,000 in total.
[Slide: BioSandwich]
The creation of fusion proteins poses interesting DNA assembly challenges, and is usually impossible using standard assembly of RFC10 parts. We pioneered the use of a new protocol, BioSandwich, invented by our supervisor Chris French. This assembly method is based on RFC10-compliant parts, but assembles them in a homology-based way. The homology between parts is created by attaching oligonucleotides to the end of each part.
[Slide: INP-YFP]
As a proof both that BioSandwich works, and that INP works, we successfully attached INP to Yellow Fluorescent Protein. When we centrifuged the cells, we found that the fluorescence seemed to be localised to the membrane fraction, seen at the bottom of the tube. Ordinary YFP would be present to a much greater extent in the cytoplasm, as shown on the left.
[Slide: bglX]
Before we attach enzymes to INP, we wanted to BioBrick them and test them. We successfully created a new β-glucosidase based on a cryptic E. coli gene, bglX. This slide shows that it is capable of degrading the cellobiose analog MUG. We also characterised the ability of an exoglucanase, cex, to degrade MUG and MUC, which is a larger cellulose-like molecule.
We have fused this enzyme, and also cex, to INP. At this time, further experiments are required to test for activity.
[This might improve by the Jamboree.]
[Slide: malS]
Another BioBrick we created was the amylase malS, the first amylase in the Registry. Amylases degrade starch, not cellulose, but a fusion of INP to malS could be useful as a test system, since degradation of starch requires just this one enzyme. We proved that this BioBrick has some starch-degrading activity with an iodine assay: iodine turns starch"

Heat shock was carried out at different temperatures in a water bath. Then, the cuvettes were maintained at room temperature and OD and fluorescence intensity were measured at different time points.
During the first experiments, we did not get any successful result... As we can see in the following graph, fluorescence emission showed no significant increasement after different heat-shock treatments:
Figure 7. Fluorescence intensity (FI) normalized by the optical density (OD) of cultures subjected to a 44 ºC heat-shock treatment of different durations. Heat-shock was not applied in the control experiment.
That was suspicious! Since we were sure that our experimental set-up was fine, we decided to check if our bacteria were actually carrying the right construction (Bac2, that consisted of groE promoter + AsRed2). Then, we found out that we had lying bacteria in the lab! Cheaters !
After that, we started to perform new experiments with ""honest"" bacteria, and good results arrived soon: as shown in the graphs below, we found a correlation between the temperature at which heat shock was carried out and the level of expression of the fluorescent protein. Higher fluorescence intensity was obtained when higher temperatures (ranging from 40 to 44 ºC) were applied (check the molecular mechanism details ). According to our results, it seems that protein expression cannot keep increasing at temperatures higher than 44 ºC, probably due to lethality effects.

were subjected to a 10-min heat-shock at different temperatures. Measures were taken 60 min

Cas13a - Accurate detection of specific genes
Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) is a Class 2 type VI-A CRISPR-Cas effector that specifically targets RNA ( O. O. Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ). Due to the potential use of Cas13a as a broad range detection tool we attempted to turn the protein and its required guide sequence into a BioBrick. The construct was delivered in three fragments that had to be assembled with the backbone into a plasmid. In parallel, we expressed Cas13a from a plasmid ( pC013 ) containing Leptotrichia wadei Cas13a (LwCas13a), received from the authors of Gootenberg et al. 2017 .
Multipurpose plasmid construction
In this section, the synthesis of a BioBrick encoding for Cas13a is explained. Firstly, the sequence for LwCas13a was extracted from Gootenberg et al. 2017 . This DNA construct (7.7 kb), was ordered in three separate parts, denoted part 1 (2.5 kb), part 2 (1.6 kb) and part 3 (0.3 kb). See Figure 1 for an overview of how the assembled plasmid should look like (see the Cas13a notebook for the entire process of assembling this plasmid). After Gibson Assembly (GA), a PCR was run on the resulting GA mixture and the product was loaded on a gel. This showed that part 2 and part 3 were successfully assembled.
Figure 1: Schematic overview of our multipurpose Cas13a construct. The insert was delivered in three parts: part 1 (green), part 2 (blue) and part 3 (red). The backbone ( pSB4A5 ) is depicted in yellow.
This part was PCR-amplified from the GA mix (see Figure 2). Subsequently, another Gibson Assembly was done with part 1, the ligated part 2 and part 3 and the backbone ( pSB4A5 ). We transformed the GA mixture several times unsuccessfully (see the Cas13a notebook ). When amplifying the ligation mixture we obtained a band corresponding to the size of 7.7 kb, which indicated the presence of the fully assembled plasmid (Figure 3), at least in"

With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

Mr. Zhang Haoqian introduced us to “Synthetic Biology”, “What is the current research field of synthetic biology and frontier progress”, “What is iGEM” and “Experience in guiding iGEM in previous years” around synthetic biology and iGEM. Afterwards, they entered the reporting stage of each team. Several participating university representatives gave speeches in turn, and reported on their topics. Teacher Zhang Haoqian asked questions and answered questions. Among them, Mr. Zhang puts forward practical considerations for our original project ideas, and believes that the path we design will have certain problems of reducing practicability, which will benefit a lot. Therefore, in the later experiments, we carried out the improvement of the subject, and pointed out the research direction of our subject in terms of practicality. At this point, the Nanjing iGEM exchange meeting has come to a successful conclusion!"

NUS Singapore
Wilbert from the Singapore University team was extremely helpful, assisting us with any number of iGEM components and technicalities. He enthusiastically gave us pointers about the Jamboree as well as the iGEM “Do’s and Don’ts”. Because this is our first year participating in the iGEM competition, Wilbert meticulously explained some of the more obscure steps to achieve medal criteria. Most importantly, Wilbert graciously helped us with the Modeling component of our project involving the substitution of various Ribosomal Binding Sites. We can't wait to meet him in November!

Our team held a long Skype discussion concerning the iGem process and goals, as well as the Interlab , wiki details, and activities at the Jamboree with the teams from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marines. The US Navy team advised us to complete the Interlab carefully and to use the already provided Excel spreadsheet. On our side, we guided the US Army team with troubleshooting their project. After the video conference, we were able to finish the Interlab swiftly with few hiccups.
Michigan State Meet-up
We attended the mini-Jamboree/meet-up on July 29th at Michigan State University. It was an awesome experience with several teams from across the Midwest gathering to discuss their projects. Our team gave a short presentation and received both criticism and praise concerning our work. It was fascinating to learn about the research and progress of the other iGEM groups! After the presentations, we talked with members from the other teams about everything iGEM!  We even spoke with an iGEM veteran who gave us extremely insightful advice on the inner workings of the Jamboree."

NCBS garden and exhibition
How are science stories told?
Yesterday, we saw the exhibition about bioprospecting at NCBS, Such Treasure & Rich Merchandize , told through curated plants and images. How do other iGEM teams tell the story of their work? Harvard's Christina Agapakis has a great blog called Oscillator that investigates art and design as well as synbio, this year she is running the Harvard iGEM team, who are making a lovely wiki documenting their work.  Semiconductor Film's Magnetic Movie takes voice interviews with scientists at NASA Space Sciences Laboratory, UC Berkeley, California, talking about magnetism and gravitational field and other invisible forces, making them visible and tangible through sound and animation laid over real spaces.

Miller Urey Experiment, Cloaca, contraption from Man in the White Suit
After the great narratives told this morning, we looked at precedents of other artists and designers telling stories through objects, from tales about manufacturing and sustainability Thomas Thwaites' Toaster Project , to alternative histories - Sascha Pohflepp's Golden Institute to frame the present and future.
Noam Toran and Onkar Kular's Macguffin Library takes plot devices from films, nicknamed Macguffins by Hitchock, and collates them into a physical library, some from real films, interspersed with some of their own fiction. Feelings are Facts , a new collaborative installation by Olafur Eliasson in Beijing creates a physical environment through mist, coloured light, and sound to tell a story.
Thinking about ecosytems, we considered Wim Delvoyes's Cloaca system in context with the famous Miller-Urey Experiment , which recreated the first development of life, with scene's from classic Ealing comedy The Man in the White Suit , where great sound design creates the atmosphere of scientific discovery.

PART 0 Safety Q&A
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Is there a local bio-safety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local bio-safety group think about your project? If no, which specific bio-safety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through.......

Ethics and regulations
We thought to confirm whether our project meets ethics, but ethics is very vague, so we decided to research about <a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Counter/Project?page=Humanpractice-block&contents=Humanpractice-2 "">ethics</a>.
iGEM Japan
iGEM Japan is an organization which was founded last year for iGEM teams in Japan to cooperate each other.
In March, iGEM Kyoto held iGEM-Japan West meeting. In this meeting, we shared each team's project and advised each other. This meeting was very useful because we could find our idea's weak point.
In August, iGEM TMU-Tokyo held iGEM-Japan East meeting, and we made presentations about our projects and criticized each other. Thanks to these meetings, we developed quality of our projects.

Overview
From ethical codes, we examined whether our projects and their application can be sanctioned. However, “ETHICS” is not steadfast rather mutable. Each SOCIETY, RELIGION, and CULTURE, which one belongs to, ingrains us what we call “ETHICS.” Even in the same society, religion, and culture, a slight difference among educational levels and living situations lets us have nonidentical moral values. Being in such dissimilarity, researchers must take the diverse values into consideration in order to justify their researches and applications.
The regulation including the law, which is standardized from prevailed beliefs and ethical values among the society, permits individual’s act unless violating others’ rights. We deduced that the regulation is involved with attitudes toward the research along with various ethical values. It is essential for each iGEM member to understand and comply with the law, regulations, and guidelines which are determined by international organizations and domestic government agencies.
However, it is difficult for undergraduate students such as iGEM members to fully understand these laws, regulations, and guidelines and apply them to their projects. Here, we edited a brief version of the complicated matters for other members. We also assessed our current projects in terms of their safety and risks, which can be caused by their application, and then we clarified that our anticipated risks would not surpass our risk management ability."

Tartu_TUIT,2018,Team:Tartu TUIT#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ae, and macroalgae [9] . Nowadays, more than 30 different types of MAAs have been identified [10] . MAAs consist of cyclohexanone or cyclohexenimine chromophore attached to the nitrogen substituent of an amino acid or amino alchohol [11] .
Two types of MAAs , Shinorine and Porphyra-334 (Figure 1), were originally isolated from red algae Porphyra Umbilicalis. These MAAs have relatively high UV – absorption in the range from 310 to 365 nm that covers UV-A and UV-B parts of the light spectrum [10] . While both substances are efficient UV-sunscrening compounds, Porphyra-334 also possesses anti-aging effects [12] and even works as an antioxidant [13] . Therefore, the use of Shinorire and Porphyra as ingredients in cosmetic products has potential advantages to humans. In addition to that, these MAAs are safe to the marine environment, since they are both parts of naturally – existing light protective mechanism in algae [14]
Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.2.
Currently, the only source of MAAs for the industry is their extraction from red algae. This process is time- and cost-consuming since red algae have a long life cycle and they require specific conditions for artificial cultivation (temperature, nutrients, etc.). Specific light is also essential for the optimal MAA production resulting in the variations of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 yield from harvest to harvest [15] [16] .To date, Helioguard 365 is the first commercially produced natural sunscreen, which incorporates MAAs as UV absorbents. Helioguard 365, protects skin from photo-aging and helps to prevent the appearance of lines and wrinkles [17] .
MAA production
Our team was inspired by the work of researchers from the University of Florida, who used Synechocystis sp PCC6803 – as a host for the heterologous production of Shinorine. Shinorine gene cluster was taken from filamentous cyanobacterium Fisherella sp. PCC9339. By optimizing gene expression, researchers managed to get the yield of Shinorine comparable to that obtained from the commercially used Shinorine producer.
The work has proved that it is possible to efficiently produce MAA under laboratory conditions using a synthetic biology approach, which is cheaper and faster than farming [18] .
Two obtain two natural UV-protecting compounds, Shinorine and Porphyra-334, we decided"

Rationale and Aim
Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations that hamper the success in biosensors development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This part can be used within the platform as a Processor unit. Real world applications of biosensors are limited by many factors, one of which is that with most biosensors there is not a readout signal showing if the biosensor is working when not in use, i.e that the cells are still alive and have not lost their bios"

4.3Environment safety
Overview
The goal of our project iPSCs Safeguard is to minimize the potential risks of iPSCs. However, with the suicide genes and the lentiviral vectors we used, our design may be argued to potentially bring about new safety risks. What we are delivering here is an organized outcome of the various discussions we had for each parts about their safety in this summer.
Lentivirus safety
Lentivirus method is widely used in both biological research and gene therapy. It can intergrate genes into the genome of target cells. Though we cannot avoid the oncogenic risk of lentivirus transfection, however, for iPSCs and hepatoma cells, lentivirus method is nearly the only way for stable transfection. While most vectors don't have the ability to transfect to iPSCs and hapatoma cells, or the inserted genes are easy to be lost, lentivirus not only guarantee efficiency, but stability as well. In addition, in lentivirus vectors the transcription and translation of our target genes are more likely to those processes of other eukaryotic genes. So the product of the circuit can be easier to be predicted and controlled, because it is more likely to natural products in eukaryotic cells. Our circuit is aiming at stable and long guard against carcinogenesis. From this point of view, more stable the circuit is, more safety it guarantees.
A fact we must admit here is the potential risks of lentivirus for integrating into host cell genome and thus bringing about new safety threats . However, when comparing with the heavy fact that the intrinsic tumorigenesis risks cuased by the four reprogramming transcrption factors, the potential pressure of the delivery system seems to be much lighter. Anyway, before put into use, we must do more experiment to measure its risks and try additional methods to ensure its safety.
Suicide gene safety
RIP1 and RIP3<a class=""quote"">[1]</a> are effective suicide genes, as we tested, but it not only cause apoptosis, but also cause necrosis. This may be a potential risk of inflammatory response. However, the possibility for normal cells to become cancer cells is very low, so the amount of cell death caused by"

Seeing is believing...
Live had been on earth for 3.6 billion years. Over time living-beings evolved, merged, devoured and mutated. Cells are having ever massive networks and interactions that is far beyond foreseeable. And now we are only slowly discovering the secret of life. Through this sea of proteins, fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins are like light houses that allows scientist to hold on with faith. As the saying goes, ""Seeing is believing"". Therefore, we decided to dedicate our iGEM project to this wonderful technology.
We focus on producing a dual light sensitive circuit in order to evolve a red fluorescent protein, mKeima. At the same time we wish to establish a noble concept of ""Evolution circuit"" and associated high-throughput evolution protocols.
mKeima?
                             Take a journey here into where mKeima come from and how it works!
Dual light sensor
The architecture of dual light sensor revolves around the trick of overlapping fluorescent spectra. In this project, we improvised the overlapping of mKeima emission and Cph8 excitation wavelength. They are fused together, becoming Cph8-mKeima chimera to bring them to close proximity. Cph8 is a fusion protein which was firstly used for bacterial photography.It is able to relay signal to E.coli via phosphorylation of OmpR.
The Evolution Circuit
In order to turn the dual light sensitive chimera to full usability, optimization of the protein structure is necessary. To achieve that, there are generally two ways: Rational Design or Directed Evolution. Rational approach is both time consuming and challenging unless the target protein had been well studied. Alternatively, directed evolution is tedious but they always work and it is where most of the time significant ""surprises"" are discovered. In our case where we are optimizing a chimera, rational approach is beyond interpretation. Hence, we setup a journey to engineer an evolution circuit.
An elegant solution of it is to introduce a eGFP reporter with Omp promoter to respond to level of phosphorylated OmpR. Omp promoter capture the signal and output it as eGFP expression which correspond to the strength of response to blue or red light. In short, the better is the mutant, the greener is the cell. This eGFP brightness can then be detected by cell"

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html,", having only one strain that does everything is a huge advantage, because only one bioreactor and one production line is needed. This makes it accessible to community labs or NGOs that would want to start producing their own version of our product.
Our design
From the lab to the world
For a biological product to leave the benches and actually reach the population, it's essential to foresee its life in the hands of the people who will cultivate it and make sure it stays alive for the future. Our design must therefore provide strategies to create a durable, usable product. On paper, the plan is simple: the manufacturers grow the micro-organism, distribute it and save a little fraction with which to start a new culture. This could in principle continue ad infinitum, but in reality the universal rules of biology soon kick back in.
Let's consider the following scenario: a wild type organism sneaks into the incubator and starts to replicate along with the engineered organism. Our microbe cannot compete: this contaminant has been selected precisely for its ability to sneak into environments and replicate, during hundreds of years, while our microbe has the burden of producing tons of enzymes to make the precious vitamins. Additionally, unnatural proteins and metabolites can have toxic effects when their production rate is high. After a couple of growth cycles, the worst seems unavoidable: the microorganism that will be distributed will not be the right one. Not only does it not produce nutrients, but it might not ferment the rice well or even be pathogenic.
These contamination events bring a lot of hassle for the manufacturer, so our design must provide solutions for making them as rare as possible.
Our approaches is based on two strategies:
Reducing the fitness burden: To make our micro-organism more resistant to contamination, we need to design it so our modifications come with a minimal fitness cost.
Identifying the contamination: If a contamination occurs, it is essential that it does not go unnoticed. Our design must allow the manufacturer to detect contamination, and check that what he is growing is exactly what he wants to grow.
It seems impossible to make a strain that fullfills its nutrient-producing functions while growing as fast as the wild type, so we found a workaround: the cells that people use are not the cells that people grow.
We embedded a differentiation system into our organism, so the vitamin-producing pathways are only expressed after a recombination event. First, the cells that are grown are almost identical to the wild-type cells. The battle against contaminants is now a fair fight. The only difference is that they express a gene allowing for their identification, that we will further refer to"

Moreover, they got into contact with Dr. Tatiana Mingote Ferreira de Azara, Health Surveillance Secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, providing us with even more details.

Dr. Tatiana Mingote Ferreira de Azara
Health Surveillance Secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Health
Via iGEM USP-Brazil , we got the opinions of dr. Tatiana Mingote from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. According to her, the Brazilian government faces lots of issues dealing with infectious diseases. The main bottleneck of diagnostic tests is not the costs but the limited production capacity. Moreover, the reliability of current diagnostic field tests is insufficient. Also, the Brazilian government does not recommend the use of current vaccines. Lastly, the fight against mosquitoes is difficult because of the bad water distribution system and the rainy seasons.
Implementation
We now obtained enough in-depth information about viral diseases in South America. There are many similarities between epidemics, but also a lot of differences. We have to take this into account when implementing our diagnostic test. This is why we explain the situation in Africa and South America as separate cases in our roll-out plan.
What will be our future scenario?
Previously, we have been advised at the Rathenau Institute to work out a techno-moral scenario for our device. This will be a future perspective for our diagnostic test. Here we answer the question: how would our world change if health care would become open source? We wanted to discuss this with an expert.
Dr. Henk van den Belt
Philosophy teacher at Wageningen University & Research, iGEM Human Practices judge 2011
We discussed this techno-moral scenario with dr. Henk van den Belt. While the current patent-based market has its flaws, it doesn’t seem likely that there will be a major change soon. Money is a major driver of innovation and by using patents companies can protect their claim. Furthermore it seems unlikely that an open source based market could be installed or effectively sustain itself alongside a patent-based market.

Final conclusions
This all resulted in the project as it is presented on the Wiki right now!
What started out as a device capable of diagnosing people went through a vector monitoring phase and resulted in a robust device that can be used for large-scale screening during epidemic situations. We gained insight into the situation"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"
