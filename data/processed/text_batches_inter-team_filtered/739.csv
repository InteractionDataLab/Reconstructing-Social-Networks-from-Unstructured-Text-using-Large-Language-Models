Figure 1: Schema of the fungicide module
The main objective of SubtiTree is to ensure the destruction of the pathogenic fungi inside the tree.   In order to achieve this goal, we built a genetic module to produce three different peptides with antifungal activities. This triple therapy provides    the advantage to minimize the resistance phenomenon.
Originally from plants, these peptides have different targets thus increasing the lethality on Ceratocystis platani.
D4E1 is a synthetic peptide analog to Cecropin B AMPs (AntiMicrobial Peptides) made of 17 amino acids  which has been shown to have an antifungal activity by complexing with a sterol present in the conidia’s wall of numerous fungi.
GAFP-1 (Gastrodia Anti Fungal Protein 1), also known as gastrodianin, is a mannose and chitin binding lectin  originating from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb cultured for thousands of years.   GAFP-1 accumulates in nutritive corms where the fungal infection takes place, and in vitro assays demonstrated it can inhibit the growth of   ascomycete and basidiomycete fungal plant pathogens.
EcAMP-1 (Echinochloa crus-galli AntiMicrobial Peptide) consists in 37 amino acids inhibiting hyphae elongation  EcAMP-1 is the first example of AMP with a novel disulfide-stabilized-α helical hairpin fold. It is isolated from kernels of barnyard grass.  EcAMP-1 exhibits high activity against fungi of the genus Fusarium.

We built different genetic constructions to test each fungicide separately and to test them all together on the same operon. The three genes coding for the  antifungal"

9.Positive Contribution:
All participants are required to work hard to build positive contributions to society and have lots of fun!
Requirements For Software Track
1.End User Documentation
Core requirements are:
Wiki documentation of project aims, methods and success -- in line with the general iGEM requirements
Detailed installation or setup instructions (if applicable)
An well-designed User Guide explaining how to use of your program or tool
2.Re-Use and Best software development practices
Core requirements are:
Submission of your complete source code and any auxiliary files to the iGEM github repository
Use git versioninig from the start of your project so that the commit history is / will be available on github
Comprehensive code documentation for outside developers
Highly recommended:
More than one realistic test case
Automated unit tests, documentation of test coverage
API documentation, preferably automatically built from source code documentation
Bonus points for:
Use of SBOL and other standards
Re-use and further development of previous iGEM software projects (or parts thereof)
Use and/or improvement of existing synthetic biology tools or frameworks
development of well documented libraries for other developers rather than ""only"" stand-alone Apps for end users
3.Relevance and Validation
Core requirements are:
Demonstrate the relevance of your development for Synthetic Biolgy
Highly recommended:
Devise an experimental test for your program/algorithm/work flow
The experimental validation of software/computational projects is not expected to result in a super fancy engineering project. Instead we would like to see simple and straightforward experiments (for example: gene synthesis, expression, fluorescence of x constructs) which can be delegated to external labs or collaborating teams. iGEM/software will try to support teams who want to outsource experimental testing to academic or commercial labs. Details will follow.

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

In addition bdh2 was tested to see whether its presence increased growth for the cells. This was completed with 3 3HB concentrations - 100 μM, 10 mM and 100 mM. ANOVA analysis shows that there is no significant difference between any of the constructs (F 4,10 = 0.1875, p < 0.9396). Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Bdh2 with no pelB secretion tag growth. Bdh2 MG1655 cells were grown in M9S media to gauge growth, the growth does not differ from the control as p = 0.5543. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Bdh2 with no pelB secretion tag fluorescence. MG1655 cells with bdh2 were grown in M9S and then tested for fluorescence by measuring their GFP output. There is significant fluorescence as p < 0.0001. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusion:We can conclude that there is a slight increase in the growth rate of bdh2 containing cells at 10 000 uM 3HB. This suggests that bdh2 is able to function as expected and produces acetoacetate which is used by the cell`s central metabolic pathways for growth. At 100uM or 100 000 uM, we did not observe any differences in growth. This could be be because the rate limiting step at low concentrations could be the uptake of 3HB rather than it`s conversion to acetoacetate. We hope that we could observe an increase in growth if we added the putative permease we designed to the system. At higher level, there is a drop in growth rates in both bdh2 and control cells, probably because of toxicity issues. In addition, fluorescence is highly elevated in bdh2 compared to empty vector control.

Der var så dejligt ude på landet; det var sommer, kornet stod gult, havren grøn, høet var rejst i stakke nede i de grønne enge, og der gik storken på sine lange, røde ben og snakkede ægyptisk, for det sprog havde han lært af sin moder. Rundt om ager og eng var der store skove, og midt i skovene dybe søer; jo, der var rigtignok dejligt derude på landet! Midt i solskinnet lå der en gammel herregård med dybe kanaler rundt om, og fra muren og ned til vandet voksede store skræppeblade, der var så høje, at små børn kunne stå oprejste under de største; der var lige så vildsomt derinde, som i den tykkeste skov, og her lå en and på sin rede; hun skulle ruge sine små ællinger ud, men nu var hun næsten ked af det, fordi det varede så længe, og hun sjælden fik visit; de andre ænder holdt mere af at svømme om i kanalerne, end at løbe op og sidde under et skræppeblad for at snadre med hende.

In order to repress translation, the  cis-repressing sequence need to interact with the RBS, and so the interaction depends on the sequences. Since different teams used different RBS to design their cis-repressing  sequences, we also had to use corresponding RBS for characterization. We had a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23102 ) to drive the  expression of the cis-repressed GFP translation unit. For the expression taRNA, we wanted to control the expression and therefore we decided to use the arabinose inducible  PBAD promoter ( BBa_I0500 ). The promoter was chosen because the 3’ end after the transcription start site of the  promoter is short. Longer 3’ end can affect the function of the taRNA (Isaacs et al., 2004) (Figure 1. A).
For the riboregulator system to work, the repression of GFP synthesis needs to be first observed when the cis-repressing sequence is added 5’ of the RBS of the system.    Significant repression can be seen in Lock 1-Key1, Lock 3-Key 3, and Medium lock (Lock m)-Key for medium lock (Key m) cognate pairs (Figure 1. B, C, D respectively). Almost    full repression was observed for the three cognate pairs. For Lock 3c-Key 3c pair, we do not see repression when cis-repressing sequence is introduced to the system. Instead,   converse can be observed. When we don’t have cis-repressing sequence, we see significant drop in the fluorescence (Figure 1.E). One possible reason could be that the RBS    sequence that we used for the controls of Lock 3c Key 3c was incorrect. For Lock3c the target RBS sequence was not mentioned. It seemed like a variation of BBa_B0034 with shorter 3’ end. In order to build the construct type 2 and 3 (Figure 1. A), the RBS sequence had to be    deduced from the Lock 3c sequence. From the Lock 3c sequence, we have used a part of sequence that resembled the RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The RBS sequence used may have been too short to be functional. Therefore, no fluorescence is observed when cis-repressing sequence is not present. On the other hand,    fluorescence can be observed when cis-repressing sequence is present because firstly, the RBS is sequence is correct, and secondly because"

2. sRNA REGULATORY SYSTEM
2.1 INTRODUCTION
In order to enter passwords sequentially, we designed a password-control system by engineering artificial small RNAs for conditional gene silencing in E.co-Lock. A majority of the trans-acting sRNAs in bacteria interact with the untranslated region (UTR) and the translation initiation region of the targeted mRNAs via imperfect base pairing, resulting in reduced translation efficiency and mRNA stability. Additionally, bacterial sRNAs often contain distinct scaffolds that recruit RNA chaperones such as Hfq to facilitate gene regulation (Fig.2-1).
In this study, we describe a strategy to engineer artificial sRNAs that can regulate desired genes in E.coli. Using LacZ as reporter gene that was fused to a native 30 mRNA leader sequence, active artificial sRNAs were screened from libraries in which natural sRNA scaffolds were fused to a designed antisense domain. Artificial sRNAs that posttranscriptionally repress two genes ipgC and sicA were isolated and characterized.
We anticipate that the artificial sRNAs will be useful for dynamic control and fine-tuning of endogenous gene expression in bacteria for applications in synthetic biology.
2.2 IDEA AND DESIGN

The process of design small RNAs regulatory plasmid
1)Construction of small RNAs regulatory system. The system is composed of box1 and box2. The model figure is as below.
2)．Screening of function silencing sequences.
(a)Add target-gene and anti-target-gene sequence to small RNAs regulatory system by One-step Site-directed Mutagenesis.
(b)Verify the effect of silence.
2.3 RESULTS
In our protocol, we design two kinds of sRNAs, including sRNA-sicA and sRNA-ipgC. Based on the reference “Design and use of synthetic regulatory small RNAs to control gene expression in Escherichia coli[1]”, we try to design sRNA-sicA for 24nt and sRNA-ipgC for 15nt. Their secondary structure figures are as follows. Now, we will introduce how to explore the inhibition efficiency of the sRNA.
We constructed two boxes in the PSB1C3 plasmid, the gene in the box1 could express normally the sRNA which inhibit the target gene in the box2.So we could measure the enzyme activity of the β-galactosidase"

When the polymerization reaction is over, the newly generated cellulose is secreted to the extracellular through these sites. The following figure is a partial schematic of the production of cellulose by G. xylinus
We hope to optimize the metabolic pathway of bacterial cellulose, redirecting more carbon sources into the production of bacterial cellulose; meanwhile expressing key genes in BC synthesis process. Through these two methods we hope to achieve high yield of BC . Therefore, we designed the following experiments:
Design & Engineering :
Phosphoglucomutase(PGM) is able to catalyze the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate and plays an significant role in both glucose metabolism and BC metabolic network.
Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a new type of second messenger molecule that is ubiquitous in bacteria. Bacteria utilize it to perceive cell surface signals and activate targets within cells, which involves amplification of the original signal and the subsequent expression of a series of specific genes in the cell. These genes affects the various physiological and biochemical processes in the cells. c-di-GMP control a wide range of process, and has a role in transcription, translation and post-translation levels. In addition, c-di-GMP participates in the regulation of  multiple biological functions and affects biofilm formation. In a nutshell, it is a crucial elements to the formation of membrane-like bacterial cellulose and the improvement of BC production.
This experiment attempts to improve BC production by over-expressing PGM and c-di-GMP, a small signal transfer molecule of bacteria.the goal is to implement both to realize the high yield of BC.
The process of the experiment is divided into following steps, firstly, we   transform the constructed plasmids into the E. coli DH5α. When expressing successfully, then we transform it into G.xylinus through electroporation and put it in comparison with the common G.xylinus. We try to explore the influence of each plasmids on the production of BC after fermentation.
We use PCR to amplify gene PGM and c-di-GMP，and transform reconstructed plasmids J23119+PGM and J23119+c-di-GMP into G.xylinus. Then we put them in comparison with the control group PAsr+PGM and PAsr+c-di-GMP and measure its effect on the yield of BC respectively.
Results
At the beginning of the experiment, it was found that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylin"

The AOX gene was successfully synthesized by IDT and cloned onto pSB1C3 with a fusion protein of Lpp-OmpA (LO) which is driven by a constitutive promoter and RBS. In the following experiments to prove the concept, we tested the gene expression system by a reporter gene (GFP) and analyzed AOX gene expression by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Furthermore, we examined AOX enzyme activity by H2O2 assay, a product generated in the process of the oxidation of alcohol catalyzed by AOX. Finally, we designed a prototype to demonstrate the application of AOX enzyme on the alcohol meter in an electrochemical simulator.
The AOX gene were cloned onto pSB1C3 driven by a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23101 ) and RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and fused with bacterial outer membrane proteins, Lpp-OmpA (LO) to display protein on the cell surface of E. coli. To test whether the gene expression system works, we cloned a reporter gene (GFP) in the same context (i.e., Pcons-RBS-LO-GFP/pSB1C3). And the gene expression level was compared to Pcons-RBS-GFP/pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1694035 ) got from NCTU-Formosa, which has the same promoter and RBS but without LO. The clones of E. coli DH5α were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37°C overnight. Because overnight cultured LB medium has a background level of fluorescence, the bacterial GFP was measured in the PBS buffer ( Enzyme Microb Technol. 2001 ). As Figure 1 showed, the GFP expression was extremely high in E. coli. LO-GFP fusion protein expression was observed at low but significant level compared to wild-type E. coli or E. coli expressing LO outer membrane proteins.

Tongji-Software,2018,Team:Tongji-Software#Human practice_-_-_TEXT.html," get the best out of our project. We integrated the extensive feedback we received into the design and evolution of our project. This page describes how the investigation of our HP issues has been integrated into the purpose, design, and execution of our project in details. It consists of two parts, Functions Integration and Project Assessment. Functions Integration Advancements in metabolic engineering have enabled us to engineer and express enzymes and construct novel pathways for various applications including drug discovery and value-added biochemical production. However, it’s quite a challenge to design and reconstruct a pathway with high yield and productivity in certain organism. So the very initial idea of us is to develop a computational tool for pathway recommendation. However, it is not clear that how to evaluate the pathway, what the general pathway engineering workflow of experimenters and how they think our solution should work. Database integration: Inspirations from Prof. Liu and Peking: Prof. Liu emphasized the comprehensiveness and reliability of data used for pathway searching. “Data is the foundation of your software. Only by ensuring their accuracy can your software work well.” Prof. Liu said. He made us aware the importance of data. We obtained data from reliable database online, cleared redundant data afterward and integrated them to our software. We met Peking on the 5th CCiC meetup. Since they need the kinetic parameters of enzymes used in their pathway to produce β-carotene, it inspired us we can offer comprehensive information of compounds, enzymes, reactions and organisms to users to help them design experiments better. Data integration:
Information display in Alpha Ant （这里放我们软件信息展示的截图） Pathway Ranking Criteria Integration Inspirations from Key Synthetic Biology Laboratory of Chinese Academy of Sciences visit: Thanks for Prof. Li Ping’s referral and we got the opportunity to visit Key Synthetic Biology Laboratory of Chinese Academy of Sciences. We introduced our project and they gave us a valued suggestion on pathway ranking criteria from the experimenter's point of view. Researcher Yang Sheng told us generally the designed pathway for value-added biochemical production should coincide with the central metabolic pathway of chassis cells as much as possible to get high yield according to the experience in experimenting. It inspired us that we could design a scoring method based on the coincidence of the pathway to be evaluated and the core metabolic pathway in chassis cell.
Improvement in pathway ranking: We integrated the new pathway ranking method into our previous criteria, which meets our users’ needs better. Also, we found that the verified pathways in papers had a higher score in software assessment. （这里插入软件validation图片） fvrfbgtbt Organism recommendation"

Neither the empty backbone nor the SDM 1 modified expression system did seem to cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could only be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated in the section of BioBrick K2020002 ). By demonstrating that this modification doesn’t result in a clearance of the skim milk plates, we were now able to prove that serine is essential for the proteolytic activity of the protease and that exchanging it would inactivate the enzyme. Hence, we demonstrated that exchanging serine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid will inactivate subtilisin E and therefore proved the principle of our project. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020004
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (S221X) This part is a variation of the BioBrick K2020003 . In opposition to the exchange of serine221 against tyrosine, the named serine was exchanged against an amber codon, the least used stop codon in Escherichia coli. The codon AGC of serine221 was substituted with TAG, which codes for DMNB-serine, if the corresponding aminoacyl tRNA/synthetase pair is added. So serine will be exchanged against DMNBS in the catalytic triade of the enzyme in the presence of the needed DMNBS tRNA/synthetase pair. By irradiation with light, this non-canonical amino acid can be converted to natural serine in the active site of the enzyme and the cleaved off photo-labile group. Thereby, the protease will reach its activity just by shining light on it and will be reversibly inactivated successfully. Unfortunately, we were not able to execute all of the experiments that we planned due to a lack of time. But as our proof of principle of exchanging serine against a larger amino acid namely tyrosine worked, it can be assumed, that this part will also operate correctly. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed DhaA+P2A+HheC and DhaA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5mM TCP respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The concentration of the products were confirmed using GC column(AC5). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass, 2,3-DCP,  epichlorohydrin, chloropropanol, and glycerol. The result was screened by GC analysis. Above the degradation of TCP and the intermediate product 2,3-DCP indicated that multistep biodegradation was happened. (Fig.1 and Fig.2). When the E.coli carried DhaA+P2A+HheC gene cultivated in medium with 2,3-DCP, the concentration of epichlorohydrin have been detected(Fig.2). 2,3-DCP was degraded to epichlorohydrin. Chloropropanol and glycerol couldn’t be detected by our columns. Since the two active enzymes were in bacteria, if the degradation followed the theoretic pathway (refer to project), TCP would be degraded to glycerol in the end.  In the future, new columns and methods will be used to further proof the result.

After executing a patent search, we have analyzed all the patents that are related to our project and we were not able to find any patents combining the three parts of our search. The next strategic step, if we wanted to continue with the development of our product and create a company out of it, would be to file a provisional patent application before we present our results in the Jamboree.
One of iGEMs values is sharing, an example of this is the biobrick agreement, where you share your biobricks and therefore get access to other biobricks. A problem arises for those that wish to continue with their iGEM project as a start-up"

Microfluidics were divide into three parts: the Selection Chip; the Gaussian Plate; and the Immobilization Chip.
The Selection of the Caenorhabditis elegans
There are two plans of selecting worms. Why we need the C. elegans with the same stage The first one is using microfluidics. We designed the Selection Chip to select the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) with the appropriate size (Fig.1).
Fig.1 The Selection Chip
We need a large number of the worms with the same stage to do the Gaussion Plate. Why we need so many with the same stage However, we found that the chip only has 12 fences (Fig.2) The efficiency of the Selection Chip was very low because of such a small number of the fences. In addition, the C. elegans have flexible body, some of the suitable size worms would still go through the second fences (Fig.2).
Fig.2 The Problems of the  Selection Chip. The efficiency of the chip was very low because of the small amount of the fences. Besides, the worms will also escape from the second fences just like the red one.
The second plan was the C. elegans’ synchronization. [1] ( How to do the C. elegans’ synchronization  ) We got the embryos (Fig.3) from the old worms so that the worms would be at the same stage because of the hatches of the embryos were at the same time. We selected several conditions of the synchronization, finally, we could get the worms at the same stage. The synchronous rate:
\frac{N_1*100\%}{N_2}
N1 equals the number of worms at L4
N2 equals the number of all worms.
can reach to about 80%.

The question of how cells detect specific molecules has always been important to biology, but is becoming an increasingly useful question to ask as we begin to engineer life. The applications of biosensing are widespread.  There is a demand for biological diagnostic tools in medical or environmental applications, like detecting diseases or environmental contaminants. Sensing also has applications in biosecurity systems, when bioengineers try to develop strains that are stably dependent on the presence certain molecules. Finally, developing sensing systems for specific molecules is invaluable in metabolic engineering, because it allows for construction of metabolite-specific selection schemes.
Traditionally, most sensing systems in synthetic constructs have been borrowed from nature. However, very often researchers want to detect a ligand that does not have a receptor in the existing list of characterized sensors. Scanning natural systems for proteins that bind to a specific molecules is difficult and time-consuming, when it is not impossible. As synthetic biology realizes more and more unnatural functions, we will want to be able to design cells that can detect molecules that life has never before responded to. This is something we cannot achieve using natural receptors.
Here at Berkeley we were motivated to address this problem by constructing a biosensing mechanism that could be readily adapted to the ligand of choice. We wanted to build a modular biosensing device that could be modified by swapping binding domains. This approach would provide a standard method for engineering biosensors that could make use of both natural binding domains, optimized by evolution, as well as engineered domains that respond to molecules outside the range of natural receptors.
ToxR is a characterized transmembrane transcription factor from Vibrio cholerae with active domains in both the periplasm and cytoplasm.  Natively, it is involved in the transcription of a number of virulence factors, including  the two subunits of the cholera toxin ctxAB and the TCP pilus. It is activated in trans by ToxS, a membrane-anchored periplasmic protein coded by the gene directly downstream of ToxR. Active ToxS in the periplasm stabilizes the dimerization of the periplasmic domain of Tox"

Safety/Security
BioMORTAR, unlike many other synthetic biology projects, does not deal directly with live cells. However, BioMORTAR designs plasmids for cells that are to be created, and therefore must consider similar safety procedures as other lab-based groups. Simlar to physical labs, BioMORTAR must be able to ensure that the cells created can be controlled for the safety of the environment and community. Also, they must be able to keep away those who are using synthetic biology for malicious purposes in order to ensure safety of the public and because the use of synthetic biology could potentially be used for violence in the future.
In order to make sure that cells do not grow out of control, the COBRA based modeling tool will project the growth of the designed bacteria. The modeling part of BioMORTAR will be able to give the user a graph representing growth rates over time. This would allow the user to compare the growth of the designed bacteria with growth of other bacteria in the environment to determine how it will interact with the other factors in the environment. Cell modeling in BioMORTAR will hopefully help promote the safe use of synthetic biology in more complex or natural environments.
Like cellular biology labs, BioMORTAR needs to have a way to keep people with malicious intentions away from this tool, especially if it is intended to expedite the creation of novel bacteria. In order to deter those wishing to create the next superbacteria, the next version of BioMORTAR will be able to log every plasmid created and match them to their registered account or ip address on the computer.  This will allow us to show records of certain member's activity in case authorities needed to find the one who created a bug that was designed by BioMORTAR.
Since there are many potential risks involved with synthetic biology, it is very important for BioMORTAR to promote the use of safety precautions by those using the software to design novel bacteria.

Is the infection causing the illness bacterial or viral?
If it is a bacterial infection, what type of bacteria is causing the infection?
Are the bacteria causing the infection carry resistance genes against the prescribed drug?
Are the bacteria causing the infection susceptible to the prescribed drug?
In addition, our application focuses on the detection of resistance genes. However, in order to solve the resistance problem, future diagnostic tools should shed light on other questions, as mentioned above. Our versatile RNA-based detection tool can also be applied to answer many other questions (also see our Entrepeneurship page ).
Impact on society
The demand for rapid detection tools to help decision making on antibiotic treatment is not only valuable in the veterinary field, but also relevant in the rapid diagnosis of the well-known MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infection ( Wielders et al. 2002 ). This infection, also known as the ‘hospital disease’, is extremely harmful to humans because it is almost impossible to treat with antibiotics. High-level resistance to methicillin is caused by the mecA gene. Detection of mecA during infections will have impact on the decision-making and the evacuation of the patient to prevent the spread of the dangerous MRSA.
We developed a versatile detection tool to detect the most relevant genes causing multiple antibiotic resistance (see Cas13a Design oage ). This expands the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies that contribute to the fight against antibiotic resistance, together with the upcoming methods to prevent, treat, or take away resistance.
Future vision
It became clear that our method could have a wide range of applications besides RNA detection. One of these applications, namely SNP detection was mentioned by one of our stakeholders (also see our Entrepeneurship page ).
SNP detection
Cas13a has single-base specificity. This means that Cas13a has the ability to detect single bases differing between two sequences ( Gootenberg et al. 2017 ). Such a variation of a single base in a DNA sequence among individuals is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Some SNPs are related to (the probability to develop) certain diseases. Being able to easily detect, study and evaluate SNPs can therefore give information about an individual’s predisposition to these diseases ( Nature Education 2014 ). Moreover, the detection of strain SNPs allows for the differentiation between different virus strains ( Gootenberg et al. 2017 ), which is important in choosing a treatment.

Shown below is the graph the of Hill equation with various Hill coefficients. As one can see, increasing the Hill coefficient makes the change (induction) more abrupt and switch-like.
Figure 3. Graph of Hill Equation (Induction)
Similarly, mathematical derivation of a system with repressors that cooperatively repress a gene expression can be modeled by the following equation shown below. Again, Theta represents the level of transcribed mRNA, and [L] represents the level of repressors present. The graph of the above equation is shown as well. Similar to the previous graph, the level of transcription switches more abruptly with higher cooperativity (higher Hill coefficient). Therefore, as shown in both cases, high cooperativity lead to switch-like behavior and is favorable when designing a bistable toggle switch.

At first we used a different binding buffer than the one provided in the kit, but the final extraction had a high salt concentration that made the DNA unusable as a PCR template. We tried using the Zymogen clean and concentrator kit to further purify the DNA, but there wasn’t enough DNA to use for PCR reactions after the clean-up. We performed two more gel extractions using the reagents from the kit but still didn’t get clean enough DNA for further PCR amplification. We finally decided to order the full genes and use the primers from the OE PCRs to amplify the full length genes.
After a successful test reaction at 10uL, we repeated our linearization PCR with a volume of 50uL. Our confirmation gel indicated a successful linearization, although some of the sample streaked above the 10 kb ladder.
We then attempted a transformation of our new chemicompetent Y. lipolytica using our control D17 plasmid. Our transformant cells were then incubated in liquid selective media for outgrowth. We also attempted a transformation of our linearized PCR product from the 50 uL reaction, but later realized that the linearized plasmid was unfit for expression of any genes at this point and so the transformation plate was discarded.
Created YNB+CSM-Leu medium (leucine-deficient) and YNBcasa (uracil-deficient) medium. Attempted to transform Y. lipolytica with pXRL2, ultimately to test if we can miniprep yeast with our protocol. Unfortunately there was no obvious yeast growth on the transformation plates.

Although the formation of dioxins occurs ""locally"", environmental distribution is global. Dioxins are found throughout the world in small amounts, including areas that are entirely uninhabited. The highest levels of these compounds are found in some soils, sediments and food, especially dairy products, meat, fish and shellfish. Lower levels are found in plants, water and air.
Global Aspects
Regulation

Regulation
Many countries monitor their food supply for dioxins. This has led to the early detection of dioxin contaminations and has often prevented its impact on a larger scale. Though nearly every country in the world contains some level of dioxin contamination, most cases have been reported in industrialized countries where adequate food-monitoring, greater public awareness [of the hazard] and better regulatory controls exist.
The Stockholm convention
In the 1990s, it became apparent that the international community needed to take action aimed at reducing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to protect the environment and human health. This led to the formation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants which was established on May 17, 2004. By 2005, over 150 countries had signed while 98 had ratified the Convention.
The objective of the Stockholm Convention is to protect human health and the environment from the effects of POP's. The convention established a range of measures to reduce and, where feasible, eliminate POP emissions, and to ensure the sound management of stockpiles and wastes that contain POPs.    A level of 0.1 ng TEQ/m3 of dioxins has been accepted internationally as the goal emission rate.

Introduction
In every problem concerning modelling, the main objective is always to reduce the system as much as possible. By this means, it's possible to understand the fundamental features and behaviour of said system. However, when studying biological systems, this approach may not be possible due to the complexity of the interactions and the large amount of parameters necessary to describe each component. With our problem is not different, for it lies on the scope of the biological sciences. Taking this complexity into account, we chose to model our system in the simplest way possible: by means of simple ordinary differential equations, i.e chemical kinetics.
Chemical kinetics usually consists of first order differential equations of the form:
describing the evolutions of concentrations in time, in terms of initial conditions and some parameters $k$ that describing the strength of the dynamics. Each equation corresponds to one chemical reaction occurring along the system evolution. Usually, one seeks to find the equilibrium solution, i.e
which is considered to be the true state of the system after a long period of time. In our case, the chemical reactions are those that regulate the binding/unbinding of promoters, the enzyme activity, the expression of the reporter gene, and so on. So, each part of our genetic circuit will be represented by an equation, which is usually coupled with the equations describing other parts.
Detection and Signaling
The first problem we have to address is the efficiency of the detection module and it's components. Our system consists in an AIP linked with a surface protein, which is cleaved in the absence of Cystatin C, triggering the phosphorylation of the ComE protein. This problem was already studied by the 2010-Imperial College London team , where they analysed the cleaving rate of AIP as well as the minimum amount of AIP needed for the ComE phosphorylation process to occur.
Detection
The first problem we"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," would enter information about their experiment, such as the number of outputs and the vessel they plan to use. They would then configure each output by inputting which control syringes from the control syringe pumps actuate it. Lastly, the user selects the wells for dispensing on the table under Output Destination.
After designing the first iteration of the UI, we received feedback from the Harvard iGEM team and scientists in the lab, in which they highlighted that it was difficult to use. The requested information was unclear and the format of the UI was confusing. In addition, initial users felt that the UI needed a slight “face lift” in terms of aesthetics. During the design process for the next iteration we decided to improve the UI by reducing the amount of information the user enters, adding a UI tutorial video, and additional focus on the UI’s aesthetics.
To do this, we first had to break down exactly what information the UI needed to gather from the user to run TERRA. This was important because it gave us an idea of how to restructure the UI and make it more efficient. We broke down the necessary input information based on key sub-functions TERRA executes to transfer the outputs of the user’s microfluidic chip into the desired locations on their vessel.
Sub-Functions
Dispense Time
Output Selection
Dispense Location
User Input
Fluid Density
Control Syringe Pump Pairs per Output
Vessel in Use (24, 96, 384 well plate)
Flow Rate
# of Output
Well Locations per Output
Microfluidic System (Continuous Flow vs Droplet)
Sample Volume
# of Outputs
Nozzle Tube Length
Vessel Dimensions
Nozzle Tube Outer Diameter
Nozzle Tube Surface Tension
Sample Volume
After aggregating the following information we highlighted user data that can be standardized to offload it from the user. The first and easiest fix was to have TERRA use tubing of known length, material, and outer diameter. In addition, the TERRA Adapter was standardized by characterizing each output in advance. By knowing the total number of outputs for the experiment, TERRA automatically configures the outputs with their respective control syringes. The user simply needs to ensure that the TERRA Adapter is connected properly to their microfluidic chip. Once inputs were offloaded, error-check functionality was incorporated to alert the user if inputted data is unfeasible or incorrect format. With error-check, the input fields are either highlighted red to prompt the user to change their input or to green to confirm that the entered data is in the proper format.

Ni affinity chromatography
1. Pick 3 colonies from plate and grow in 30mL LB + antibiotic (1‰ Kana or Amp according to vector) at 37℃ overnight. Transfer 10mL culture at 1:30 ratio into 300mL LB + antibiotic. After new culture could be grown at 37℃ into OD600 0.6~0.8 (which normally takes ~3hrs), add IPTG to induce protein expression at 16℃ for 18~20hrs.
2. Collect culture in a 50mL tube, centrifugate consecutively at 4℃ 5,000rpm for 5 min and discard of LB supernate. Resuspend sediment in 10mL lysis buffer (20mM HEPES, 500nM KCl) and centrifugate again. Then discard supernate and resuspend sediment in 20mL lysis buffer.
3. Add protease inhibitor at 1:1000 ratio and extract suspension through ultrasonication at 3sec/3sec for 10 min twice with 10 min interval. Centrifugate lysate at 4℃ 11,000rpm for 60 min. Take samples from supernate and sediment for future examination.
4. Blend supernate with Ni resin in a 50mL tube and incubate horizontally on ice at 160rpm shake for 1.5hr, then erect the tube and place on ice for 0.5 hr to settle mixture. Take sample from solution which would be marked as flow-through.     5. Segregate protein from affinity chromatography at 20nM-500nM imidazole gradient elution.
6. Equilibrate with storage buffer (20mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl).
7. Examine protein purification through SDS-PAGE.

However, the evaluation of MTT assay is not very good, because its detection                         condition is too critical for the cell and the cell survival pressure is very high. [26]

Our goal is to build a system with function of                         detecting the antioxidants and has the advantages of high biological relevance, simple                         operation, low-cost, good reproducibility, accuracy, and high sensitivity for antioxidant                         detection.

“Now, the years have progressed and technology has evolved, celiac disease may be a disease without symptoms, and may have clinical signs, many years ago it was a disease with severe effects, for example children who did not develop because they did not gain weight, had swollen bellies, were weak, had anemia, but it was a long time ago. Now the situation has changed and sometimes children with signs like, thin children do not gain weight, just less than before, and not tall, abdominal pain, diarrhea. Today, it is not a disease that can lead to death, but there can be complications at a later age which can lead to intestinal tumors, then it can lead to death. ""

For the generation of our memory system we needed to create different parts. Because the Dronpa-caged Cre constructs are fusion proteins, we used the RFC25 standard for the assembly of these parts from the simple parts we generated from gBlocks synthesized by IDT.
All simple parts were cloned into the shipping vector pSB1C3 for further use and submission to the registry.
Linkers for protein fusion
These parts contain the protein coding region for the generation of 6/9/12/15 amino acid linkers. The linker will be composed of 4 amino acids from the scars from using RFC25 standard and serine/glycine residues. The parts are supplied in RFC25 standard. Characterisation of these parts was not possible, because they do not fulfill a direct function.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Drinking tea and eating Aachen’s famous gingerbread, everyone gathered around a big table. One of the most mind blowing discussions about biohacking and bioart we ever attended was about to start. It turned out, that most of the regular guests were actually artists, who collaborate with the Waag society. The presented bioart projects ranged from simply painting with different-colored microbes to experimentally expressing the behavior of a biological network as a theater play with actors as nodes of an computational algorithm.
We learned a lot about bioart and how the Waag society triggers open discussions about synthetic biology and biotechnology using bioart as a starting point. They invited us to visit their exhibition Matter of Live in November 2015, which we gladly accepted
Another big project of the Waag society’s WetLab is the BioHack Academy. This academy teaches everybody interested how to set up a laboratory based on DIY hardware. Not only private persons, but also new found community labs use this academy. Via internet conferences, the biohack academy goes global, even people from Iran asked them to join the biohack academy.
Concerning the Waag Society's educational strategy, they were also interested in the teaching lessons in synthetic biology we shared with the ""Technik Garage"". Following the teach the teacher principle, we believe they will soon spread synthetic biology even to people far away from Europe.

Ten random colonies were picked for overnight growth in liquid media. The next day the plasmids were purified and digestion was performed with SnaBI, BsaI & BamHI to make sure that this was the plasmid we had ordered. The gel showed that this was the case.
Creation of the Leaky construct
As desided by our genetic design the redoxilator can be removed from p241i by NotI digestion and subsequent gel-purification of the backbone. Following religation of the backbone the DNA was transformed into E. coli. This plasmid was purified and digested with XmaI and run on gel to check whether the expected 2500 bp & 4500 bp bands appeared. The gel gave ambiguous results so a test PCR was done on the purified plasmid to check whether the redoxilator had been removed. This test showed that this was the case.
Transformation into yeast
Yeast (CEN PK 113 5D (Ura-)) was transformed with the pRS416c-plasmid using the Ura marker present on pRS416 Yeast was also transformed with pSC011 kindly provided by Simon Carlsen, CMB containing the sequence from BBa_K194001 under the constitutive expression of the TEF promoter. pSC011 holds the same promoter and terminator as the pRS416 holding the BBa_K194003 and can therefore be used to analyze the difference of the addition of the Cln2 degradation signal.
Also the construct (p241i) holding the redoxilator and the leaky construct was transformed into CEN PK 113 5D
BioLector fermentation
To characterize the yeast strains that we have constructed in the project we used the BioLector machine kindly provided by the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis at DTU. The BioLector is able to keep the microtiterplate stirring and measures OD and GFP levels every 3rd minut making it ideal for our experimentt. Our main goal with this experiment was to determine if there was a difference in GFP signal for different carbon sources and this way prove if the GFP signal is anyway dependent on the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the cell or not
We characterized:
1. Wildtype as background: CEN PK 113 7D without any auxotrophic marker was chosen. If there is GFP fluorescence of the wildtype this needs to be accounted for.
2. Our Redoxilater construct : This construct holds the redoxilator sensor controlling the expression of BBa_K194002 . This plasm"

Collaborating with other teams
Inter-team collaboration is a hallmark of iGEM. We collaborated with three different teams in the 2015 iGEM season. We assisted the University of Maryland team with the Interlab Measurement Study. We also helped out the Cambridge-JIC team by supplying them with fluorescent constructs to serve as positive controls for their Project: OpenScope 3D Printed Fluorescent Microscope Initiative. Finally, we participated in a collaborative effort with the University of Georgia iGEM team to determine fluorescence values for mCherry proteins controlled under an archaeal RBS library.

Discussion on the problem
We brought out that we met with difficulties when synthetizing 4 gene fragments into a plasmid. The Tsinghua students gave us many practical advices. One of them is suggesting us using Gibson assembly kit. With this kit, the DNA fragments could be bound to each other by using master mix (contain 3 kinds of enzymes) in a constant temperature bath for 1 hour. However, Gibson assembly kit could only assemble the fragments less than 80 bp, while the DNA primers we need to assemble were 150bp. Thanks to team members of TSINGHUA-A, we were able to amplify our plasmid by the method of using both PCR and assembly kit.
Meanwhile, we discussed about other problems about wiki and social practice, and we all got a satisfactory result.
Visiting laboratory
There were not many researchers in their Lab when we visited, so they have times to show us around their labs and discuss about conducting experiments.
Summary
Through this communication with fellows in Tsinghua University, we have learned much about automation. It not only expanded our horizons, but also enlightened us that the combination of biology and information theory would have a broad prospect. Besides, fellows in Tsinghua University also impressed by our creative ideas of conducting experiments. In short, it’s been a pleasant and successful communication.

Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"on.  The equipment I  use in surgery is sterilized by chemical or steam methods [which do] eradicate the biofilm.  There are probably reservoirs of bacteria in our hospital or offices that aren’t completely eradicated by standard cleaning regimens.  This can occur in areas we used to use to treat patients such as whirlpool tubs and hubbard tanks. Because of biofilms and impossibility in eradicating the bacteria in these tubs and tanks,  these are now largely obsolete in treating burn patients, patients with wounds, or patients with immunologic compromise.
What cleaning techniques do you currently use against biofilms on your equipment? How effective are they?
Housekeeping is largely responsible for sterilizing the hospital, patient rooms, washrooms, etc.  I am not sure of their current regimen or its success in treating biofilms.
How often do you encounter biofilms in your practice?
The Biofilms I deal with are in vivo.  Part of my job is treating chronic ulcers (diabetic, neuropathic, etc) and chronic wounds.  These are particularly difficult because of biofilms.  Standard topical antimicrobials and even systemic antimicrobials are not all that effective.  Any tissue-safe enzymatic agent that could break down this barrier would definitely be an asset.
I also deal with biofilms in prosthetics.  These prosthetics may be hardware used in skeletal fixation or joints, or prostheses used in breast reconstruction.  Once these prosthetics become bacterial colonized or form a biofilm they largely have to be removed and replaced.   Biofilms can also contribute to scar formation.  Their low grade inflammation (without full blown infection) has been theorized to cause breast capsular contractures (which cause distortion and hardening of breast implants in cosmetic and reconstructive patients).  This low grade inflammation can also cause increased scar formation around total joint replacements (hips and knees) causing reduced range of motion and stiffness.
The best product I could envision would be a gentle cleansing agent that can be used in vivo, and thus on chronic wounds, or to safely wash out total joints or prosthetic devices and be able to safely reuse them in the same patient..

Safety design in Printeria
Ethics in Printeria
Introduction
As Theodor Reik (Sigmund Freud disciple) said: “In science, like in all life fields, a slogan is imposed: safety first”. Nowadays, safety is an essential requirement when creating new devices which humans will use, and Printeria is not different.
This document describes the safety of our project so, a clever step before begining is to know what is it. Safety describes  the containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxines, or their accidental release [1]. Furthermore, safety is how you have protected yoursef and other in order to avoid any harms which could occur.
Printeria is designed to be a secure device, because is going to be used by bioartists, schools and researchers which are our identified potential users according to MIT segmentation table and we do not want it to be a variable which create concern in those users. This approach toguether with our lab tools and posibilities,  have  influenced the experiments we did and the way we build Printeria. Next paragraphs describe our lab safety and how and why we implemented biosafety and biosecurity requirements in Printeria.

To validate the quality of the predicted models, we calculated the QMEAN Z-score[8], which estimates the absolute quality of a model by comparing to the structures solved by X-ray crystallography and with a resolution below than 2 Å. From there, we chose the best structure.
Finally, we aligned models with experimental structures to check if the structure was conserved, so functions would remain unaltered.
RFP_CBDs (BBa_K1934000)
First, we ran preliminary tests with a construct similar to the chimeric protein of the 2014 iGEM Stanford-Brown-Spelman team 2014 ( BBa_K1499004 ). Instead of streptavidin at the center of the CBDs we used RFP, like the 2015 iGEM Edinburgh team did. If the protein became red, it meant that the RFP domain was functional. Then this protein was used for the development of purification and fixation protocols on microcrystalline cellulose. Here, we just studied the fold of the protein in order to see if it could work.
The best model has a Z-score of -1.75, which means a quite good absolute quality of the prediction. The graphic below shows that the predicted structure is in the standard deviation of the major part of the experimental structures.
Figure 1: Comparison with a non-redundant set of PDB structures of RFP_CBDs model (red cross)
Figure 2: 3D structure of the model, CBD1 (blue), RFP (red) and CBD2 (green)
The RFP domain is similar to its template with an RMSD of 3.17Å, but the second CBD has only a RMSD of 11.39Å and the first CBD has lost its secondary structure.
Nonetheless, we found out through our wetlab experiments that the protein was red and it fixed to the cellulose.
Streptavidin_CBDs (BBa_K1499004)
As the model seemed suitable for the RFP_CBDs, we decided to work on the part designed by the 2014 iGEM Stanford-Brown-Spelman team ( BBa_K1499004 ) and model its 3D structure.
The best model had a Z-score of -3.36, which means a bad absolute quality of the prediction. The graphic below shows that"

We are very pleased to find both of us work on the MFC system so that we can share many experience and problems. In this year’s project. LZU-China try to develop a system based on MFC to sense the pollutes. They constructed a series of heavy metal sensors used in MFCs (microbial fuel cell). When pollutes appear, the sensors can produce riboflavin to improve the voltage. Through our research, we find that F- is also a remarkable pollute which have a potential risk to human beings so we advised them to construct a F- sensor and the sensor can be constructed based on BBa_K911003. Through our advice, LZU-China then constructed BBa_K1755024, the F- sensor.

To prove their part BBa_K1755024 can work normally, we tested their part in our own lab under our MFC system which had similar culture environment. The BL21 with K1755024 was cultured added with NaF and the production of riboflavin was measured.

Firstly, we measured the riboflavin concentration produced by BBa_K1755024. 3ml bacteria solution was taken every 12 hours(0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h）, their absorbance (OD values ) were measured in the 600 nm wavelength. The absorbance of supernatant (OD values ) were measured in the 444 nm wavelength, which suggests the concentration of riboflavin.
Figure 4. The relationship between riboflavin production and NaF (after incubation of 20 h, K1755024, BL21).
We can see from the figure that though the background expression is relatively high, the concentration of riboflavin shows a good linear relationship with that of NaF when NaF ranges from 0 to 40 μm. However, 80 μm condition, through our speculation, may inhibit the expression of riboflavin.
Cu2+ sensing  part
Apart from the F- part, we also helped them characterize the Cu2+ sensing part in our MFC device.
As for BBa_K1755301, the voltage in MFC was documented. The MFC‘s anode was added with Cu2+ from the very begging (0 min), and their voltage (with BL21-K1755301)"

Figure 5. Schematic of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing used to extract shale gas. Steel casing lines are drilled deep underground and cemented in place. Fracturing fluid is then injected at high pressures to create fractures in the shale formation to facilitate extraction. Adapted from “Shale Gas: Applying Technology to Solve America’s Energy Challenges”. NETL (2011).
In March 2011, the United States government released the “Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future” that outlined a collaboration between the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Environmental Protection agency (EPA) to monitor the development of unconventional resource extraction. The three agencies would be responsible for mitigating potential risks ensuing from wellbore integrity, developing green technologies for extraction, evaluating the stress conditions of unconventional resource basin, assessing ecological impact of resource production, and monitoring air and water quality as it pertains to environmental and human health.5 The EPA began a study in 2011 to assess current and potential risks for contamination of drinking water by hydraulic fracturing processes. This is an ongoing study that will focus on both retrospective cases and prospective sites for hydraulic fracturing.6 Recently, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) established new guiding principles for water and fluid management in hydraulic fracturing. The guidelines call for full disclosure of fracturing fluid chemical additives, development of lower risk fluid additives, and safeguarding the quality and quantity of water resources.7 In the last few years, the U.S. federal government and several states have developed public disclosure rules intended to provide the public with information about the chemicals added to fracturing fluid and what role those additives serve, such as corrosion inhibitors, friction reducers, gelling agents, and surfactants.
In a report issued by the BC Oil and Gas Commission in August 2012, high pressure fluid injection for recovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs, injection of waste fluids into deep rock formations, and withdrawal of hydrocarbons from reservoirs were identified as potential causes of altered stress conditions of natural fault lines. While thousands of micro-seismicity events can occur as fracturing fluid is injected into gas shales, these events are of such low magnitude that they are not felt on the surface. Larger magnitude events that may be felt at the surface can occur if the fluid injection causes movement along pre-existing stressed faults, however only one such"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," conditions for the functionality of the dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein.
Approach: We performed the functionality test in three main parts:
Loading of sgRNA and the desired target DNA to the individual dxCas9 was confirmed by trypsin resistance assay ( Jiang et al, 2015 ) and electrophoretic mobility shift (binding) assay (EMSA) ( Sternberg et al, 2015 ).
The ability of the Tn5 dimer to load the adapter DNA was demonstrated by EMSA ( Whitfield et al, 2008 ).
The ability of the fusion protein to load its components was demonstrated by EMSA, which closely followed by the integration assay ( Whitfield et al, 2008 ).
Experimental design: Trypsin resistance assay identified whether dxCas9 was able to load the designed sgRNA. Loaded dxCas9 undergoes a significant conformational shift causing the protein to become significantly more trypsin (protease) resistant compared to an apo-dxCas9 (non sgRNA loaded) protein ( Jiang et al, 2015 ). We visualized this resistance to trypsin by comparing the protein degradation ratio between loaded- and apo- dxCas9 on an SDS PAGE.
Electrophoretic mobility shift (binding) assay (EMSA) further identified the complex formation between fusion protein and EPO (BBa K2643004). A mobility shift occurs when binding of DNA to protein retards the movement of the DNA through the polyacrylamide gel, creating two distinct bands ( Sternberg et al, 2015 ). When the EPO coding sequence DNA formed a complex with loaded dxCas9, we observed a band shift in comparison to the unbound EPO on a 5% TBE native PAGE. With the same principle, we performed EMSA to verify the loading of DNA adapters on Tn5.
We performed EMSA to verify the loading of fusion protein with sgRNA, DNA adapters, and target EPO CDS. Next, we assessed the target specific integration using a sgRNA that was designed to guide the fusion protein to the position ~160bp of the EPO cDNA ( BBa_K2643004 ). The Tn5 portion of the fusion protein integrates DNA adapters at this position. This integration split EPO into two fragments of ~250bp and ~480bp. We performed two negative controls of targeted integration: without sgRNA and with only Tn5  protein in parallel. We PCR amplified the integration products with primers that annealed to the adapter DNA and the beginning ("

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"
Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," a way to avoid communication problems between the modelers and the rest of the team. In some teams, the modelers and experimentalists work tightly together. One respondent mentioned that it would have been helpful to have had the experimentalists involved in the modeling right from the beginning.
One person doing both modeling and experimentation
In some cases, same people did both experiments and modeling, so there was no need for cooperation at all. Whether this is possible depends on the case: if a single person can tackle the question at hand, cooperation is not necessary. One respondent pointed out however, that while having the same person doing both experiments and modeling reduces communication issues, it can increase the likelihood of errors due to the lack of discussion.
Integration of modeling and experimentation
“The choice of promoters, RBSs and plasmids depended greatly on the model data obtained.”
- A 5th year biomedical engineering student
Sufficient integration of modeling and experimental work done in the laboratory was considered difficult but important. About half the teams were able to get modeling results that affected the work done in the laboratory. As often was the expectation, modeling helped some teams in focusing their time and energy on certain designs. For instance, it helped teams in deciding what constructs to create and influenced the choice of promoters, RBS and plasmid backbones. Some teams adjusted the protein degradation in their gene circuits according to the models they built. One respondent also noted that modeling helped in thinking about the possible influences in the system and in improving experimental setups. Some teams performed experiments to gain parameters for their models and adjusted their models according to experimental results.
When there was no effect or the effect was smaller than desired, it was often a question of time. Building a model takes time, but due to the tight timeframe of the iGEM competition, work in the laboratory needs to start early as well. Therefore, the model might provide results only at a too late stage for it to have any effect in the experiments. Many would have preferred to start the modeling earlier on, had it been possible. One respondent replied that the modeling will not have any significant effect, as their team is doing so little modeling due to lack of expertise. In some cases there was simply not enough time to adjust or validate a model using experimental data, often due to difficulties in performing the experiments successfully. Due to the timing of our questionnaire approximately 6 weeks before the end of the competition, some respondents answered that they do not yet know whether there will be an effect, but were nevertheless mostly optimistic.
In addition to the problems of cooperation, many teams mentioned having problems with finding information required for modeling,"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," 2.0v, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Here, ΔESD and ΔEtRNA are constant since neither the SD nor the start codon are altered. Consequently, variations in σ are exclusively determined by ΔEopen. Applying the model to the plasmids with our constructs bearing thermoswitches, enabled us to rationalize translation events, as translatable constructs consistently scored higher σ, or lower ΔEopen, than non-translatable ones.

α: the effect a competing population has on a population’s growth
K: the population’s carrying capacity
r: a value between 0 and 1 for the population’s growth rate, modulated by GP2 in the cells of the population
x: represents the population.
Simulation: Population Ratio Tuning
When a co-culture is inoculated at a 1:1 ratio with populations that grow at different rates but do not contain the GEAR system, a clear disparity in their growth can be observed.
Figure 1: Population dynamics observed without a GEAR system implemented
One population clearly outcompetes the other and the 1:1 ratio is lost. Implementing the default GEAR system into the populations of this co-culture results in an obvious improvement in the ability of the co-culture to maintain its original 1:1 ratio.
Figure 2: Population dynamics observed with a default GEAR system
The effectiveness of the GEAR system is even more pronounced when a key tunable parameter of the circuit identified by the sensitivity analysis of the single cell model, in this case only the constitutive transcription rate of STAR-activated GP2, is optimized. Such a change can be implemented in vivo simply by using a different Anderson promoter from the iGEM Registry. As seen below the co-culture is tuned by the GEAR system such that it maintains its original 1:1 ratio.
Figure 3: Population dynamics observed with an optimized GEAR system
Similarly when a co-culture is inoculated at a 2:1 ratio with populations that grow at different rates but do not contain the GEAR system, one population also clearly outcompetes the other.
Figure 4: Population dynamics observed without a GEAR system
The introduction of the GEAR system, without any optimization of the key controllable parameters of the circuit, again works very effectively to correct the imbalance in the consortium's ratio.
Figure 5: Population dynamics observed with a default GEAR system
Again, by further modifying the constitutive transcription rate of STAR-activated GP2, the ratio of the co-culture populations can be tuned very precisely from the 2:1 inoculation ratio to a new"
USTC-Software,2011,Team:USTC-Software#tech&algo_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins and non-BioBricks in which cases each sequence may have only one agent. One example is Isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). It has a binding domain \textit{laci} for Lac repressor and thus can be represented as i0001(laci), where i0001 is not a valid identifier in MIT registry since IPTG is not a BioBrick part but a conceptual part in our extension, which can be represented using the same syntax of BioBrick definition. In a short summary, sequences are chains composed of one or more parts, which are not limited to BioBrick parts or even not corresponded to any actual entities.
There is a problem brought by the use of registry identifiers as the name of BioBricks: in principle, protein coding sequences should also have both RNA and protein representations and other type of BioBricks, such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and terminators, should have RNA representations. Each BioBrick, when transcribed or translated possibly, cannot be distinguished from its DNA, RNA and protein representations simply by its name and a qualifier is needed to tag a sequence explicitly to tell whether it is a BioBrick and if it is, which type of representation it belongs to. This can be easily done by adding a type qualifier preceding a colon character `:' to the head of a sequence representation to distinguish the four cases. In the current version of MoDeL, the four permitted types of sequences are DNA(d), RNA(r), Protein(p) and Non-BioBricks(nb), where the character in parenthesis following each type is the type qualifier used to tag sequences. For example, the tet repressor (tetR) can be represented as p:c0040(dna), which is totally different with d:c0040(dna), the protein coding sequence for tetR protein.

6/13/11: Prepared M-9 Media
Enzymology
CL: This week consisted of write up and prep for the ethanol detection assay.  We have chosen to use an Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) assay in which ADH catalyzes a reaction between a primary alcohol (ethanol) and NAD+ to produce acetaldehyde and NADH.  The NADH product can be quantified using its absorbency at 340nm, and it directly proportional to original ethanol concentrations.
Media
Growth of NEB 10-ß cells was tested in minimal (M9) media supplemented with 36 mM glucose and BG-11 supplemented with 50 mM glucose or 1 mg/mL (18.7 mM) NH4Cl and 50 mM glucose. The results of this experiment showed negligible growth in all media aside from LB.  It was thought that this was likely due to one or more auxot"

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#Science_-_-_TEXT.html,".e. an oxydative hydrogenation (Figure 2.a). This oxidation with dioxygen forms a vicinal diol and adds two hydrogens on the ring. This step needs energy to break the aromaticity. This complex enzyme needs NADH,H+.
The Second step in the reaction uses the dihydro diol dehydrogenase from Ralstonia sp. (E2, BBa_K2198002). This step allows the restoration of the aromaticity with a dehydrogenation of the vicinal diol. As a result, the next enzyme in the process will be able to open the ring with an oxidative cleavage. The reaction requires the action of the catechol 2,3- dioxygenase from P. putida (E3, BBa_K2198003).
Figure 2: Enzymatic cocktail degradation of Poly Aromatic hydrocarbons: The case of Anthracene.  Enzymes involved in the multi-step catalysis of PAHs degradation. E1:naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase is a homodimer made of E1-1 and E1-2, E2:dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, E3:catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, E4:trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase. The green arrow shows a possible cyclic effect in the reaction scheme between E3 and E4. The dotted line shows a possible feed forward step by removing pyruvate from the reaction.
The E3 is able to do an extradiol ring cleavage. Thanks to this step, the PAHs are now less toxic and available for an alkyl removal by E4, trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase from Nocardioides sp (BBa_K2198004). If we were to stop at this step of the process, all the products can be handled by chemistry thanks to this alkyl chain. Furthermore, E3 can begin an iterative degradation with E4, if the E4 main product enters in the range of substrate specificity of E3.
The last step of our degradation pathway allows us to remove a ring from the PAHs by producing a pyruvic acid molecule. This product is a common harmless cell intermediate molecule. Moreover, this step produces a smaller PAH if there are more than 2 rings at the beginning.
This second-generation PAH can reintegrate the pathway at the previous"
