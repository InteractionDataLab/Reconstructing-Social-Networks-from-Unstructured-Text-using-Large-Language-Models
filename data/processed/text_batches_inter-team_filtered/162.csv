Furthermore, many of the primers had a high probability (Gibson free energy value lower than zero) of froming dimers or hairpins. Finally, we deicided that it would most likely be more successful to use 3A assembly instead of Gibson.  In order to save time and ensure the accuracy of the sequence, we decided to synthesize instead of assemble the whole silica making device in a high copy plasmid.  Welcomed Rubeena to the iGEM team. We are looking forward to working with her!

We reevaluated our previous decision to synthesize the silica making device. We have now decided to use Gibson assembly to create the OmpA-silicatein fusion sequence and 3A assembly for the rest of the device. We believe that this will save money and, considering the time taken to order and deliver the sequence, will not take any more time than synthesizing.

What’s more, idea-sharing seminar gave the forum members chances to exchange ideas about poster design and production, as well as listen to advice and stories from experienced professor, who is now running his personal bio-company.
Visiting the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science
In February, we brainstormed the idea of our project. During this time, we visited the Institute of Zoology and discussed with Dr. Wei, the expert of Conservation Genetics, for advice. We made clear of the prospection of idea with the professors; and they confirmed that our research topic will be very meaningful in the society and gave us some very useful suggestions.
Field Trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University
On July 20th and 21st, 2017, our team took a field trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University to attend a meeting with instructors and their former iGEMers. We explained our project idea and they warmly offered us some specific suggestions in our experiment design and human practice. Informed that our attempt was to improve the salt resistance of the yeast and increase the efficiency of food waste disposal, they generously provided us some information from the former teams which had studied the similar project from a different perspective. After the communication, we had a pleasant dinner and appreciated their help. Then they offered their contact information to us, looking forward to our further improvement.
Online communication group
Because it is hard for us to have face to face communication with other teams, we had a We-chat communication group FAFU CCiC with them. This group consists many teams, like BIT-CHINA. We shared our idea with many college students, and they gave us many professional suggestions and kind help.
Education
School
Several of our teammates gave the speeches in biology classes of Beijing 101 International Department and Beijing Changping New Oriental Foreign Language School. In every speech, we mainly introduced the history of iGEM, and how creative the match is—lots of innovation are originated from this match. Then, we introduced our project—how to effectively decompose the kitchen waste with low os"

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#8 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," we took was the Spin method.
The only thing to note is that we did not midi-prep all of the samples placed in the flask; cultures 1 and 2 (both deriving from the 200ul LB+amp plates) were both spun down with supernatants removed (culture 2 from the 500ul plate was discarded) with culture 1 being placed in the freezer for storage and culture 2 used for the midi-prep process. Here's a summary of the process:
50ml of culture 1 was spun down for 10 minutes at 5,000g. The supernatant was aspirated off and the pellet was resuspended in 4ml Resuspension/RNAse solution.
4ml of lysis solution was immediately applied and after inverting the falcon tube 6 times, the solution was allowed to sit on the bench for 4 minutes. 4ml neutralisation solution was added once the time had expired and the tube inverted 6 times again.
3ml of binding solution was added and after 2 inversions the solution was placed into the filter syringe. With the plunger removed from the syringe, the lysate remained in the syringe for 5 minutes. During this time, 4ml of Column Preparation Solution was allowed to be run through the midiprep binding column (by centrifugation).
The plunger was then applied to the syringe and half of the lysate (which had been sitting in the syringe barrel for 5 minutes) was injected into the midiprep binding column. The binding column was placed in the centrifuge at 3,000g for 2 minutes and once the eluate had filtered through the remaining half of the lysate was added and treated in the same way.
4ml of Wash Solution 1 was then added to the binding column and centrifuged for 2 minutes before 4ml of Wash Solution 2 was added and then placed in the centrifuge for 2 minutes again. The eluate was discarded before the tubes were placed under a further 2 minute spin to ensure all of the ethanol had gone.
1 ml of Elution solution was then added to the midiprep binding column before the column was spun for 5 minutes at 3,000g. The eluate was then harvested at the bottom of the binding column and transferred to the freezer for storage.

Spinning Apparatus Project
Required Materials:
2 12V Stepper Motors
1 Arduino Uno R3(knockoff brand)
Breadboards
2 Easy Driver v4.4
2 12V DC adapters
Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a system of two stepper motors spinning at different speeds to stretch and wind silk.
Today's Progress:
As seen below, I was able to hook up the Arduino to the Easy Driver, and then to a Stepper motor.
The system worked incredibly well, however during the process of changing Easy drivers to test if both worked, a problem occured and I was unable to replicate the successful rotation.
After Troubleshooting, I have determined the problem does not lie in the arduino, and so I have ordered 2 new easy drivers, with the belief that poor soldering on my part caused the failure in replication, as well as poor disconnection practices of the power sources( the external 12v DC adapter as well as the Arduino)
The Easy Drivers will arrive on Saturday, Progress will continue at this time."

Collaboration
The Paris-Bettencourt - Calgary iGEM collaboration started last June when a few members from each team met at the SB6.0 synthetic biology conference in London, England. After a few beers and lab stories, we learned that despite coming from the opposite sides of the globe, we were both using synthetic biology to build biosensors to sense DNA. Each of our own systems targeted different problems, but we were struck by the number of commonalities between these projects. See the Figure 1 for a breakdown of these differences.
Figure 1. The Calgary and Paris Bettencourt biosensors both sense DNA, albeit with some differences in how they function mechanistically.
As we talked about our projects and discussed our adventures searching through iGEM, we agreed that there is a lack of DNA biosensor components in the Parts Registry. We were thus excited by the possibility of developing modular DNA sensing platforms that future iGEM teams could repurpose for other problems. Moreover, we found the lack of organization of biosensors in the registry frustrating. Each teams veteran iGEMers mentioned that biosensors had consistently finished as grand prize winners in previous years of iGEM. This left us curious as to how biosensors had evolved since the beginnings of iGEM and how each of our current projects fit into the greater context of the iGEM Parts Registry.
SensiGEM - A biosensor database
To get an answer to this question, we built a collaboration between our teams. Since our initial meeting in London, members of each team have tele-conferenced weekly on Skype. After accustoming ourselves to the eight hour time difference, we"

Re-transformed LuxBioBrick
 
7/20/11
Removed plates from the fridge so that they could dry (trying to salvage the liquidy plates).
Learned how to use Ken Chen’s autoclave machine and wrote a protocol for the machine/LB plate making.  The autoclave machine is the small 70’s-looking machine on wheels on the far side of the BE undergrad lab.
Streaked a plate using a colony from the 20ul Lux plate (this was the only plate that had successful cell growth).
Started autoclaving 2 250ml LB agar with the intention of making chloramphenicol plates and ampicillin+arabinose plates.  The amp plates that are currently in the fridge look bad and should be checked.
 
7/21/11
16 LB + chloramphenicol + arabinose plates were made.  184ul of chloramphenicol was added to 250ml LB agar. (The amount used in 500ml of the agar was 368ul so we divided this number by two.  See lab journal 07/18 for details).
.1876g of arabinose was added to this 250ml LB agar. (We want approximately 5*10^3uM of arabinose to maximize light production, so 5*10^-3moles/L*.25L*150.14g/mol = .1876g arabinose)
12 LB + ampicillin plates were made.
Threw away LB + ampicillin plates that were liquid/unusable.
2 colonies were isolated from the 20ul lux plate and inoculated in 2 snap cap tubes at 4:30pm.
7.35ul of 34mg/ml chloramphenicol was added to 5ml LB broth to yield an end concentration of 50ug chloramphenicol/ml solution).
The plate with the streaked colonies and the original 20ul lux plate are in the minifridge in one of the side doors.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then"

Standard practices, such as wearing gloves when handling microorganisms, as well as using autoclave and bleach to decontaminate materials are stringently followed. Therefore, our iGEM project is of very little concern to the biosafety committee.  The Biosafety committee only has to be contacted when organisms of risk level two or higher are used in research.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
      The use of antibiotics to select for microorganisms of interest has become prevalent in research and industry. In large scale ethanol production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used to break down sugars in a corn-based emulsion and produce ethanol as a major product. Unfortunately, contamination of the emulsion with other bacteria like Lactobacillus spp. is extremely common, so antibiotics are used to control bacterial growth, eliminating competition for yeast growth and maximizing ethanol production. Using antibiotics on such a large scale works wonderfully for industry; it is cheap and effective. However, the wide spread use of antibiotics has caused rampant antibiotic resistance in wild-type strains of bacteria. The leftover antibiotic laden emulsion from ethanol production is often sold to farmers as cattle feed, further spreading antibiotic resistance.
      Antibiotics are also commonly used in synthetic biology to select for bacteria with the plasmids of interest. While this practice works extremely well in the present, it cannot be maintained in the future, as more antibiotic resistance is spread to wild-type strains from iGEM teams and other sources. Hence, alternative selection measures may have to be developed for future iGEM teams to not only prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance, but also to set an example and lead the way for industry.  One possibility is to implement a common selection practice used in yeast genetics and integrate it into E. coli. An auxotrophic strain of E. coli with a mutation in Tryptophan (TRP1) could be transformed with a plasmid vector containing a TRP1 gene. The transformation mix would then be plated on an agar plate with growth media lacking Tryptophan. Only auxotrophic E. coli colonies containing the plasmid vector of interest would be present on the plate. By decreasing the dependence of antibiotics in the lab, iGEM can help stop the spread of antibiotic resistance, which is a rising health and safety concern across the world.

Week 1
Wet Lab
We chose the plasmid of kit plate to transform and amplify. We designed parts by adding promoter (BBa_K206000) and RBS(BBa_B0034) to the upstream region of luciferase gene and adding prefix and suffix and we committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize this gene.
We gathered and summarized the data of algal bloom case in North China.
Week 2
Wet Lab
We transformed the plasmid pSB1C3 (BBa_K592009/BBa_E1010/BBa_J04450) in DH5α and proceeded amplification, extracted the plasmid and used two kinds of enzyme (EcoR I, Pst I) to digest and verify.
We designed primers and committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize these primers (nluc, nluc-pSB1C3, cluc, cluc-pSB1C3, β-tubulin, β-tubulin-pSB1C3, α-tubulin, α-tubulin-pSB1C3).
We borrowed expression plasmid pET21a(+) from the lab of Yang Dong to amplify and DNA template (nluc, cluc, mcf-7, hepg-2), and we amplified these fragments (nluc, cluc, α-tubulin, β-tubulin) by PCR.
Dry Lab
We guided FAFU about modeling.
Week 3
Wet Lab
We designed primers about TOPO (α-tubulin-TOPO-F, β-tubulin-TOPO-F, α-pET21a(+), β-pET21a(+), nluc-pET21a(+), cluc-pET21a(+)) and committed the GENEWIZ company to synthesize these primers.
We tested amplification products by PCR, and linked them to produce plasmids pSB1C3 and plasmids pET21a(+). Meanwhile we did topo clone.

However, for the outermost grid points of our domain the finite    difference is defined as (32).
$$    \delta^2_x C_{1,j}=C_{J_x,j}-2\cdot C_{1,j}+C_{2,j}    \;\;\; \text{(32a)}    $$    $$    \delta^2_x C_{J_x,j}=C_{J_x-1,j}-2\cdot C_{J_x,j}+C_{1,j}    \;\;\; \text{(32b)}    $$    $$    \delta^2_y C_{i,1}=C_{i,J_y}-2\cdot C_{i,1}+C_{i,2}    \;\;\; \text{(32c)}    $$    $$    \delta^2_y C_{i,J_y}=C_{i,J_y-1}-2\cdot C_{i,J_y}+C_{i,1}    \;\;\; \text{(32d)}    $$
Implementing these    adjusted finite difference expressions in our computational schemes    breaks the bandedness of our matrices, but the result is still a    nearly-banded sparse matrix for which efficient methods also exist.    Therefore, we can implement periodic boundary conditions efficiently.
Matching
The purpose of the hybrid model is to employ appropriate modeling   techniques for different entities that behave differently and   couple them within a single system. The advantage is that   computational costs can be lowered while retaining accuracy.   However, if no special care is taken to adapt the modules to each   other in an efficient way, the computational savings might not be   significant or even nonexistent. Therefore in this paragraph we   discuss the matching of temporal scales and spatial scales in the   hybrid model.
Decoupling of Timesteps
In order to benefit from the implicit PDE-solver described       above the agent's timestep is chosen smaller       then the timestep of the PDE solver.       As a result, the agent density field goes through several       timesteps before the PDE solver takes one timestep.        The question then becomes at which timestep the        density field should be sampled to provide the source term in"

Monday was the first day of the SUPERB program. I got introduced to the IGEM team. Doug gave a tutorial on Clotho and on plug ins. Got the Clotho source code from the repository.
Tuesday we had a meeting. I will be working with Adam on the language project. BOL will be a language which is based on the abstract model of parts which form the lowest level of hierarchy and will be the basic data types in this language. Parts can be composed of other parts, but in themselves cannot be decomposed any further into lower level data types.  Devices will be at the second level of hierarchy and can consist of multiple devices as well as parts. It will be different from other languages like Antimony, SBML , or BNGL , as BOL will be a structural human readable language not geared towards modeling. BOL has a direct relationship to BOGL symbols, the graphical representation and can be used to convert textual designs to graphical representations and vice versa.
Wednesday brainstormed with Adam on the syntax of BOL. It will have defined data structures based on the BOGL symbols like promoter, RFS. Supportive data types will be string, int, composite. Also, an important feature that we would like BOL to have is the ability to create more user defined data types. I created a preliminary data type table on properties, data types, operators. Also started familiarizing myself with GNU Bison , which we will use as our parser for the language.
Thursday continued to work on syntax and to write the code for an available diagram.
Diagram that uses BOGL symbols
Researched more on other languages. It seems that BOL will indeed be different from previous languages. The rule based description has been implemented in BNGL , which is a modeling language and concentrates on species, molecules rather than standard parts. We still have to go over the syntax for rules and how we will implement them in BOL. The logical """

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Team12_-_-_TEXT.html,"avours, we have pursued marketing and fundraising initiatives. Our communication with businesses in many industrial sectors allows for the discussion of the opportunities and future developments of synthetic biology and the potential applications of our wetlab and modelling projects. Our marketing endeavour is intertwined with the outreach initiative and can thus be found under the 'Human Practices' section.
Another important aspect of communication in this competition is the availability of collaborative work, within our own team and as a community itself. Our team is made up of students from health sciences, kinesiology, and engineering;  who are actively participating in interdisciplinary work. This requires the ability to communicate information to people from different backgrounds and perspectives. As well, iGEM allows us to communicate with other teams at an international scale. We hope to establish means of communication and thus cooperation with other teams in our respective projects, enhancing the iGEM experience.
The wetlab, modelling, second life, human practices, and fundraising components of our project have allowed us to establish communication at the cell, individual, and synthetic bio community levels.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," our constructs and sharing them with other iGEM teams, you have to take a closer look on BBa_K1362091-97! Read more about it under Collaborations.
Improving an existing Part
Standardization and building up on existing parts are the fundaments of iGEM. We improved a Xylanase (wood degrading enzyme) by improving its sequence for the expression in E. coli and further characterized its function in respect to heat stability.
Favorite Parts.
The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2014 had built a new biological system for the iGEM community integrating split-inteins.   Intein splicing is a natural process that excises one part of a protein and leaves the remaining parts irreversibly attached. This great function allows you to modify your protein in numerous ways.
Creating a toolbox including all great functions and possibilities of inteins, we need a new standard for the scientific world of iGEM. This standard, the RFC of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2014, allows us to easily and modulary work with split inteins.
Our favorite Parts represent the basic constructs of our toolbox – the Assembly and the Circularization construct, which are both tested in many methods and applications.
In the following we present you BBa_K1362000 , the construct for circularization, BBa_K1362100 and BBa_K1362101 , the N- and the C-construct for assembly. Take a look and visit the Partsregistry to read the associated documentation.
Circularization Construct. BBa_K1362000
BBa_K1362000
This part is an element of the Team Heidelberg 2014 intein toolbox and can be used as described in the new RFC[i]. The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to circularize any linear protein. While conserving the functionality of their linear counterpart, circular proteins can be superior in terms of thermostability, resistance against chemical denaturation and protection from exopeptidases. Moreover, a circular backbone can improve in vivo stability of therapeutical proteins and peptides. Using this part, Xylanase, lambda lysozyme and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) were successfully circularized.
Assembly Constructs. BBa_K1362100 and BBa_K1362101
BBa_K1362100
This intein assembly construct is part of our strategy for cloning with split inteins. Inteins are naturally occuring peptide sequences that splice out of a precursor protein and attach the remaining ends together to form a new protein. When splitting those intein"

We are not content to rest on the results of the iGEM competition. We want more. Here, we summarized a developed and suitable mode for iGEM teams to build a strong connection with companies. Additionally, we are attending to transformation our project into practice and registered the part of “After iGEM”.

Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital
• Project Design
Making something that can quickly detect indicators had always been our direction. Since it is characterized by rapid detection which we are going to utilize and find a suitable situation for, we turned to hospitals-first aid needs quick response! We went to SIR RUN RUN SHAW HOSPITAL, the third affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University for valued opinions of clinicians.
It is widely acknowledged that General Surgery is well-informed involved in emergency departments and a great many consultations, so we contacted the director of General Surgery who had extensive experience in this field. After learning our appeals, the director recommended several suitable applications for A Detector: poisoning, flu, myocardial infarction and first-aid. Symptoms of the diseases above are all not visible but requires urgent detection. Through WeChat and offline meetings, we discussed the feasibility of each proposal with him.
First, poisoning is relatively unpopular, and the poisons are diverse, which puts higher demands on high specificity and sensitivity of the approach to detect. The cost of translating research results into clinical practice is also relatively high and requires substantial funding support.
Actually, we are interested in studying flu because there are always countless people suffering in the spring and autumn in Hangzhou. If it can be detected by portable chips, it will achieve effective early-prevention, reduce infection and benefit the society, especially the elderly and children. However, God did not grant what one prayed for sometimes. Our campus lacked a corresponding laboratory with negative pressure to study virus and the headquarters of iGEM had strict restrictions on safety as well.
Therefore, we used to struggle between myocardial infarction and first-aid. If the time window of myocardial infarction is not caught, the patient would pay the price of disability and even death. So is first aid. Meanwhile, both the myocardial infarction and emergency biochemistry are also complicated and have urgent need for rapid detection. Whereas, as for which indicators are most suitable for our project, the director of General Surgery said that he could not"

Using this construct, the only insert we found was the 9bp of pSB1C3 homology (Figure 3).
Figure 3: pSB1C3 self-homology is in empty vectors
Sequencing the vectors that were empty from colony PCR, we found that unanimously that in place of the gene insert was the 9bp pSB1C3 homology instead.
This suggests that pSB1C3 is not a good vector for Gibson Assembly.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.

DspB
DspB has been isolated and purified and has been shown to increase dissemination of wild type cells from biofilms and restore dissemination in mutant cells (Kaplan 2003).
DspB comes from the bacteria Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.  It is most likely an N-acetylglucosaminidase that causes the detachment of cells from biofilm colonies through the 1→ 4 glycosidic bond of β-substituted N-acetylglucosamine (Kaplan 2003).  DspB is homologous to family 20 glycosyl hydrolases which cleave terminal monosaccharide residues (Kaplan 2003).
One possible substrate for DspB is a type IV pilus required for the attachment and autoaggregation of bacteria by altering its adhesive properties.  Another possible substrate is exopolymeric substance (EPS) which is part of the exopolysaccharide matrix which plays a role in biofilm formation.  Exopolysaccharides may contain N-acetylglucosamine which DspB is thought to hydrolyze.  Manuel et. al have characterized the mechanistic aspects of DspB and show that conserved D183 and E184 resemble the proposed 20 β-hexosaminidase mechanism; that aromatic residues W237, Y278 and D183 assist N-acetal group orientation and hydrolysis; that Y187 plays a role in specificity; and that residues R27, E332 and W330 help stabilize the transition state of hydrolysis (Manuel 2007).
We will test two versions of the gene.  The WT gene was sent to us by the University of British Columbia 2010 iGEM Team and was already cloned into pSB1C3.  The second is a snthetic version designed with codons optimized for Caulobacter but resulting in the same amino acid sequence.  This gene was synthesized by IDT . BioBrick part BBa_K531004 .

Spinning more Tamura
Fasih prepared a pooled Tamura fraction
concentration is 1.6 mg/mL
want to spin total volume of 300 uL
Let's prepare a dope such that the Tamura:silk mass ratio is 1:500, and 15% w/v.
recipe
225 uL of 20% w/v silk dope
56.1 uL of the pooled Tamura fraction
19.4 uL of ddH2O
procedure
spun at 6uL/min into 70% v/v ethanol
spun silk was wound around tweezers
results
the spin appears to be successful
the majority of the spin ended up in a single contiguous fiber. The fiber looks and feels much more like regular silk.
the resulting thread was much more resilient than the previous spin.
visual inspection under the UV box shows that it fluoresces
the same silk sample under the UV box. Its glow is very apparent. Sample on the right is Tamura co-spin. Sample on the left is native b.mori silk. Note that this picture was taken on July 20, while the sample was co-spun on July 14. Even after a week, it' still fluorescent!
UV microscopy verified its fluorescence.
20x magnification. 100% excitation light intensity.
thoughts
The fact that the fiber was stronger and thinner during this spin could be due to a number of factors:
this spin was 15% w/v. Last time's spin was 12% w/v.
As we wound the thread around tweezers, we were stretching the thread.
This spin's fluorescence is much less than last time's spin , which was much thicker. This is despite the fact that last time's spin had a silk:tamura ratio of 4000:1, while this time's spin has a ratio of 500:1."

Lac characterisation and IPTG effect on protein production
Aims
Characterise Lac promoter by varying amounts of IPTG
Determine the IPTG concentration that allows for maximal protein production while still being non-toxic to the cell
Assay
The cells will be grown until OD=0.7. Now, IPTG of various concentrations will be added, and the RFP output will be measured.

All magnetic effects that are observed for particles between 1 nm to 100 nm are considered superparamagnetic. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles only show magnetic effects when an external magentic field is applied. This field aligns the electron spins in the particle resulting in a magnetic moment mediated by an external magnetic field.

3.3 Iron Homeostasis, E. coli Nissle and Knockouts
As an essential element for almost all life iron is often necessary for the activity of certain proteins but can also be problematic because of its toxicity and poor solubility. Organisms have evolved to regulate their iron effectively and as iron in an organism is usually supplied in a limited condition pathogens evolved iron acquisition systems to outcompete other microorganism.[1]
E. coli Nissle 1917 is a probiotic strain which is used for medical treatment of diseases (infections) of the gastrointestinal tract. This probiotic strain is available at pharmacies for the public. Since EcN is classified as a non-pathogenic strain in category S0 one might never assume that this strain could ever become pathogenic or be a possible danger to seriously ill patients consuming the probiotic. However, genomic analysis of EcN showed that the genome of tested EcN cultures possess genes from horizontal transformations such as adherence factors or iron uptake systems. Do these findings pose the possible transfer of virulence factors as well? Different studies showed that depending on environmental conditions EcN developed pathogenecity (Dr. Schulze). Depending on the location E. coli manifests it is differenced between intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC) and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). IPEC causes severe diarrhea, while ExPEC are often constituents of human microbiome. They behave unobtrusive"

Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube

Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.

The Experiment
To round out the experiments for DNA recovery, it is essential that we show that the recovered DNA is in fact plasmid DNA from the relevant lysed cells. To that end, we again set up an experiment involving two flasks but this time each flask contains two cultures. For one flask, one culture is a co-transformation of a lysis plasmid and a RFP-containing plasmid and the other is a co-transformation of a negative control plasmid with a GFP-containing plasmid. In the other flask, the reverse is true: lysis is with GFP and negative control is with RFP.
Induction with IPTG lyses the cells with the lysis cassette but leaves the cells with the negative control free to produce the red fluorescence. Collecting the supernatant and sterile filtering it reveals, by qPCR or by transforming it and counting the colonies, that the supernatant contains RFP plasmids in one flask and GFP plasmids in the other. Meanwhile, the large flask from which the supernatant samples are taken should be yellow-green and pink respectively, since the remaining cells will fluoresce according to those colors.

The team also obtained help from other universities in order to complete the project. As nobody at our university works with Physcomitrella patens which the team chose to work with we had to find an advisor who could support us with the transformation procedure which is not really simple for plants. Additionally researches from other universities helped us by providing plasmids.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Reski at Freiburg University (Germany)
The team at the Chair for Plant Biotechnology is working on gene expression in the bryophyte model plant Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B.S.G. at different levels in correlation with phenotype analysis and additionally employs comparative genomic approaches.
The Reski team kindly supported us by supervising our moss transformations at their lab and by allowing us to use some of their equipment and materials for the process. Our special thanks go to Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann .
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Fussenegger at ETH Zurich (Switzerland)
The research group at the Chair for Biotechnology and Bioengineering is implementing a progress in basic research to achieve generic and prototypic advances in human therapy by focusing on mammalian cells and capitalizing on an integrated interdisciplinary systems approach. Their current research initiatives include several programs interfacing with biopharmaceutical manufacturing, gene therapy and tissue engineering.
They kindly provided us with the pSH21 plasmid which was used as template for the Polioviral Internal Ribosome Entry Site ( BBa_K1159300 ).
Laboratory of Dr. G.D. Wright  at McMaster University (Canada)
The Wright Lab is trying to understand fundamental aspects of how antibiotics work, their sources and how bacteria become resistant to them.
They kindly provided us with the plasmids pDEST14_ereA and pDEST14_ereB which was used as a template for the Erythromycin Esterase Type II (<partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>).
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arndt  at Potsdam University (Germany)
The team at the Chair for Molecular Biotechnology investigates the factors that mediate interactions in coiled-coil proteins in order to target coiled-coil domains of proteins e.g. involved in tumorigenesis, tumor proliferation and metastasis.
Sven Hagen who had participated several times in iGEM in the past kindly provided us with the pBad-mVenus (RFC 25) expression plasmid. This plasmid was used for the production of recombinant protein in E. coli.

Then we held a small class for the students: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for students to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.
We talked about the scale, location, function, discovery and shape of DNA based on history and researches as well as knowledge of genetic engineering introduced by a project done by USTC in iGEM 2014.
We also included a brief history about the development of synthetic biology in the lecture, hoping to impress them about the mechanism in biological world and thus they might be attracted into the field of biology in the future.
After that we showed them around our laboratory and introduce our equipments to them. In addition, procedure and some rules of using peptites were also taught to them. Many of the high school students showed strong interest in our project and biological experiments.
Then we played a video describing our daily experiments in laboratory, which was transcribed in advance. The video consists of four parts, plasmids extraction, making mediums, digging out single colonies and electrolysis, which were completed by four of our team members, respectively. With that video, high school students could gain more detailed and comprehensive knowledge of our experiments and project. In this way, we aimed to enhance their interest about synthetic biology.
Finally, since it is the 10th year that we have attended iGEM, the history of USTCers' participating in iGEM was told to them. We encouraged them to study harder to join us one day, so that our glory will be continued by THEMSELVES.
Although nowadays it become difficult for public to catch up with the rapidly developing science, we still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.
**Introduction of iGEM to freshmen **
In the beginning of this semester we held a lecture for freshmen of our university to introduce iGEM competition as well as our project to them. By holding this lecture we wish to encourage those new students who are interested in synthetic biology and likely to choose biology as their major to try to learn more about this field and participate in iGEM competition next year.
Kaiyue Ma, the leader of Team USTC, gave them an introduction about molecular biology told them what the scientists do with the technique of synthetic biology. During the lecure, we tried to show that scientists hire the cutting-edge technology to explore the complex metabolic process of organisms and creat new applications"

iGEM at Sorbonne Université
Sorbonne University was born on January 1, 2018, from the merger of the Paris-Sorbonne and Pierre and Marie Curie universities. The purpose of pooling the strengths of these two institutions is to lead and train future players in world-class research, presenting the full range of disciplines in the fields of literature, the arts, the humanities and social sciences, the sciences, engineering and medicine.
As Sorbonne University students, we are proud to bring to the international scene of synthetic biology the values of scientific excellence and openness to the world of our university already rich in history.
The first iGEM UPMC-Paris team was created in 2016 at the initiative of students in the Master of Molecular and Cellular Biology who recognized themselves in the values of iGEM and allowed the creation of a second team in 2017 Both teams were able to lead with determination their projects ""Bee subtilis"" and “The BioMaker Factory” rewarded by a Bronze Medal.
We have set up a tutoring system between the previous teams and this year's team, which allows us to exchange and benefit from their experience of the competition, which with the help of our teachers gives us every chance to win the competition. highest award of the contest.

We were pointed in the direction of Pauli Kallio from the University of Turku, Finland (their collaborator), who gave us permission to use their vector. The Imperial team then promptly provided us with it.
Blue box for gel examination - given our struggles with our own electrophoresis kit(our dye was not specific enough), the Imperial team lent us their spare BlueBox so that we could start using SybrSafe dye, producing far better results and allowing our project to move forwards.
Competent cells - as a school we have no access to a freezer where we could keep chemically competent cells, but thankfully the Imperial team very kindly shared theirs as well as their facilities for us to perform transformations. They also taught us about safely transporting microbial plates across town.
GoCulture Game - we have been testing Imperial team's computer game, both within our team and with younger pupils. We met up with them in order for them to see some students playing the game and for us to give them the feedback that they needed.

COOPERATIONS
Edinburgh IGEM team
During the theoretical work on Synbiome we decided to use a β-glucosidase to provide our Interkingdom Consortium with a usable carbon source. We asked Chris French to send us the part BBa_K392008, made by team Osaka in 2010 and encoding a β-glucosidase from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. Firstly, we tested the part and it worked, but the DNA sequencing we decided to make during the generation of our parts BBa_K553005 and BBa_K553006 underlined the presence of a frameshift at the beginning of the coding sequence, introducing a stop codon. We shared this information with team Edinburgh and together we elaborated a solution to this strange problem (more details can be found on the cooperation page of team Edinburgh’s website). They were also very kind to provide us with a protocol of an assay that can be used to test the activity of this β-glucosidase using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide.

Homogenisation would allow the fatty acids and the enzymes to come in to direct contact with each other very easily in vitro. Whilst this would appear to be a very simple way of producing the required fatty acids, there is of course the problem that the cells would be killed and therefore unable to produce any more product in the long run. This would be a major inconvenience for industry, which would want sustained production over time. Therefore feeding the bacteria exogenously would be a more viable option of long-term production. This has its own set of problems, however. The primary concern is that passive diffusion of long-chain fatty acids is very slow and therefore could be rate limiting. This said, it would cause less metabolic stress on the cells and in the long run return a higher yield per cell.
Results
Improvement of existing BioBrick
Our biobrick BBa_K1027002 (delta 12 desaturase) is an improvement of the BBa_K925000 biobrick created by the St Andrews team in 2012. We improved this biobrick from the ground up, starting by taking the protein sequence from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This protein sequence was reverse translated and then codon optimised for expression in E. coli. We believe our redesigned biobrick has two features that the original biobrick does not. Firstly, the original biobrick could not be transformed by iGEM HQ, whereas we have managed successful transformation (as shown by the plate pictures). Next, the St. Andrews biobrick was cloned from cyanobacteria, and so is not optimised for expression in E. coli. As St. Andrews then went on to express their delta 12 desaturase biobrick in E. coli it follows that a sequence optimised for expression in this chassis, as ours was, would perform better than the sequence naturally found in cyanobacteria.
Orbitrap LC-MS analysis
Delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes were chosen because their products, when expressed in their host organism (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803), convert stearic acid into oleic acid, and oleic acid into linoleic acid respectively. Therefore, we fed batches of transformed DH5-alpha with 2 different concentrations of exogenous fatty acid (0.1% and 0.5% stearic acid fed to the delta 9 desaturase batch, and 0.1% and 0.5% oleic acid fed to"

As shown above in the gel image, there is still some PCR that needs to be done. Additionally, it appears that Joe's knockout PCR was not working either, so that PCR was to be repeated as well. It appears apparent that increased concentrations of DMSO and magnesium chloride help the reaction, so the appropriate amount of each was added to the mastermix. The reactions were as follows: TrpB with Kan cassette, TrpA, TrpB, ArgC, and MetA.
Since we were planning to put these into biobricks, it was imperative that we made sure that there were no restriction sites. To do this, we used the NCBI data for the gene sequence and ran it through Nebcutter, searching for all illegal sites. No illegal sites were found in TrpB, TyrA, TrpA, ArgC, or MetA. Lucky.
As shown above, a reaction for the tyrA gene worked. Using this PCR product and the rfp plasmid, we digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The resultant product was used to transform Epi300 cells. Tomorrow, we will check for white colonies among the red ones, which would suggest that the ligation was successful. A colony PCR will be done to confirm.

As a team, we decided to participate in iGEM's Fifth International InterLab Study along with other teams from around the world. This study is organized by iGEM's measurement committee in an effort to better measurement techniques in the field of synthetic biology. Our involvement in the study required that we submit measurement data dealing with the fluorescence and absorbance associated with cells transformed with different test devices. Throughout our experiments, we tested 8 plasmids (2 controls and 6 test devices), and we measured the absorbance and fluorescence of our samples using a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader. We divided the protocol into six components: (1) measuring the OD600 reference point of LUDOX CL-X, (2) construction of a particle standard curve, (3) construction of a standard fluorescence curve, (4) transforming the two controls and 6 test devices into competent DH5α cells, (5) conducting Abs600 and fluorescence measurements of transformed DH5α cells, and (6) calibration of OD600 into colony forming unit (CFU) counts which are directly related to viable cell counts.
Step One: Measurement of LUDOX CL-X OD600 Reference Point
We used LUDOX CL-X as a reference to obtain a conversion factor to determine an OD600, similar to that acquired from a spectrophotometer, from an Abs600 read from the plate reader.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," it is possible to operate without reliance upon the lab space of other Bindley Bioscience Center scientists, lending additional flexibility to the projects iGEMmers are able to complete.
Phosphorus genes arrived, and the team got to work on PCR amplification in the afternoon. This included resuspending IDT DNA gBlocks and using PCR to increase the amount of DNA present for transformation.
THE WEEKEND
So diligent is this year’s team that several members completed additional PCR amplification and iGEM kit plate promoter transformations on Saturday and Sunday. After digestion and ligation, they did some gel electrophoresis, as well, running several different samples.
Week 4
MONDAY, JUNE 13
Most significantly this week, team members hosted Molecular Agriculture Summer Institutes (MASI) high school students in the lab as they worked with Emma on completing InterLab protocols [InterLab is an iGEM-wide study working to establish a consistent unit of measurement for fluorescence; experimentation and measurement is completed using GFP.] The transformations completed over the weekend proved successful–the positive RFP control exhibited growth, while there was no growth on the negative control. Transformed cells were inoculated and plates parafilmed for short-term storage. PCR was completed for 3 phosphorus genes whose gel electrophoresis analyses were unclear when attempted over the weekend. Wiki design was also discussed to get this critical project element up and running ASAP.
TUESDAY, JUNE 14
Lab work for Tuesday included the mixing of gels for later electrophoresis, the miniprep of promoters that were PCR’ed previously, and continued InterLab transformations.
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15
Meeting day! Highlights of this week’s meeting include a discussion of the utilization of mass spectroscopy to complete proteomic profiles, the wastewater analytics tools possibly available to us through the generosity of Dr. Ashley Hammac and the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Lab, and the idea to replicate a study upregulating E. coli genes related to phosphorus uptake and storage as a basis of comparison to engineered strains. Via Skype, the team established a collaboration agreement with Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology’s iGEM team, aiding them with fluorescent microscopy in exchange for help characterizing some proteins.
In the afternoon, several team members volunteered with the Wabash River Enhancement Corporation (WREC) by aiding in the upkeep of a rain garden in Lafayette designed to use plants to stop pollutants from infiltrating the Wabash.

Therefore , the jth column records all the impacts the system exerts to the jth substances.
Let xj(t) denotes the concentration of substance j at time t , then we use the following ODE to characterize xj(t) for \(j\in\{1,2,...n\}\)           $$ \frac{\mathbb{d}x_j(t)}{\mathbb{d}t} = \prod_{i=1}^n\{ \frac{R_{ij}(R_{ij}+1)}{2}f(x_i(t))+\frac{(R_{ij}+1)(R_{ij}-1)}{-1}+\frac{R_{ij}(R_{ij}-1)}{2}g(x_i(t))\}- \beta \times x_j(t)           $$

Modelling Workshop at the UK meet up
Overview
On Friday the 12th of July our team was at UCL for the iGEM UK meet up. We delivered a workshop about Mathematical modelling and using the rule-based modelling language BioNetGen. We believe the workshop presentation and handouts we developed are a great resource for those new to biological modelling.
We first gave a presentation covering the following areas:
What is modelling?
The benefits of rule-based modelling.
The difference between deterministic and stochastic modelling.
How to build a Michaelis-Menten model with BioNetGen.
NB. Information about modelling the Subtilin system is included in our lecture slides on our wiki for the extra keen but was not covered in our talk.
We then ran a practice session in which we helped people get to grips with the BioNetGen language and the software required to produce models ( RuleBender ). We provided a hand-out guiding people in how to build a Michaelis-Menten model and a simplified Lac operon model. This workshop also introduced Team:Leeds to BioNetGen which they then used in their project.

Pittsburgh,2016,Team:Pittsburgh#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," the work of Huang, Vazin, and Liu . The lead-specific DNAzyme was based off the work of Lan, Furuya, and Lu .
The structure of the DNAzymes was created by combining aspects of the Collins toehold circuits, specifically D and G, and existing metalloDNAzymes. MetalloDNAzymes split their substrate at a specific sequence, releasing the products into solution (if properly designed), given the presence of the applicable cofactor(s). The Collins trigger sequences turn the Collins reporter sequence on by interacting with the toehold sequence ahead of the reporter (in this case, the LacZ sequence). The point at which the substrate splits is controlled; in the case of the thallium metalloDNAzyme, the substrate is split at the sequence rA*G, where rA is a RNA base, * is representative of a phosphothioate bond, and G is a normal DNA base. For the lead DNAzyme, it simply occurs at the sequence rAG.
Taking the initial structure of the DNAzyme and substrate, the substrate is first altered such that the split will create a piece which has the trigger sequence of the toehold circuit. Additionally, the trigger sequence is placed on the 5’ end of the altered substrate, so that the piece of the trigger sequence which initially bonds to the toehold sequence is bonded to the DNAzyme. This measure is to prevent the trigger sequence from activating the toehold sequence without the presence of the metallic cofactors. The DNAzyme is then altered such that both arms (the areas to the left and right of the catalytic loop) will bond to the appropriate places of the substrate.
Back to Top
Toehold Switch
Toehold switches are RNA sequences that regulate protein expression by hiding the ribosome binding site (RBS) in a hairpin loop. They require a trigger sequence to unfold, expose the RBS, and begin translation. Here is a video illustrating the mechanism of a toehold switch:
The Collins circuit utilizes a toehold switch to activate the lacZ (β-galactosidase) gene, which then is used to cleave a specialized substrate which turns purple (absorbance = 570 nm). The original Collins circuit utilized a RNA trigger and RNA toehold. Our modified circuit utilizes a DNA trigger sequence with an RNA toehold.

Furthermore, we will use GUS-PTS1 expressed in S. cerevisiae without Snc1 fused to a membrane anchor for a control. We will measure the active GUS in the supernatant with a liquid assay based on the turnover of  4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide to 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) (Blázquez et al, 2007) . Here we expect a higher activity of GUS in the supernatant of cultures with Snc1 decorated peroxisomes.
To increase the variability of our constructs we also designed vectors with and without a GS-Linker connecting the Snc1 with the Pex15. Additionally we tested our constructs in strains with a deletion of Pex11 . This deletion leads to formation of larger peroxisomes and may increase the efficiency of our secretion mechanism.

In Vivo Sensors
Surveillance of key physiology factors is indispensable for a good understanding and optimization of metabolic processes in compartments. In comparison to in vitro measurements, in vivo sensors have major advantages in terms of measuring relevant physiological properties in living systems. Former methods required destructive assays, expensive and time consuming preprocessing of cells or compartments to determining fluxes inside cells Frommeret al. (2010) . This leads to inexact measurements with poor spatial and temporal resolution. The usage of in vivo sensors tackles all of these problems at once. They allow detecting fluxes inside the cell and compartments in real time and supersede difficult and time consuming cell and organelle extraction.
Sensors
To enrich our toolbox we decided to measure four essential physiological factors: ATP, NADPH, Glutathione and pH.
ATP/ADP conversion is used as an energy currency in many cellular processes like translocation of proteins and metabolites or anabolic and catabolic turnovers. It is assumed that ANT1P, an ATP/AMP antiporter, is located in the peroxisomal membrane. Furthermore, the shuttle mechanism of the peroxisomal protein import machinery is ATP dependent (Palmieri L. et al., 2001) . NADPH plays an important role in anabolic pathways and is also indispensable to our desired pathways of nootkatone and violacein. Glut"

Preparation of iGEM-parts for shipping
19-09-2011
People: Simon, Anna
Our Biobricks will be picked up by FedEx today between 1 pm and 3 pm for shipping to the registry. 6 out of 7 Biobricks are ready for take-off, but BBa_K568004 has to be finished in time!
Cloning
Part BBa_K568004
The 9 prepped samples of BBa_K568004 have to be checked for correct sizes of vector and insert. The following digestion was prepared:
Due to time reasons, 10 µl of the sample was digested for 1 min in the microwave at 800 W, while the other 10 µl of the sample were incubated at 37 °C.
The product of quick digest in the microwave was separated using electrophoresis with an analytical 0.8 %  agarose gel. This yielded the following picture:
The bands of all samples look fine. The insert BBa_K568004 is 306"

TecMonterrey_GDA,2017,Team:TecMonterrey GDA#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," but, unfortunately, correct waste management and recycling is not done everywhere, and consequences are for everyone. Context is key in determining how long it will take for proper measures to be implemented in each country, and our problem prevails even with new wonderful ideas.
Proposals are often criticized for having a low impact at a large scale:
“Many innovations and improvement efforts show potential, but to date these have proved to be too fragmented and uncoordinated to have impact at scale.” (WEC, 2016).
But such a complex issue that englobes economic context, education and even a legal framework towards companies and infrastructure cannot be solved with only one “large scale proposal” or many. It would be really hard to solve a multifactorial issue with few proposals given the different contexts. Multiple proposals have to work together to ensure we do not reach this future, meaning that we can implement solutions around our context: a million small steps that sum up to a single effort to reduce the plastic in our oceans.
It would be ideal to reduce plastic production, if our global economy followed a circular model, but in our country it is not done yet. Tthere has been some few movements and actions, for example a law passed from 2010 that prohibited the use of non-biodegradable plastic bags but only in the biggest (and capital) city of Mexico. The effort is applauded, however the law has some leakages…
1. Consideration on what they contemplate and classify as degradable (could be up to 100 years, for example, and the problem also revolves on how much damage that plastic could be doing to the marine ecosystems) and the use of oxo-degradable plastics which have the same carbon footprint as regular plastics and are not environmentally friendly, since they just break apart into smaller pieces (America Retail, 2013). But, in an official study made by the SEMARNAT (Governamental organization for the Environment and Natural Resources) and INE (National Ecology Institute), it was shown how HDPE with oxodegradable properties was actually contributing to the greenhouse gases emission by 24% more than non-oxodegradable production in Mexico(SEMARNAT, 2009). Lastly there is a chart that states that only 1.2% of recycled wastes are plastics (SEMARNAT, 2011).
2. What the plastic industry and associations contribute to the economy. The plastic industry in Mexico contributes to the 3% of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). They generate jobs for at least 150,000 people…

MODELING
We utilized the CRISPR/Cas system with gRNA engineered to recognize genes from infectious bacteria using bacterial        specific phages delivery system. Specifically, we target Cholera as a proof of principle. To target the Choleras genome,        our team focus on (1) cutting efficiency of the gRNA-CRISPR/Cas9 system and (2) the delivering efficiency of the phage        delivery system.
There are two important features we have to look at:
On the Intracellular level, in a single Cholera cell, the CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA system is transcript         and translated. The complex then cleaves the Cholera native genome, leading to cell death.
On the population level, the phagemid delivers the CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA plasmid from the probiotics         to Cholera population.
Our Mathematical Model and computer simulation provide a great way to describe the functioning and operation      of our system. Enjoy!

Demonstrations of Transformation
Electroporation into Mu-Free Donor E. coli
Figure 6: Transformation of One Tube Reaction into Mu-Free donor E. coli. The above photos show LB plates with varying types of antibiotics. MFD E. coli were electroporated, recovered in SOC media, and plated. Although few reporters can be seen (sGFP dominates each plate except on CRB), it is possible that multiple transformations succeeded.
In order to test the BHR kit’s function in a diverse array of organisms, we demonstrated how a one tube plasmid mix, which contained multiple assembly plasmids, could be transformed into DAP auxotrophic Mu-Free Donor (MFD) E. coli cells. These transformed Mu-Free Donors would ultimately be used to conjugate with non-model organisms in which electroporation is not a viable option for transformation. When attempting to conjugate with a target non-model organism, donor cells carrying the BHR plasmids must first be created. Rather than performing an independent transformation with the donor cells for each assembly plasmid, it is more time-efficient to perform a single procedure that transforms all of the assembly plasmids into the donor cells that is followed by a selection of the recovered cells. In this demonstration, we show the how the one tube transformation can easily be applied to Mu-Free Donors for conjugation.
Electrocompetent MFU donors were electroporated with a single mix of DNA containing eight assembly plasmids, as described above and in Table 1. The antibiotics were added to the media at a 1:1000 ratio, and the media was supplemented with DAP at 6 µL DAP per ml of media. The electrocompetent MFD cells were transformed via electroporation on settings suitable for E. coli and allowed to recover for an hour at 37°C. 100 µL of the recovery was plated on each selective plate and incubated overnight. The results of this demonstration are shown in Figure 6. These transformed cells can be used in future conjugations using the Broad Host Range kit in non-model organisms.

II-Munich Meetup
Parisian Meetup
The Pasteur iGEM team hosted the Parisian iGEM Meetup in Paris (France) Saturday the 7th of July. In the morning, each iGEM team presented their project in front of a jury composed of scientist and professionals. Then, at the end of the afternoon, we had open discussions on bioethics and round tables on synthetic biology.
The Jury (Pascale Dupuis-Williams, Jonathan Keller and Deshmukh Gopaul) gave us feedbacks about our project and presentation. This meetup allowed us to train before the final presentation at Boston.

At this event, many iGEM teams from all Europe met together to exchange about their projects and listen to talks from experts in the field of synthetic biology. In total, 180 young scientists were participating.
In this Meetup, we had the chance to discuss with Will Wright, a Business Accelerator, Investment Manager and European iGEM Ambassador. We also had a chance to talk to Randy Rettberg, President and Founder of the iGEM Foundation. We presented our project to him and discuss the different aspects of the competiton.

Design Details
Enhance the degradation efficiency & detect PCBs
1. Switch on the degradation pathway
The system is awakened by PCBs.
We add bphR1 upstream the pathway and bphR2 downstream. bphR2 could sense the presence of PCBs and bphR1 could sense HOPDA, the third step product. These two regulators could switch on the degradation pathway.
In the absence of PCBs, small amounts of BphR2 protein bind to the bphR2 operator to re press bphR2 transcription (auto-repression). Under this condition, the levels of transcription of bph genes are very low. In the presence of PCBs, the BphR2 protein binds to the operators of bphR1 and bphA1A2A3A4BC and activates their transcription; thus high levels of HOPDA (the ring meta-cleavage compound) are produced from PCBs. In the presence of HOPDA, the transcription of bphR1 is further promoted, and its product BphR1 activates the transcription of bphR1 itself and downstream pathway [1,2].
2. Solve the bottleneck in PCBs degradation pathway
Our idea: Add a spur track to solve the bottleneck of the pump.
BphC (2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase), the third enzyme of the bph pathway, is of particular significance because it is incapable o f catalyzing the ring cleavage step and is subject to various types of inhabitation, as well as suicide inactivation. According to the recent research, ortho-chlorinated PCB metabolites (DHBs) are potent and physiologically significant inhibitors of BphC, so we design a feedback activation pathway using small RNA to increase the BphC transcription and expression under a 2, 3-DHBP and 4-CB inducible promoter Ppcb [3]. As 2, 3-DHBP is the second metabolite in the pathway, 2, 3-DHBP at a concentration more than 0.1mM will induce the activate PpcbC and thus increase gene expression downstream. The activated threshold of P"

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.

* Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history.
Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

This reporter system could be further developed enabling the localization of proteins to specific organelles. Such a system would allow the study of organelles and other compartments in real time.
pJEJAM1 BBa_K678049
pJEJAM1 is a plasmid intended for transient transfection of mammalian cells. The expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is under the control of the strong constitutive CMV promoter, which can be seen in the figure below.
U-2 OS cells transiently transfected with pJEJAM1 expressing GFP. This plasmid provides a good expression and homogenous distribution of GFP. The white bar has a length of 20μm.

pJEJAM2 BBa_K678050
pJEJAM2 is a plasmid intended for transient transfection of mammalian cells. The expression of GFP is under the control of the strong constitutive CMV promoter (see the figure below). The peroxisomal targeting signal PTS1 is directly fused to the C-terminal of GFP, this sequence should ensure the localization of GFP to the peroxisomes of the cell. Although the microscopy shows GFP distributed in points, further analysis are necessary to confirm that GFP is in fact is targeted to the peroxisomes.
U-2 OS cells transiently transfected with pJEJAM2 expressing GFP localized to the peroxisomes. As can be seen on the picture this vector most likely localizes GFP to the peroxisomes of the cells. The white bar has a length of 30μm.
pJEJAM3 BBa_K678051
pJEJAM3 is a plasmid intended for transient transfection of mammalian cells. The expression of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), is under the control of the strong constitutive CMV promoter (see the figure below).
U-2 OS cells transiently transfected with pJEJAM4 expressing YFP. This vector provides a good expression and homogenous distribution of YFP. The white bar has a length of 40μm.

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Wetlab#Part Design#Components#LacZ_-_-_TEXT.html," for the activity of a promoter can be derived using the following equation:
(A420 gives a value for o-nitrophenol concentration; A550 gives a value for cell debris scattering (the procedure of the β-Galactosidase assay requires cells to be broken apart); 0.1 is the volume of cell lysate used in the assay, and; A600 gives the cell density before lysis).
Returning to agriColi, the further characterisation of PyeaR was essential to inform our work and to give us a clear understanding of the activity of PyeaR in a range applicable to the nitrate levels in soil. However, after several failed attempts with BBa_K216009 it was discovered that the title for this biobrick on the registry is misleading - BBa_K216009 only contains LacZ' or LacZα (depending on which nomenclature you choose to apply), rather than the full copy of LacZ. This requires the second part of lacZ, known as LacZΩ to be present on the bacterial genome for the assay to function correctly.
This is more appropriate for the technique of blue-white screening than for β-Galactosidase assays. For a start, the activity of the promoter may cause greater production of LacZα than LacZΩ, yet the activity of β-Galactosidase will be limited by the expression of LacZΩ and hence give a false limit to the activity of the promoter being assayed. Coupled with the stress of adding extra reagents such as IPTG to the mix, this results in a procedure that is not appropriate for complete characterisation of the biobrick. With this in mind, the team set out to create a new biobrick using the promoter PyeaR and a full functional copy of LacZ.
Despite our best efforts and two attempts at forming the new construct, none of our efforts were successful, and with time constraints in mind we returned to BBa_K216009 in order to get the best data we could from the materials we had. After several more attempts we finally arrived at a set of reproducible data and at this point called a halt to the lab work. The results obtained from the numerous repeats can be viewed on the β-Galactosidase assay page in this wiki.
