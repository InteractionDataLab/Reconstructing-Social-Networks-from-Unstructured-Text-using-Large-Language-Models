Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Design#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," our PC reporter can easily reach the detection limit of only 1 genome copy per tube, which is sensitive enough for real TB diagnosis (Figure 11).
Figure 11. The effect of genome copies/mL for NAD amplification on the bioluminescence intensity of PC reporter.
 
 
From single marker to multi-marker array
We have demonstrated that our Paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter system works well in bench and could be applied to the detection of MTB genomic DNA. Particularly, when combined with PCR, our PC reporter is as sensitive as to confidently detect only 1 genome copy per tube.
However, in the clinical practice, the situations are much more complicated considering the fact that strain mutation, sample difference and other environmental factors would cause misdiagnosis for single test. So we got an idea of designing a diagnosis array to extract more sequence information for our PC Reporter to test multiple sites on the target genome at one time, thus  to guarantee reliability of diagnosis.
The core and also the first step of array design is to enumerate all the dCas9 binding site (PAM site) through the entire genome of MTB and to identify MTB-specific PAM sites as markers via SSPD . After computational screening, we totally obtained 2791 MTB-specific markers. 72 sgRNA pairs was designed according to 72 markers out of 9 fragments on MTB genome (Figure 12). Then we utilized Oligo Generator to design oligos for Golden Gate Cloning in a high-throughput manner, built sgRNA Generators for cell-free transcription, and finally obtained 70 sgRNA pairs (2 pairs failed during cloning).
Figure 12. 72 target sites (MTB-specific markers) out of 9 fragments on MTB genome, screened out using SSPD.
Then we performed array-based high-throughput measurement using PC Reporter system (See Methods ). Two separated assays were carried out using MTB and a control bacteria (E. coli), respectively. By data analysis, the results were presented as heat maps below (Figure 13). We can easily discriminate the results of MTB from that of control strain. Note that among 70 successfully constructed sgRNAs, 59 exhibit a significant performance for the detection of MTB; 11, however, fail to be positive. This is consistent with our concern that some factors might disrupt the performance of individual single test of PC reporter.  Reassuringly, the array-based PC reporter detection solved this problem (Figure 13).

We meet the problem
The lopsided ratio of ions(too much Na+ and less K+) of saline soil could affect the growing of the crop[1] such as wheat and rice.
The high concentration of Na+ in sea water limits our range of drinking water.
How to solve the problem
To solve those problems ,we need to distinguish the potassium ions and the sodium ions.But because of the similarity between K+ and Na+ (radius of ion and chemical charaters), it is very difficult to distinguish them in solution. And alternatively we need to exclude or absorb sodium ions in an efficient way.We decided to use ion channel to meet both requirements simultaneously.
Why we choose ion channel
Ion channel is a protein that locals in the membrane of cell.The selectivity carried by the structure can identify different ions ,open for the particular ion and resist the others from get through the channel.And the transfering rate of channel is so high that reachs 10^8 ions per second [2], near to the diffusion rate .Alternatively the transfering process is hardly wrong.We use KcsA (https://2018.igem.org/Team:NWU-China/Kcsa_Modify) potassium ion channel ,which from the soil bacteria Streptomyces lividans that has been studied extensively in ion channel research[3].
The modify on the channel
The wild potassium channel is not enough,we need to get a channel with a more powerful function. After trying and researching ,we find a way to get a novel characteristic.
The fantistic KcsA* channel protein can absorb K+ under the high concentration of K+ and allow the Na+ get though when the"

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Experiment: Amplified Insert Assembly of MelA.
The promoter-MelA assemblies seem to be successfully assembled, so we will try to add a terminator to the constructs.
We are using 0113-0116 as the MelA parts and 0014 was used as the terminator and backbone. We adapted the 3A assembly protocol to just using digestion of the parts and then ligating them. If this doesn't work, we may have to try using PCR amplification to produce enough insert.The products were ligated using the 3A protocol with the minor adjustment of just using two parts instead of three. The ligated DNA were then transformed into E.coli and plated 150 µl on LB cam plates.
Experiment: PCR verification of NAT1 and Beta-tubulin in A. oryzae.
A Onetaq PCR was performed on the A. oryzae lysates PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, PG1, PG2, PG3 and PG4 to verify the presence of NAT1 and Beta-tubulin. Each of the lysate samples were amplified using the Seq_NAT1_in_fw/Seq_NAT1_in_bw or seqP_betatub_in_fw/seqP_betatub_in_bw primers. The resulting gels were dissapointing and the lysates declared unsuccesful End of Experiment: PCR verification of NAT1 and Beta-tubulin in A. oryzae.

Our materials
Together with our pleasure on promoting events that seed and grow knowledge about synthetic biology and the iGEM on people of many ages, we had to concern about a more practical problem: money to develop and travel to present our work! An iGEM team cannot live only from ideas after all… Due to it, part of the material we have created/provided, besides widely disseminating these concepts and our ideas, team and project, acted more directly on the seeking for sponsors and people that liked, learned and could become willing to support us financially.
Poster
The poster was posted within the university and served to publicize the team´s blog, fan page, twitter account and our crowd funding site.
Brochure
We created a brochure especially for potential sponsors, explaining the great opportunity to become a partner of our team.
Educational video: “Piece by piece: what is synthetic biology?”
We also created a video disclosing about synthetic biology, the relevance of this new area of knowledge and about iGEM, including the participation of Brazilian teams.

Background
In many countries, water is a necessity. It's used for drinking, showering, cooking, washing dishes, and doing laundry. Yet as the recent crisis in Flint, Michigan shows, its purity and safety is not guaranteed. In Flint, city officials trying to save money on water temporarily supplied the city with water from the Flint River. The water contained bacteria, so residents were advised to boil the water. However, the chlorine used to treat the bacteria reacted with other compounds in the water to produce total trihalomethanes (TTHM), which could be carcinogenic. And, as news headlines declared, the water contained dangerously high levels of lead because the water corroded the pipelines and allowed lead to seep in. City officials did not proactively treat the water to prevent corrosion. And although residents complained about the water quality, city officials maintained for several months that the water was safe to drink ( NPR ).
Lead's toxicity is a result of its similarity to minerals our bodies need such as zinc, iron, and calcium. It can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption through the skin. Through the pathways of these minerals, lead is distributed throughout the body. Lead is especially dangerous for young children and fetuses, in whom it interferes with development, resulting in symptoms ranging from speech and language problems to decreased bone and muscle growth. Other common sources of lead poisoning in children are lead-based paint, used in old houses, and contaminated soil ( KidsHealth ). In adults, lead poisoning can lead to high blood pressure and kidney problems ( EPA ). In children and adults, even a trace amount of lead can cause problems, but the maximum contamin"
Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#PlasmidConstruction_-_-_TEXT.html," promoter PAtpI has its origin in Bacillus subtilis. It is   responsible for the expression of atpA gene (ATP synthesis) during the first 30   min of the germination of B. subtilis (Sinai et al. 2015) . atpA gene is part of an operon atpI-atpB-atpE-atpF-atpH-atpA-atpG-atpD-atpC, therefore the promoter region in front of the first protein coding gene (atpI) in this operon was chosen. The region was checked for the binding of sigma factors and   transcription factors with DBTBS . No   binding factors were found with the highest significance level. In our   project we wanted to find a constitutive promoter for our ciprofloxacin   resistance casette. In the following part we put the promoter PAtpI in the   pSB1C3 backbone to make it available to other iGEM teams.
PCR
Experiment:
06/10/16: The promoter PAtpI was amplified (see PCR protocol ) from the    ciprofloxacin resistance cassette BioBrick BBa_K1930004 ) with the primers pATPI+prefix and pATPI+suffix (primer sequences can be    found here ). The    correct size of 372 bp for the PCR product was checked with DNA   electrophoresis. The PCR product was stored at 4°C.
PCR mixture:
50 μl PCR assay was performed according to the following protocol .
DNA Electrophoresis:
For detailed information on how to prepare and run agarose gel see    following protocol .
Figure 1. DNA electrophoresis with amplified PAtpI promoter     sequence 372 bp in size.
Conclusion:
The PAtpI promoter was successfully amplified with prefix and suffix    from the plasmid.
Procedure after gel validation:
PCR product was subsequently cleaned with PCR Purification Kit –    Jena Bioscience .
Restriction digestion
Experiment:
07/10/16: The PAtpI was cut with EcoRI and PstI. The backbone pSB1C3 (BBa_J04450) was digested with the same enzymes. This construct is carrying RFP reporter therefore it was used for easier screening after transformation. You could see self-ligations as red    colonies and the correct ones as white ones.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content applications_-_-_TEXT.html," the one hand, when the oxide stress in our internal environment increases, normal cells may mutate to cancer cells if the ROS value is higher than the threshold value. On the other hand, cancer cells may die because of the accumulation of ROS. So the key point is, when ROS value higher than the maximum, we can kill the cancer cell while ROS value lower than the threshold we may push normal cells to change into cancer cells. So the level of ROS is in a specific range which we can measure using chemical methods.
Think about a proper range of ROS's concentration. Is it familiar to you as we mentioned a similar problem when talking about advantages of oscillatory system as biosensors? H2O2 is a kind of ROS. The oscillation will happen only when the concentration of is H2O2 between the maximum and the minimum. By regulating our circuits to let it respond in the proper concentration range which matches the ROS range of cancer cells, we can use the oscillatory system as a biological cancer detector.
In our experiments, we found that we can regulate flow rate and some parameters of microfluidic chip such as the depth of the well, the width of the channel and the concentration of H2O2 to change the period and amplitude of the oscillation. So by changing parameters of microfluidic chip, we can get a proper concentration range of H2O2 if the oscillation works. From then on, we can extract some cancer tissue to detect the ROS concentration in the microfluidic chips or get some suspected tissue on chips and diagnose whether it contains cancer cell.
2 Periodical Killer
2.1 Drug delivery
Our circuit also has a great potential application in periodic drug delivery. It is amazing when we realize that the oscillate circuit can control the drug to release in a specific period and the concentration of the drug is related to the amplitude. It is well-known that nowadays drug-release is a very hot research field. Many efforts are focusing on how to modify or delivery drug using materials such as synthetic polymers, liposome or nano shell which can respond to differences between different intracellular environments. Our oscillatory gene circuits provide a more biofriendly way for drug release. Our future plan is to make some deep exploration in this field.
2.2 Protein Synthesis
What else, a resonance may happen among the oscillators which results in a peak synthesis of protein under some conditions. This phenomenon can be used to increase the yield of some medical proteins such as antitoxic serum and antibody[9][10].

Go to Jilin_China
This year we collaborate with Jilin_China from Jilin University.
We meet them during the CCiC meeting in China, we were then aware of their large amounts of RNA-based thermosensors to submit to the part registry. In addition, we have our experience with Golden Gate assembly. Therefore, we provide our help to construct the standardized parts: RT104 for them.
The parts is shown below, the number of the conserved sequence in the device is RT104.
We inserted an 60bp DNA fragment into the pSB1C3 plasmid. The DNA fragment contains BsaI restriction site. Golden Gate assembly will enable fast and efficient parts construction. We sent the device to them as quickly as possible and hopefully it will improve their experimental efficiency and reduce their work.
The plasmid was confirmed to be constructed as expectation by enzyme digestion (original plasmid, BsaI single digestion, and EcoRI and PstI double digestion). We sequenced it, and the sequencing results shows the positive result.
Moreover, Jilin_China also help us with the measurement of our Device A. We test the data once, however, after analyzing the data, we were then aware of several problems. For example, we suspected that both LB culture medium and psicose in the system may probably make the bacteria grow, and the osmotic pressure is not controlled. Therefore, we asked Jilin_China to re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium and test the data. The result is shown below.
Except for this cooperation, we also discussed our protocol in Golden Gate assembly and we solved many problems for each other that were encountered during the experiment. We also discuss some questions about modeling.

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practice#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," weaknesses in science communication are. Therefore we surveyed about 100 people from different intellectual and cultural backrounds in the Heidelberg pedestrian area. To determine the opinion of scientist on science communication we surveyed in addition about 300 scientists (PhD students, post docs and professors) at the BioQuant and the German Cancer Research Center. That gave us the starting point of our practical work.
Here you can find additional information and the evaluation of the public survey and the evaluation of the scientist- survey .

We also had the great opportunity to get to know the opinion of a Nobel Prize winner about science communication. This year's Nobel prize winner in Medicine, Prof. zur Hausen, kindly gave us an interview on this topic! Read the interview here

Information, Honesty and close Contact to the public
Third, and that was the most important part of the project, we wanted to practice a way of science communication based on our antecedent research and theoretical work, which would at the end lead to a close contact and a close exchange between our scientific work on the iGEM project and the public. The aim of this practical approach was to inform the public and by that prevent upcoming unsubstantional fear and scepsis and give to the public the knowledge necessary to built a substantional opinion on the upcoming field of synthetic biology. In our opinion the three bases of science communication are:
Information, Honesty and close Contact.
Thus we used different communication approaches to get a broad contact and to reach people from different intellectual and age-related backround. The general idea of our approach- and therefore the decisive point of our human practices project- is to integrate our research into science communication and not only to communicate the results- which in our opinion would cause a seperation of our work from the public. Thus we wanted to give the public an insight into our wet lab work and also make it possible for non-scientists to follow the project description and documentation of our project. In the following we will give an overview on the practical approaches we used to reach this aim.

Media Work
We had a close collaboration with one of the most well-known newspapers in Germany: The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). In addition we had close contact to the TV stations Campus-TV Heidelberg and Prometheus TV as well as good contact to the DKFZ institute press. Furthermore the radio station Ruperto Carola and the DKFZ, BioQuant and University Press-Devisions wrote articles concerning synthetic biology, our iGEM Team and the ongoing project work.

Utah_State,2014,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," what if we need to wash something off like oil and dirt? Oil and other stains are made of non-polar molecules where the electrons are spread out evenly among all the different groups of protons. This is where soap comes in. Soap is made of long molecules that have both properties, a polar end and a non-polar end. Finally, water can attach to the polar end while dirt and oil can bind to the non-polar end. This helps us wash our hands clean of grease and grime.
Now back to detergent. What makes detergent different from soap? Soap is made from natural sources, like animal and plant oils (for their non polar end) and salts like sodium (for their polar end). Detergents are made of synthetic molecules not found in plants or animals. Detergents are most often used to clean materials like clothes, parts of your house, or metal. Soap is less harsh and is used to clean our skin. Because detergent is more powerful, less of it can be used in a large volume of water.
Enzymes
Chlorophyllase
Chlorophyll is naturally degraded during normal turnover of the pigment, when leaves change colors during fall, when fruit ripens, and during triggered cell death due to extreme temperature or water  shortage. The first step in the breakdown of chlorophyll is catalyzed by the enzyme chlorophyllase.  Chlorophyll is broken down into chlorophyllide and phytol. Chlorophyll is a dark green and hydrophobic  molecule while chlorophyllide is a lighter green and hydrophilic (Arkus et. al, 2007). The chlorophyllase  enzyme obtained for our project was cloned from a species of wheat, Triticum aestivum. Chlorophyllide is  further broken down by a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions into colorless final products (Eckhardt et.  al, 2004).
Green grass stains are actually chlorophyll stains. When a grass stain occurs the friction caused from  sliding the plant over the material breaks cell membranes. This releases chlorophyll and other proteins  into the fabric. Because chlorophyll is similar in chemical structure to natural fibers like cotton and wool  it binds to the fabric making it difficult to remove with regular detergents (Rodriguez, 2003). Our project  aims to synthetically produce the enzyme chlorophyllase that will begin the degradation of chlorophyll. As  chlorophyll is degraded into chlorophyllide, it will become more water soluble."

Outreach, industry, and IP blogs for the iGEM community
When we started development of Neptune the question was raised:
How do other researchers and industries use microfluidics?
How much does the public know about microfluidics?
By answering these two questions we could tailor Neptune to be as useful as possible, by as many people as possible.
We could develop an accessible workflow.
To this end, we decided to visit several synthetic biology labs and companies to learn more about their use of microfluidics. We also participated in public outreach and education, using this as an opportunity to educate the public about synthetic biology, and to learn more about the public's view of microfluidics. Finally, we wrote several blogs on IP in synthetic biology, drawing from what we learned about the importance of accessibility in synthetic biology.
In this page we cover 3 sections to our Silver HP contributions:
We discuss our public outreach and education contributions.
We summarize our industry visits
We conclude by exploring our contribution to the iGEM community: A reference blog on IP in synthetic biology
Public and Educational Outreach
The goal of public engagement was twofold: firstly, we wanted to do our part in educating the public about synthetic biology, and about microfluidics! Secondly, we wanted to learn about what the public knew about microfluidics- are DIY microfluidics a common practice? Does the average person know what a microfluidic is? Our first outreach was the Building with Biology event at the Boston Museum of Science.
Building with Biology | 29 June 2016
In the Building with Biology event, our team participated as guest researchers, we worked alongside museum staff to present museum goers with synthetic biology activities. These activities serve to educate the people playing, and we also got to learn about what the public knew about in synthetic biology.
One such activity included solving problems using various genetic “building blocks,” each labeled with a specific function. These literal"

The content of carbon dioxide in the solution was tested continuously according to the time of the gas entering, and this was used as the data source of our mathematical modeling.
First of all.By using MATLAB to conduct the correlation analysis of the experimental data,we found that the color readings (five dimensions: B, G, R, H, S) showed a certain linear correlation with the concentration of carbon dioxide.This conclusion is consistent with the other conclusion ,which obtains its conclusion by using lambert-beer's absorption law. That is, there is a certain relationship between the substance concentration and the color reading. Secondly, using the multiple regression of statistics to carry out regression analysis on the data, the relationship between the material concentration and the color reading (five-dimensional) is obtained, and the appropriate mathematical expression (or mathematical model) between them is determined as the empirical formula or regression equation.
A mathematical model for determining color readings and carbon dioxide concentration - a linear regression equation. Firstly, a linear regression model between carbon dioxide concentration and color reading is established. The residual of the model is large and the fitting effect is not good.
Considering establishing a nonlinear quadratic regression model.Using the rstool function modeling in the MATLAB statistical toolbox, and evaluating the pros and cons of the model by residual standard deviation and residual. In the final nonlinear quadratic regression model, the residual standard deviation is small, the prediction model is very good, and the residual of the model is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with the multiple linear regression model. Therefore, the linear quadratic regression model is better than the linear regression model. The comparison of the errors of the two models shows that the nonlinear regression quadratic equation has higher precision.
In the process of project communication with each other, we learned that they had a little trouble in modeling. It may be that Northeast Forestry University-China did not fully consider the influence of external factors on the experiment, which led to some errors in the model establishment. Through our tests, we found that the lethal efficiency of their calculations was wrong. After we found the problem, we told them in time and helped them improve the model.
The Northeast Forestry University iGEM team (NEFU-China) also helped us to test the safe reliability of our model. Through this cooperation, the friendship between our two teams was strengthened and the progress of the project was promoted. Both sides regard it as a fairly successful collaboration.
Thanks to the iGEM team of Northeast Forestry University (NEFU"

I'm currently in my third year in the School of Life Science, and this is my first time to take part in the iGEM competition.  It's a precious opportunity for me to apply all the knowledge I have learned to the actual researches.  Although I didn't help in the experiments, I still made my efforts in gathering the information our team needed by studying the documents concerning our topic, as well as all the translation work.  Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball, watching movies and traveling.  We had a lot of fun working with each other this summer.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala_-_-_TEXT.html,"umen where they become adult worms [2, 8].
Figure 1. Small strongyles.
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [2]. When untreated, the death toll can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The threat of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will help avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness among farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for Detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal    samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection  of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [1,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [1].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of"

Prepare the HRP substrate solution as follows: a stock solution of ABTS can be prepared in advance by dissolving 22 mg of azino-bis(3-ethylben- zothiazole sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) (Sigma, cat. # A-1888) in 100 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0. Filter sterilize and store at 4°C. Immediately prior to the detection step, add 36 μl of 30% H2O2 to 21 ml of ABTS stock solution per plate to be analyzed.
Add 200 μl of substrate solution to each well, and incubate for 10–60 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation.
Read the plates using a microplate reader set at 405–415 nm. For each phage concentration, compare the signals obtained with and without target protein.
The protocol was later performed in micro-centrifuge tubes to reduce non specific binding of peptides to the polystyrene. All the reagent volumes were the same. Washes were increased to 1ml * 5 times.
GOLDEN GATE ASSEMBLY
GOLDEN GATE ASSEMBLY/CLONING PROTOCOL
For the Golden Gate assembly (GG) here we fused two protocols, using part of the one facilitated by NEB Golden Gate Assembly Mix, which contains BsaI and T4 DNA Ligase, and another which we had by courtesy of our advisor Nadine Bongaerts:
uL
x 40 fmol of vector and insert
1ul Buffer 10x
0.5ul Assembly mix
x dH2O (until 10ul)
-----------------------------
10 uL total
Settings
1. 37 C - 5 min
2. 37 C - 2 min
3. 16 C - 5 min
4. 50X back to 2
5. 37 C - 5 min (final digest)
6. 50 C - 10 min
7. 80 C - 10 min
Once this is done the product of the reaction can be transformed avoiding to use electroporation, since it could be ions still in the mix
Over-expression of bpul
In this protocol volumes and other quantities used are proportional. By applying simple mathematical operations of multiplication or division one can adjust the protocol based on his/her needs.

Wonderful woman. Very free-spirited. We're all very fond of her. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here —sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there—and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold —wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.
They won't hurt us, Donny. These men are cowards. Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe. Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was… He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern California from Redondo to Calabassos. And he was an avid bowler. And a good friend. He died—he died as so many of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom you took him, Lord. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc.

Therefore, in the spirit of helping others, we gave them a lot of advice in presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, their use of genetic engineering techniques are not skilled, so we helped them in the field we familiar such as selecting the clone and assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, we helped them about the adaption between mediawiki platforms with html. We pointed an important mistake for them, which made them avoid adding a wrong part and told us many things about the part shipping. They completed the part submission form with our assistance. We helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told them how to fill in the Registry.
See their special thanks to us
The collaboration with SZU
What SZU-iGEM have done this year was to create an anti-bladder-cancer-cell system which is regulated by an AND GATE. What we had promoted was to put the effector gene Renilla Luciferase to replace Firefly Luciferase in the third plasmid which has the strong constitutive promoter SV40. The remould was supposed to increase the security of the AND GATE and the expression degree of the system, and together the influence of the orthogonal system to the project system.
1. Security testing
After transforming the three plasmids system into T24 cells for many times, the result of expression examination showed the system had a nice security degree. Compared to the two plasmid system in Hela cervical cancer cells, the expression of the three plasmid system in the control group without Ack has the same level. While the expression of the three plasmid system is expected to improve the expression of the project system when the Ask exists, the examination showed that our remould has no effect on the security of the system.
2. Effect testing
2.1. Examining by Rlu
Comparing with the expression of the group without Ack, adding Ack has reached more than 7 times. It shows that the effect of orthogonal system on the whole system has been improved. In addition, the average expression of adding Ack experimental group has reached 790.5, and in others successful transfection experiments, the highest number of test results have reached 1000. All the data indicated that expression amount of the system has enhanced a lot after the remould.

Riboregulator Feature Page
In this feature page, several teams that have worked with riboregulators are highlighted. More outstanding riboregulators are also identified according to the these criteria: availability from Part Registry, usage frequency, and availability of characterization information of the riboregulator system. Finally, abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that used or planned to use riboregulators are included; links are provided to each team’s riboregulator page for more information. This feature page can help users to quickly scan through the available riboregulators, and determine whether the riboregulator system is feasible for the project in mind by comparing previous projects that have used the riboregulator system.
Introduction to riboregulators
Figure 1.
Artificial riboregulator system used to control post-transcriptional regulation
Regulatory RNAs are small RNA that regulates biological processes such as transcription or translation. The use of regulatory RNAs has been a great interest in the field of synthetic biology because it provides an additional level of regulation for biological circuits and systems. Regulatory RNAs have also used by many iGEM teams. We have identified 7 teams that have used cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) riboregulator system and more teams that have used riboswitches. For example, UC Berkeley 2005, UC Berkeley 2006 and Caltech 2007 contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry.
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by the UC Berkeley iGEM 2005 team. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system ,crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence 5’ of the"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices#Ethics#SL Conference_-_-_TEXT.html," the field or are part of some organization that is related to the topic of discussion. They also invite a general academic audience, that listens to the discussions, and depending on the type of conference being held, can also participate by either asking questions or advocating their perspectives and perceptions. Our University of Calgary iGEM team members have attended some conferences in Second Life ™ and they have found these conferences to be very interesting, knowledgeable and communication friendly.
A primary consideration for this undertaking is: ""Why choose a Second Life ™ conference over a survey?"" Simply put, the conference would be a novel exploration of ethics. In the past, many iGEM teams have conducted surveys or self administered questionnaires during their exploration, and the results from these initiatives were generally similar in some way or the other. As well, there was little variation in the questions that were asked and the responses that were received. Many of these surveys explored how much the public knows about synthetic biology, and underlying perceptions of the field.
We recognize that data gathered from past surveys have indicated that generally, a greater understanding of synthetic biology is necessary- especially to hold meaningful discourse on the future and concerns regarding this field. To remedy potential gaps in knowledge, we have set up multiple educational initiatives that are outlined in the Outreach and Second Life sections of this wiki. Beyond that, however, we seek to ask a further question: Regardless of perceived knowledge, how can one have meaningful discourse between individuals, whether or not they have scientific backgrounds?
Meaningful discourse, that is, the sharing of concerns and viewpoints, allow scientific fields to maintain social relevancy by directly addressing issues brought up by individuals from multiple backgrounds. Although the general public may not always have a complete understanding of a scientific undertaking, their opinions are still valid and must be addressed. In order to obtain a solid grasp on these issues, tools such as conferences and debates provide a support on which such discourse can be built.
As well, there are always limitations to these surveys and questionnaires, such as the complexity of the questions that are being asked, partly because of the large range of knowledge about synthetic biology and molecular biology.  Surveys pose restricted exploration of ethical issues. While, these issues usually entail a variety of opinions and view points, surveys can restrict thinking and exploration of different perspectives on ethical issues, due to the limiting structure of the questions that are asked. Conferences overcome this situation, as they are built in the 'present', that is, the flow and direction of topics can be easily modified to suit the audience present- and the platform itself does not generally require structured responses to express personal views. These are"

Additionally, if any accidental emergency were to happen, all members of the team knew where safety equipments such as fire extinguishers, emergency shut off valves, eye wash station, etc., were located and how to use them. Furthermore, to prevent confusion, all laboratory equipment, such as test tubes, and bottles, had labels with proper identification to ensure that accidental usage of the reagents and other media was prevented.
    3. Operational safety:
    When the experiments are operated in Clean Benches, we light the alcohol lamp in the first place, and then disinfect gloves with alcohol, preventing hands from burning. Gloves are replaced and hands are washed immediately after using ethidium bromide or any of the harmful solutions. There are taped off, designated areas for working with ethidium bromide. These areas are cleaned before and after work and are the only areas the solution may be touched.
Material:
-Bacteria
    We will use E.coli MC1061, Lactococcus lactis NZ3900, Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and its mutant strain L. lactis WH101. No viruses will be used. Our chassis organism is Lactococcus lactis. The strains (Lactococcus lactics NZ3900 and NZ9000) involved in this experiment do not produce any toxic substances or carry resistance marker genes. Lactococcus lactis do not multiply in the form of spores. All the genetic recombination operations are based on homologous gene recombination, therefore they are relatively safe. Even if they accidentally escape the lab, they will not cause large-scale proliferation or have adverse effects on the surrounding environment.

As one of the important apoptosis-mediated factors, ROS could be propose under a variety of                         stress, such as cold induction, metal ion induction, high pressure induction. However,                         considering the feasibility, time period, operational difficulty, and the cause of ROS                         accumulation, we finally accumulated ROS through overexpressing yeast endogenous genes.
It's been established that overexpress some genes can accumulate ROS in yeast cells previously,                         in hence we selected two genes, yno1 (encodes a genuine NADPH oxidase, which is located                         in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and produces superoxide in a NADPH-dependent fashion) [6] . and ndi1 (codes for the internal mitochondrial ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which                         transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in the electron transport chain) [7] to achieve our goal of ROS accumulation.
Improve the tolerance of ROS
Fig. 2 knock out gene yca1 through homologous reorganization.
Higher ROS content comes higher mortality rate. In order to prevent the yeast from dying for                             oxidation, simultaneously, maintain a high level of ROS accumulation in vivo, we need to knock                             out the gene yca1, which encodes synthesis of metacaspase, a homologue of the mammalian                             caspase, and is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of yeast apoptosis, for avoiding                             the death induced by high concentration ROS.

Up to now, we complete the construction of a yeast stain that can accumulate ROS endogenous                             alive.

When we have already placed the yeast cells in an oxidative state, next step is to control the                         accumulation of ROS. So we set up the feedback part.
We supposed that the reason of ROS accumulation in our project is the overexpression of related                         genes. If so, the ROS accumulation can be reduced through repressing gene expression. There are                         two common global-repressors to inhibit the gene expression, RNAi and dCas9 technology. We                         compared two technologies and asked our advisor, Dr. Ying Wang for advice. She suggested that                         we chose dCas9 for it got a higher success rate. We followed her advice and continued other                         designs.
After choosing the inhibition method, we started to find a ROS sensor with low sensitivity to                         ROS, since we hoped"

Creating and placing these attention-grabbing stickers in UVA bathrooms was ideal for generating a captive and curious audience. We hope that this humorous image of Jefferson will encourage readers to our story, thereby informing the public in a creative way.
Mid-Atlantic Meet-Up
On July 29th, we hosted the Mid-Atlantic mini jamboree in which five other teams attended. The teams that joined us are William and Mary, University of Delaware, University of North Carolina at Asheville, University of Maryland, and Georgia State University . The morning was filled with presentations from each team and constructive breakout sessions. The most rewarding part of this session was the dialogue established. Individuals from all different teams were working with one another cooperatively, reflecting that we are all part of the same iGEM community.
Instead of concluding after the final team presented, however, we wanted to provide some exposure to what one can do with iGEM beyond the jamboree. To do so, we brought in Shaun Moshasha, an alumnus of Virginia iGEM 2014, and other professional who, like Shaun, work in DIY labs. Shaun spoke about what iGEM has meant for him and his career, and he described how much he has enjoyed working in his DIY lab, called Open Bio Labs. Following his talk, we had breakout discussions with the eight other lab professionals Shaun had brought with him to gain a better understanding of what kind of entrepreneurial opportunities arise from iGEM. Ultimately, this jamboree was a great way to learn more about the iGEM community, to become friends with team members from other universities, and to get exposure to the innovative opportunities that iGEM presents for our futures.

We took images along three points on the fiber and used ImageJ to measure the diameter of the fiber at each point. We then averaged the measurements and found the fiber's radius to be 13.9 +/- 0.3 um.
Fiber fluorescence
We used an EVOS FL digital microscope to take microscopic images of our fibers. Natural silk showed some background fluorescence, but the co-spun fiber with GFP co-spinning module had considerably stronger fluorescence, as determined by visual assessment. Unfortunately, we were unable to quantify the difference in fluorescence.
Fluorescence microscopy of the same fiber. 470 nm wavelength excitation light was used at 100% intensity in the EVOS FL digital microscope.
For comparison, this is fluorescence microscopy of native Bombyx mori silk. 470 nm wavelength excitation light was used at 100% intensity in the EVOS FL digital microscope.
Fiber Strength
Stress Strain curve for the co-spun silk with GFP co-spinning module.
Our fiber had a Young's modulus of 5.39 GPa. The Young's modulus is a measure of the fiber's elasticity. The fiber's ultimate strength, or stress at which failure occurs, was 103.4 +/- 6.6 MPa. The toughness of the fiber, which is the total energy that the fiber absorbed before breaking, was 1.47 megaJoules. The maximum strain, or deformation, that the fiber tolerated before breaking was 2.2% of the original unstressed length (10mm).
Overall, this fiber that we co-spun was extremely stiff and brittle and did not match the properties of natural silk. However, this could be largely attributed to the fact that we did not stretch the fiber after spinning, which is known to be a crucial process that confers silk with much of its natural strength and elasticity.[3] It has been determined in the literature that silk reconstituted from silk dopes and stretched to several times its length can have properties matching or even exceeding those of natural silk fibers.[6] Stretching is known to cause further formation of beta sheet crystals in the fiber, as well as align them in the same axis which allows them to form more hydrogen bonds with each other, thereby increasing the fiber's overall strength.[6] We still need to stretch our co-spun silk after spinning in order to determine if the GFP co-spinning module actually interferes with the structure and strength of the reconstituted silk.

bOing! Festival
This event was spaced out over the campus of the University of Kent. We were able to set up our own booth of which we named “Science Island”. Our booth included five different stations (Mother Nature, Chemistry Lab, DNA Kitchen, The Human Body and Light Source) that the children could explore. These booths were created to either help introduce or expand the knowledge of science to the children and their parents.
Mother Nature
Here, we introduced the definitions of pH range, acidic, neutral and alkaline. To do this, we allowed the children to use sterilised pipettes to ‘suck’ up household products such as cola and baking powder. During this, we were able to teach them how to prevent cross contamination by giving them new pipettes for different products and explaining how it would have an effect on the final product if the same pipette was used. The products were then placed in to individual sterilised test tubes where the children then used pH test strips to determine whether the product was acidic, neutral or alkaline. After the conduction of these pH tests we discussed the importance of pH in nature and in relation to balanced ecosystems and the environment, examples included: The maintenance of water pH for the survival of fish and how changes in the pH can cause disease.
The Chemistry Lab
On this station, our team members demonstrated experiments with dry ice, soap and other household materials, while talking to the children about sublimation, the different states of water and the behaviour of gases.
The DNA Kitchen
Our kitchen allowed us to explain to the children what DNA was and what it is involved in, such as genes. To do this, we helped them to construct a DNA double helix out of candy to then explain how our DNA carries information, where the information comes from and how it makes us unique. We also used this opportunity to explain the concept of genetic manipulation and mutations to the older children and their parents. This was carried out in relation to our project, which then led onto us asking the older children and parents to participate in our surveys so that we could get feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of Genetically Modified Organisms, how to improve our project and to gain a better understanding of the awareness, media impact"

Israel-Technion, Mini Jamboree
On September 9th, We were invited along with the other Israeli iGEM teams to the Technion - Mini Jamboree Event.
Here, each team presented their project, and a panel of judges asked questions and gave tips for improvement and better preparation for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Collaboration and panels
Round table
Mentors and advisors are one of the most valuable resources a young researcher/entrepreneur should tap into. The idea of launching a project should no longer be a scary or daunting experience, riddled with unknowns. It should be a collaborative experience accumulating the knowledge of the hundreds of experts who have already built successful endeavors, and can help you move faster and avoid known pitfalls based on their years of experience.
Therefore, from the very beginning we engaged experts who have a deep understanding of cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a real need and it is designed properly to potentially address it in the future.              On May we organized a roundtable discussion with the leading researchers from the fields of cancer diagnostics and therapy, genetics and synthetic biology.
We managed to bring together the following experts:
Prof. Roni Apte ,  Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics expert
Prof. Etta Livneh , Immunology and Genetics expert
Dr. Ayelet David , Cancer, Nano-medicine, Polymers, Pharmacology expert
Dr. Noam Levaot ,Physiology, Cell and Synthetic Biology expert

Exemple of sequences of base units.
From the modeling side, we calculated analytically the steady state of the integrase and terminator modules, and it  appears that the deterministic model gives a binary steady state corresponding to an XOR gate. This is what we expected, it confirms that deterministic model in our case is interesting for the study of dynamics of the whole system, and not for steady state calculations. So we are now moving to dynamic studies.

Week 4: Improving plasmid design, Modularization of the whole model
Wednesday, June 18th
We improved a little bit the plasmid design, determined which parts will be taken from the iGEM registry, and which parts we have to synthesize.
Second draft of plasmids. The repressors production genes have been moved to the sensor plasmid in order to distribute more evenly the number of kb.
Sensor plasmids will be approx. 9.3kb long, and logic plasmids will be approx. 5,2kb long.
From the modeling side, the whole model has been modularized and we have calculated and simulated steady state for the quorum sensing module.

Modularization of the system
Sunday, June 15th
The idea of our system is to associate a quorum sensing part, which should be able to react to a certain concentration of input, with a integrase-base logic part, which should be able to derive a computation given the transformed inputs.
From a modeling point of view, it seemed obvious that we had to consider these two entities separately. That is why we chose to have a modularized approach, where we regrouped, on one hand, the equations corresponding to quorum sensing and, on the other hand, the ones corresponding to the integrase logic phenomena.
As the integrase module is not that well known, we further decomposed it into two successive parts. The first one only models the path integrases go through in order to bind to DNA. The second one models the switch behavior of the integr"

Having witnessed the depressing situation, rather than being a spectator passing by with nothing to do, we devise this project on the basis of what we have gained and our imagination to appeal to more citizens to protect the environment as it is time that we should do something to control the desertification.
In April 18th, 2017, we launch an environmental education at Wencheng Elementary School in Yuzhong County, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province. We have illustrated the harm caused by desertification. In addition, we have tutored them in many little tips on how to protect the environment. Furthermore, we led them to pick up many fallen leaves on the campus, utilizing which to blueprint their own spring with their imagination.
Pupils were absorbed in creative work with fallen leaves.

We cannot stop human beings from cutting down trees, but we can save every piece of paper.
We cannot stop human beings from hunting for rare animals, but we can refuse to purchase ivory and to wear marten coats.
We cannot stop human beings from littering and discarding batteries, but we can sort wastes around us, make full use of them and even make them profitable again.
We cannot stop human beings from wasting water resources, but we can turn off faucets whenever we have washed our hands.
We cannot stop all uncivilized behaviors, but we can make a change from who are close to us, from where we live, meanwhile sparing no effort in assisting others to establish awareness to protect the environment, thus making some contributions to protecting our planet.
Environmental protection could be simply defined as “working at present, reaping for centuries.”
We hope that all efforts we have made could make the world a better place.

The 2017 Research Team
iGEM Guelph is a newly formed team, with 2017 being our first year competing. This year our goal was to establish the club and learn how the iGEM competition works so that we may be competitive in years to come. This year we made strong new friendships and learned a lot about what we are capable of and where we need to improve for next year. We look forward to competing in the years to come and experiencing all of what iGEM has to offer.
The University of Guelph was founded in 1964 and specializes in Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine and Biology. Its main campus is located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
Co-President Lab: Danielle Rose
Danielle is in third year Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Guelph. Her main responsibilities this year included organizing laboratory activities, coordinating team activities, purchasing, and coordinating with advisers. She is also in charge of coding the wiki so finds talking in the third person about herself very odd. This year she enjoyed spending a great deal of time in the lab conducting experiments, helping with troubleshooting and designing primers. Danielle also helped with contacting potential sponsors and raising awareness of iGEM within the University of Guelph. She also helped with the administrative aspect of the team such as ensuring safety forms were filled out and obtaining key card access. Taking off her biology hat and pretending to be an engineer for a day she designed and built a battery powered tube rotator for the team for use in the 37 Degree incubator during transformations.
Danielle is pretty obsessed with microbes, especially extremophiles and is happy to talk your ear off about all the cool things microbes can do. After completing her undergraduate Danielle intends on becoming an entrepreneur and starting a biotech company. In her free time she enjoys reading, cooking, and a multitude of crafty endeavors (drawing, jewelry making, etc.).

Data generation
Wiki Scraping
We wrote a pipeline to collect and print the data for every team properly. Thus proper script exiting and output file specification via the command line were easier to implement. The track, which was missing until now was included in the scraping process.
Furthermore several bugs were fixed. We had encountered problems regarding whitespaces, espacially the dublication of teams when their name contains a blank space. We also took care of the proper construction of all the spider objects.
Data conversion to R

A first shiny app that can display the numerical data in a scatterplot was created. Besides shiny it also uses the RCharts package for more aesthetic graphs.
Shiny concepts
Different concepts for shiny files
Since there are two different concepts of how to implement the page surrounding a shiny app, we tried out both.
See week 20 for the final solution we chose for building our apps.
R builder functions for html
Files needed:
./server.R
./ui.R
This solution turned out to be very complicated due to the combination of directly accessible html tags, those which need the tags() function and styling rules within the ui.R. Thus using the other concept seems more intuitive.
Separated html code
File needed:
./server.R
./www/index.html
Here the app is built directly in html and css syntax as any other basic homepage. This on the other hand became complicated, when integrating the server output in the app.

Assuming that transcription for all genes occurs at this speed, and based on the supposition that 1 nM equals one molecule per cell in E. coli ( Bionumbers ), we propose the following equation to estimate the maximum transcription rate for every transcriptional unit in the model:
Maximum transcription rate = Average transcription speed (2890.8 nt/min)*Number of copies of the plasmid
The size of a transcriptional unit takes into account the CDS plus 3' and 5' untranslated regions.
Translation Rates
A similar process was followed to calculate the maximum translation rates for all the proteins in our model. Using an average translation rate of 19 aa/s, or 1140 aa/min [ Bremer and Dennis, (1996) in Neidhardt, et al. ], and assuming that all translation in our system works at the same speed, the maximum translation rate can be written as:
Maximum translation rate = Average translation rate (1400 aa/min⁡〖)/〗 [Protein size (aa)]*RBS strenght(Assumed as 1 due to lack of data)
mRNA and Protein degradation rates
The degradation rates for all mRNAs were obtained based on the half-lives (in minutes) and the cell division rates, and expressed as the sum of the actual degradation rate ln(2)/half life and the dilution rate (Ln(2)/cell duplication time, 30 minutes). When the half-lives of the mRNAs used in our system were not available in the literature, we assumed them to be the average half-life of mRNA in E. coli, 6.8 minutes, Selinger, GW, et al. (2003) .
According to Varshavsky, (1997) and Tobias et al., (1991) (8), when the N-terminal aminoacid of a protein in E. coli is K, R, L, F, Y or W, the half-life of that protein will be as short as 2 minutes; otherwise, it will be greater than 10 hours. Since none of the proteins in our system begins with any of the aminoacids listed above, and because the"

Modeling for Toulouse 2016
In collaboration with the iGEM team Toulouse , we conceived a model of plasmid loss for the Toulouse team.
Data recovery Bordeaux 2016
In order to help the iGEM team Bordeaux , we extract data from the paper « Dynamics of plasmid transfer on surfaces » [1] and organize those data about their experiments on plasmids transfer. Thanks to this, the iGEM team Bordeaux can compare those results to their own computationnal results.
Here is a summary of this article.

BGU_Israel,2013,Team:BGU Israel#Bricks_-_-_TEXT.html," used to replace the native promoter and regulatory sequences upstream of the CDS of the TyrS gene that encodes for the enzyme Tyrosine Synthetase. The native promoter is replaced with an IPTG/Arabinose induced promoter (BBa_k354000) and BBa_b0034 RBS. In addition, it has a kanamycin resistance gene (KanR) to aid in selection of the desired transformants.
Creating the world’s first UAA logic AND gate
The sixth amino acid in the TyrS sequence was replaced with an amber stop codon (TAG). The TAG stop codon is used for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into the protein sequence. This system gives us better control of the translation process and prevents expression of TyrS when the unnatural amino acid is not present in the medium.
The fail proof aspect of this system is achieved by creating a logic AND gate which is depended on IPTG/Arabinose AND UAA in order to synthesize an active TyrS protein.
The part was characterized through sequencing and restriction digest with BamHI and XbaI.
Improving existing parts
Purifying a specific protein from the cell and analyzing its expression requires precise and often expensive tools and ability. Attaching a certain tag to the protein usually simplifies this process and makes it much easier. However, some tags usually have an effect on the function and activity of the protein such as shorting its half life or disrupting its function.
BBa_K1223007 -  cI translational unit with HisTag
This part is an improvement of the existing BBa_K327018 LVA tagged cI repressor protein. We added a his tag instead of the LVA tag in order to offer a convenient way to study the protein without damaging it. The his tag is located at its C-terminal, therefore having no effect on its function [1]. The part was characterized through comassie staining and western blotting with His probe anti-histag antibody.

“……over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone....... all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood!” said Exodus 7 Hebrew. Algal blooms have existed since long time ago and were recorded in books including the Holy Bible.
Algal bloom in aquatic ecosystems could be caused by several reasons like eutrophication, high temperature, strong light and so on. Considering rapid developments in industry and agriculture, and dramatic climate change within decades, algal bloom has become widespread among water areas from the Five Great Lakes in North America to small fishing ponds in East Europe. Treating algal bloom is often time-consuming and costly, for example, that the Japanese government had paid 30 years and 18.5 billion dollars eliminating annual burst of cyanobacteria in Lake Biwa.
The most remarkable characteristic of algal bloom is its colossal biomass. They can not only shade submerged vegetation, but also deplete oxygen and cause anoxia, thus being harmful to the organisms living in the water fields. Although several existing methods have been implemented to counteract algal bloom, these methods have noticeable weaknesses or expensive for cost. Furthermore, many species of cyanobacteria secret toxins into water, tens of them are more toxic than cardio-toxin. In 1996, a water contaminated affair of microcystin (a kind of cyanobacteria toxin) in Brazil claimed 76 human lives in total.
Project
This year, in order to improve the method of annihilating algal bloom, Peking iGEM engineered E.coli to kill the cyanobacteria and degrade the toxins existing in the aquatic ecosystem.
First, we innovatively introduced a bactericidal enzyme, lysozyme to annihilate the algal bloom. Besides, we found that the killing efficiency would be enhanced if the average distances between E.coli and cyanobacteria were reduced. Therefore, we introduced two improvement methods, Binding and Gas vesicle,"

FimH sfGFP FimH Fusion
Proteins Fim Operon back to top
Basic Parts
Most of our basic parts are derived from the terminal protein in pili structures FimH. FimH is expressed as a 300 amino acid protein which is then processed by the removal of a signal peptide, Figure 1. The mature form of the protein (279 amino acids) consists of two domains: the mannose binding domain and the pilin domain (Le Tong et al 2010). The literature shows that FimH can be successfully modified by introducing heterologous protein segments at positions 225 and 258 of the mature protein (Pallesen et al 1995, Shembri et al 1999). However these two amino acids are in the pilin binding domain which may present difficulties when attempting to introduce large modifications. Harvard iGEM 2015 also introduced modifications at position 1 of the mature FimH protein. We decided to construct a suite of FimH modified sequences to not only test a variety of metal binding proteins but also determine, via GFP expression, which position 1 (22), 225 or 258 would be best.
Figure 1: This arrow represents the linear amino acid sequence of the protein FimH. As shown, it can be split into its three essential components. The signal peptide guides the protein to the cell surface membrane and is cleaved upon export. The mannose binding domain is the seat of the bacteria's pathogenicity, its ability to bind to glycosylated cell surface proteins in mammals. The pilin binding domain interacts allosterically with the mannose binding domain and other fim proteins during binding and pilus biogenesis.
FimH sfGFP
To easily monitor expression we chose to modify FimH by inserting the super folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) (Pedelacq et al 2005). The sfGFP was inserted in three different places in the FimH protein to act as a reporter on the level of expression of the protein and thus giving an indication of its efficiency. The three"

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,") FeSO4 (2.0mM). These concentrations approximate the concentrations reported by Thorell et al. (2003). Cells were incubated overnight at 37O C in a shaking incubator. The next day, each 5mL culture was pelleted and resuspended in 0.4mL of 10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0. The resuspended pellets were then transferred to plastic cuvettes as shown below in Fig.8). Chlorite (0.1M) was then added for a final concentration of 0.5M.
Results and Discussion:
Cultures expressing Cld(SP-) were noticeably reddish brown in colour whereas those derived from Cld(SP+) showed the same colour of  conventional E coli. This suggests that heme-containing Cld(SP-) is being produced whereas heme-containing Cld(SP+) is not being produced. When chlorite was added to the resuspended cell pellets, the CLD(SP-) samples began to bubble almost instantaneously. In contrast, no bubbling was observed in the Cld(SP+) samples. The failure of  Cld(SP+) to produce O2 is not clear. It might have resulted from the ala to ser mutation revealed from the gene sequence or alternatively the failure of the non-native MalE signal peptide.

Making a Collagen Mimetic
Human Collagen
Human collagen is a complex protein to produce recombinantly. The tight left-handed helix structure is facilitated by numerous hydroxyproline residues1 which must be produced by post-translational modification by an enzyme with complex quaternary structure2 with the function only demonstrated natively in a single relatively common yeast strain, Ogataea polymorpha.3 The traditional collagen motif is Gly-X-Y, with X often representing proline and Y hydroxyproline; these relative locations in the helix are essential for their contributions to its formation.4 Even working in H. polymorpha, which in addition to not being cultured in most labs has finicky codon preferences,5 there are a number of problems.
Collagen genes themselves are ill-suited to genetic manipulation, with glycine and proline codons (GGN and CCN respectively) making up such a large proportion of the sequence. The high GC content and potential self complementarity that result from high glycine and proline content cause additional concerns on top of general repetitive sequence issues. Even after transformation and successful translation, human collagen undergoes post-translational glycosylation and cleavage before forming a number of different heterotrimers,1 with cross links depending on specific positioning of multiple different post-translationally modified amino acids.6 All this is not to say that recombinant synthesis of human collagen is impossible; it has in fact been done. However, replicating that work would have been quite difficult in the"

Dynamic Model
Purpose
For our purposes, the dynamic model seeks to provide an explanation for the gene expression observed in the microarray experiment.    However, for the scientific community in general, a dynamic model would be enable phenotype prediction over time under varying     environmental conditions. Such a model would also be able to predict phenotypes for knock-out mutant strains. Probabilistic     integrative modeling (PROM) uses gene expression data across a wide variety of environmental conditions to quantify the link     between the transcriptional-regulatory network and the stoichiometric metabolite-reaction matrix. In other words, PROM modulates     the reaction fluxes by looking at the likelihood a given reaction is active given the current state of gene expression. This method    has been shown to accurately predict growth phenotypes in knock-out strains of E. coli and M. tuberculosis. Unfortunately,    PROM does not consider the current environmental cues. It considers a multitude of prior environmental cues through the gene expression     data. As such, it is really only useful for predicting fluxes in knock-out strains. Despite this limitation, it is still a great     starting point for building a dynamic model as it considers both the transcriptional-regulatory network and a constraint-based     stoichiometric model. It does not rely on the sparse kinetic parameters used in ODE models.
Enter integrative dynamic flux balance analysis (idFBA); it combines the signaling, transcriptional-regulatory, and metabolic networks.
Results
The flowchart below shows the progress of the feasibility study. We were able to build a suitable metabolic model, and to find the information    necesssary for implementing the transcriptional-regulatory network using PROM. We were even able to obtain some idFBA scripts from an author of    the article who happened to be a supervisor to the University of Virginia iGEM team. Unfortunately, the singalling network was a mystery. Sure,     Groningen studies this network in B. subtilis quite extensively, but there still are too many gaps to be able to predict the Wetwork team's    microarray data from their gas chromatography data.
This initiative did not progress past the feasibility study.

Synthetic Biology Trainee
This year, members of the 2013 iGEM team did molecular biology and genetic engineering training for new members of iGEM 2014 during two weeks. The goal was not only to teach techniques of genetic engineering but also make synthetic biology and explores how it is in the iGEM competition. Utilizing the idea of integrating synthetic biology and explain this new science, during lessons, examples of other teams projects were presented to show how the experimental part was made and for what purpose. But wasn’t a common training class…other students, technicians ad professors took part on that making the UFAM-Brazil and the iGEM known in the Genetics department, that was a hack of experience!
Short Term Course
We did give some lectures that preceded the short term course in order to make the new members more familiar with the subject, and then, be able to interpret results and try to biologically explain their doubts during the experimental part. The classes were based on the main stages of the project design by exploring some techniques such as bacterial transformation, plasmidial expression, enzymatic digestion, purification, vectors ligation, PCR, preparation of solutions and culture media, electrophoretic profile analysis and preparation of competent cells.
Community integration
We also conducted, as part of human practice, the integration of our team with the school community. Some members of our team traveled to a country town called Iranduba
,  where most of the citizens are riverside communities, the ones who more directly lead with contaminated waters. We gave presentations about our project MercuryBacter, and we could explain about the mercury contamination problems and also the benefits of our project. Consequently, we discussed about basic concepts facing synthetic biology area as well as synthetic biology innovations in other to arouse interest in the students in an integrated, intuitive and playful way.

The gel below shows the digest confirmation. To investigate the actual desulfurisation capability of our initial Rhodococcus source culture for the dsz operon, a desulfurization assay was prepared by innoculating various treatments of the M9 media prepared previously. Also, a conditioning agent composed of 100ml of 95% ethanol, 50ml glycerol, 30ml of 12M HCl (aq) and 70g of NaCl(s) was prepared. The assay relies on the turbidity of a sample containing sulphate ions which are precipitated (hence the turbidometric nature of the assay) upon adding BaCl2(s). Elsewhere, B0034 was constructed with dszC and of the colonies that grew on the plate of the transformed products, colony PCRs were performed and the gel image gave an indication of it being successful. However, further analysis through sequencing showed that the constructions were not successful, and so the constructions were restarted.</p>
Denitrogenation
The sequencing for the CarAc/B0034 construct came back with only CarAc and no evidence of a B0034 site preceding it. The confirmation PCR that was run last week using the B0034 forward primer seemed to indicate that it was inserted, however since B0034 is only 12 base pairs the primer may not have been specific enough. The construction on this part was restarted this week. CarAa colony PCR on last week's transformation showed two positive colonies, however upon culturing, miniprepping, and digesting these colonies the plasmid appeared to be too large (3000 base pairs as opposed to the expected 2000). This may be due to a problem of a mislabeled plasmid tube that has been experienced by other team members, causing the gene to be inserted into PSB1AC3 rather than PSB1C3. To test this, a streak plate was made from these colonies and grown on an ampicillin resistant plate. Mutagenized CarAd was successfully transformed into top 10 E. coli cells, cultured, and miniprepped. The miniprep product was digested with NotI to test whether the NotI site was successfully removed. These results were good, as the plasmid ran at 2000 base pairs and the insert at just"

Membrane
When manipulating genetically engineered organisms, it is crucial to guarantee the confinement of these organisms. In our case, we want genetically modified bacteria to stay at the interface between the prosthesis and the external organic medium. At the same time, one of the main issues our project wants to tackle is the conduction of the neuron influx to the prosthesis. The answer to these questions came as a double solution: confinement of the bacteria by conductive nanoporous membranes. The membrane’s nanoporosity allows substances produced by our modified biofilm to pass through the membrane, but the bacteria remain confined. We tested the conductivity and biocompatibility of two types of membranes.
Figure 1: Bacteria + Conductive Nanoporous Membrane = Confined Bacteria
Membrane
Gold-coated membranes
Sterlitech Polycarbonate Gold-Coated Membrane Filters represented one of the types of membranes we tested. The pores have a diameter of 0.4 micrometer, which is small enough to confine Escherichia coli bacteria, which diameter and size are respectively about 1 micrometer and 2 micrometers. These membranes were relatively easy to manipulate with a forceps because of their high flexibility.

The other membranes were Sterlitech Alumina Oxide Membrane Filters with 0.2-micrometer pores. Their higher rigidity compared to the gold-coated membranes led to several membranes being broken while manipulating them with a forceps.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Last year, 115 oral presentation and 75 posters have taken place in our congress. The topics and scientific background of these projects are also the mainstream and promising features which may pose a great role in the future. For instance, “CRISPR/Cas9 system”; its utilities, possible applications, especially on tuberculosis infection, “tissue engineering” and its novel approaches, the-state-of-art method for “treating colon cancer by using synthetic gut flora” are a few studies presented in the previous year’s scientific program. Just by reading these topics, the potential impact and attribution of our congress to the scientific society can be understood further. However, there is still a certain need of support to ease the procedure of converting these studies conducted by students into scientific articles. This is extremely paramount as they can be trained to become the future’s qualified, skillful and experienced scientists and experts. The encouragement to study and undergo such researches will also be a boost if this support is conducted.
Another team we collaborated was METU-Turkey. We held a dinner and presentation evening in our faculty where discussions of our project ideas were articulated and enabled us to intensify our collaboration further. We helped METU-Turkey by providing genetic materials and iGEM kit plates from previous years. In return, METU-Turkey kindly helped us to conduct a significant modelling study.
Finally, we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them in every aspect to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.

Formal Lab Session - 19th August 2009
Overview
Metal Sensor Team - picked 3 colonies of potential BBa_J332066 E. coli transformants and inoculated LB solution with them
Stochastic Switch Team - only 5 out of 7 BioBricks had transformed in E. coli cells - these colonies were used to inoculate LB solution
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - counted the colonies produced by the treated sleB/cwlJ mutants
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
So far in the lab, we have prepared the BioBrick BBa_J33206 (arsR promoter + coding sequence) from the repository and attempted transformation of this DNA in E.coli. Once this procedure had been completed, the Metal Sensing team then streaked the bacteria on an LB + ampicillin plate and left it on 37°C incubation overnight.
Today’s procedure involves searching the plate for any colonies and if any colonies are present, picking three of them and inoculating 3ml LB with them. These grown up cultures will then be used for a mini-prep of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick. If no colonies are present, we must attempt transformation again. Because the plasmid involved in this BioBrick (pSB1A2) is a high copy plasmid, we can inoculate 3ml LB + ampicillin in the morning; by the afternoon the E.coli should have grown in the LB solution sufficiently to further inoculate 50ml LB solution in the afternoon (for midi-preps).

Next generation Public outreach Collaborations
Next generation
Preparing and inspiring future generations to take on the challenges of synthetic biology was an important part of our iGEM project. Our work on this involved introducing the field of synthetic biology and iGEM to high school students, as well as introducing the iGEM competition to the younger attendants at the Chalmers University of technology and other universities. We viewed this as an important part of our project since inspiring the next generation is vital for the continuing development of the field of synthetic biology and science in general.
High school seminars
The high school seminars involved presentations, quizzes and discussions within the field of synthetic biology.
The lectures/seminars involved some basic information surrounding biology, an introduction to synthetic biology and iGEM as well as information about our team project. At the end of each presentation, a discussion was held where the students could express their own opinion regarding the ethics of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Both the students and teachers showed great interest in iGEM, the potential future role of synthetic biology and the challenges faced by the field.
The discussion part of the seminar was highly productive and gave a lot of insight into how the younger generation views synthetic biology and genetic modification of living organism. Overall they were very positive and interested in how the process of genetic engineering worked as well as the possible risks that might be associated with the technology.
University outreach
Our team did not feel this was enough and we also sought to engage other university biotech students here in Sweden, therefore we will participate in Bioteknikdagarna (Biotech days) at Chalmers University of technology on november 3-6. Bioteknikdagarna is a multi-day conference attracting biotech students from several technical universities from all over Sweden. As part of this conference we will hold presentations on our iGEM experience, the competition as well as our project. There will also be an open floor exhibition where everyone will have the opportunity to ask questions and interact with the team.
Public outreach
Spreading awareness and interest for synthetic biology can be a difficult task due to the complexity of the field and the fast pace"

〔 はい ・ いいえ 〕
結果
iGEM JAPANのHuman Practiceアンケート結果より、全体の半数以上の人が遺伝子組み換えやバイオテクノロジーに関する研究を続けるべきと考えていることがわかりました。しかし、遺伝子組み換えでない食品を買う傾向や遺伝子組み換え・バイオテクノロジーによって作られた医薬品を避ける傾向がありました。また遺伝子組み換え技術に関しては半数以上が否定的なイメージを持っていることがわかりました。
考察
多くの人が遺伝子組み換えに関して漠然とした嫌悪感を抱いていると考えられます。研究を続けるべきと答えている人の多くが遺伝子組み換え技術を「食糧問題や医療技術へ応用」できると考えています。このことから遺伝子組み換えに関する知識があるとはいえます。しかし、メディアにより遺伝子組み換えに対して悪印象を持っていると思われます。これにより、遺伝子組み換え技術に対する理解と嫌悪という矛盾した意見の混合があると考えられます。これらは遺伝子組み換え技術の実態の不明瞭さが招いているもの"

Great jobs we have done
We devised the tandem promoter scheme to combine a few promoter to precisely express target gene at a required level. Experiments were carried out to prove the feasibility of this plan. A model was constructed to predict the strength of tandem promoter, given the kinds, the number and the order of sub-promoters. We proposed the multistage promoter scheme to switch the expression between several ideal level. Experiments were done to construct the system. In order to insure the orthogonality of the system, the off-target tendency of the regulating protein - dCas9, has been carefully modeled by analyzing the data from six paper about Cas9 off-target behavior.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NicoleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," split into two groups, half of whom I showed the working demo to and the other with Kim for a discussion about risks involved. When I tried starting the demo however, although the Sifteo cubes worked, a problem arose when trying to communicate with the surface and it was because the internet connection went down. Meanwhile, Consuelo was able to distract them by showing them the Beast. It was great to see how enthusiastic some of the kids were in learning more about how the Beast worked, the back end of some of our programs, etc. The demo with the two groups of kids went smoothly after the initial incident. Had a meeting with Kathy and Kara about what information they need for the Registry Crawler. When Kara demo'd the MoCloPlanner for the video for tomorrow's presentation, I had just realized how slow it took the program to pop up results, so search optimization is something I'll also have to work on after extracting the information Kara and Kathy want.
Day 38: July 20, 2012
Today was presentation day to the rest of the Computer Science and Math Wellesley summer researchers. Worked on finishing up modifications to Parts Registry Web Crawler by having it pull more information on genes, specifically the type of gene as well as started work on optimizing search. When the program gathers the entire source code for the parts page, it is copied into each one of the big classes: BasicInfo, Description, Protocol, References, Promoter, RBS, Gene, and Terminator when only a fraction of the source code is needed to populate the instance variables in that code. Have to add more functionality to the cube, specifically the idea of contamination (where E. Coli can ""contaminate"" the colored and plasmid cubes) and, when neighboring another E. Coli, start an animation where each goes into the other's frame. Also have to work on lessening the memory space each animation takes up.
Day 39: July 23, 2012
One of our first demo-able versions of SynFlo. Contamination of E. coli cubes and introduction of toxins have not been introduced yet
Worked on optimizing search for MoClo Planner. While I was able to fix some of the bugs that lessened the amount of information extracted for particular parts, the search time for creating RegDataSheets for a list of seven parts actually increased from 33 seconds to 40 seconds. Did a task on the MoCloPlanner to help Kathy, Kara, and Nahum out with any glaring bugs that may have possible been in their program. Then worked on"

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," many iGEM teams including iGEM_BIT(Beijing Institute of Technology University), iGEM Tianjin (Tianjin Unniversity) and LZU_China (Lanzhou University), and here we really appreciated their advices on our project about the competitive experiments, Kai ABC systems and the OMVs systems. Luckily, we won the best presentation award. What's more, we were greatly benefited from Meagan's lecture pointing out the importance of “After iGEM”. This strengthened our determination to contact the old members of XMU-China and luckily we got precious experiences and further understanding about this competition.
The 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
From July 30th to August 3rd, 2018, we participated in the 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by National Chung Hsing University, Taichung. There was a total of 22 teams and 140 participants from Taiwan, China, and Japan, warming up for the final Jamboree in Boston at the end of October.
The conference invited wonderful speakers from the field of Synthetic Biology and Ambassador of the iGEM HQ to give a talk at the Opening Ceremony. Among them, Prof. Kenji Tsuge from Kobe University explained the emerging synthetic biology technology that can link quantities of large fragments of genes and perform these genes; Dr. Zhang Jui-Jen, an associate researcher at China Medical University Hospital, shared his experience in using synthetic biology entrepreneurship; iGEM Asian Ambassador Chen Hong explained some new systems and shared experience on behalf of iGEM. We gained tons of new ideas from these lectures, which had great influences on our next work.
In the five-day conference, we also had a 20-minute English presentation and a poster exhibition. It was the first time to present our project frankly to iGEMers from Asia, and a good opportunity to practice for the final Jamboree. At the end of the exhibition, Prof. Wenming Yang from the field of molecular biology at National Chung Hsing University gave a comment on our presentation. Through the conference, we also made suggestions to other Asian teams, longing for more cooperation opportunities.
This conference has provided us tremendous new ideas to improve our project and final presentation.
