Outline
    In order to make an environmentally safe insecticide, the Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT or Terminator) incorporates a genetic circuit with LuxI/LuxR device for controlling the population size of the terminator. When the Terminators are released in the environment, the Terminator population can be self-maintained by our system thus a surplus will never exist using. In addition, we can manually kill all Terminator's by spraying AHL to induce self-destruction.

Component Descriptions
   1. In strand C, Ptet promoter (BBa_R0040) express the downstream genes, LacI (BBa_C0061) and LuxR (BBa_C0062) constitutively at room temperate.
   2. LuxI protein (BBa_C0061) is the synthase that convert S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) into acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). When the concentration of AHL reaches a threshold level, it binds the N-terminal domain of a LuxR protein. Then the LuxR/AHL complex binds the Lux box within Plux (BBa_R0062) promoter in strand D to activate transcription of the downstream ccdB gene (BBa_ K145151) and red fluorescent protein (BBa_ E1010).

I have patients that are basically untreatable.
Dr. Gebhardt
Phage therapy is a very promising alternative. Phactory seems very interesting, as it tackles quality and safety issues.
Dr. Gebhardt
Dr. Gebhardt showed us around the diagnostic laboratory of the hospital, where patient samples are analyzed. He then brought up a very important fact: To avoid delays in the delivery of life-saving therapeutics, the bacteriophages could be produced directly in the hospital itself. To be suitable for on-site production, sufficient stability of the components for distribution and storage has to be made possible.
Thus, we decided to establish a protocol for lyophilization of the cell-free expression system to fulfill these requirements."
uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"DE system can be devised to model the temporal responses of sgRNA, dCas9, and the resulting sgRNA-dCas9 complex to the gene sequence at various times, based on whether simple activation, simple repression, or competition between the two is induced. In order to mathematically model this, use of a pre-existing, mainstream biochemical model for mapping ligand binding probability to a “receptor” known as the Hill’s equation will be used. Use of Hill’s equation will allow for modelling of the gRNA (and by extension, the mRNA) transcription rates in relation to the interactions between sgRNA, dCas9, and the resulting sgRNA-dCas9 complex.
Based off the above paragraph, manipulating standard derivations of Hill’s equation for transcription factors can yield the probability of activating and inhibiting complexes respectively. Seen below, pa represents “probability of activation” and pi represents “probability of inhibition”:
$$p_a = \frac{\frac{K_ac}{1+K_ac}([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a])}{1+K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i]}$$
$$p_i = \frac{\frac{K_ac}{1+K_ac}([\text{dCas9-gRNA}_i])}{1+K_a[\text{dCas9-gRNA}_a]}$$
Converting the mathematics back into biology, let us translate the meanings of these equations briefly. The logic gate of our choice, the NOR gate, requires 2 inputs based upon which a single output is generated. For our inputs, simple activation/repression or competitive activation/repression of sgRNA-dCas9 ligands/complexes are the possibilities. Should the sgRNA-dCas9 combination enhance expression of the output, activation is at play, likewise, the converse result indicates repression all relative to a “control” expression (known as basal expression). In order to determine the effect at play, the output of choice is fluorescent proteins (e.g. GFP). By quantitative measurement of the fluorescence levels, we can work backwards to determine which effect is happening and at what probability it is to occur in the future.
Biologically however, wet lab data had been suggestive of repression being favoured significantly more than activation. These results have been backed up in journal correlation in a multitude of journal results, indicating that this will be a significant factor to account for likely via a weighted probability.
Furthermore, with much assistance from our graduate student advisor Danny Salem and the wet-lab team, more differential equations were generated with the purpose of finding out the dissociation, transcription, and decay"

Our Project
Yeastilization, this year's DTU Biobuilders project, focuses creating a combined solution of the worlds future excessive consumption of crops for non-feed purposes and increasing waste generation. By using a non-traditional yeast, Yarrowia liplytica, as chassis, we provide a new avenue for production of biotech products. Y. lipolytica has a broader substrate range than the traditional workhorse of the biotech industry, S. cerevisiae, which allows for the use of industrial biproducts instead of primarily produced glucose.
Using organic waste from industry instead of glucose from the agricultural industry to produce insulin (or other Biotech products) could potentially open up massive areas of arable land for food production. With a rising population, increase of food production is absolutely essential and every bit counts.

The Problem
TNT has been used as an explosive since 1902, and quickly became widely used in warfare and demolition; in World War II over one million tonnes was produced by the Allies alone. Although production has fallen since then over 1000 tonnes per annum are produced by the USA alone.
There are consequences to this high level of production. The waste created when producing TNT is toxic and long-lasting; the soil around a World War I ammunition disposal facility in Belgium was found to still contain high levels of TNT and related compounds.
What implications does TNT have for health?
Chronic exposure to TNT can put the sufferer at an increased risk of leukaemia. In Marburg, Germany, residents living close to contaminated ground soil from a WWII ammunition plant were 10 times more likely to die of leukaemia than the national average. A study conducted on copper miners who used TNT in their work found they were 4.5 times more likely to develop urinary tract tumours and 14.3 times more at risk of kidney tumours. This mutagenic effect has also been observed in mice.
Prolonged TNT exposure can cause cataracts. An Israeli study showed that 50% of people had developed the illness after 7 years exposure on average. In a Chinese study that tracked munitions workers who had been exposed to TNT for 20 years, 88.4% of the workers had developed peripheral cataracts.
Acute exposure to TNT results in a 1-8% increase in methemoglobin levels in the blood. This can last for 2-5 days. Methemoglobin is dangerous as it is unable to bind oxygen – meaning that oxygen cannot be released into the blood and can result in tissue hypoxia.
There have also been multiple studies in animals that show TNT can cause:

Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," Not only would this reduce the cost of producing our palm oil, but would also aid in the disposal of waste.
Delta 12 desaturase
In 2012 the St Andrews iGEM Team aimed to achieve a similar goal to our team, to produce a synthetic Omega-3 fatty acid. Their pathway included delta 12 desaturase, an enzyme we required in the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid. St Andrews had produced the delta 12 BioBrick and submitted this to the Registry – which provided an invaluable opportunity to use existing components from the Registry. Unfortunately when we requested this part from the iGEM Registry they were unable to send us this BioBrick as it would not transform, and after contacting the University they were also unable to provide us with this BioBrick.
As delta 12 desaturase is an essential enzyme in the production of our palm oil substituents we therefore attempted to re-produce the delta 12 BioBrick submitted by St. Andrews with improvements such as codon optimisation for E. coli BL21 (DE3).
Creating this system in Algae
During our project planning we evaluated the prospect of genetically engineering algae, such as cyanobacteria in order to produce our fatty acid products. The advantages of this would include being able to use light as a source of energy, significantly reducing the expense of media required - in particular glucose. The gene sequences for delta 9 and delta 12 desaturases are also not-native in E. coli, so these were obtained from a cyanobacteria. Whilst the cyanobacteria is prokaryotic, there was potential risk for incorrect protein folding when expressing these genes in E. Coli.
Unfortunately because of the slow growth rate of cyanobacteria we were unable to use this as a chassis for production of our fatty acids. Further, as an iGEM requirement all BioBricks must function in E. coli - so we would potentially have to repeat our project in two different organisms in order to satisfy this criteria.
In the future we would like to see our system created in algae to derive the potential benefits discussed.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," non-targeted DNA and give a visual indication of target DNA presence ( Baetsen-Young et al, 2018 ). The prescreening was tested with the human EPO gene and a corresponding ssDNAp targeting exon-exon junctions of the EPO gene. We were able to verify the possibilities of d-AuNPs to screen for EPO gene doping presence.
2.2 D-AuNPs: Generating a prescreening with visible readout
Aim: Develop a cheap, sensitive, and high throughput screening method to identify possible gene-doping users.
Approach: We generated batches of dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNPs) and evaluated their aggregation behavior in a range of 0 - 1000 mM NaCl under three different testing conditions:
No single strand DNA probe (ssDNAp) or double strand DNA (dsDNA).
Only ssDNAp and no dsDNA.
Target gene doping DNA with a specific ssDNAp, inducing annealing between both.
We compared the extent of d-AuNPs stabilization under these three conditions to determine the required concentration of NaCl for testing. After showing the functionality of the prescreening as a potential method for gene doping, we determined three assay properties:
Sensitivity: We assayed different ratios of target/non target DNA concentrations keeping the total amount of DNA constant.
Robustness: We evaluated the influence of sample background DNA after sample preparation.
Versatility: We compared the assay at the same conditions with different targets (varying ssDNAp).
3. Fusion Protein - dxCas9-Tn5
The final step of our gene doping detection method is based on targeted sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform. Our aim was to reduce the amount of data generated with Next generation sequencing and effectively identifying gene doping DNA. We accomplished this by creating an innovative fusion protein used in rapid library preparation required for sequencing. Our fusion protein consists of a cleavage deficient nuclease specific dxCas9 and a Tn5 transposase. The dxCas9 part, loaded with a single guide RNA (sgRNA), will interact with the specific target DNA sequence via complementary matching between sgRNA and target DNA. Whereas the Tn5 part will integrate two small DNA molecules (adapters) required for nanopore sequencing. Thus, the fusion protein is capable of performing dxCas9 guided adapter ligation for targeted sequencing library preparation, allowing us to identify gene doping in blood samples with our method ADOPE.
Before establishing a targeted library preparation protocol, we produced and analysed the functionality"

The Effect of Lead Contamination in Drinking Water on a Young Population
In developing a lead sensor for our project, we were curious about the effects of lead contamination in the water supply on small children. How do their bodies metabolize it? Where does it go? We were pretty appalled by the devastating effects lead can have on the human body and how long it can persist even after the initial exposure. Many journals report that there can be devastating neurological and physiological impairments from even the smallest exposure and there is no safe dosage of lead.
Very often, a journal would give a range of blood-lead levels and say that it correlated with a specific impairment but no paper was able to show a level or duration of contamination that resulted in that blood-lead level. Without this, we couldn't really gauge what level of lead exposure and for how long a person could be exposed to lead and miss out on the devastating health benefits. So we decided to try and model it!
We began with a thorough examination of the literature, looking for important details on how much lead is absorbed into the body, where the absorbed lead goes, and how long it stays in the body. With these literature values, we were able to create a rudimentary mass balance of the human body focusing on the amount of lead ingested and the amount that is excreted. We decided to treat the blood and bones of a contaminated person as two different systems to more accurately model how the body metabolizes lead and processes it. Our simplified version of how the body metabolizes lead is shown below.
The basic format of the differential equations for the two systems are included below.
To put the differential equations into terms that could be measured, estimated, or taken from literature, the following substitutions were made.
Below is the definition of each variable used in the differential equations. Units are included (as well as conversion factors) for dimensional analysis and confirming that each term is correct

CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.
Their proposed biomedical device technology -- called “Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time” -- is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
In addition to winning $10,000 in the SouthVenture Business Plan Competition in March, the group recently took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region.
They received another $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect -- An Alberta centre for New Commerce -- a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge -- plus a host of other in-kind prizes including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.
“I am extremely proud of the Synbiologica group for their achievements and wish them continued success,” said Dr. Dan Weeks, the U of L’s Vice-President (Research).
“The U of L is a comprehensive research institution that offers significant research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. This approach is important as it equips our graduates with the knowledge and ability to thrive in their research and entrepreneurial careers.”
The competition evaluates and awards business plans submitted by entrepreneurs who have taken advantage of the free business training provided by Community Futures across Southern Alberta. Finalists were chosen from 24 groups that submitted business plans for the challenge.
While he has to be a bit cautious about revealing details because of the patent process – an expected six to eight-month timeline -- Ward said their idea will significantly improve the way in which hormones are detected.
“Hormones – and hormone imbalances -- play very important roles in understanding behaviour and mental health, pregnancy as well as development and aging of all populations,” Ward said.
“We are pursuing new technology for the detection of hormones that provides rapid results that are 93 per cent more cost effective than traditional antibody technology.”
The team’s market analysis showed diverse applications and projections for growth, with a two to three-year timeline to produce a marketable device. The first test runs of"

A BETTER FUTURE WITH SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Study of synthetic biology emerged as a multidisciplinary science that help people in solving various problems. Among the general public, synthetic biology is famous as bioengineering and extreme genetic engineering which have an advantage in redesigning a life through genetical circuit, thus allows people to manipulate a new organism for use in treatment and diagnosis of disease, provision of quality seeds, remediation of environmental pollution caused by industrial and mining as well as the mitigation of global warming.
Indonesia as one of the currently high development countries in science is allowing for synthetic biology to grow rapidly. Prospects for the synthetic biology's development in Indonesia, among others, is the independence of technology in the health sector include the development of a specific diagnosis, the provision of pharmaceutical raw materials, and technology screening for Indonesia natural resources which have potency to treat various types of diseases.
Brawijaya University iGEM team will develop synthetic biology in order to solve health sector problems, focus in Cervical Cancer. We have three sub-projects, they are: plant engineering for cervical cancer prevention, developing Cervical Cancer Care Program application for smartphone as helpdesk, and scanning technology for natural materials treatment (CHS Kit).
Background
UB_INDONESIA BRINGS C3P (CERVICAL CANCER PROGRAM)
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Yet, because of poor access to screening and treatment services, the number of deaths occur in women increase highly, especially in our country, Indonesia. Effective methods for early detection of precancerous lesions using cytology (Pap smear) exist, but not effective enough for detection in all age. However, new technological developments, using synthetic biology, offer the potential to tackle cervical cancer in a more comprehensive way and build a healthier future for girls and women. Here we go with our great idea!
UB IGEM TEAM is on progress in developing C3P (Cervical Cancer Care Program) as the theme to give solutions for cervical cancer cases. Starting"

II) Expected Outcome
Phage plaques that decrease along with the dilution series on plates.
III) Materials Used
1x LB Top Agar (TA)
LB Broth
LB plates
Eppendorf tubes
Phage ( strains T2, T5, and T3)
IV) Actual Procedure
We filled five eppendorf tubes full of 90 microliters of Liquid Broth each.
We added 10 microliters of our desired phage to the first test tube and then mixed
We took 10 microliters of the first tubes mixed solution and added it to tube 2, and followed the same procedure for each test tube down the line to tube five.
We then labeled 6 culture tubes 0 to -5.
In the first culture tube, we added 20 microL phage to .5 mL bacteria.
In tubes -1 to -5 we took 20 microL from eppendorfs and added to .5 mL bacteria.
We then allowed a 20 minute waiting period for the virus to infect the E. coli.
5 mL top agar was added to each culture tube.
Each tube was then plated and incubated at 37 degrees C.
The following teammates were assigned phage as follows:

Edinburgh_UG,2016,Team:Edinburgh UG#Error Correction_-_-_TEXT.html," result    the value of each base had a value of 1 added to it. The first checkmethod of one    BabbleBlock can be defined as:
Fig3
Fig4
This method results in Fig.3 and Fig.4 for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system respectively,    which shows a large improvement over the original checksum method. The maximum frequency    of a single checksum has been significantly decreased which will lower the probability of    a false positive occurring; this is largely due to the large range of results available to    the method. However, there is still room for improvement as the shaded area of the graph    indicates that on a smaller scale the frequency of checkmethod 1 varies between high and low    values. Eliminating this fluctuation would allow for the data to be spread out more evenly.    To improve this    method a second layer of multiplication will be implemented, each digit will    now be multiplied by a constant depending on its relative position in the BabbleBrick.
Fig5
Fig6
This has been plotted for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system in Fig.5 and Fig.6 respectively.    When comparing checksum to checkmethod 2 the frequency peak is approximately 20 to 30    times smaller in both cases whilst utilizing more values. In Fig.5 and Fig.6 the largest    improvement using the second iteration of the checkmethod is the utilization of every    integer value, checkmethod 1 appears shaded as the frequency varies frequently. The last    step is to test checkmethod 2 when used in a babbleBlock containing 20 BabbleBricks; the    largest value possible assuming a BabbleBlock containing the value ‘3’ in each digit will    grant a value of 60600 which falls out of the current limit of 10^4 values. Therefore,    it is recommended that one more BabbleBrick is added to the end of the BabbleBlock in order    to store 10^5 values.
To improve this method  further more complex multiplications could be added, it would be    a decision based on optimising efficiency of calculations and minimising false positives.    In a 2 and 3 BabbleBrick system the probability of a false positives occurring was reduced by    approximately 20 and 30 times respectively, although the numbers are too large to compute,    this new method has the possibility of lowering the maximum false positive error of the previously    used checksum by one or more orders of magnitude.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," additional advantage of sharing many similar cellular functions with higher eukaryotes.
In iGEM, S. cerevisiae is not a popular chassis organism. This is easy to understand as yeast grows slower than bacteria, and with the limited time in the competition it is no wonder that many teams opt for a faster growing chassis. It is also likely that students have more experience in working with E. coli , and as a result, they favour a bacterial chassis. Moreover, in many projects working with an eukaryotic chassis wouldn’t bring any notable benefits. This preference for prokaryotic hosts can clearly be seen in the BioBrick Registry: there are hardly any yeast-compatible BioBricks, and most of them are poorly characterized and not in stock.
The main reason we chose to use yeast is that it has many similar cellular functions compared to humans. As we researched the toxicity effects microcystin has on mammalian cells, we discovered that the toxin has the same basic toxicity mechanism also in yeast cells, but it has no notable effect on e.g. E. coli (Yang, 2008). Also, with our project, we want to make synthetic biology more acceptable to people, and bring a change in the public views surrounding it. Using S. cerevisiae , or baker’s or brewer’s yeast as many outside the scientific community call it, as a chassis could help in this. By using a familiar organism with neutral connotations as a chassis, we can show that synthetic biology doesn’t have to be something scary or foreign. Additionally, because our detection mechanism is engineered in yeast, it was logical to implement the degradation part in yeast, too. That way, it will be possible to couple these two together in the same organism if desired.
In addition, if enzyme production in S. cerevisiae is successful, this could open possibilities for attempting to produce the enzyme in other eukaryotic organisms capable of even higher production yields, such as the yeast Pichia pastoris (Ahmad et al. 2014). This could enable more efficient mass production of the enzyme. An additional benefit of yeast is that it has an efficient secretion mechanism (Bitter, 1984); this would greatly facilitate mass production and purification of our enzyme, if it is possible to secrete it.
Our team was also lucky to work in a laboratory where people work routinely with yeast; we could ask help whenever we needed it. The advice we received from people working with yeast made our work a lot easier and taught us much. However, this was not the case for every team working with yeast this year"

Moreover, the absence of integration products on the other negative control (without fusion protein, adapter, or target DNA) on figure 18, lane 6-9, 12, and 13 confirmed this further.
Figure 18. 5% TBE native PAGE stained by EtBr and imaged by GelDoc system. A: Lane 1: DNA ladder (100-1000bp), lane 2: amplified product with fw EPO lane 3: amplified product with rv EPO, lane 4: amplified product with fw EPO without sgRNA, lane 5: amplified product with rv EPO without sgRNA, lane 6: amplified product with fw EPO without fusion protein, lane 7: amplified product with rv EPO without fusion protein, lane 8: amplified product with fw EPO without adapter DNA, lane 9: amplified product with rv EPO without adapter DNA, lane 10: amplified product with fw EPO with Tn5, lane 11: amplified product with rv EPO with Tn5, lane 12: amplified product with fw EPO without target DNA, lane 13: amplified product 2 without target DNA.
To confirm that these two bands represented the expected integration products, we isolated and sequence verified them. Figure 19 shows the sequence alignment between the two fragments and the target EPO gene. From the sequence alignment we can confirm that integration occured upstream the sgRNA binding site. The overlapping alignment between the two products  suggested that integration does not always occur at the exact base pair position (~10bp variation), which might be the result of the flexible linker between dxCas9 and Tn5.

To examine the functionality of our fusion protein further, we studied integration activity with different sgRNA and target DNA notebook ). Moreover, we repeated the reaction with longer incubation duration. With increasing incubation time, we observed fading bands representing targeted integration with increase in bands representing random integration ( notebook )
Conclusion
We successfully constructed, expressed and purified the fusion protein. We developed a method to test its functionality both in vivo and in vitro. We successfully demonstrated that our fusion protein was able to perform targeted integration in vitro. We sequence verified the integration products and confirmed that integration occurred in the region close to the sgRNA binding site.

CheZ can be fused to a reporter and direct bacterial motility in a ligand-dependent manner up a concentration gradient. Note: Fluorescent reporter proteins were fused to CheZ for observation of riboswitch activation during experimentation. (Click to enlarge)
Using analyte-induced CheZ expression, the main objective of project “Biotweet” is to illustrate the ability to reengineer bacterial chemotactic behaviour through the activation of riboswitches. Construction of such a mechanism is done in a modular fashion, producing an opportunity for scientists to not only direct bacterial movement to a specific location, but additionally, the prospect of delivering products of any protein-encoding sequences to that same site. This can be done by fusing any translational unit to the CheZ sequence in the riboswitch.
Figure 3.WITS iGEM 2011 riboswitch design. The riboswitch is linked to the motility activator CheZ protein, which can in turn be fused to any coding sequence. (Click to enlarge)
The aim was to reprogram E. coli CheZ deletion mutants (which lack natural CheZ functionality) with riboswitch-activated CheZ – to search, localise to the riboswitch activator, and return to a set location in order to report. This, in principle, will show that bacteria can be programmed to move in a directed manner towards a new stimulus and establish a connection between two points in space. The generic design for this is depicted in Figure 4. The “send” module is essentially a riboswitch-activated CheZ expression system which is responsive to analyte A. The “receive” module works via the same expression principles, except that the riboswitch is responsive to analyte B (Figure 4).
To ensure that the “send” and “receive” modules act independently, analytes A and B need to function as riboswitch activators. Additionally, analyte A must also function as a de-repressor of the Repressor X, within a biphasic toggle (Figure 4). Repressor X will repress Cre-recombinase (as well as Repressor Y) expression and the toggle will only flip at a critical concentration of Analyte A. A constitutive promoter, flanked by lox sites, will control transcription of the riboswitches – which exist in opposite transcriptional orientation within a single construct. Cre recombination will allow for irreversible “flipping” of this constitutive promoter (by lox site recombination) and thereby switch the mot"

First of all, by adjusting a series of independent variables and correcting the parameters, we solved the problems above. We gain the numerical solution of the equation by applying the Runge-Kutta Method as well. The method is suitable for differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxide ion in equation ABCDE group , we get the pH and use the pH to judge the termination condition. In equation C and F, we jump out the conditions according to concentration of specific substances. The initial value of every equation group is the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way we achieve the whole cycle process and finally get dynamic image of pH.
Fig. 1.1 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process
The initial concentration of OH- is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are, in order, Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.
2.  We helped BIT-China to detect protein NhaA and NhaB.
BIT-China’s project this year is about regulating pH, thus they need to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Taking account of the fact that membrane proteins are especially hard to express and detect, we offered to help them with this part. To this end, we reviewed an amount of relevant literature and consulted several professors of this field, on which basis we tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB.
Initially we did SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria. To put it in detail, we centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4°C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then with protein loading buffer added. Afterwards we run SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.
As the whole cell was too stick, we couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight are about 46 kDa. Then we tried normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result came out as Fig.2 has shown.

Monday: In the afternoon we had our first full team stand-ups to see how each project team has progressed so far and discuss our future goals. Joanna and I spent some time in the morning preparing to present, listing our accomplishments so far, thinking about potential risks, and sketching out a timeline for project completion. It was great to see the progress everyone has made and how much we have all learned already.
Tuesday: Integrating the canvas elements with the rest of the application has been an obstacle. Ideally, we would like to drag elements out of the canvas into other elements of the application, but that doesn’t seem to be possible. I’ve been experimenting with various draggable elements, but they have to remain within the parameters of the canvas.
Wednesday: After battling with canvas, I’ve begun to experiment with using mouse coordinates to manipulate elements from the canvas.
Week 7: July 8 - July 12
Project Presentation
Monday: To access the elements drawn into the html canvas I created a mouse down event to compare the (x, y) coordinates of the mouse in the browser window with the coordinates of the canvas images. Rather than dragging elements out of the canvas, the event currently triggers the appearance of another image object outside of the canvas. This may not be the ideal solution in the long term, but at least it allows for some interactive functionality now.
Tuesday: Moving forward, I integrated the test applications into the project’s html code in Google App Engine. So now, in conjunction with Joanna’s hard work on twitter and GAE, we have a mostly functional application to test and build upon. It’s exciting to see everything coming together. In the afternoon we had a check-in with Orit, who seemed pleased with our progress. Following her guidance, we are going to begin to think about the look and feel of the application, developing a cohesive brand image, and streamlining the visual interface.
Wednesday-Thursday: We have been making steps towards getting the interface a little closer to our goal. Tweets are now accessible and showing up in the right place thanks to Joanna, which is a huge step. I made the canvas stretch across the entire application, and layered other components over it, so that we can potentially drag elements from one section of the application to another. We also found out that we are presenting to some of the other science departments on Friday, so Joanna and I spent some time preparing and organizing our presentation material.
Friday:  Today Joanna and I presented our project to the other Wellesley CS/Math/Physics Summer Research groups. It was good to practice doing a formal presentation in front of"

This stator system Works with Na When this two protein system was established in E. Coli, it showed increased flagellar rotation speed and strength as compared to the original MotA/MotB stator system.

White letters in black boxes and arrows show identical residues and junction sites of chimeric proteins, respectively. Gray and hatched bars indicate putative transmembrane (TM) regions and peptidoglycan binding motif (PGB), respectively. Hypermotile mutations and strain numbers are indicated under the alignment.
Figure 5. Diagram of the properties of each chimeric B subunit. White, gray and hatched bars show the contributions of PomB or MotB from V. alginolyticus, R. sphaeroides and E. coli, respectively. TM, transmembrane region; PGB, peptidoglycan-binding motif. The stator proteins were expressed in V. alginolyticus or E. coli. R. sphaeroides MotA/MotB do not function in E. coli or V. alginolyticus, and PomA/PomB function only in V. alginolyticus. MotBE and PotB7E function in E. coli and V. alginolyticus. The properties of motors containing either protein are essentially the same in both species. Stators containing MomB7E or MomB7R function only in V. alginolyticus.
It is possible that the PomA/PotB59 system could be effective without the PotX and PotY proteins.
In light of the above information, we decided to use the PomA/PotB59 system in addition to the mutant HNS protein to increase the bacteria’s flagellar speed and torque strength.

Preparation: Characterize parts in registry
 
We based our design partly on existing parts K537009 and K411003 . These two parts are riboswitches sharing the same theophylline aptamer. We utilized their aptamer, embed an RNA scaffold after the theophylline aptamer in K539003 of K537009 and K411001 of K411003 , to become alloscaffold K738002 , thus empower K537003 & K537009 with new application. We mutated 8 bases of their aptamer to improve its compatibility with scaffold.
To make tentative steps in order to fix the theophylline concentration of our clover version coexpression experiment, we test these two theophylline riboswitches tagged with fluorescent proteins.
 
1. BioBrick Part K537009:
 
To characterise the theophylline riboswitches (part K537009, iGEM11_WITS_CSIR_SA), we quantified their activation at different theophylline concentrations (0 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM) over 2 hours using fluorometry.
 
Competent E. coli (strain DH5a) cells were transformed with plasmid vectors containing the ""Promoter-Theophylline riboswitch -Venus-Double terminator"". The bacterial colony appeal pink.
 
Cultured until the mid-log phase of growth, a different concentration of theophylline was added to each culture for induction. The activation of the riboswitch was detected as a fluorescent response as a result of increased translation of the fluorescent protein Venus, in the presence of the activator. Before fluorescence assay, we wash the culture with PBS.
 
A Synergy hybrid reader was used to excite the cultures at 505 nm and the intensity of the emission was detected at 535 nm. Empty bacteria were used to correct for auto fluorescence (IGEM11_WITS_CSIR_SA offered exciting at 514nm and emission at 528nm, but 514&528 is too close for our machine to detect.)
 
We have two end points of the OD 630 of each sample.
 
""Fluorescence intensity / OD"" increases greatly with theophylline concentration.

He also sent us a list of questions about biosafety so that we could think about this important subject. These questions concerned the specificity of our phage-like particles and the possibility of recombination between phagemid DNA and M13KO7.  Finally, he gave us a clue to finding highly expressed genes and explained a practical approach to designing our part.
Thanks to him, we explored the rate of production of our PLPs, by modeling and testing the recombination levels and the production rate of PLPs.
Marie-Agnès JACQUES
When our project was well defined, we presented it to Marie-Agnes Jacques, who is the national expert for X. fastidiosa at the agronomy research institute (INRA).  With this interview, we wanted to test the relevance of our project .  Since we weren’t able to meet her in person, this interview was made by email.
Firstly, we explained her our project and, after few exchanges about what we were planning to do, she was very encouraging.  However, she did raise the point that our product would be classed as a GMO.
Therefore, we decided to collaborate with the iGEM Evry Paris-Saclay team that offered to review on the legislation and European commission directives .  This way, we discover the different steps necessary to get a marketing authorization.

InterLab
Interlab with ZJUT-China
    This year is our first time to attend for the iGEM, So We met up with ZJUT-China，DLUT-China and LZU-China in Jiangsu Normal University to learn some experience form them and share our own project to them . Before this meeting, we had some troubles in interlab and we couldn’t find correct method to solve it. So we shared our problems with them at the meeting. The ZJUT-China had finished the interlab successfully and gave us some suggestions on our interlab. We adopted their suggestions and finally made it. After this meeting, we had a further communication with ZJUT-China and What they studied in Lysis gene gave us some inspiration about our own project, which made us consider to add a kill switch to make our L.lactis safer towards the biological environment. In return, we also gave them some ideas and suggestions to help them with their project.
Kill switch with SSTi-SGZD
    This year we also had a deep cooperation with SSTi-SGZD. They helped us with Wiki construction and technical support, so our Wiki could be compatible with the required format. We shared our ideas that we want to add a gene as the kill switch and wanted to get their suggestions. Then they just provided us with a supernova kill switch in a light-controlled gene system, which was an essential part to their last year's iGEM project. In order to help them with their experiment, we suggested on a method called Ubbelohde viscomete, which they could used to test the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid.
Safety with  Unesp_Brazil
    This year we also contacted with the  team Unesp_Brazilr by e-mails. We all concerned about the safety of the synthetic biology so we talked more about how to construct a high efficient chassis microorganism which is safe enough. Although we wanted to make our strain applied into the practical application, we didn’t know anything about the application of engineering bacteria. Fortunately, Unesp_Brazil offered the regulations and instructed us to apply our bacteria in the correct way. They also offered us the gene which could"

Figure 2. Proportions of colonies of each colour following transformation with the mutated amilCP sequences.
Results: Common Mutants
Mutants of each colour were selected for sequencing. It was found that all coloured mutants (blue, purple, pink and green) only had single nucleotide substitutions (SNPs), whereas mutants that were white, and had thus lost amilCP function, tended to have deletions resulting in frameshift mutations. Several different SNPs were found to cause the same colour, with some common ones that result in purple, pink or green phenotypes summarised in Figure 3.
Some colonies appeared to have the same colour as the wild type, however upon sequencing, it was discovered that there were several mutations that changed the nucleotide sequence, but did not seem to alter the function of amilCP. Most of these were later found to have no effect on the amino acid sequence.
Figure 3. Common mutations of amilCP resulting in a change of colour.  The wild type amilCP amino acid sequence is shown, with the mutated residues in bold. The 3 mutants that were submitted as parts (BBa_K1996003-005) are indicated by asterisks.
We were unable to find an objectively darker blue mutant, however, we have submitted pink, purple and green mutants (Figure 4) (BBa_K1996003-005 respectively). The colour in the purple mutant, like the wild type, can be observed after incubation overnight, whereas the pink and green mutants take up to 2-3 days to express the colour.
It was observed that wild type amilCP tends to decrease in vibrancy following multiple restreaks or after storage at 4˚C, something that was also observed in the pink and green mutants. However, the purple mutant retained its colour both on plates, and when inoculated into liquid media.
Figure 4. Purple, pink and green mutants compared to the wild type.
Protein was extracted from 50mL of culture and resuspended in 0.5mL TE buffer.
Results: Spectrums
Protein was extracted and a spectrum scan from 300-750nm was performed. Maximum absorbance for wild type amilCP was at 589nm, whereas the absorbance maximum for the purple mutant was at 579nm (Figure 5), indicating that it had been shifted slightly to the left. The absorbance"

Human practice
To let people know more about iGEM and synthetic biology, we participated in two events (Tokyo University Festival and our school tour for high school students and parents) and made some poster presentation. At both events, we told people what synthetic biology is and how this study contributes to our society. We also introduced what we did in last year’s iGEM competition.
People at the events appeared to have little knowledge about synthetic biology or even about basic biology, so they showed great interest in our poster presentation and asked many questions like: what is “gene”?, How do you insert foreign genes into E. coli?
We noticed through the events that most people had negative images of gene modification or using E. coli. We think these are derived from exaggerated reports about harm caused by gene mutation by mass media in Japan. Since there was radiation leakage in Fukushima nuclear power plant, people in Japan are very sensitive to the effect of radiation to their own gene. E. coli is also famous for negative accidents like infectious disease. (The most famous one is mass food poisoning caused by E. coli O-157 sakai in Osaka.) Such tendency undermines researches’ (including us) position.
Based on these facts, we think it was great achievements, to let people know that synthetic biology and E. coli can be useful in various ways such as production of protein or bioethanol, after having talked with people unfamiliar with the subject. We, the laboratory students that should make more effort to broaden spread the knowledge about synthetic biology, by taking the advantage of being at a closer distance with the general people outside the lab, than a busy person in responsible position like university professors.   We are now trying to get feedback from people by questionnaire, interviewing, and so on to improve our activity.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," an hour of venom incubation can be calculated from the β-galactosidase function determined from the primary reaction above, and the molar extinction coefficient of amilCP, which is determined experimentally to be 87600 M−1×cm−1 [2]  From the molar extinction coefficient of ONPG/ONP (21300 M−1⋅cm−1 ) [3], it was determined that a concentration of 5.8 uM released ONP would give off an absorbance value that corresponds to that of incubated amilCP.
Using a Vmax value of 142 mol/time/mg enzyme, the kcat rate constant of the secondary enzymatic reaction could be determined, using the calculated beta-gal concentration from the primary reaction. The kcat value was then used to determine the time (T2) it would take for the secondary reaction to reach the target concentration of 5.8 uM ONP, assuming that no ONP was present at the start of the reaction. The combined time of the two reactions (i.e. the time before sample is transferred from CH1 to CH2 plus the time for the secondary reaction to reach the target product concentration) can be plotted as a function of T1. With our arbitrary units of time, the plot appears as in figure 9.
Figure 9: Plot of total detection time as a function of incubation time of function 1 (In arbitrary time units)
From figure 9, it can be seen that there is a local minimum for the total time at T1= ~0.8 arbitrary time units.  It thus seems like it is theoretically possible to determine an optimal time of incubation of our expressed composite part in snake venom, although more parameters has to be determined to give more reliable data. This is only our first iteration of the model, and in the second iteration we would like to input more real life values, to get away from working in a.u.

The PCR products were analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gel is either stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with GelDoc system, or directly imaged with Typhoon Imaging System. The resulting gels are shown on Figure 1.
Figure 1. 5% TBE native PAGE stained by EtBr and imaged by GelDoc system.Integration reaction after 1 hours. Lanes are (1) DNA ladder (100-1000bp), (2) amplified product with fw EPO (3) amplified product with rv EPO, (4) amplified product with fw EPO without sgRNA, (5) amplified product with rv EPO without sgRNA, (6) amplified product with fw EPO without fusion protein, (7) amplified product with rv EPO without fusion protein, (8) amplified product with fw EPO without adapter DNA, (9) amplified product with rv EPO without adapter DNA, (10) amplified product with fw EPO with Tn5, (11) amplified product with rv EPO with Tn5, (12) amplified product with fw EPO without target DNA, (13) amplified product 2 without target DNA.
Figure 1 showed the result of PCR. Hyphothetically, sgRNA would steer the fusion protein to the target EPO (~600bp), specifically to the area close to the 160th bp. When specific integration occurs, target EPO will be split into two fragments of around  280 and 480. PCR reactions were done with primer sets that would amplify these fragments seperately. Lane 2 shows the PCR of the first fragment. A very intense band were indeed present around 230bp, confirming the presence of this integration product. Lane 3 shows the PCR of second fragment. An intense band were also present around 480bp, which also confirmed the presence of the second integration product. On the negative control lanes (without sgRNA or with Tn5), random bands were present, and none of these intense bands shown on lane 2 and 3 were observed here . This confirmed further that targeted integration indeed occur due to our fusion protein that is loaded with sgRNA. The absence of amplification bands on the other negative controls confirmed our result further.
Results of the longer incubation time shows similar result. However, it seems like the specific bands loses intensity with increasing time, suggesting perhaps re-integration events done by excess fusion protein. The higher intensity of unspecific lower bands over time strengthen this analysis further"

Collaboration
It is fairly difficult for one team to tackle their problems along. This year, we made excellent collaborations with three iGEM teams from China: SCAU, SZU and XMU. We also attended several conferences including the south China meeting in Shenzhen, CCiC in Shanghai and Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference in Taiwan. We are grateful to have their opinions so that we made changes and did better
SCAU
Early in March, we visited team SCAU in Guangzhou and had a thorough discussion about both of our projects. During the discussion, we gave suggestions about the potential questions for their insertions of plasmids and what they may improve in order to accomplish that step.
However, our group benefited a lot from the way they carried out their Integrated Human Practices activity. What they did was that they used a rasterized world map with all lands in color yellow. On the school open day, they simply asked the crowds to paste trees and achieved great impacts. Back in March, our group was still frustrating about what to do with the integrated part, and this collaboration served as a helper. We were enlightened by its simplicity and significance, which gave rise to the first tryout of our later CCC project in Shenzhen.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," best improvement was observed with the dual expression of FucO and GSH gene and demonstrated by Monod equation.
Fermentation
Ethanol production rate depends on the cell mass, sugar concentration and the inhibitor substances  (Olsson, Hagerdalt & Zacchi, 1995). In our project, the improvement of ethanol production was decided to be accomplished by increasing the tolerance of bacteria to inhibitors. Thus, the kinetic module developed by Olsson, Hagerdalt & Zacchi (1995) was used to emphasize the expected ethanol production rate of normal and improved E.coli KO11. Because we couldn’t construct a fermentation experiment, we used the parameters’ value from Olsson, Hagerdalt & Zacchi (1995) which were obtained from the utilization of KO11 in toxic substances. The Monod equation which was redesigned by our experimental data, was integrated into the fermentation kinetic model. The kinetic model were constructed by Matlab and shown below.

The backbone of the U of Calgary project are the composite parts. All of our parts are composite, and are an amalgamation of different registry parts which act together to provide a novel function. The composite parts designed for this project are based around the modified Bowman-Birk Protease Inhibitor (mBBI) and the competency-inducing ComK part that was submitted to the registry by the 2014 UofC_Calgary team.
A variety of different parts were used across all of the mBBI composite constructs. We used Pveg, a constitutive E. coli and B. subtilis promoter, and double terminators to book-end internal genes upon chromosomal integration. To improve secretion and transdermal delivery of mBBI from B. subtilis, we added a secretion (sec) tag as well as a transdermal (TD1) tag. The secretion tag is a localization tag for the Sec pathway in B. subtilis (Fu et al., 2007). TD1 is a part previously developed by the USTC_China 2013 iGEM team, and it is designed to allow for the trafficking of peptides across the skin.
The second major composite part was the ComK construct. ComK is a transcription factor and master regulator for competency in B. subtilis. We modified the original ComK sequence, which was first submitted by the 2014 UofC_Calgary team, to remove unwanted restriction sites from within the ComK gene itself. The ComK gene and xylose-inducible promoter were then flanked with sequences homologous to the amyE locus in B. subtilis, a non-essential gene responsible for the degradation of starch. These flanking sequences were added to allow for the integration of a controllable ComK into the B. subtilis genome. The integration of a xylose-inducible ComK allows for the transformation of B. subtilis to be more time-efficient and less resource-intensive.
Our last construct does not fall into either of the two previous categories. The construct is an integration"

No luck. Our streak plates gave us no growth.
Conclusion: The fungus that was growing on our plates broke down the AMP, which allowed the untransformed bacteria to thrive. The bacteria we harvested, thus, were not transformed with our F2620 part.
June 14
Today, we put together our entire part. We used the A3 assembly, as explained on the Model page.
We then poured plates of our assembled plasmid. We hope for 10 to 50 colonies of transformed colonies.
June 16
Neither we nor the other high school team in the lab had growth on our transformed plates. We are going to attempt to re-assemble the part. This time, we are re-adding the correct enzymes to the already cut parts, to ensure we get enough cut. Then, we are doubling the incubation times. We are hoping the parts will thus be sufficiently cut, and the enzymes will all be killed in the heat shock.

Compared to the shake flask cultivations and the micro cultivations in 12 well plates, far lower maximum specific growth rates and much higher minimum doubling times were reached.
Verification of the Function of PtNTT2
To verify that PtNTT2 fulfills its desired function, a simple experiment was designed. Usually, the function of nucleotide transporters is determined using radioactively labeled nucleotides. Given that we did not want to work with radioactively labeled nucleotides and that not every lab has access to suitable equipment, we focused on verifying the function without using radioactively labeled nucleotides.  Under phosphate starvation, E. coli secretes phosphatases to utilize the phosphates from nucleotides as phosphate source. Subsequently, the nucleosides can also be taken up by E. coli. On the other hand, cells expressing PtNTT2 and integrating it into the inner membrane should be able to take up nucleoside triphosphates directly. By taking up nucleoside triphosphates directly from the media, the cells can directly take up three phosphates and the nucleobase. Given that the uptake of NTPs by PtNTT2 is facilitated by counter exchange of NDPs, NDPs are exported and consequently converted to NMPs by extracellular phosphatases.  The experiment we designed consists of two parts and is based on the disability of E. coli to take up nucleoside triphosphates from the surrounding media. The first part consists of cultivations performed in MOPS minimal media which is supplemented with either 1,32 mM K2HPO4 or 1 mM ATP. Calculation of the Odds-ratio as shown in equation (A) allows to evaluate how beneficial expression of PtNTT2 is for the cell if extracellular ATP represents the sole phosphate source. The second part of the experiment consists of liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements for the quantification of AMP in the supernatant. Combined, these methods provide a way to investigate the function of PtNTT2 without the application of radioactively labeled nucleotides. Furthermore, these experiments might also serve as a way for future iGEM teams"

Subsequently the combined construct will be characterizes the same way as the double plasmid system and other options regarding different fluorescence proteins with different quenchers will be considered to be able to have multiple fluorescence responses readable at the same time while still being faster than normal expression.
Also finding and testing different promoters which can be used to express the TEV protease is planned to be able to detect not only Pseudomonas aeruginosa but also other pathogens. Also the technology can be expanded to other molecules enabling other research areas to profit from the faster fluorescence response.

This indicates that we are able to get ICA working using M-270 beads. It seems that the problem we had previously was due to using streptavidin magnabind beads, which may be incompatible, or degraded.
The bands at 100 bp are most likely due to the amplification of the IT construct, may be reduced in the future by using less initiator, compared to the 1 uL of 5 uM initiator used for this experiment.
The bands above 400 bp may be due to over-amplification, and can be eliminated through optimizing the PCR.

Solutions of sending DNA parts to the Registry
1.Search for and follow the regulations published by iGEM HQ
According to the rules of submission at iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we will follow the regulation for sending the parts.  (1)  Follow the shipping guidelines for submitting samples of the parts. Samples have been sent as mini-prepped plasmid DNA  (pSB1C3).  (2)  Submit by using the 96 well plates, sealed completely (adhesive foil/plastic), and covered with a protective lid.  (3)  Provide a tracking number for the package  (4)  Disguised or hidden are not allowed and avoid customs confusion.
2. Ensure less risk as possible
Prepare backups for emergency situations, and check problems by consulting with local post offices.
A. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
E. coli lab strains (DH5α and BL21) have no known survival mechanisms outside the lab culture, and they only caused minimal harm to people or environment. Therefore, they are considered to be safe and practical for research. The only excluded condition is horizontal gene transfer. In our project, the gene products were oxidoreductase enzymes, AOX, which catalyze the oxidation of primary alcohol. The enzymes have been used in many biotech and industrial applications and supposed not to be dangerous to the health of our members.
B. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
Our genetically engineered bacteria producing alcohol oxidase enzymes would be used on the sample test strip of the Blood Alcohol Meter, an electrochemical analyzer like Blood Glucose Meter seen as household items. If released by accident, the E.coli has no survival mechanisms in the environment and cannot spread spores or reproduce in the gut of an organism, so it has low threat to the public. By design, the bacteria will be killed in the process of standard sterilization process before depositing them to the test strip. The test strip we created will not contain any live GE bacteria, therefore it won’t have risks to the safety and health of the general public.
C. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
If so, the E. coli lab strain no longer has survival fitness outside the lab. And the DNA plasmids are maintained by high concentrations of antibiotics like chloramphenicol and kanamycin in our case, thus they will disappear and be degraded"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

Our Proposed Parts
PilA1 (Part: BBa_K1476001):
The proposed function of this part is the production prepilin1, a pilus subunit, the theory of transforming in this part is that it will promote hyperpilation and increase the surface area in which electrons can be transferred from the plastoquinone pool to the anode. Making the cell ‘leak’ more electrons. This part also contains the pilA1 gene and the upstream Pcpc560 super-strong promoter, this will ensure the overproduction of the proteins necessary for hyperpilation. This biobrick part does have some complications however, see the safety section for more details.
PetF (Part: BBa_K1476004):
PetF codes for ferredoxin, which is an iron-sulphur protein found in photosystem I. Ferredoxin transfers electrons to the ferredoxin reductase protein, which reduces the cofactor NADP to NADPH. This insertion is controversial, increasing the production of a protein which actively takes up electrons into a metabolic pathway will decrease electron leakiness, and therefore decrease the voltage given of by the fuel cell.
PsaD (Part: BBa_K1476003):
The PsaD subunit is a peripheral protein which helps to dock ferredoxin onto photosystem I2. Deletion of this gene will decrease the amount of ferredoxin in photosystem I decreasing the amount of electrons entering the electron pathway. However, deletion of this gene will have implications for the cell’s hardiness and survivability. Deletion of the PsaD protein could cause cell death and/or greatly impair growth.
PilT1 (Part: BBa_K1476000):
Deletion of the PilT1 subunit will suppress pilus retraction, by reducing the activity of the ATPase responsible, again focusing on the hyperpilation of the Synechocystis. This will not lead to added growth of pili, but more the decreased subtraction of them once they are formed. This increases the surface area for which electron transfer can take place. However, Synechocystis is reliant on the PilT1 subunit for it’s motility and transformation competency. This will have direct consequences on the cell’s ability to reach nutrients and therefore grow, possibly meaning an even more exaggerated stumped growth and replication when nutrients start to become more scarce.
How our knockouts and insertions will work:

On January 6, the day that the advisory service of the rectory UFMG finally spread our invitation to the entire campus and other institutions, we had over 300 subscribers.
The numbers have continued to increase since then until the end of the registration period, a month later. When the system was closed there were 837 registrations recorded in the database. People from all areas, undergraduate levels and the most diverse experiences possible took interest in our course.
The 40 students selected to participate were able to step into SynBio world, in a week of theoretical and practical classes. They also formed groups to develop and present a SynBio project idea. The overall satisfaction with the offered course, measured through a survey applied in the last day of the course, reached 82.5% and 100% of the students said they would recommend the course for their contacts.  In addition, 83% of the course participants were interested in joining UFMG_Brazil iGEM team. Ten of them actually entered the team.

Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of research safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
There are potential safety concerns with our project, but they do not exceed the normal caution exercised when working with antibiotic-resistant organisms. Although the team is working with a lab strain of E. coli that must be provided with the proper nutrients to survive, we are also working with a variety of antibiotic-resistant plasmids. While we follow proper sterile protocol in our work in the lab, there is still a chance that a wild pathogenic bacteria may enter reactions. In this event, a wild bacteria may have the chance to acquire an antibiotic resistant plasmid. If it were to be removed from the lab, this bacteria could exchange this resistance factor with other bacteria. We do not work with virulent or potentially hazardous strains of bacteria in the lab, and thus would not risk infection or illness from these antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The only hazard is in allowing these antibiotic-resistant bacteria to transfer their plasmids to pathogenic bacteria outside the lab. Here there is the possibility of danger to the public or the environment depending on the strain of bacteria.
Since some of our project ideas require the use of specific antibiotics, their use and disposal must be taken into consideration. Some of these compounds are toxic or even carcinogenic to humans and must be handled appropriately. These compounds may also be toxic to the environment or public if they were to not be disposed of properly.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our BioBrick components raise any safety issues other than the antibiotic resistance they carry. Steps must be taken to ensure the antibiotic resistance is not accidentally imparted to a pathogen bacterial strain. Otherwise all of the BioBricks created by the team are for analytical purposes only and can only produce fluorescent proteins when correctly used.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Yes, there is a biological safety review board at Penn State University. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) records, reviews, and approves laboratory research based on the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. They have approved the research conducted in our lab, and we are in full compliance with the biosafety regulations imposed on our work by the"

These also represent the levels at which our projects act: MUN is engaged globally, YES on the European regional level and iGEM teams through their human practices act on a local level.
The event would start by informing how a problem in synthetic biology (e.g. safety issues) can propagate on all three levels of engagement. Then we would try to motivate interested audience members in a workshop to come up with their own ideas how to tackle such problems. The final goal is to get them engaged in youth organizations that start the cycle anew: inform an audience on their subject, motivate interested audience members and help them get engaged in youth organizations.
The plan for such an event has been set, however we were unfortunately not able to find an available date to organize the event before the start of the Jamboree. Nevertheless, it shows iGEM and collaborations with other youth organizations show great potential to achieve SDGs!
The Experts
The field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research partially lacks answers to the most basic questions on microbiome dysbiosis. However, most experts agree that dysbiosis is integral to the pathogenesis of IBD.[1]
In order to address the right problems in our project, we met a number of experts, with whom we discussed not only technical details, but also ethical and safety issues of the project:
Prof. Gerhard Rogler, Gastroenterologist and expert on IBD at Universitätsspital Zurich
Prof. Christophe Lacroix, Expert on bacterial metabolites and its role with probiotic bacteria at ETH
Prof. Martin Jinek, Expert on CRISPR related protein-RNA interactions at University of Zurich
Prof. Gerhard Rogler
IBD is very complex class of diseases and given that some bacterial species might worsen the condition for patients, it is of the utmost importance to take the necessary precautions to make our bacteria interact as little as possible with the disease. In the following paragraphs we will summarize the interview with Prof. Rogler, where we address these issues.
Our project is currently implemented in E. coli, however E. coli lipopolysaccharides are known to increase the immune reaction in IBD patients and are sometimes even connected to pathogenesis. One strain of E. coli, E. coli Nissle, is currently being used as a probiotic in IBD patients and does not increase inflammation. The problem with E. coli Nissle is that it cannot take up any plasmids and it is therefore not a feasible candidate host for our project.
Prof. Rogler therefore suggests using Lactobacillus"

Because to see it and do it myself put it into a state of reality that made much more sense than a thing that you just talk about. It was very nice and interesting to do experiments in a real laboratory and to imagine being a biologist who wants to find the biological origin of an unknown sample. And generally to know that something like this is possible is fascinating. I would like to do something like this again and I would suggest to do it with my friends.

9th - 11th May 2012 4th Annual Meeting of Senior Experts of Chemistry (GDCh)
After the project of the iGEM team of TU Darmstadt stood firm and the beginning of lab work came up, the team had the opportunity to present their project to the elder people. The Society for German Chemists (GDCh) organizes every year a meeting of senior experts in chemistry. At this congress, the team could occur with three posters and convince the elderly from their project ""Next Generation Recycling"". The project met with great interest, and there were long discussions about costs and feasibility of it. It was not unusual that present chemists themselves were involved in the production of plastics or on the other hand developed new chemical-based recycling processes on it. Many did not know the way of seeing things with the view of biology yet and were surprised what opportunities this new view offered. The iGEM team quickly realized that it is not easy to convince a chemist from biology. It was easy to explain the degradation of the polymer with its chemical structure, but it is more difficult to explain genetics and even more the BioBrick system. Nonetheless was the presentation a huge success and they were able to convince the elder people of the idea. It was not only convincing the people for the project, but also the discussion about the new topic of Synthetic Biology, which is a contrary topic in Germany. It was important for the team to achieve not only one group of residents in Germany but as many as possible. For the team it was necessary to inform the people about new scientific technologies in a true and open way. Chemists, who are still working and dealing with the recycling of waste, came to the team and wanted to know, if the project could be extended to other substances. It turns out that the method of bioremediation is not used in its maximum manner and there are a lot more tasks outside to deal with. So the project of the iGEM team of Darmstadt is a hint into to the future and could soon find its application.

To ensure the suppression efficiency of the gRNA, four gRNA sequences targeting different sites of CSPA promoter were designed and transfected into the E. coli strains BL21. Efficient suppression of CSPA promoter in strains BL21 was observed. GFP levels in GFP transgenic strains decrease after inserting a fragment that expresses CSPA promoter gRNA. And the sequence with the best suppression effect was selected for further study.

Before obtaining the right of market entrance, producers have to make appliances according to CLIA categorizing system. After that, CMS, DCLD and CDC will check the products and authorize corresponding CLIA certifications. When it comes to POCT products specially, they will have to firstly recognized by JCAHO and CAP, and finally authorize and certificate by JCAHO, CMS and CAP [5].
In terms of the usage of POCT products, owing to the fact that there is not much barrier, the superintendence is therefore the key to optimizing POCT and enlarging its range of application. POCT committees have been set in every organization, city and state in America so as to implement quality-superintendence over its usage and guarantee the accuracy of the testing results [6].

Introduction
The expanded characterization of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) systems focused on 10 main systems, which are tabulated in the Project Description. The synthetic system that our team aimed to construct split the system into a Sender (AHL synthase) and a Receiver. By separating the inducer of the AHL from the receptor, crosstalk can be determined between systems.
Bacterial Cloning
E. coli DH5αT was used for the construction of the Senders and Receivers. BL21(DE3) E. coli was used for induction tests. After long transformation, liquid cultures were made using LB broth mixed with ampicillin. All cultures were then appropriately digested and ligated in order to properly construct each part. A modular receiver and modular sender vectors were developed for each of the parts. The designs for these plasmids are shown below.
All Senders and Receivers were gel verified and sequenced with the help of the Arizona State University's Core Laboratory. After confirmation of the successful construction of each part, each part was retransformed to create sufficient stocks for later experiments. In addition, the 5 Senders that were submitted to the registry were taken out of their respective modular vectors and placed into psB1C3 Biobrick standard vector. The Modular Sender Vector was submitted within its own backbone, as it was designed with an RFC10 prefix within the part.
Inducer Confirmation through Optical Density Measurements
Initially, after the construction of the 20 Receivers and Senders, the focus of our project centered on the Aub system. This was due to the highly uncharacterized nature of the Aub system as well as possible discoveries of orthogonality between Aub and other system receivers. However, we encountered difficulties with the AubR transcription factor, which would not be highly induced in the presence of the Aub AHL. We shifted our focus to the inducers, seeking to create a part collection of 5 novel inducers that were previously unavailable in the iGEM registry. While we had successfully sequenced each of the constructed Senders, a proof-of-concept test was conducted on the inducers to demonstrate the likely production of the AHL.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Overview#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," biological parts can, however, in the wrong hands, have hazardous consequences. Improved characterisation of parts will make it easier, even for people with limited knowledge of synthetic biology, to create increasingly sophisticated constructs. Individuals with malicious intentions could for example create biological weapons. This concern is strengthened by the fact that all iGEM material is open source and easily accessed.
Easier construction of biological systems can thus potentially have both positive and negative consequences: Well-intentioned use of synthetic biology can lead to better health of the world’s population, solve the environmental problems of the globe etc., while use with bad intentions can lead to disease and possibly death for an unknown number of people.
In utilitarianism the weight of a potential consequence is usually quantified by the magnitude of the consequences multiplied by the probability that the given consequence will occur. Since a large number of scientists have good intentions with research in synthetic biology, and (presumably) a comparatively low number of people are trying to create harmful things with synthetic biology, we argue that the positive consequences outweigh the negative consequences. It can also be argued that the better understanding of biology brought about by synthetic biology research will help mitigate the consequences of malicious use of synthetic biology.
Manipulating Nature
Another concern commonly raised against synthetic biology (and genetic engineering in general) is that the engineered organisms might escape to nature and disturb the natural ecosystems. With regard to this argument synthetic biology products should be divided in two groups: Those that are intended for release in nature (e.g. bacteria that degrade oil in the oceans) and those that are intended to be kept in a laboratory environment (e.g. strains for producing medicine).
For the products that are not meant to be released in nature, the consequences of accidental release into nature can be minimised by a number of existing biological mechanisms that can be incorporated in the organisms to prevent them from spreading outside the laboratory. Furthermore the probability of accidental release is minimised by the many precautions that are currently required when working with GMOs in the lab (see our safety page ).
The products whose functions do depend on release into nature will inevitably disturb the ecosystem where they are released. However this is often the intention with these products, as they are designed to remedy some already existing ecological imbalance/disturbance. Additionally, prior to releasing an organism into a natural ecosystem it seems prudent to investigate how the organism might affect the ecosystem in question and assess (and minimise) the risk of the organism spreading to other ecosystems, where its presence is not desired.
In light of these considerations we argue that the concern of synthetic organisms disturbing ecosystems is largely unwarranted: Organisms intended to be contained in"

PROTOCOL
1.Artificial synthesis the genes
Gene synthesis is the step during which oligonucleotides (oligos) are combined into DNA fragments of several hundred bases in length. Numerous protocols have been described and extensively reviewed. In our project, we use the polymerase chain assembly (PCA) to synthetic ipgC, InvF, sicA and mixE.
We finished the gene synthesis of ipgC, mxiE, exsC, sicA* and invF.They have be proved to have the correct sequence.
First, we disassemble target gene into several oligos using GENE DESIGN, and we synthesis these oligos in GENEWIZ.
Then, the oligos that are synthesized to build the target gene. The pool of oligos is assembled in equimolar amounts and allowed to anneal. The annealed oligos are extended in the 3' direction until the end of their partner oligo is reached. The double-stranded DNA is melted and reannealed with extension products and any remaining oligos. Each extension reaction results in progressively longer products and full length products are eventually synthesized. At this step, the terminal oligos are added to the reaction and full length products from the previous reactions are amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned and sequenced.

2.One-step Site-directed Mutagenesis
We insert target sequence into plasmid to construct our desired synthetic small RNAs. Our protocol is rather simple. We just use PCR to perform it, one-step site-directed mutagenesis. In our experiments, we used it many times. For instance, one of steps is that we inserted ipgc sequence into Box2 (blue target in Fig. 2-1).
IPGC sequence is ATGTCTTTAAATATCACCGAAAAT
To construct box2 for testing silencing effect, we should insert the 24-nt-long sequence ATGTCTTTAAATATCACCGAAAAT between the RBS and the lacZ gene. (Fig. 2)

Our goals for these two weeks were very clear. First, we need to generate enough mutagenized phage for the Phage Purification Team to work with. Second, we need to start our modeling project. Hopefully, everything will go according to plan and we will have presentable data soon! As for our modeling project, we have decide to model phage plaque sizes against different variables, such as phage particle size and top agar concentration. We aim to generate a mathematical model that can be used both to optimize phage plaque size for research and characterize our mutant phage.

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," were performed with Gold NPs (AuNPs). Because AuNP solution is purple in color, we can take absorbance measurements and convert these values to AuNP concentration using a standard curve (figure 5-5A). 10 mL of AuNP solution was added to different volumes of biofilm (figure 5-5B). The containers were shaken at 100 rpm overnight to maximize interaction between the biofilm and AuNPs. Finally, the mixtures were transferred to conical tubes and centrifuged to isolate the supernatant, which contains free AuNPs quantifiable using a spectrophotometer set at 527 nm.
Adding more than 1 mL of biofilm to the same amount of AuNP solution did not trap more AuNPs (figure 5-5C). We observed that 1 mL of biofilm was just enough to fully cover the bottom of the container. Since only the top of the biofilm directly contacted the AuNP solution, increasing biofilm volume beyond 1 mL simply increased the depth and not the contact area between biofilm and AuNPs. Therefore, we concluded that biofilm volume is not a main factor determining NP removal.
Figure 5-5 Biofilm volume does not affect NP trapping. A) AuNP standard curve relates absorbance and molar concentration. B) Different amounts of biofilm were added to same amount of AuNP solution. C) Increasing biofilm volume beyond 1 mL does not increase NP removal. Experiment: Yvonne W.
Surface Area Affects NP Trapping
Next, we tested the effects of surface area on NP removal. Similar to the previous experiment, biofilms were extracted and washed. Two experimental groups were set up in different sized cylinders, with either a small (~1.5 cm2) or big (~9 cm2) base area (figure 5-6A). The bottom 0.5 cm of each container was covered by biofilm, then 10 mL of AuNP solution was added. In this case, the depth of biofilm is consistent, so the contact area between AuNPs and biofilm is equal to the area of the container’s base. All containers were shaken at 100 rpm at room temperature. Every hour (for a total of five hours), one replicate from each group was centrifuged and the absorbance of free AuNPs in the supernatant was measured at 527 nm.

As shown from the above bar charts, with 0.5Mm,1.0mM and 1.5mM of IPTG induction, there is only slight increase of gene expression level by only 2-3 fold. However, with 2.0Mm of IPTG induction, there is much greater fold change of more than 2-3 folds. It is worth to notice that the RT-PCR efficiency might be different for different genes due to their size of PCR products and the formula used above is assuming the PCR efficiency to be 100% that eventually resulted in 2 copies of products.
Advise and information sharing with Team Macquarie on HemH gene knock-out in bacterial genome
Macquaire iGEM team members wish to knock-out HemH gene in DH5α using CRIPSR-based system. HemH gene is responsible to encode ferrochelatase enzyme that insert ferrous ion into protoporphyrin ring IX. By knocking out this gene, protoporphyrin ring IX can be redirected for the production of chlorophyll a instead of heme.
As the CRISPR-Cas based bacterial genome editing application is relatively unexplored and underpresented, our team is helpful in advising Macquiare iGem team that it is not preferable to use CRISPR-Cas based system for bacterial genome editing . This is because later we have realized that lethal effect has been associated with CRISPR-induced double-stranded break on targeted gene. This phenomenon can be explained by low occurrence of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), one of the DNA break repairing mechanism in bacteria.  Hence, this lead to irreversible DNA breakage . Thus, in this situation, CRISPR-Cas system is used as a selection force rather as primary editing tool.By this selection system, only successfully recombined or modified cells are able to survive.
As a proof of concept, this lethal effect can be shown from CRISPR-based HemH gene knock-out results that accomplished by Macquarie team. When they try to introduce purified Cas9 protein with a series of concentrations for HemH gene targeting,cells with higher amount of Cas9 protein shows significant slower cell growth. For Cas9 concentration such as 17uM, cell growth are almost negligible.This again highlight the lethal effect of high concentration of Cas9.
