However, because Ideonella Sakaiensis is a poorly characterized, it is not a suitable chassis for genetic engineering. To harness the power of PETase, we would use synthetic biology to make the well characterized E. Coli our chassis and engineer our Plastiback system.
Our Genetic System in E. Coli
Though we are using the PETase enzyme from Ideonella Sakaiensis, we expressed PETase in E. Coli. An E. Coli based genetic system is useful because E. Coli is a well-researched chassis organism that has multiple available strains for protein expression optimization. To find a strain that best expressed PETase, we investigated several genetic systems and strains, including LEMO21 and SHuffle T7. Among the strains we tested, we found that T7 lysY Iq was the optimal strain to express PETase in.   We realized that Plastiback needed to do more than just express PETase. We designed our system to tightly control the expression of PETase so that the cells expressing PETase could grow without the metabolic load of it being expressed. Further, we realized that ocean researchers with no synthetic biology experience would need to use Plastiback, so we designed a visualization method with a fluorescent protein that would be allow researchers to check that Plastiback was working properly simply by looking for a green glow.   Additionally, the design of our system requires PETase enzyme activity to take place on solid plastic outside the cells, and to remain in it soluble, catalytically active state. In order to get outside the cell, we would need to design a mechanism for secretion. After researching various pathways and secretion systems, we selected 3 secretion tags with significant and convincing literature and/or iGEM precedent for correct protein localisation. We used the YebF fusion protein, used by the 2015 Oxford iGEM team, who successfully used it to secrete a cell lysis protein. We also used the pelB secretion tag, which the 2012 UC Davis team used to successfully secrete their protein in the extracellular medium. We also tested the ompT secretion tag, which uses similar mechanisms to pelB.
To read a complete description of our genetic design, see our design page.
On our results page , we show that we were able to successfully control expression of PETase, use our easy flourescence check to visualize PETase expression, and achieve catalytic activity. With a system to break down PET into its byproducts, we were ready to use these byproducts to sense  the presence of PET"

Regulations. There is a big problem due to lobbies. They have a huge power. Lobbying in ministeries should be forbiden.

Take home message
History. Professor Morange talked to us about recombinant DNA technology, The Asilomar conference, the guilines that came out of this conference. We detail these in our human practice report.
Benefits. It is very important to know WHY we are doing such and such genetically modifed organism. What benefits are we expecting? I can forsee ecological and economical benefits to the use of GM bacteria in the wild.
Risks. We do not know how to evaluate the risk. We are not even able to completly identify it. Therefore the precaution principle should be applied when releasing gentically modified organisms in the wild. All risk can be acceptable if the benefits are high enough.
Discussion with the public. There was no real discussion in France like there was in the US after Asilomar, so each time the whole debate starts again. Moreover, debates may be held, but in the end, are people saying ""no"" really listened to? The debate concerning GMO plants and crops was very badly led: it was not a real debate, and peopl where never presetned with the risks (they were told there was no risks). Therfore, Europeans felt that GMO food was imposed to them, that they had no real say in the situation.
Patent. It is important to keep the biobrick registry open source.
Our system. Good idea. When natural bacteria/animals/plants are introduced in a new , there is also a risk of disrupting the recipient ecosystem. this is not jsut a problem inherant to genetically modifed organims. Therfore your synthetic safe guard system could also be used in ""natural"" bacteria that are intorduced in other ecosystems.

1. Although biological electromagnetic wave has already been found, it is far from steerable.
2. Biological electromagnetic wave is too weak to carry information, how can we strengthen it?
3. How to realize biological electromagnetic in a microbe?

iGEM Campus Selection
E
xperienced the first year of the iGEM, our team have a better understand of how to operate iGEM in our school. It is a very important issue that how to arrange our learning arrangements, community activities and iGEM competition together. Based on the above factors, we think it is necessary to keep a primary form of the selection in our school. So we held an iGEM campus selection, the continuation of last year's Campus Workshops.
T
he competition was divided into overall program design and three special games (mathematical modeling, biological experiments and web design). All teams must participate in the overall program design, in addition to select from at least one of the three special contest.
A
t first, our team orgnized a simulate iGEM teach-in .NJU associate professor and doctoral tutor Chen Xi, the captain of NJU_China Zhou Yu were invited. They were invited to introduce the meaning of synthetic biology and iGEM. From their speech, we learned that competition and problems in the formation of an iGEM team also should be noted.
I
n September of this year, our team also made an exchange with the students to share the fun, summed up the need to pay attention to the matter. At the same time, we have introduced our project for this year's competition to them——the Horcrux.
T
he competition selected excellent students into the school to participate in NJAU_China team. By participating in an international tournament, making the race organizers have a better understanding, and tryouts for the next campus provide a richer experience. Simultaneously, students selected this competition can provide technical and theoretical support for international events for next year.

DTU-Denmark,2013,Team:DTU-Denmark#Kinetic Model_-_-_TEXT.html," is given in [6] as 283 kDa and the molecular weight of HAO is given in [5] as 189 kDa. Summing those numbers leads to a molecular weight of 472 kDa corresponding to 7.838 · 10−16 mg. With this number we convert the vmax to 3.116 · 10−14 μmol min−1 . Then using the Avogadro number we derive a kcat value of 18765 min−1.
We also need to know how much ammonia the water we want to treat will contain. The ammonia concentration in different types of waste water is given in [7] as 1 mg/L in aquatic cultures, 10 mg/L for municipal waste water and more than 100 mg/L for industrial waste water. So the concentrations we want to look at in our model are: 1 mg/L (58.72μM), 10 mg/L (587.2μM), 100 mg/L (5.872 mM) and 500 mg/L (29.358 mM) ammonia.
The equations of the two models for Mutant 1 and Mutant 2 are:
The modeling was done in MATLAB using the Systems Biology Toolbox [8] and the scripts are uploaded in the section scripts below.
Results and Discussion
Concentration versus time plots of ammonia and nitrous oxide are shown in Figures 1-2 for different enzyme concentrations. There should at least be around 500 copies of each enzyme in the cell to convert the ammonia in a reasonable time. Especially in Mutant 2 the conversion takes long but with 1000 enzymes per cell the converion times is little more than 20 minutes for an extreme concentration of 500 mg/L ammonia. The plots shown here are estimations based on literature research and will be corrected once we have experimental data.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," has the potential to prevent many unsuccessful experiments of iGEM teams and may improve the characterization of the parts in the parts registry. However the extra amount of work required to clone such an additional construct may inhibit this behavior. We therefore improved the standard plasmids pSB1X3 and pSB4X5 by inserting a lacI repressible T7 promoter directly upstream to the BioBrick prefix of those plasmids. This promoter is completely inactive in 'E. coli' strains lacking a T7 RNA polymerase such as TOP10 or DH10beta bute inducible in strains carrying the T7 RNA polymerase under a lacI repressible promoter such as DE3 strains. This enables the use of the same backbone for cloning and over expression. Using 3A assembly a translational active part can be cloned from an RBS and a coding part in one step while maintaining the full flexibility of standard BioBrick assembly. These new RFC 10 conform backbones eliminate one cloning step needed for the expression and thus the characterization of a newly BioBricked protein. Version number 30 was claimed for the high copy variants and version number 50 for the low copy variants.
High copy BioBrick expression backbone:
pSB1A30 (Part:BBa_K1362091): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Amp resistance
pSB1C30 (Part:BBa_K1362092): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Cm resistance
pSB1K30 (Part:BBa_K1362093): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Kan resistance
pSB1T30 (Part:BBa_K1362094): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Tet resistance
Low copy BioBrick expression backbone:
pSB4A50 (Part:BBa_K1362095): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Amp resistance
pSB4C50 (Part:BBa_K1362096): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Cm resistance
pSB4K50 (Part:BBa_K1362097): High copy BioBrick cloning/expression backbone carrying Kan resistance
Because of the great experience we had using our expression vectors, we sent them to the iGEM team Aachen and Tuebingen. We helped them solving their problems with the expression of their products.

Presence of Aspergillus and its toxins represent a huge loss in the world production and in the food production income. (Abbas et al 2005)             Aflatoxins present important food safely problems in both developed and developing countries. Contamination is monitored in developed countries using enzyme‐linked immunusorbent assay (ELISA) ‐and high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)‐based assays, both of which may be too expensive for routine use in many developing countries. There is a need for inexpensive alternative approaches to detect aflatoxins in lots of foods and feeds.             When ruminants are feed with food that has been contaminated with type B and G aflatoxins, these are metabolized end excreted through milk as type M1 and M2 aflatoxins. (Abbas, Hamed K. Aflotoxin and Food Safety. Boca Raton: Taylor & Francis Group, 2005)             The International agency for cancer research (IARC) has reported that aflatoxins from type B1 and M1 as possible human carcinogénics. (Food Tems and Constituents, Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines and Mycotoxins. Vol. 56, 1997) Both United States and European Union regulations on the MRL for M1 type aflatoxins of products that derive from milk establish a limit of 0.05mg of aflatoxins per Kg of sample.              Formal studies that involved the presence of M1 type aflatoxins in Mexico where done from 1990 to 1998. Until in 2008, when a research group from the Metropolitan Autonomous University at Xochimilco (UAM) quantified the presence of M1 type aflatoxins in raw, organic and ultra pasteurized milk that was produced in the mexican high plateau. Their results showed that the 59.1% of the tested milk contained dangerous levels of the M1 type afl"

Finally the fusion protein is dialysed and concentrated. 4.5mL of sample (MonoQ chromatography elution fraction 2-10 of fusion protein) were dialysed according to the purification protocol with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5).
Protein Purification - Concentration
After dialysis, 4.5mL of sample of fusion protein was concentrated to a final volume of 0.6mL and  stored at -20℃, according to the purification protocol.
In order to analyse the concentrated fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Concentration: 8% SDS PAGE of fusion (expected size 214.7kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 Crude lysate, lane 3 final fusion post concentration 9uL, lane 4 final fusion post concentration 4.5uL, lane 5 final fusion post concentration 2.25uL.
Trace amounts of contaminating background was observed, however, the fusion was significantly more in quantity and the background was tolerated for functionality testing. The final concentration of the solution was determined according to the BCA protocol and resulted in a concentration of 0.57mg/mL (2.64µM).

Model of Biosensor
Abstract
As we all know, it is difficult to detect macromolecules with synthetic biological methods. The hardest problem is that it is difficult for macromolecules to enter the gene machine - cell body, that leads to follow-up work out of the question. For this problem, we propose a model that replaces the substance with another substance. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the substance that our project wants to detect, but alpha-fetoprotein is a macromolecule and is difficult to enter the body of engineering bacteria. So we use lysine, an easily detectable substance, to establish a mathematical relationship with our target concentration to detect the concentration of AFP indirectly.
If we can prove that the amount of lysine separated at different AFP concentrations is different, then we can prove that our project is feasible. At the same time the aim of our project is detection, if the lysine detection quantity has linear relationship with AFP concentration, then our project will have obvious advantages in detection.
Introduction
We divided the modeling part of the sensor work into two steps: First, AFP and aptamer combined, so leading to hydrogen bond fracture process. Second, lysine molecules and DNA complementary strand separate.
As the picture shows：
In order to simplify the model, we explore the ideal conditions and put forward the following assumptions:
1、Lysine is coupled with complementary strand 1:1.
2、AFP  binds to aptamer 1:1.
3、The first step is that AFP binds with the aptamer and the second step is that lysine with the complementary strand complex separate in the time and space. The time is recorded as t1 and t2.
The first step
AFP has a good affinity with the aptamer. This conclusion has been proved through the experiment and the specific content can be seen in Design-biosensor part. A large number of literatures show that the affinity of proteins with aptamers is much greater than that of hydrogen bonds. When AFP binds to aptamers, it will result in a hydrogen bond breakage between the aptamer and DNA. Thus releasing lysine and DNA complementary complex, we referred to as Complex.
This process can be seen as a base reaction, which follows the law of mass action. So the reaction rate V can be expressed as following.
k1 refers to the rate constant, [AFP"

Vincent PCR purified the pSB3K1-extended (no TetR) for use in the Gibsons and negative controls.
The Gibson assembly of J6-Plac-Lysis had produced a single colony. Vincent colony-PCRed it using two different sets of primers to amplify subportions of the lysis cassette. The first set of primers (30-f & 816-r) amplify an 800 bp piece whereas the second set (Seq-J6-RFP-f & Seq-J6-RFPlysis-r) amplifies a 1100 bp piece.
The gel seems to confirm that lysis is in the plasmid. We will send the plasmid for sequencing on Friday.
After taking a closer look at the plate from the platereader, it seems that none of the T7 variants did any lysing. This realization made it urgent that we discover whether or not the full T4-lysis cassette was really in these Gibson-assembled plasmids. The samples that had been sent in for sequencing had primers that seemed to amplify the backbone, instead of the lysis cassette. While this does not"

Marburg,2015,Team:Marburg#Minicells_-_-_TEXT.html," proof of non propagating of the minicells
Purification
We were able to separate minicells from the parental strain with a purification of 98.8%. After non-successful efforts to separate the minicells by differential centrifugation, we developed our own purification method. We established a protocol with combination of different filter systems – first to exclude parental cells followed by a concentration process. Plating our concentrated cells indicates that there is only a slight background contamination with the parental cells. We will further improve this method in the future.

flow cytometry  in the overnight culture and after the purification.
Production of nutrients
Figure 7: Production of β-carotene
Here we can show that the minicell producing strain TB43 can be altered synthesize β-carotene. To determine the production of nutrients in our strain TB43, we successfully optimized the plasmid, encoding the necessary genes for the biosynthesis of β-carotene ( BBa_K1650010 ).  In Fig.7 we show that β-carotene, which is of orange color, is expressed, when a culture of TB43- β-carotene is plated. This leads us to the assumption that also the minicells produced by the TB43-β-carotene strain contain the wanted micronutrients.
Figure 8: Design of the biosynthesis
Induction of minicells
We can prove that the minicells can react to an inducer with the production of a fluorescent protein. By using an inducible promoter (pLAC) that controls a fluorescent protein (RFP), we could follow the production of RFP in time-laps fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 9). Our results show that non-fluorescent minicells became fluorescent after induction. This result demonstrates that minicells are can perform protein-biosynthesis and are able respond upon induction.  Although most of the minicells only became fluorescent after induction, some cells constitutively expressed RFP, likely due to stochastic distribution of repressor molecules.

Finally, we see the FORTE electrode can surpass in selectivity the FINE electrode. The FORTE electrode is a great example of an electrode we could use for our device.
Thus, thanks to this example, we understand that it is possible to develop our own type of electrode. We gathered a lot of different information. First, having a good electrical model of the nerve is crucial to understand what are the parameters we need to take into account to develop our electrode. Moreover, it is primordial in order to be able to simulate the performance of an electrode. We now know that different algorithms that improve the output signal of an electrode already exist. We would like to test and use such algorithms for our device. Finally, thanks to the example of the FORTE electrode, we have already thought about how it will be possible to incorporate such an electrode in our device.

LALF (Anti-LPS)
As we know, seawater is a virtual ""bacterial soup"". Typical near-shore areas that form the prime habitat of the horseshoe crab can easily contain over one billion Gram-negative bacteria per milliliter of seawater. Thus, the horseshoe crab is constantly threatened with infection. Unlike mammals, including humans, the horseshoe crab lacks an immune system; it cannot develop antibodies to fight infection. However, the horseshoe crab does contain a number of compounds that will bind to and inactivate bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Anti-LPS factors that are synthesized in the blood cells of crab are part of this primitive ""immune"" system.
Lots of horseshoe crabs are collected by some manufacture companies and their blood is extracted in some laboratories. During the extraction process, up to 30% of the animal's blood is removed. Research has shown that once returned to the water, the horseshoe crab's blood volume rebounds in about a week. But, it is also noted that a number of crabs which cannot be undervalued are also dying during the process.
                                        
In our project, we aim to produce those factors by using the synthetic biology. In this way, we can obtain them without extracting blood and hurting any crab. Additionally, the possible medication will be gathered cheaper.
In our project, mainly we study on a protein that is gathered from horseshoe crab (limulus polyphemus), limulus anti lipopolysaccharide factor (LALF). By the help of this protein, we planned to stop bacteria growth in vitro situations. 
                                                               
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is the major mediator of septic shock, a serious complication of Gram-negative bacterial infections in humans. Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor ("

We had a freewheeling talk with the iGEM team of Northeastern University, because of this talk,  we later had opportunities to collaborate with them in experiments.
AUGHST, 26
Many suggestions that we received from other teams are of value, so we further improved our design after coming back. Besides, we built close cooperation with UESTC-China since we both used the tobacco.
OCTOBER, 7
We trained ourselves through telling others our story, and they fed back what they were interested in or what they could not figure out, and all these information helped us discover many defects in our presentation.
Human Practice Summary
We engaged with stakeholders as well as experts,and did field study etc., which as a whole helped us to design and improve our project.
We consider the safety problem and interviewed the officials about bio-safety legislation. New designs and changes occurred after we made a trip to the tobacco company. Also, we made a lot of connection with public, especially teenagers, through activities like garden party, open house day, project-related computer game and so on. What's more, we joined in some meetings with other participants.
We saw the current condition and problem, and made dialogues with professors and common people to got useful advice. Then, we made new things(like our VOC device) and confirmed one direction of our project. Through the project process, human practice helped us throw light on public issues and make efforts to solve the practical problem.

Operation  ECHO | Collaboration with other teams
Operation ECHO, by Tsinghua-A Team
More Details
During the season, we will dedicate in pursuing the goal of the construction of a biological oscillator, which we call ‘ECHO’, the abbreviation of ‘the E.Coli Homochronous Oscillator’.
With two Escherichia coli populations expressing gene one after another, they give red and green fluorescent light alternately. E.coli populations communicate bi-directionally by a class of signaling molecules involves in bacteria quorum sensing, that is, N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), to regulate the gene expression of each other. By engineering their gene circuits, two groups (name as CELL-A and CELL-B) will form a network, with B inducing A and A restricting B, thus able to realize oscillation. A mechanism is set up to change the rate of an AHL expression, allowing us to control the period and the phase of the oscillatory cycle.
What’s more, we establish a mathematical model to analyze the dynamics of the system, and computer simulation software is introduced into the process. The comparison between the wet lab experiment and the simulating outcome contributes to a contemplated and well-planned designation of our project.

Taking as reference a medium-size protein (40 kDA)  which moves with a speed of 5 nm per ms, the program only runs this thousand steps if the constant-time values 1000. If the number decrease, the simulation loss realism but it will run much faster, which could be interesting if we are interested in obtain just a more qualitative comprehension of the system.
The slider cell-cycle-length gives us the length of a cell cycle, by default 30 minutes.The button divide-cells? allows us to eliminate half of the repressors and RNAs in a randomly way every cell-cycle.
Controling the division cell process
Under the title of Actions, the user can interact with the simulation in real time. This way, the user can toggle the bistable switch between the two possible states. For convenience, we have taken as “On” the state in which the protein LacI has a high concentration in the cell. To turn off the bistable we have to release a high concentration of IPTG and be patient. We have to give enough time to the simulation, because the RNA must be transcribed to produce after this the protein c1ts and the RNA, and free LacI  proteins must disappear.
Controls to turn off the bistable
To turn on the bistable, we only have to increase the temperature. The temperature-effect gives us how many times faster grows old the protein c1ts. We can see that it is rather easier to turn the bistable on than to turn it off.
Controls to turn on the bistable
The show-view button allows us to turn-off the simulation window, although the plots and the monitor will carry on actualizing. To turn-off the view enables the simulation to run much faster, so it is strongly recommended.
The program also allows to export data to a .csv file with the name Simulation data, and it is saved in the root folder where is saved the simulation. It is recommended that if you want to use the simulation to produce data the program must be open from the .nlogo file.
The simulation represents the concentration of RNAs and repressors in the plot. Moreover, we can see in the monitors the amount of molecules of every kind, how many repressors can be found repressing, how many repressors with kind 1 are bound to IPTG and the temperature.

Project
Overview - E. motion
As a part of Policy & Practices project, we conducted a survey on people’s attitudes toward genetic engineering. The results showed that the general public does not feel familiar not only with genetic engineering but also with science. So we designed our project in order to change this for the better.
What can we do to make science more appealing to everyone? One of the solutions for us was to harmonize science with arts. You may say that science is incompatible with arts. But KIT actually constitutes of science and arts majors embodying a fusion of them, as its philosophy posits ""Wisdom, Beauty and Technology."" Our project fused science and arts in a KIT way. With the help of E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and C. elegans, we decided to use not only color but also scent and MOTION, as the new elements to enliven the artwork livelier. Please enjoy it.

We performed the characterization process same as what we did with RIOT sensors 1-3 in milestone 6.
RIOT sensors 4-6 did not show much improvement compared to sensors 1-3. They are also leaky and hence, not suitable to be integrated into the whole system.
RIOT sensors 7-9 showed encouraging results since they were more sensitive to small changes in lactate concentration.
After evaluating the sensitivity to lactate of each combination of promoter and ribosomal binding site (RBS), we chose the weak RBS to synthesize RIOT sensor 10 and 11 which contain sfGFP in place of Alanine Racemase to make them become a potential diagnostic device to detect pathogenic cells.

spisPink & amilGFP optimized to Escherichia coli K12
After completing the insertion of gBlocks (IDT) designed (spisPink and amilGFP), into the plasmid pSB1C3, by following the relevant protocols; competent cells were successfully transformed and consequently the removal of plasmids (spisPink into pSB1C3) BBa_K1684000 and (amilGFP into pSB1C3) BBa_K1684001 was performed.
The Figure 6 presents a 1% agarose gel which contains two samples, by triplicate, next to the ladder. In line 1, 2 and 3 are located the triplicate samples of spisPink piece, optimized for E. coli K12 (BBa_K1684000), with a size of 2789 bp. Likewise on the line 4,5 and 6 are repeated samples of the piece amilGFP optimized for E. coli K12 (BBa_K1684001). For both BioBricks, the electrophoresis results correspond to the theoretical size, greater than 2500 bp and less than 3000 bp; also it can be seen that there is no variation between samples, replicas, indicating the reliability of E. coli K12 transformations.

Experimental data
After the sequencing confirmation, we collected the data every hour for ten hours and the fluorescence and OD600 of the liquid cultures were measured using a plate reader. For we did not use the sunlight sensor as our input source, we used tetracycline which inhibits TetR repression at the beginning. Chart.1, Chart.2 and Figure.1 Show the fluorescence and OD600 data. We can notice that the tendency of chart.1 and chart.2 is similar and fit the tendency of a normal E.coli.
Discussion
Why we did not use the sunlight sensor as our input source anymore?
Before further experiment, we needed to ensure all the parts that we would use were in order. Therefore, we conducted a PCR for all the parts that we used after the propagation of the plasmid which are in 2015 distribution kit by transforming them into E.coli. Besides, we sent out samples of all plasmids for the sequencing. Afterwards, we performed a sequence alignment between the sequencing result and the sequence which is provided by the registry. However, we only found one third of the sequence matched the official sequence in the UVR8-TetR sequencing result. Therefore, we decided to change an input source.
How did our circuit work without the sunlight sensor?
We decided to use the toggle switch by using tetracycline as an input. In the toggle switch, tetR protein represses promote tet, and tetracycline inhibits this repression so that promoter tet works. With CI protein inhibiting pcI and tetR protein being unable to inhibit promoter tet, the toggle switch is switched to YFP state. As our data above shows, yellow fluorescence goes up.
Doesn't tetracycline kill your bacteria?
To prevent this, the promoter tet-RBS-CI-RBS-YFP-terminator circuit is constructed in tetracycline resistance plasmid backbone.
How to explain the difference between simulation and experiment data?
We can see fluctuation in the data of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th hour. This may be caused by random error of the plate reader. The data curve went more steadily from 5th to 8th hour than the simulate one. That's because we only used one tube of culture for measurement. Every time we took out 200μ culture for measurement, some of the bacteria were lost, and the growth of the bacterial was also paused for a moment due to the low temperature. This influence is especially obvious in the first few hours, but the two curves would finally be closer to each other"

The year just passed witnessed the vigorous gcolumnth of her, which was due to the learning and working experience with iGEM team members.
While she used to be quiet and nervous, experience in iGEM really changed her a lot. Now, she has been more outgoing and warm-hearted, and never afraid to face challenges and difficulties.
She still enjoys reading and traveling alone, but becomes more open to new friends and new ideas.
Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!

NTHU_Formosa,2018,Team:NTHU Formosa#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Wings Medical, a very successful award-winning biotech wearables startup.
While Singular Wings Medical was very impressed with our innovative idea, several interesting and important concerns and useful advice was proposed during the discussion.
Why watch?
It’s true that watch is not the only available option for bioluminescence detecting devices.As Singular Wings Medical suggested, manufacturing a portable handy bioluminescence detector for our project is a way easier approach than trying to alter current                 smartwatches or come up with a new brand of watch to compete with the existing smartwatches on the market.
We totally agree that, at the developing stage of a company, launching a portable device instead of smartwatch will become great help to the company’s finance. However, the idea of BioWatcher was partly inspired by smartwatches and we are still aiming                 at this incredibly huge wearable markets. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), PMR and Gartner, in 2017 alone, there are 121.7 million shipments in the wearable market, in which smartwatches took up half of the shipments. The                 predicted 2017-2021 CAGR of smartwatches and wristband combined is up to 24.9%, while their predicted 2021 market share is 89.7%, the highest among all wearables. ""Smartwatches are on pace to achieve the greatest revenue potential among                 all wearables through 2021, reaching $17.4 billion,"" said Angela McIntyre, research director at Gartner. All in all, we are targeting a vast market and, hopefully, we can bring BioWatcher to real life.
Being a successful startup owner, the manager of Singular Wing Medical, Mr. Lee, generously share his experience in starting a company. Transforming lab experiments into real product need to take up dozens of years. Even after we overcome                 all the biotechnology and ethic issues, hardware development will spend us quite a while.
Therefore, he encouraged us to make plans gradually-- before our whole non-invasive real-time report blood test system become mature, we can take a step back by developing an improved and optimized blood test system and devices in the                 current diagnostic industry, such as micro-measurements or electrochemistry approach, to support the startup when developing our ultimate goal—BioWatcher.
We greatly appreciated this chance to learn a lot about the experience from a successful senior and we hope to have more discussion and mentor in terms of entrepreneurship.
Presentation skill is one of the most crucial parts of promoting ideas and attracting corporate sponsors. Before the meeting ended, the importance of delivering a good presentation is emphasized many times."

We didn’t have enough time to order and clone this gene so we didn’t continue to do this part’s experiments.
AI-2Sensitive Promoter and LsrR
We got the results of Lsr promoter part from 2013 ATOMS iGEM team. Their results are shown below.
Inducible promoter experiment
To observe inducible promoters response, we co incubated two different bacteria. The first bacteria culture is expressing enzyme system and the second culture is including inducible promoter. At the experiment, we incubated them seperately for 16 hours and mixed them into one flask and 4 hour later, we add 0,1 mM SAH (with 10x PBS containing %1 BSA). Incubate with SAH for one day and, took 2 ml of liquid culture to santrifuge tube.Centrifuged it. We saw the red color at the pellet as you see below.
So, it means the enzyme system is working and inducible promoter is succesfully induced from AI-2.
Toehold-Trigger RNA-GFP
PSB1C3-Toehold-GFP/Trigger RNA CLONING
We cloned these two IDT G-Block genes into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and TnrA-pAlst-RFP G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, Toehold-GFP’s band should be at 1294 bp line and Trigger RNA’s should be at 443.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check as a second control of cloning. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

This is our last day of summer vacation, and we had this meeting to conclude our work in the summer.
For the part of the experiment, we searched out the target anaerobic promoters from documents and iGEM official website, and extracted the plasmids we wanted from bacteria strains or through strains PCR.  However, we did have some problems during the experiments.  The main problems among all are:
1. unsuccessful electric transformation,
2. failure in separating PCR products and primer dimers when extracting plasmids,
3. troubles like low recycle rate of gel, mistakes in electrophoresis spotting, and no separating bands in electrophoresis that repeatedly occurred during the process.
For the wiki part, we have outlined the structure of the website but have difficulty in linking to iGEM official website.  Thanks to our teammates' careful records on experiments, the contents of the wiki are well prepared.
School days will begin tomorrow, and we will not be able to continue our experiments like we did in the vacation.  Therefore, we rescheduled our plan for the experiments.  Because our laboratory is in Gulou Campus, experiments in weekdays are in the charge of the teammates living in tGulou Campus, while teammates living in Xianlin Campus will help with the experiments in the weekends to ensure the process of the experiments.  Meanwhile, teammates in Xianlin Campus will prepare for the contents for our wiki.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

6.Survey
With the aim of helping people understand solid tumors and synthetic biology, we did a survey with related questions in August 2016.Among 179 people completing the questionnaire, about 79% of them were between 18~30 years old, and most of them have bachelor’s degrees. However, most of them knew almost nothing about solid tumors.
6.Survey
Besides, more than half of them knew nothing about the therapies to treat solid tumors and only 10% of them know something about novel therapies, such as immunotherapy or therapies with the assistance of modified microbes. To the potential application of synthetic biology in the treatment of solid tumors, people’s opinions were uncertain.
6.Survey
Because their knowledge about solid tumors and the new achievements was very limited, many people worried the behavior of the microbes inside human body. They thought that it was difficult to control the proliferation of microbes in vivo, which might cause some side effects. Many people held the belief that there were many other severe problems that remained unknown if the microbes were introduced into human bodies. Some people also thought that the efficacy of using protein drugs to cure solid tumors was limited.
In conclusion, even in the well-educated population, the knowledge of solid tumors was not widespread. About curing solid tumors by the means of synthetic biology, many people questioned the risk of the introduction of bacteria into the bodies and the efficiency of this approach. We could learn from the results that it is important to raise public awareness of the threat of solid tumors, and it will be very helpful if we could promote the public interest in curing solid tumors with the aids of synthetic biology.
7.Social Network Platforms
WeChat and Twitter
Though social network platforms, such as Wechat and Twitter, we shared our experience and enthusiasm with others. By recording the on-going events, we shared our failure or success and everybody could look at our growth. Sometimes we posted our lab-notes and our efforts in laboratory can be seen by our fans. We also promoted external communication, interacted with other iGEM Groups. Most importantly, we used these platforms for educational purposes. With our fan page, people who are interested in our project and the iGEM competition can follow us all the time. By doing that, they can learn basic information of synthetic biology, and get further knowledge in frontiers of this field.
Our fans give us support and encouragement, and they make our promotions no end at all. When operating these platforms, we saw a lot of support or accompany from our fans. Each response is the hopes, and they make us to know that there is always"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", since it can have unpredictable consequences on its own or after mutation several generations later (47–50).
After reviewing several kill switch systems by the group of J.J. Collins at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (47) and the group of G.M. Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston (51) and others, we decided that one of two kill switches designed by the group of P.A. Silver at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School in Boston (52) would be a great addition to our project to restrain function of our GMOs outside of the dextran hydrogel. In contrast to the kill switch proposed by professor Jan van Hest, these kill switches do not rely on artificial amino acids. This makes them significantly cheaper (53).
Stirling et al. describe the type II toxin-antitoxin system CcdA and CcdB (52). CcdA is the antitoxin of CcdB, which can be inhibited by direct binding to CcdA. The CcdB protein is toxic to E. coli because it inhibits a part of DNA gyrase (a type II topoisomerase), which is essential for survival.
Stirling et al. include a bistable switch system of bacteriophage lambda in this toxin-antitoxin system consisting of proteins cI and Cro. The combination of a simple toxin-antitoxin system with this switch functioning as a memory element increases the amount of bacterial generations the switch survives before being shut down by any kind of DNA modification. They experimentally showed that several candidate strains of bacteria could retain their kill switch system for approximately 140 generations (48).
This retainment is very impressive and would be an interesting addition to our engineered E. coli. The lengths to which the kill switch remains active enables our E. coli to have a reliable system for several days. This time span comes close to the period we want to realistically apply our patch on wounds for.
The future of our living material
In our iGEM project, we demonstrated our living material as a useful platform for wound healing. However, we envision our living material to be a much broader platform useful for a range of applications. Living materials have the potential to perform extraordinary functions. We invite future iGEM teams to use our platform for their own creative applications. Team Hamburg has already investigated our hydrogel for their own project. We hope that more applications will follow!

CCU_Taiwan,2017,Team:CCU Taiwan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,", we invited Mr. Uily to discuss with us the development of the device. In the course of the discussion, we learned about many of the products on the market, and did an in-depth analysis and discussion of the relevant products. We absorbed the relevant advantages of those production, and applied the knowledge to our products, help to improve our product planning structure. On the other hand, we also invited National Yunlin University of Science and Technology Professor Zhong-guang Chen to teach us about the establishment of product business model design, and help us in the subsequent commercialization of the product.
Description of Value Proposition
Although the target group mentioned above is metropolitan national primary schools, in fact the real end users are children, so we expanded our understanding of the oral status of small children by asking a dentist who is the Managing Director of Taiwan Oral Care Association and really cared about children’s dental health.
At first, we did not understand the importance of the deciduous teeth. After asking the physician how a child's deciduous teeth compared to adults, we got the information that most children's oral condition is divided into two parts, one is the deciduous teeth and other one is permanent teeth. The deciduous teeth are small and also relatively thin, so the nerve tube is proportionally thicker. If a child gets a cavity, it will hurt immediately. If the deciduous teeth are not deal with, it will also affect the growth of permanent teeth in the future. Additionally, as we mentioned above, children are afraid to see the dentist, they always don’t inform their parents till they feel the pain, which might be too late.
Therefore, the value of our products is to help parents and the schools in advance to understand the children's oral condition about tooth decay risk, reduce unnecessary pain and follow-up costs in the future.

We exchanged ideas with                         researcher Yuan Huiming. Researcher Yuan said that the main problem in urine testing is to                         eliminate interference from other proteins in the urine. The nanobody of β2-microglobulin we                         selected is more specific and can solve this problem well. On the other hand, our liquid crystal                         detection method has extremely high sensitivity and has great advantages for the detection of                         trace proteins in urine.
This exchange allowed us to see the achievability and practical application of our project from                         the aspect of technical application. It also let us have confidence in our projects.

This year, our project researches the issues of the field sobriety test. We visited the judges, the policemen, the wine tasters, and the health care workers, who we considered as experts who may give us advice. Surveys were designed for the public concerning the breathalyzer test. We also met iGEM teams (NCTU, NTHU, CGU) and attended 2016 iGEM Asian Conference to exchange project ideas and share experience. In addition, a biotech company, BIONIME corp., provided us with technical supports. This page particularly presents our efforts concerning the Human Practices events.
Scenario: One day, a man drove lively on the road after eating lychees. Suddenly, he lost his control and his car bumped into the tree on the sideway. And he fell into a coma. For a while, a police officer came up and asked him to take a sobriety test. It turned out that he exceeded the legal alcohol limit in a breathalyzer test. He felt upset and decided to take action. How could we help him prove that he was innocent?
After researching news concerning the field sobriety test, we found many debates against the breathalyzer test such as individual metabolic differences, diabetes, refusals, people dead or in coma. We studied the principle behind the test and believed that there’s a way more reliable. Therefore, we went to the judges in the court, the police officers in the police station, the health care workers in the hospital and the wine tasters in a working place to discuss the issues and seek for opinions. We also designed a questionnaire to survey the public about their experience in the sobriety test. On campus, we educated the younger schoolmates with biotech skills and engaged the school’s teachers to experience the breathalyzer test. To connect iGEM community, we met teams hosted by NCTU-Formosa and attended the Asian conference held by NCKU-Tainan that provided us opportunities to exchange ideas and share experience. To work with iGEMers, we collaborated with NCTU-Formosa and helped them to confirm a function of one of their BioBrick parts. To develop IGEM BLOOD AL"

As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions, it is a important project but not the last project of my engineering life, I wish I would develop more and more softwares in future.

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," detection that the operon had been transformed.
Week commencing: 23/07/2018
The long-awaited Pseudomonas sp. arrived this week, having come all the way from Germany,  meaning our iGEM team could start preparation for the transformation process. The team worked with  Dr Montero-Calasanz to make initial agar and liquid cultures in both LB and TS mediums and now  have enough bacteria to start the initial transformation experiments.
This week the some of the parts for the hardware arrived meaning we could get underway with the  construction of the hydroponics. First the basic circuit for the LED lights was created, the code  we used to control these lights was an adaptation of a freely available library (FastLED) which can  be found online. We made minor adjustments to suit our requirements, for example the  light intensity was increased. Our micro-controller (Arduino), was then loaded with  this edited code. This device will be responsible for monitoring and maintaining our entire  system. We faced issues with timing the lights for a 16 hour day and 8 hour night cycle.  We decided to use a ‘count’ within a loop to control when the LED’s need to be turned off.  This meant we had to calibrate for the time a single loop took and multiply that up for  16 hours. We are currently waiting for some parts to arrive so that we can begin construction of an automated switching circuit.
The week was rounded off with a presentation to the stakeholders in the project, such as the PI's  and instructors, to provide an update on how the project has progressed thus far. The presentation also offered a valuable opportunity to highlight areas of the project that needed to be strengthened and was a good opportunity to develop our presentation skills prior to the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Week commencing: 30/07/2018
This week we managed to get off campus and talk to potential stakeholders. We were lucky enough to arrange an interview with GrowModule 365. As a company, they produce shipping containers that contain hydroponics systems. There concept adopts a new approach to farming, allowing crop production in unconventional places. The visit allowed us to see how traditional farming is being challenged and gain an insight into hydroponics systems. We gained lots of useful information from the meeting; we learned which wavelengths are most effective for increased yields, the alternative growing mediums available, the markets perception to innovative farming and which control parameters are most important. Paul Brown (Director) gave us lots of useful contacts within the industry and seemed very passionate about our project, however he"

""What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal.""
Our aim is to construct a transducer system that is able to efficiently recognise free ligands inside the blood to activate downstream reporter in real time. The SynNotch and CAR systems have all been proved potential for cell therapy, while both of them are limited to cell-surface antigens. That’s why we finally chose another new synthetic system, namely the Modular Extracellular Sensors Architecture, as our transducer framework, and the main part of our STEP system.
This cell membrane receptor consists of two chains, one chain of transcription factor (TC) and one of protease (PC). The two chains are in a free state under normal circumstances, but will dimerize in the presence of the ligands. Once these two chains get close the protease on the PC chain can cleave the peptide linker between the transcription factor and the transmembrane domain of the TC chain, then the transcription factor can be released into the cytoplasm to activate the reporter (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Basic theory of STEP system.
It is obvious that the extracellular domain can literally be any kinds of protein that can bind to the tumour markers, including natural receptors or binding domains as well as antibodies and scFvs. Two different binding domains can be used to recognise different sites of the ligand, while identical domains can also be used for dimers. Considering the accessibility of ligands and sequences, we decided to use the two dimers, VEGF and D-Dimer, as our targets for the demonstration of our system, one for broad-spectrum cancer targeting while the other for NSCLC. And as a consequence we are allowed to use the same binding domain for both TC and PC chains.
For VEGF recognition, we selected one of its single-chain variable fragment (scFv) as the extracellular domain of our receptors. The only V"

Finding the relative Kds of our      aptamers with thrombin in terms of RFU
We spotted on an epoxy-coated glass slide different concentrations of Cy5-labeled Thrombin aptamer 1 and Cy3-labeled Thrombin aptamer 2, ranging from 2 μM to 0.2 μM, for MITOMI experiments. Cy3 and Cy5 labeled DNA oligos were again used as negative controls. Both aptamers were      resuspended and incubated for 1 hour to obtain a saturation binding curve.      As expected, the fluorescent signal increases with aptamer concentration.
After data analysis, we obtain two hyperbolic saturation binding curve      (Fig. 2a and 2b). The best statistical model was found to be a simple one-binding site model ($E_{max}$ model): $y_i = \frac{B \times x_i}{K_d + x_i} + \epsilon_i$ with $i \in \{ 1,...,N\} $.
$x_i$ denotes the aptamer concentration in solution, $y_i$ the aptamer-protein complex  concentration and $N$ the number of observations. The residual errors are assumed  to be identically and independently distributed $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ .

Sandwich assay with our Thrombin aptamers   1 and 2 in buffer
The Thrombin aptamer 1 is now biotinylated rather than Cy5 labeled, enabling it to be fixed to the surface. To begin the biotinylated aptamer 1 was flown, then human thrombin in half of the chip and finally the whole chip was covered with Cy3 thrombin aptamer 2. As expected, a signal in the button area was observed in the region containing containing the first aptamer, thrombin and the second Cy3 labeled aptamer. Washing steps were done   with PBS and Aptamer Binding buffer (ABB, cf. protocols).

SMITe - The Concept: Background
Biofilms
With both chronic wounds and the variety of bacterial resistance mechanisms in our minds we were concerned about using traditional bactericidal approaches to aid chronic wound healing, which often stumble into one of two pitfalls:
a largely unspecific effect which risks to further aggravate the wound [3]
a limited efficacy on chronic wounds from the very start and / or decreasing efficacy during the course of the treatment [4]
So instead, iGEM Stockholm decided to focus on a prominent feature of many chronic wounds – the biofilm.
Biofilms are complex extracellular structures generated by a variety of bacteria as a self-protection mechanism and are often increased in response to stress such as antibiotic treatment. [5] They are essential in supporting bacteria when they adopt a ‘sessile’ lifestyle in the form of chronic colonization; they interfere with inflammation meant to rid the wound of bacteria, help the bacteria attach and detach from the wound surface as the infection progresses and have been found to contribute to quicker development of antibiotic resistance. [6] [7]
The components of biofilms differ among bacterial species but many of them have been found to serve a specific purpose. Three structures observed commonly in different biofilms are expolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and a variety of biofilm-associated proteins.
The vital role that biofilm plays in persistent infections provides a solid rationale for making them our primary target.
Figure 1: Overview of typical structure of biofilms
The above image depicts the pillar-shaped structure biofilms often adapt, with a distinct distribution of components in different sections of the pillars.
Three major components of many biofilms - extracellular DNA, expolysaccharides and a range of proteins - not only serve their own specific purposes, but also interact with each other to fortify the structure of the biofilm.

Week 16
Monday October 1st
With classes started, it is getting hard for us to come in and keep track of what is going on. We are working on the wiki as well today, as there is much information that must go on the website before the wiki freeze. We also had some of our last constructs sequenced, analyzed and prepared to send to the registry.
Tuesday October 2nd
We spent a large amount of time developing the wiki further, as the wiki freeze is approaching. We also took PET samples that were incubated with our strain, and weighed out the masses. Our data shows generally expected results, although we still need to furthermore fully characterize the results in order to effectively say our enzyme works. We also finalized our shipment and sent in our parts to the registry!
Wednesday October 3rd
Today centered around finalizing the wiki for the wiki freeze at 9:00. Hope everything goes well!

•   To correlate people’s attitude towards gene editing with educational background.
 Survey Design 
In order to obtain meaningful results, we invested great effort to design our survey questions and methodology to minimize the biases it may introduce. As such, we first established the following before our start.
Goal
Determine public awareness, concerns, and acceptance towards use of gene editing and therapy.
Covering letter
Cover letter provides information about the survey and get informed consent from the respondents.
 Approach
Both interpersonal collection in outreach events as well as digital collection through Google Form.
 Minimizing Bias
We formed and evaluated the following matrix of criteria, taking necessary steps to minimize the potential bias in our survey and ensures the validity of our survey results.
1. Neutral Wording
Words that carry connotations or emotions are avoided. Scientific definitions given where necessary.
2. No Leading Questions
Incorporate Likert-scale questions where possible. [1]  Open-ended question given to allow discussion.
3. Readability
Tested with Dale-Chall Readability Formula, Gunning Fog Index, and Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test [2] , all show a tenth grade level.
4. Random Sampling
Distributed online and social media for anyone to fill in. Not limited to the people around us.
5. Anonymity
Name or contact information is not collected and individual answer is not published.
6. Appropriate Length
Able to be completed just over three minutes.
 
7. Demographic at the end
Demographic questions are intrusive, and may affect answers by reminding social status. [3]
8. iGEM Past-Examples
Researched on the past studies in iGEM. Wording checks by Harvard Survey Research Tip Sheet [4] .
9. Pilot test
Pilot test of 30 samples conducted in NJC outreach to validate our survey. Results were not used.
After our own evaluation, we then consulted Prof Rosenthal from Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University [5] to confirm the validity of the above criteria and our survey.  He is an expert in the field of public understanding of science and research methodology. He gave us valuable feedback on how to further improve the survey questions such as fine-tuning some of the phrasing and organization of the entire survey.  Here shows a sample of our survey should you become a participant.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

BBa_K2053000  (for Bronze medal): T. pseudonana silaffin kinase (tpSTK1)
Thalassiosira pseudonana silaffin kinase (tpSTK1) is a central BioBrick part. It was described as an efficient diatom silaffin-phosphorylating enzyme [1]. Since it was shown that phosphorylation of silaffins increased their biosilification activity [2], we hypothesized that phosphorylation of silica-binding peptide from our fusion protein would increase its biosilification properties. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.
BBa_K2053002 (for Silver medal) : Fusion Si4-cellulose-binding domain-B domain protein A
In order to functionalize a cellulose-based patch into a biodetection device we designed and created a fusion protein by assembling three parts: the phage displayed silica-binding peptide (Si4) [3],  the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CBPa) [4], and the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (BpA) [5]. This fusion protein is used to bind to cellulose-based patch, increase its rigidity by biosilification, and make it a detection device by fixing Fc fragment of specific antibodies. We used preexisting iGEM BioBrick parts that we assembled thanks to commonly used flexible linkers [6]. To facilitate protein purification, we added a HisTag. To remove the HisTag, we separated the HisTag from the sequence by the TEV cleavage site sequence.
Fusion cellulose-binding domain of CBP-B domain of protein A (for Gold medal)
We improved previously existing BBa_K863110 and BBa_K103003 BioBricks parts by combining them, creating one part. It is a fusion protein between the Clostridium cellulovorans cellulose-binding domain of cellulose-binding protein A (CB"

The experimentation session took place with students from the the high school of Langevin-wallon in Champigny sur Marne with the help of their teachers Laurent Martorell and Celine Barreto. At the beginning, we asked students if they knew about MOOCs, but none of them did.
After we presented our MOOC, their feedbacks were rather positive. The fact of interacting with teachers through digital way didn’t repel them, and they would be willing to incorporate MOOCs in their daily courses. However, most of them admitted that they would be less efficient if they had to follow courses without a rigid framework encouraging them to work; as provided by school. Indeed, a MOOC format can be followed everywhere, and also relies on self-responsibility of students. Both teachers and high-school students agreed that MOOCs are not meant to fully replace teachers.
However, there are still ways to adapt MOOCs to high school students; especially since distant learning seemed to be well-perceived by them. Along our conversations about the MOOCs with teachers, we came to the conclusion that concepts such as flipped classrooms can be an idea to develop.
What is a flipped classroom
The University of Queensland, Australia defines the flipped classroom concept as a “reversal of traditional teaching where students gain first exposure to new material outside of class, usually via reading or lecture videos, and then class time is used to do the harder work of assimilating that knowledge through strategies such as problem-solving, discussion or debates”
Figure 2. Graphic explaining the concept of a flipped classroom, University of Queensland, Australia, available at http://www.uq.edu.au/teach/flipped-classroom/what-is-fc.html
With flipped classrooms, MOOCs are used in order to improve conventional teaching methods. Students use MOOCs in order to assimilate theoretical notions, but their applications remains in the hand of teachers. To us, it seemed to be a good way to combine both benefits of the modern and conventional teaching methods.
We decided to renew the experiment during a presentation of our project for students of the Master in Systems"

Results and Application
We have successfully overexpressed avermectins in streptomyces avermitilis and achieved toxins manufacture in E.coli to kill termites.    To trap effectively, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC),     and generated the nanofibrous microspheres self‐assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers.     Additionally, a device has been designed. With the help of modeling,     preliminary experience of the device has been made to prove its effect.

IGEM is not only a scientific competition. Since we are casting the synthetic biology on the real world problem, it forces us to consider about the ethical, legal, religious and social problems. Thus we collaborate with Synenergene, who aims at fostering responsible research and innovation in synthetic biology. The writing process of application scenarios and techno-moral vignettes prompts us to ground the plausibility and desirability of applications envisaged in our iGEM project.

Due to the combination of feedback loops in the model, the red blood cell count will reach the same steady state regardless of the initial population in the mesh. To change the steady state of the dynamic model, the parameters in the feedback functions would need to be modified until a desired steady state red blood cell count is reached. This was not done in our model.

The only substrate whose beta-carotene flux optimized PHPPs and growth rate optimized PHPPs remain very similar, without showing the mentioned trends, is oleic acid (Figures 16, 20, 24). Oleic acid’s stability in PHPP topology, independent of these two objective functions, implies it is a substrate that can make control of optimality simpler for both growth and beta-carotene production.

These results confirm the expected molecular weight for MamC-eGFP which is 45 kDa. The second band would be eGFP, because it has the molecular weight of 32,7 kDa and it probably derives from the cleavage of the Gly-linker used between MamC and eGFP.
Figure 3: Left fluorescence signal from MamC- eGFP observed through confocal microscopy. On the right a white field view onto the same E.coli cells.
Looking at the results of the confocal microscopy, we can clearly observe fluorescence corresponding with the E.coli cells. This image (Fig. 3) attests the functionality of the eGFP part of the fusion protein. For the fluorescence measurements eight transformed colonies were inoculated into liquid culture and grown overnight alongside three E. coli cultures containing a non-expression plasmid with a non-fluorescent insert (MamC-pSB1C3). Fluorescence was measured on an ELISA reader.
The mean values of the fluorescence can be found in the table (Tab. 1) below. Standard error for both groups (Total SE) was assessed using a Satterthwaite approximation.
Table 1: Showing fluorescence measurements on MamC-eGFP.
All dilution showed significantly more fluorescence than the control cultures except for the 50X dilution (Fig. 4). The mean of the difference to the control cultures is shown as a function of dilution below. These results additionally support the functionality of our construct.
Figure 4: Plot of the fluorescence of MamC-eGFP in relation to a negative control.
The fluorescence measurements and confocal images support the conclusion that the eGFP part of the MamC-eGFP fusion is functional, along with the western blot which also proves the right size of the MamC portion of the construct.
MamC
The MamC sequence was taken from Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum’s (MS-1) genomic DNA. The protein is supposed to be located in the magnetosome membrane thus making MamC ideal for anchoring foreign proteins to the magnetosome.
There were no results obtained on the MamC protein alone, since we didn’t have any possibility to prove its functionality.

There are other healthcare plans such as the compulsory health plan (Plan Obligatorio de Salud) which covers a variety of birth control methods. Maria uses this healthcare plan but didn’t realize that it covered birth control methods until she researched for this project. She also believes that not many people would know this either unless they researched like she did. According to Maria, birth control is generally supported in the more developed areas of Colombia, but in rural areas there is still stigma surrounding birth control methods. As a result, many women in the rural areas get pregnant in their early teens. Maria has experience taking birth control herself; she used birth control pills and states that “it is the most popular method around the community”.  A recent report given to us by Maria relays that birth control pills in Colombia were reduced in price by 50% so that more people can buy them. We are happy to see that Colombia is taking action to make birth control more accessible, but the issue of stigma still exists. We hope that our brochure may be of use to the rural communities in Colombia.
Guatemala
Zuleyka, Guatemalan Citizen
Zuleyka is a mother of eight from Mixco, Guatemala. She had her first child at the age of fourteen and faced several labor complications because she lacked the proper medical assistance to deliver her baby. Zuleyka birthed her baby on a dirt floor and relays that this is common among women in her area. Guatemala has one of the highest rates of pregnancy in South America due to their lack of access to contraceptives and prevalence of sexual violence [2] . In her community, many people believe that their religious deity blessed every woman with their particular number of children, which makes many women question their use of birth control methods if it ""interferes with God's plan"". Zuleyka went through a similar internal conflict, as she wished she spaced our her children out to provide better financial support to her growing family. Hearing Zuleyka’s story further inspired us to create our brochure for distribution and work to create a safe, alternative birth control method for women in need.
