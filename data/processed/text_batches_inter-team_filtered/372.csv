USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its"

After filtering only repetitive sequences with at least 12 tandem repetitions, we calculated the chances to find these elements in different DNA fragments sizes in chromosome 1. Our results show an increased chance of finding these elements into fragments bigger than 2000 bp, when compared to smaller fragments (Figure 2). Considering  the binding of a hemiCherry sensor to a DNA strand, the intensity of a 2000 bp fragment can have an increased intensity 10 times higher than a smaller fragment of only 200bp.

Furthermore, it was very satisfactory for us to see                                         the enthusiastic attitude of the students towards that workshop. It seems that                                         most of them find special the fact of having a personal message stored in a                                         DNA sequence which could be then synthesized, introduced to and replicated by a                                         living organism. The program we developed based on the coding system of Church                                         et al, 2012, helped the students to integrate into the topic by engaging on it                                         hands on. Like the examples provided before, this section of the workshop                                         helped translate a difficult concept in a simple but rigorous way to general                                         population. In addition, it served us as a tool to attract people to the                                         workshop and explain them a little bit more about iGEM, synthetic biology and                                         our project.

We used in our system a constitutive promoter for the production of it too. What we expect and what we could argue from literature is that having p-coumaric acid is in all cases preferable. Maybe exceeding levels could cause increased energy consumption and maybe even acid accumulation, a decrease in tyrosine(a precursor of p-coumaric acid) etc. What most probably will happen (and what we actually hope for) is that the natural feedback mechanism will be triggered and control the process. But you are right, a inductive system would have been prettier :)
For the last question, p-coumaric acid is mostly produced by plants. Even vanilla production and cinnamon flavour begins with p-coumaric acid. Many plants produce p-coumaric acid so p-coumaric acid exposure should not cause any harm to them. Besides, p-coumaric acid will be produced in the midgut of the bee, so it is unlikely for p-coumaric acid to find its way directly to the plant.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," showed increased motility in almost all of our assays (Fig. 6). On the minimal medium M9 agar plates they were usually significantly faster and showed swimming motility earlier than any other cells. On Tryptone swimming agar they were in general the runner up behind yhjH-transformed E. coli. Unfortunately, we had trouble cloning our fliC constructs into pSB1C3 because of a problem in our reverse primer suffix. When we had located the source of the problem it was too late to send this part to the Registry in time.
flhDC
Fig. 8: The master operon flhDC, involved in motility, codes for the transcription factor FlhD4C2 which acts as a regulator of flagellum synthesis. It is suggested that an overexpression of this operon in E. coli results in an increased motility [2]. (A) The flagellar apparatus is  anchored within the bacterial cell membrane. (B) E. coli cells that overexpress the flhDC operon supposedly exhibit an overall increased flagella production. Consequently, the cells should be able to move faster than their untransformed fellows.

The flhDC operon is the master regulator of motility and chemotaxis in E. coli. This means that it is the main control instance for flagellar synthesis and starts the complex process of flagellar gene synthesis and flagellum assembly (Chevance and Hughes 2008). The flhDC operon codes for the transcriptional regulator FlhD4C2 which forms heterotetramers and activates class II operons in concert with sigma factor 70. Among the gene products of class II operons are several components of the flagellum and the alternative sigma factor FliA which is essential for the transcription of class III genes. It has been shown that increased expression of flhDC also enhances motility in E. coli (Ling et al. 2010). We wanted to see how different levels of flhDC expression affect the speed of our E. coli lab-strains."

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

equals to the number of amino acid encoded by ci in the whole protein set.
Calculation of Fitness
NSGA-II algorithm applied35:
1. Randomly initialize a population of coding sequences for target protein.
2. Evaluate fitsc (g) and fitsp (g) fitness of each sequences in the population.
3. Group the sequences into nondominated sets and rank the sets.
4. Check termination criterion.
5. If termination criterion is not satisfied, select the “fittest” sequences (top 50% of the population) as the parents for creation of offsprings via recombination and mutation.
6. Combine the parents and offsprings to form a new population.
7. Repeat steps 2 to 5 until termination criterion is satisfied.
The identification and ranking of nondominated sets in step 3 is performed via pair-wise comparison of the sequences' fitsc (g) and fitsp (g) fitness. For a given pair of sequences with fitness values expressed as (fit1cp (g),fit1sc (g)) and (fit2cp (g),fit2sc (g)), the domination status can be evaluated as follows:
• If (fit1sc (g)>fit2sc (g))and (fit1cp (g)>=fit2cp (g)), sequences 1 dominates sequences 2.
• If (fit1sc (g)>=fit2sc (g)) and (fit1cp (g)>fit2cp (g)), sequences 1 dominates sequences 2.
• If  (fit1sc (g)<fit2sc (g))and (fit1cp (g)<=fit2cp (g)), sequences 2 dominates sequences 1.
• If  (fit1sc (g)<=fit2sc (g))and (fit1cp (g)<fit2cp (g)),"

E.coli strain mutant
We have to test the mutant strain CY15001 (trpR-) that Dr. Charles Yanofsky kindly provided us.  As the mutation consists of a frame shift, we decided to make a PCR reaction and then sequence the amplified products.
The primers used are:
Forward (5'->3'): CGC ACG TTT ATG ATA TGC TAT CG
Reverse:(5'->3'): AGG CCT ACA AAA TCA ATC G
These primers would amplify trpR coding region (326nt), 87nt upstream from the start codon and 12nt after the stop codon. Thus, obtaining a final PCR product of 426nt long.
Samples: The trpR mutant colonies that were selected to make the colony PCR were: 1,5,8.
Colony control: E.coli k12 wild type.
Experimental Procedure
11-13 August 2010
PCR colony: Protocol
1. Take with a toothpick a sample of the colony.
2. Dissolve the sample in 200μL of Tris-ETA 10/1-NaCl 10mM solution.
3. Heat the sample during 10 min at 95°.
4. Centrifugate at 14 000 rpm during 2 min.
5. Take 10μL as DNA template for PCR reaction.
6.The  PCR products  around the expected lenght - 421 nt - for E.coli k12 wt and trpR mutant colonies use them to sequence and analyze the trpR frameshifth mutation.

Figure 3: The design of docking domains in our experiment. At each set of docking domain, the top was connected with ACP that its upstream joined in the PFC 23 and   its downstream joined in the RFC 10. The following came close to KS that the upstream joined in the RFC 10 and the downstream joined in the RFC 23. The following has   no linker generally.
Results
After long exploration, we have got the standard DDs that can be used in different connections of ACP and KS. All docking domain are class 2 in our project. At each   set of docking domain, the top was connected with ACP that its upstream added the RFC 23 and its downstream added the RFC 10. The following came close to KS that the   upstream added the RFC 10 and the downstream added the RFC 23. The following has no linker generally. With dedicated efforts, we have built out the different modules   by using the same docking domains. With the upstream and downstream added for assembly, it has been constructed into pSB1C3 vector for further use.
Figure 4: Gel Electrophoresis of our amplified fragments needed for Docking Domains. Each fragment showed the different DD and the”M” is stand for 100bp maker. In   the picture (a), number 1 to 3 refer to the” DD1上” . Number 1 to 4 refer to the “DD2上、DD2下、DD3下、DD3上” separately in the picture (b). For (c), number 1 to 5   refer to the “DD4上、DD4下、DD6上、DD6上、DD6下” separately.
Conclusion
In our initial design, we aimed to create the standard general DD that can connect different Module (get more information about Module, please click here). Now, we   have got the standard biobricks of DD but without strict verification. Then, we will continue completing the remaining parts of the experiment.

Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Modelling#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," (How?) Try to avoid this, try going directly to protein.
Model degradation? (How?)
Model interaction of relevant substances. This requires reaction formulas for all the substances with (known) reaction rates, as well as information on how the substance diffuses (unless it is assumed the model is ""well-mixed"").
Link to the world outside the cell and macroscopic effects, like cell density. Note the medium is usually well-known.
Create a kind of mind map of the processes involved to show how the model could be refined.
Formulate what aspects of the modelling results are essential. So, for example that some concentration rises as a result of the presence of a substance, or that the bacteria actually float. (Can we use mathematical topology as a criterium?)
This can be done using one of the following methods:
One ordinary differential equation per substance involved, reflecting the different reaction formulas and rates.
If the spatial distribution of substances needs to be taken into account partial differential equations can be used. This is probably not necessary when talking about large numbers of bacteria.
Stochastic modelling can be used if needed (if we deal with very low concentrations for example).
Questions:
What exactly is the role of a kinetic law in modelling a reaction?
A kinetic law is usually a generic equation describing the rate of a certain class of reactions in terms of the reactant concentrations and some constants. (For example the Michaelis-Menten equation .)
Purpose of Modelling
Descriptive, it can help describe the system.
As verification of the design.
Predictive, it can help predict results to aid in selecting physical parameters. (How many copies of a gene? What concentrations? etc.)
As tool in designing tests. What tests will give the best discrimination, etc.
Literature
See our literature list for a full overview of all literature. For our team members that are looking for books on the subject, have a look under code 605B (Bernoulliborg library, lower floor), as well as 605C/D/E (A and Z also exist but seem to be less interesting) and 610A (and possibly 625, 715).

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", which has contributed to our cooperation in the optimization of CSCA protein expression conditions and product purification for AHUT_China. We tested the expression efficacy of CSCA at different temperatures, different induction time, and different IPTG concentrations. By comparing the protein expression level, we determined that the best induction condition was induced at 37 °C, 0.5mM IPTG for 6 h. After induced by IPTG, CSCA protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, which suggested that the CSCA protein was expressed with molecular weights of about 60 kD. Since the N-terminal of CCA carries a 6 x His tag, the expression product was purified by passing the Ni+ affinity chromatograph column, which ultimately helped AHUT_China to obtain 1 mg of purified CSCA protein with a purity greater than 85%.

【Data comparison of kill switch】
Security issues have always been a very important part of the iGEM competition. This year NEU_China_A and DLUT_China have worked together in the kill switch section. From the proposing the idea of a kill switch, the choice of lethal system, the construction of the plasmid vector to the characterization of the part, NEU_China_A and DLUT_China cooperate with each other. After discussion between two teams and with reference to the experience of the previous iGEM team, we choose the maz-EF system and Lysis two different systems. Two characterization methods were used to verify the function of the kill switch, one is plate induction and the other is a growth curve.
NEU_China_A and DLUT_China compared the lethal efficiencies of two different kill switch systems. The two teams verified the efficiency of cold shock expression of Lysis and mazF by measuring the growth curve under the same experimental conditions. Our data indicate that due to the high toxicity of mazF, even low expression of toxic proteins is sufficient for cell death. In contrast, the cold shock expression Lysis showed a better kill switch property. In vivo at 37℃, low expression of lysis is not enough to cause functional probiotics to die, while short-term (<4h) cold shock induction in vitro can fully inhibit cell growth. In short, cold shock expression of Lysis as a kill switch is a better choice.

Overview :
We decided to use nanoparticles as our carrier. We then had to find which kind of nanoparticles would suit our project the best. We first thought about polymers, but we needed something that could easily be degraded. So, we decided to use gelatin, which can be specifically degraded by enzymes. What's more, we found that many different kinds of gelatin nanoparticles had been made, with various loadings, such as proteins, organic molecules or DNA. We made our gelatin nanoparticles using a modified two-step desolvation method, and loaded them with fluorescently labeled dextran and recombinant GFP. We also labeled the nanoparticles directly with a dye. In addition, all of them were biotinylated, so that they could be linked to bacteria expressing streptavidin on their surface.
Figure 1: CY5-labeling of the nanoparticles
Figure 2: Biotinylation of the loaded nanoparticles
Making nanoparticles :
We made our gelatin nanoparticles using a modified two-step desolvation method [1 ]. In this method, acetone is progressively added to a gelatin solution under constant stirring. Since gelatin is not soluble in acetone, two phases start to form: the acetone-water solution (organic) and the aqueous gelatin (non organic). In order to minimize the system's energy, the gelatin struggles to reduce its surface over volume ratio, hence forming nanospheres. At the end of the reaction, the nanoparticles are stabilized by glutaraldehyde crosslinking.
Before we found this protocol, we tried making similar nanoparticles using a protocol from another paper [2 ]. However, the results weren't conclusive.

The approach developed in this work aims to point out the stakes and challenges that animate the field of synthetic biology.
As observers, we also have challenges and responsibilities. We will now use this third part to face questions about governance of the discipline, challenging our ethical reflexion with a realistic perspective. Thus, a topography of actors and decision making processes will enlighten us about what is “possible”, “thinkable” in order to fulfill what is ethically necessary. We also use this part to put a last look on fundamental concepts about the new perceptions brought by the discipline and by the actors, in order to get at how these topics will affect our societies.
Briefly and schematically, we can have a look on our previous reflexions and observe that we had to consider two sets of stakes and challenges to impose into the consideration of the actors of the field.
That stakes are technical and social. As I try to figure out in my methodology and criticism, technical and social questions have to be regarded together, because of their common dynamics and co-construction processes. For example, how to distinguish the “Synthia” project from the Venter Institute, the bacteria which is not"
Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#freedthefrogs_-_-_TEXT.html," our relationships with nature. Nature, which was once declared as an enemy, a dangerous force threatening the human race, is now more and more perceived as something sacred that has to be preserved from huge disasters occasioned by human technology. Fears concerning environmental changes and the disappearance of the world we knew are leading to this extreme. From one extreme (paying no attention to significant others) and another (paying so much attention that we want to keep them in formalin), an intermediate solution, pragmatic, made of compromises, have to be found.
However synthetic biology is still building itself on strongly anthropocentric values. These values are stated in the first fundamental canon of the American Society of Civil Engineers' Code of Ethics : ""Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and shall strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of their professional duties."" The attention to the principles of sustainable development was added in 2009, as explained in the footnote of the document. This novelty is quite important as it highlights the need of an evolution of our relation to non-human beings. The environmental crisis and maybe pressure from society compels technology to care for a ""sustainable develoment"". Synthetic biology appears to have in mind a quite similar understanding of ethics. Ethics is widely link with safety and security, with the issues of bioterrorism and the avoidance of environmental leaks. The formulation of the human pracice on the iGEM site also encourages this conception: ""Will the world be a safe place if we make biology easy to engineer?"". Those questions of environmental safety and risk assessment are quite difficult to deal with, and we are glad to see that the project of Paris Bettencourt was to take them seriously through a study of horizontal gene transfer. It seems to be too often taken as granted with some killer switch assumption.
But improving human welfare from an anthropocentric perspective can have for consequences a deep blindness of the environment in which we are embedded. The history of animal ethics testifies of the limits of a blind fulfillment of human diseres. The animal issue was triggered in UK by Ruth Harrison’s book, Animal Machines: The New Factory Farming Industry published in 1964. From this book rises a campaign against industrial farming giving birth in the early 70s to the concept of “speciesism”, and slogans around “animal liberation” “animal rights”. The main works structuring the animal movement were published between 1975 and 1983; Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation and Tom Regan’s Animal Rights and Human Obligations (1976).

As you can see in these five pictures, compared with other samples, group 4 and 5 had more precipitations on the surface of the bacteria significantly. Although we have followed every step in the protocol from other papers, our bacteria did NOT have so much precipitation as them. It may result from the fact that there are too many varieties in this experiments. So we could not repeat their results. However, these pictures still provide us with a solid evidence for our assumption! This enzyme can produce S2-, which can precipitate Cd2+ to form CdS nanoparticles for our final goal——utilizing light energy to generate more electrons!
6. Effect of CdS nanoparticles to cathode-current
To see whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as we expected, we added CdS quantum dots kindly provided by team ShanghaiTech into the culture when we were forming bio-film onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically, CdS quantum dots would be attached to the surface of the bacteria as the bio-film was formed.
Figure 6. Preparation for bio-film
Figure 7. The way we gave light to the reaction system
Then, we put the cathode running and monitored the current. As you can see in figure 8, the strain pMC, which were co-expressing Mtr CAB and Ccm A-H, had a stronger cathode current than the WT strain before the light was given, which perfectly repeated the result we have done in the conduction system section. After the current was stable, we began to give light to the system. The light’s wave length is 455 nm and the source is a LED light bought from an online shop. The strain pMC with CdS quantum dots on it responded to the light stimulate. It had a stronger current than it was before the light was given. However, those strains without CdS quantum dots on it did NOT respond to light stimulate. Especially, for the pMC group without CdS quantum dots on it, it did NOT have any current change after we give light to the system, which exclude the possibility that the current change was resulted from the Mtr CAB proteins or the Ccm A-H protein. Moreover, after we stopped the light, the current got back to the level it was before we gave the light.

This strongly proved the assumption we had that the CdS can increase cathode current, which means that CdS quantum dots"

UNebraska-Lincoln,2016,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Integrated Practices 5_-_-_TEXT.html," safety cases have already been built for will be able to develop even more thorough safety cases on them and adapt them when developing safety cases of their own.  A greater confidence in engineered microorganisms could ultimately be achieved.
By building an organized repository of SafetyBricks, future iGEM teams can more quickly build safe, robust systems and understand how they may function in the environment. Safety cases will help teams integrate safety at all levels of their project, understand unanticipated behavior when introduced in in a simulated or real environment, and develop increased and justified confidence in the behavior of their systems.
A quick search in the SafetyBrick repository of similar projects could help teams more easily identify potential hazards and may point them in the direction of evidence in literature for developing their safety case.
Synthetic biology systems are becoming more complex. Their behavior in the environment will become more complex as well. Encouraging the use of a systematic method for gaining confidence in the safety of a synthetic biology system will allow synthetic biologists to address modes of failure when introducing these organisms to environments outside of the lab or to simulated environments.
We can begin to identify patterns of failure that will be increasingly important as systems become increasingly complex. The identification of underlying patterns of failure will lead to quicker identification and mitigation of failure modes in system design and construction.
iGEM Competition
The iGEM competition could integrate safety cases into the competition by adding the development of a safety case as a medal requirement. Safety is currently a deliverable, which is a requirement to be eligible for medals. Safety could have a larger role in the iGEM competition which would have a positive impact on the field of synthetic biology. Including a medal requirement for safety could serve as a small incentive for teams to give safety more consideration. A special award could also be created for the best safety contributions to synthetic biology.
For teams that are unable to obtain lab results, developing safety cases can still be a very beneficial task. Literature can be used as evidence of the safety cases. These safety arguments can be further strengthened by future wet lab results.
Developing safety cases would also be a perfect task for iGEM teams composed of high school students. It would increase their awareness of the safety and environmental concerns and will also give them a structured way to develop their synthetic biology ideas.
The scope of iGEM projects are limited since the timeframe to work on them is relatively short. Alterations to safety cases can be made. These can be called future safety plans. Hypothetical safety arguments can be made and supported by results in literature. Future safety plans can be picked up by future teams and refactored/"

In order to make roGFP2-orp1 in a suitable                         redox state, we chose several promoters of different intensity and ligated them to roGFP2-orp1                         through OE-PCR, then adding hydrogen peroxide to verify its function.
Specific method:
First, we obtain seven promoters of different intensity from Saccharomyces yeast genome through                         enzyme digestion method. They are: FBA1,TEF1,TEF2,ENO2,PCK1,PDC1 and PGI1. [1]
Second, we linked the promoter fragment to the previously constructed fragment roGFP2-orp1by                         OE-PCR and constructed it on the pESC-Trp plasmid. We screened positive results in the                         following of digestion，ligation and transformation of the large intestine. Finally, we                         constructed the fragments into our chassis organisms through yeast transformation.

The response of roGFP2-Orp1 to H2O2
According to literature[2], roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein shows peak value                         at 405nm (oxidation peak) and 488nm (reduction peak). Fluorescence ratio R (R=I408 / I488) is                         uesed to the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1. Therefore, we used different H2O2 concentrations (independent variable) to simulate the accumulation of ROS in cells and the                         fluorescence ratio (dependent variable) to characterize the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1, which                         means that the increase of fluorescence ratio R shows roGFP2-Orp1 is oxidized and the decrease                         shows reduction.
Fig.7 Experimental Group
As Figure.7 shown, the fluorescence ratio R of roGFP2-Orp1 increases with the increase of H2O2 concentration. And the fluorescence ratio is basically unchanged when the concentration of H2O2 exceeds 0.8 mM.
Fig.8 Control Group
As Figure.8 shown, the fluorescence ratio of wide-type was not affected by the change of H2O2 concentration and remained unchanged.
Redox reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
Firstly, we made the cells almost be oxidation state by adding 1 mM H2O2 and observed the change of fluorescence ratio R (dependent variable) with time (independent                         variable).

All composite parts were succesfully cloned and controlled by sequencing and transfection as well ( Freiburg Transfection and Synthetic Receptor )
Biobrick fusion protein
The present BioBrick prefix and suffix rules are not compatible with modular protein design. Thus as in 2007, we proposed an extension of the present standard for fusion proteins in which two restriction sites are added in frame adjacent to the coding sequence. The basic parts and as well all composite parts follow this strategy.  To get further information see FreiGEM07_report_fusion_part

As for the reaction rates, the model will follow the engineering principle of chemical kinetics, in which the reaction rates will be maximum in the beginning, since the binding process happens maximum in the beginning, and gradually becomes much slower as the binding process becomes progressively slower too.
Other base modelling for the mass-transport is Langmuir-Hill model, in which the binding of a ligand to a receptor/macromolecule will be faster in the presence of another ligand in close proximity. The resulting graph will have similar shape to the f(x) = ln(x) graph since the models basically have similar fundamental base, which can be found in the autophosphorylation graph.
In reality, especially in micro-molecular protein complex, of course, there are difference and complex’s own signature characteristics, regarding their rules in mass transportation, that will be explained in detail as follows:
HB-EGF Binding

Figure 28.Reaction Rate of Diphtheria Toxin to HB-EGF.
Figure 29.Dissociation Response of Diphtheria Toxin to HB-EGF.
Figure 30.Reaction Rate of Diphtheria Toxin to HB-EGF.
Both response unit and reaction rates for both association and dissociation reaction roughly follows the same mass transfer principle, in which the response unit (the existence of the mass) will grow faster in the early stage and then will gradually become slower in the later stage. The reaction rates will follow directly from the response unit, therefore, the reaction rates will reach its peak in the beginning and begins to falter until it reaches the maximum. The literature base [1] confirms and give another insight to the analysis, in which the Diphtheria toxin-association is environment dependent, while the release of Diphtheria Toxin (Dissociation) is rate-limiting step. The paper also elaborates that there might another additional factor regarding of interaction of toxin to HB-EGF.
The final regression of the data ultimately utilizes polynomial equation since it gives the largest R2 which means the smallest deviation, so it can be utilized for future interpolation or extrapolation purpose.

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," The biosynthesis pathway of astaxanthin formation in transgenic rice endosperm. The dotted arrows indicate pathway limitations in rice endosperm. The solid arrows indicate the existence of carotenogenic reactions. The red arrows indicate the reactions catalaysed by four exogenous transgenes Psy, CrtI, BHY and BKT.
 
The biosynthesis of astaxanthin from pyruvate needs more than ten kinds of enzymes. However, based on the study of Golden Rice, we deduced that its biosynthesis in rice endosperm requires four key enzymes (Figure 2). The PSY (phytoene synthase) catalyzes geranylgeranyl-PP into phytoene. The CrtI gene from Erwinia uredovora encodes phytone desaturase that could complete the catalysis process from phytoene to lycopene. Moreover, the β-LCY gene, encoding β-lycopene cyclases, is expressed and active in rice endosperm. Therefore, when the two genes (PSY and CrtI) are drived by endosperm-specific promoters in rice, the β-carotene (pro-vitamin A) was synthesized to produce the famous Golden Rice. From β-carotene to astaxanthin, there are still two steps: BHY (β-carotenehy droxylase) catalyze β-carotene to zeaxanthin, and BKT (β-carotene ketolase) catalyzes zeaxanthin directly to synthesize the end product astaxanthin. Because the expression of the endogenous rice gene BHY is very low, the biosynthesis of astaxanthin in rice endosperm requires at least 4 genes (PSY+CrtI+BKT+BHY, BBPC). For the combination of three genes (PSY+CrtI+BKT，BPC) maybe produce little astaxanthin (even nothing!). Therefore, we utilized a multigene vector system to assemble and transformed these four genes into rice to study the metabolic synthesis of astaxanthin in endosperm.
 
 
2. Rice-based bioreactor
According to the advantages listed below, we took rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm as the bioreactor for astaxanthin production.
 
● Rice is a crop plant of low-cost, high-yield, high-safety.

A single genetic circuit has a set of responses based on the chemical or environmental factors present in a biological system. By introducing new genetic circuits into the SBiDer network the biology community benefits from new devices with new functionalities or improved functionality, and when introduced into the SBiDer network creates a multitude of new genetic device combinations. The SBiDer website includes a device upload page to encourage the collaboration of the synthetic biology community to keep expanding the database and network for improved and up to date genetic devices. The database also maintains updated SBML forms of all genetic device parts and the SBiDer network so the biology community can continue working on the most up to date information.
Technologies
The database was implemented using SQLite, a widely used database management system, and the SQLite3 Python module.  SQLite is developed and maintained by multiple companies including Oracle and Adobe (www.sqlite.com). With it’s widespread use and fast queries, SQLite is a powerful tool to use for collaboration with the biological community. Python’s success within the biology community, it’s ease of use and compatibility with major operating systems also makes for an effective combination with SQLite and computational work in biology (“Programming for Biologists”, 2014). Using these two technologies, a Python based API was create that encourages the synthetic biology community to participate in the database expansion and operation as well as SBML file access.
Database Schema in Depth
The plasmid table stores the name and pubmed literature references allowing users to easily find out more about their given device. The plasmid is then broken down into operons where multiple operons can be mapped to the same plasmid. In order to capture this relationship, a table of plasmid id and operon id allows for multiple operons relating to a single plasmid. A direction column in the plasmid-operon relationship table also allows users to specify the directionality of the operon inside of the given plasmid as multiple operon sequences can can be found with presence in either strands of the DNA. Operons are also mapped exclusively to their plasmid, meaning that identical operons from different plasmids require insertion into the database with a mapping to the corresponding “parent” plasmid. The operon table itself contains information on the operon sbol and sbml files representations.
The input transition table explains the type of logic that is being used for operon activation as either AND or OR logic. AND logic transitions are transitions which must take in all corresponding inputs species for the activation of the operon. OR logic transitions are transitions which require a single input species or multiple input species"

USTC,2017,Team:USTC-Software#project_-_-_TEXT.html," We think a user-friendly forum centred on Biobricks is necessary, where users can grade the parts they've used, or share experiences with other scholars. The forum on the one hand complements the data used for more accurate ranking, and on the other hand provides a platform for idea exchanging.
The parts data can be used for various purposes, but apparently we are not able to achieve all of them. In consideration of this, we decide to make our software extensible. Developers with ideas to better make use of the data may develop their own plugins, and embed them into the software. With the help of forum, such plugins will be acquainted quickly, and accelerate the development of synthetic biology.
To Be Improved
As an upgrade version of Biohub 1.0, we've achieved quite a lot, but there's still something imperfect, due to technical or time limitation. One is that users cannot upload their own plugins freely as a consideration of security. We will try to add sand-box mechanism in the future, whilst still providing enough freedom for plugins. Another is that the project lacks a scaffold for plugin developers, which may confuse them while setting up developing environment. Also, the plugin system lacks a detailed documantation for developers. We will keep updating the repository and gradually fill these blanks in the future."

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#HomeEn_-_-_TEXT.html," Whatever the nature of the vector, they raise many problems: stability, targeting, membrane passing, and immune reactions.
This is why we have tried to create the ideal vector: the best stability, the best targeting, capable of penetrating easily its target and especially capable of eluding the immune system. We have thus created a ""double vectorization system"" (DVS) that uses jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector , of bacterial type, is used to target the tissue and resist the immune system, whilst the second vector , of phage type, is used to target the cell type and to penetrate the membranes. The combination of both systems offers an improvement of the intrinsic capacities of vectors, as well as new application possibilities.
Bearing in mind the public health problems of the world, we deemed interesting to apply our concept to lung cancer, which opens a new realm of therapeutic strategies to fight this physiopathology.

Mitochondrial Leader Sequence ( BBa_K1119000 , BBa_K1119001 )
Introduction
In our characterization, the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of MLS was assembled in frame with that of GFP reporter using Freiburg’s RFC25 format ( BBa_K648013 ). The translation unit was driven by CMV promoter ( BBa_K1119006 ), and terminated by hGH polyA signal ( BBa_K404108 ). The aforementioned construct ( BBa_K1119009 ) was then transfected into HEK293FT cells. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos dye after transfection and co-localization between the GFP signal and that of the dye was determined as the area of signal overlap. To provide a positive control, the CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted downstream and in frame with the CDS of the MLS in the commercial plasmid pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). Our negative control construct was the same as our experimental construct, but minus the MLS CDS. ( BBa_K1119008 ).
MLS is submitted in RFC25 standard ( BBa_K1119001 ) to facilitate fusing with other CDS. MLS in RFC10 standard ( BBa_K1119000 ) is submitted as alternative but it cannot be fused directly to other CDS due to limitations in RFC10. Users who obtained the part in RFC10 standard can amplify the part by PCR and fuse it to other domains using overlapping PCR.
To quantify the amount of signal overlapped between the GFP signal and the MitoTracker® dye, we adopted the method described by A.P. French et al. in “Colocalization of fluorescent markers in confocal microscope images of plant cells” (French et al., 2008). With the use of the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin for ImageJ image processing, scatter plots of the green intensities (y-axis"

Method 5: method 2 and method 4
Method 6: method 3 and method 4
The application of molybdenum fertilizer and productin increase researcher in Xinxiang(Liu, 1987)
It is easy to find that method 5 can obtain the highest yield. The phenomenon reveals that Mo is of great importance during both germination and growing period, but too much Mo will not increase the production, even reduce it.
For the maximum production, proper amount of Mo is essential. Traditional way is hard to control molybdenum concentration near peanut roots, because there are many factors effecting the concentration of molybdenum fertilizer around peanut roots, such as rainfall, the condition of peanut roots.
Traditional way may also waste molybdenum, because molybdenum near roots is easily absorbed by roots or transported into nitrogen-fixing bacteria. However, further molybdenum will not initiatively get close to roots. Although there is no exact experimental figure about that, our model may reveal the low efficiency of it.
Traditional way may even cause heavy mental pollution.
The national upper-level threshold standard of Mo is 0.005mg/L in water and 2.0 mg/kg in soil. (Zhang, 2012) The usual molybdenum spraying process is as follows according to Gao & Dong (1998). During the seeding stage and early blossom stage, 30~35 kg 0.3% (NH4)2MoO4 per mu (666.67 square meters) will be spray to the leaves for 2~3 times. During flowering stage, 50~70 kg 0.3% (NH4)2MoO4 per mu (666.67 square meters) will be sprayed to the leaves for 2~3 times. If it rains or winds heavily in the future 24 hours, the same process should be done again. Only in spraying process, even if not affected by rainfall, every square meter may receive 710mg Mo. If it rains, the amount may receive 1000mg. If the dressing process is also calculated, the amount of Molybdenum may still be more and fertilizing year by year will finally pollute water and soil.

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html," of vitiligo. Therfore, I think this transcription factor seems to be good to introduce into the skin and further into melanocytes.
""Recently, beyond the already large group of genes activated by MITF, other potential targets were identified by using the microarrays in MITF-overexpressing human melanoma cells (20). Because severe MITF mutations preclude the development of embryonic melanocytes (21) and MITF is required for the survival of adult and even malignant melanocytes (22), the MITF protein is believed to be an essential regulator of the life and differentiation of melanocytes.
Melanomas generally express high levels of MITF, although these levels differ greatly among melanoma cell lines and cells in the tumor tissue."" - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 2
Nina: MITF seems to activate genes that code for enzymes which can take care of free radicals (ROS). The ROS have been shown to be accumulated in vitiligo skin since maybe a lack of these important enzymes, hence melanocytes die because of the many ROS.
""MITF controls not only expression of pigmentation-related genes but also genes involved in diverse biological processes in melanoma cells (Fig. 1a) such as proliferation, invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis and stress mediated by reactive oxygen species, and possibly metastasis."" - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 2
Nina: MITF looks to be very important to melanocytes.
""At least four different transcription factors participate in the transactivation of the MITF gene in melanocytes: the paired box-containing transcription factor PAX3, a sex determining region Y (SRY) family member SOX10, the Wnt ⁄ b-catenin pathway effector LEF-1 and the cAMP pathway effector cAMP response element binding (CREB) (Fig. 2), with the last two proteins being probably more important for the maintenance of MITF levels in melanoma cells"" - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 3
Nina: If it becomes to difficult in the practicals to introduce the transcription factor MITF, we may introduce instead the transcription factors involved in activating MITF in melanocytes, but hopefully we do not need to make this step.

We set up each of these both with 1mM IPTG and without, so 16 overnights in total, with 25μg/ml chloramphenicol for the strains with plasmids.
The next day, we spun down 500μl of each overnight in 1.5ml eppendorfs, resuspended in 1ml PBS buffer (PBS gives less background fluorescence than LB broth), and transferred to cuvettes for OD600 measurements. For the fluorescence measurements, we used a Typhoon FLA 9500 with the samples in a 96-well plate. Each of the 16 samples were pipetted into 3 wells with 300μl each. The settings on the Typhoon were: 1) excitation laser at 532nm and emission filter above 575nm (so would detect any wavelength above 575nm) and 2) excitation laser at 473nm and emission filter above 575nm. Both were across the whole 96-well plate, but the second lower excitation wavelength was included in case the first was too high to excite KillerOrange.
Results
For each of the wells, a fluorescence value in arbitrary units (au) was calculated using ImageQuant software, where we set the 3 wells of PBS only blanks as 0% fluorescence, and the well with the highest value as 100% to convert au into percentage. Next, we normalised for any natural fluorescence in the cells by subtracting the average of the “cells only” wells (DH5α, and Dh5α.Z1, both with and without IPTG) from all wells, and then corrected for the difference in OD600 values between samples by dividing the normalised fluorescence measurements by the OD600 values. The table below shows the average across the 3 wells of each of the 16 samples.

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#modeling1_-_-_TEXT.html," from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density (OD) were measured at t1=60 min and t2=120 min after the application of the heat pulse had finished.
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and we split the experiments in two batches. FI and OD were measured at t1=60 min, and t2=120 min for batch number 1, while for batch number 2 the heat shock was delayed 40 min with respect to the first batch. Therefore, measurements for batch no.2 were taken at t1=100 min, and t2=160 min respectively.
During the 40 min delay, the microorganism was growing. Therefore, the heat shock in batch no. 2 was applied to a larger population than in the case of batch no.1. Consequently, the measurements of FI and DO gave much higher values. This fact affects the ratio FI/DO, were the two batches can be clearly distinguished (see figure 4).
Figure 4.
Raw data from the heat shock experiment.
Our first modeling work was aimed to obtain data reconciliation. To this point,  we assumed that, during this 40 min delay, the only thing that happened was that cells grew. Growth was approximately linear in the range analyzed, as seen in figure 1 (blue data). We fitted a simple model DO=p1+p2*t. The result can be seen in figure 5, were:  p1 = 0.161573  p2 = 0.000866314 Therefore, the above ratio FI/DO can be compensated by multiplying data by the fractions (p1+p2*t100)/(p1+p2*t), and (p1+p2*t160)/(p1+p2*t). Actually, what we did was to compensate all measurements to the same time base. The reconciled results can be seen in figure 6.
Figure 5.
Model fitting for OD w.r.t. time.
Figure 6.
Recoinciled data for t=60min and t=120min.
Once we had all data reconciled, we fitted them to a static model relating the ratio between fluorescence intensity (FI) and the culture optical density (OD) with the temperature applied during the heat shock.
Since the model is nonlinear with respect to parameters K1 and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at"

All three of these samples were placed in a rotating incubator, sampled every hour, sample in spectrophotometer at OD 600, and then the Miller Assay was done for each. The OD 600 revealed the growth functions of both the Negative and Positive were normal, but the Test growth was severely retarded. Consequently the Miller Assay revealed that the amount of ß-gal in the Negative and Positive steadily decreased over time, while the Test has a constant large amount present. This implies that the Test cells are focussing more on the production of a protein, than on their own growth.

The delay factor in growth between the Negative/Positive and Test is 12:1. A test with differing AHL concentrations would prove this.

Before we obtain the result of the simulations, we are required to set the values of biological parameters and set the initial state of the system. That, is another story…
2.4 Setting the Parameters and Initial States
How do we acquire the parameters we need to simulate and validate our model? Estimating all the parameters based on our experimental results is not realistic, due to the large number of parameters, the nonlinearity of the system and the potential inaccuracy of our experiments. A straightforward way to obtain the values of parameters is to refer to literatures, results of previous iGEM teams and common sense. We trust that the simulations run based on these values of parameters should provide us with generally satisfying results, which can at least predict the"

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," experiments, we set a goal to finish two system we designed, one of which is a gene-level switch, and the other is a protein-level switch. We constructed our device in the plasmids of Escherichia coli and then integrated to the plasmids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After that, we transformed all the plasmids to the competent yeasts. However, due to the limit time, we only finished the Pro priontein system, leaving the yeast plasmids of our Propri-ontein system untransformed. With sufficient time, we believe that our Propri-ontein system will work succeessfully.
Expand our system to Escherichia coli
This year, we fused the gene of SUP35NM with the activating domain of GAL4, the binding domain of GAL4, and sfGFP11. We verified the fusion of SUP35NM and sfGFP11 worked fine. It was believed that the cure of the prion aggregate might be associated with the generation propagation, however, a generation of the yeast can be very long, which may reduce the usefulness of the application.There are evidences showing that the yeast prion can work in E. coli[1]. So one of our future work falls on expanding our systems to E. coli make our system faster.
Find more interacting protein pairs
This year we use the sfGFP split to construct our Pro Priontein system, but theoretically, any interacting protein pair can be exploited in this system, which could be recognized as a universal protein-level switch. In scienticfic research, especially the protein field, the interaction of proteins is frequently taken into consideration. Thus our system appears to be a very useful tool in protein study. To verify its universality, more protein pairs are required, which makes a part of our future work.
Find a more convenient fluorescence reading method
Before performing our experiments, we thought the difference of the intensity of fluorescence would be distinguished by eye, however the results overthroughed our former assumption. Therefore we can only see the difference by the fluorescence microscope and process the images using Matlab. Thus a more convenient fluorescence reading method is required to make our system portable and ready-to-use.
Automatically eliminate the noise
The noise of the background of the images took through fluorescence microscope would seriously influence the quantativating. However, we could not figure out how to eliminate it automatically, because we didn't know the specfic relationship between the noise and the subject. We have tryed to use subtraction and division to eliminate, but the error still remained. Thus we concluded that the"

Week 5 (May 29- June 2, 2017)
Due to the lack of growth on the Interlab Study plates last week, chemically competent DH5𝛼 E. coli were made again because there may have been issues with the first set of competent cells created. However, there was still no growth on the plates inoculated with transformed cells.
On a positive note, our constructs from IDT that were ordered in week 3 arrived!
Outside of the lab, lots of work was dedicated to researching four possible applications of our project (space, wastewater treatment, landfill leachate, and developing countries). More about this research can be found on our Applied Design and Silver Human Practices pages.
Week 6 (June 5- June 9, 2017)
Again, Jacob and Sam’s work on the Interlab Study was unsuccessful. Different protocols for making chemically competent cells and transformation were used, but there was still no growth observed. This strongly suggests that there is an issue with our DH5𝛼 cells, so next week we will get new cells and try again. Due to our problematic cells, work has not yet begun with our actual secretion construct from IDT.
Lalit and Kaitlin prepared necessary supplies that will be needed on Lalit’s trip to Winston Churchill High School on Monday, June 12, 2017. During this outreach, he will discuss synthetic biology with Grade 11 students, practice gel loading, and perform strawberry DNA extraction experiments with them.

June 11, 2017- Geekstarter iGEM Workshop, presented by MindFuel and Alberta Innovates
Today was an iGEM workshop hosted by Geekstarter that was attended by the University of Alberta, University of Calgary, Urban Tundra High School, and University of Lethbridge iGEM teams. There were four speakers who gave ½ hour presentations on an introduction to syn bio, mathematical modeling, wiki design, and integration of art into syn bio. Later, we had the chance to speak with each presenter individually and ask questions specifically related to our project. Also, there was a collaboration period where we got to mingle with the other teams and discuss our projects with them. Overall it was a successful day where we learned a lot from the presenters and identified possible collaborations with the other teams.

These experiments do not only give some good indications that the functioning of this promoter is indeed regulated by the induction of fusaric acid, but they also show that this regulator could actually be used for other purposes, such as in our case the detection of Fusarium oxysporum and producing anti-fungal agents in its presence. A fusaric acid detection system has not been developed before now, and the implications of this part could very likely exceed this iGEM project.
Future work
During this iGEM project, we also tried to isolate the promoter from the original P. putida KT2440 genome without the inhibiting gene, but we were unsuccessful to do so. However, while performing mutagenesis on the BioBrick to remove the illegal restriction site PstI, an unintentional insert was introduced, causing a frame shift in the inhibiting gene, possibly disabling its function, leaving the promoter uninhibited. When this part would be inserted into P. putida, the over-expression of the inhibiting gene would be gone. Note that using this part is only possible in P. putida for this reason.
By introducing this part to P. putida and growing it at the same time as the tested transformed P. putida used in the previous experiments, the fusaric acid resistance can be compared between the two strains. Hypothetically, the new strain could have a higher resistance, because the overexpression of the inhibiting gene is dysfunctional and therefore cannot block the fusaric acid efflux pump in the original genome. We did not have time to test this yet.
Resistance
Approach
Different gene cluster known to be related to fusaric acid resistance will be isolated from multiple different organisms. FusABCDE from Burkholderia cepacia [1], FDT-123 from Klebsiella oxytoca [2], FuaABC from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [3] and PP1263-5 from Pseudomonas putida itself. These clusters will then be expressed under an IPTG inducible promoter (BBa_J04500) or a ramose inducible promoter (BBa_K914003) in order to test the resistance levels. Since all of the clusters contain multiple illegal PstI sites, it was decided to insert"

3.T cell conduct suicide when it feel infected.
It is not practical for the team to deal with HIV, however, we can simplify our idea which concerns the resistance against the virus, that is, the phage. One thought is that we make the promoter of our parts the same as the promoter of the virus expression system. When the virus invades, it switch on two set of systems: one binds the phage inhibiting its reproduction, the other makes the host suicide. This project can be applied to fermentation production.

The teams split into small groups to discuss individual themes. They did some research into multiple aspects of the project including: wiki layout, t-shirt design and possible team logos. We also looked at past iGEM team wikis for inspirational ideas.
,
A talk on Computational Modelling and BioBrick concepts was given. This talk led the team to start building the biophysical model of the lipid membrane of Bacillus subtilis and modelling of lipid synthetic pathway. Later in the day, the team met to discuss initial aims and progress of our work so far.
Wiki
Initial designs for the wiki have been created and uploaded. Currently all style sheets and javascript pages are stored externally until the design has been ratified by the team. Front-page image carousel has been created and initialised with blank colours to demonstrate what it shall look like until actual photographs have been taken and edited.

We started off working on a Modelling Exercise to identify components and species of the subtilin biosynthesis pathway. We also sketched down some potential logo ideas and created a shortlist of favorites.
We went on to learn about the differences and similarities between stochastic and deterministic modeling. We also used rule based modeling such as RuleBender and BioNetGen. Using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model as an example, we alter the parameters and rates of reaction to observe the effects.
Wiki
The wiki design was agreed upon and further developed. A front-page image display has been created, developed and set up with dummy text and placeholder images. Discussions have been held over the layout for the calendar, the general consensus being that as few a clicks as possible should be needed to switch between and overall summary of what was done and the more detailed view. Designs are started with the idea being to create a large calendar holding daily headlines that spawn a non-obtrusive pop-up window containing more detail.

Science Slam in Constance
What it was about
In April, the town of Constance was celebrating the 600th anniversary of the Council of Constance. In this vast assembly, a lot of scientist from Universities all over Europe came to Constance and exchanged about their research, turning it into one of the first major scientific meetings in European history. To live up to this historical event, a Science Slam about “Innovations” was held, a topic perfect for our project and research field. The Slam included eight scientists and students from multiple scientific fields: Engineering, Physics, Medical Research, Medieval History, and our iGEM team as a representative of Synthetic Biology.

What we did
Each representative gave a ten-minute presentation. The mood was magnificent, and both the participants and the listeners could learn about recent developments in various scientific fields. Our team was able to inform the audience about the opportunities and possibilities of our project and synthetic biology in general, a scientific field which faces a lot of opposition in Germany. The reactions were all very positive, since most people only see the risks and not the chances of synthetic biology, our presentation gave us an opportunity to improve the reputation of synthetic biology. The reactions of the audience gave us a valuable feedback about our work and insight into the concerns of non-specialists about Synthetic Biology.

We discussed the concept logos that our artist, Amy Congdon, had produced. Many of them contained the image of a rabbit, an image synonymous with UEA's campus, and an image found on this very wiki. We felt perhaps that because our logo would be very much our public image, and that outside of the iGEM world a logo baring a rabbit prominently may give the wrong impression of synthethic biology to the public, that the rabbit aspect of the logo may be better as a smaller piece of the image, or even non-existent in it. We did, however, believe that the ""N=ORWICH"" part of the logo was extremely important and clever in representing our project on nitric oxide , and this can be seen in the finalised version of the logo all over the wiki!
We also focused on the information we wanted to present in our interview on STAR Radio the next day. As we were told we would be on both the farming and the business portions of the show, we focused on how to discuss Synthetic Biology in the senses of both agriculture and business. Further to this, we ensured that we had a clear and precise definition of synthetic biology in order to help put the idea across to the radio show's listeners and hopefully publicise the branch of science and help dispel fears about it.
In the afternoon we had our end of day lab meeting where we built on the project outline for Sunday's iGEM deadline and contacted Cambridge's iGEM team to discuss a visit and meeting while we were in Cambridge for the radio interview.
Labs
Today was our first day in the labs and we began by transforming NEB 5-alpha Escherichia coli with three BioBricks we had picked out as being applicable to our project in order to characterise them and investigate how far we would be able to use them in our project. When choosing the BioBricks we looked at those that had been used in previous years to either sense/report on nitric oxide specifically, or those that been used in sensing/reporting on physiologically relevant molecules that we could adapt for nitric oxide sensation. The three BioBricks we used were:

The bacterial population dynamics arising from the synchronized lysis circuit can be conceptualized as a slow build-up of the signalling molecule (AHL) to a threshold level, followed by a lysis event that rapidly prunes the population 。 After lysis, a small number of remaining bacteria begin to produce AHL anew, allowing the ‘integrate and fire’ process to be repeated in a cyclical fashion. We  observe growth  with the fluorescent protein superfolder GFP (sfGFP).

The Establishment of Co-Culture System
Co-Culture :
Based on what we have illustrated above, it is our priority to both improve the yields of cellulose generated from G.xy though exploring and optimizing the various condition of co-culture system during the fermentation process and make sure “engineered  bacterial”——E.coli have grown stably and normally.
Since the reproduction speed of E.coli have been much faster than the speed of G.xy, it is significant to calculate the ratio of inoculating both bacterial. Yields of cellulose will be compromised if we inoculate a number of E.coli while little volume of E.coli for which will fail to manipulate the pH.Therefore, it is necessary for us to to explore the best ratio of incubating E.coli and G.xy.
During the process that we utilized culture medium for G.xy to fermented both E.coli and G.xy, the speed of forming the biofilm has been slowed down, therefore we went through the study of growth and metabolism of G.xy and noticed that the glycerol has played a crucial role in metabolic route of G.xy. According to the researches, adequate amount of glycerol  is able to stimulate G.xy to secrete BC in the later phase. Based on what we have in mind, we decided to adjust the combination of carbon source  of culture medium, which is turn the former pattern that glucose as the single carbon source to integrated carbon source pattern which use  the glucose and glycerol to co-provide carbon source.
In addition, we as well as did the trails to measure the impact of yields of BC from other impact factor as ethanol and citric acid etc..("

Design of our sub-projects
Protein Import
Control over the peroxisomal proteome is an essential requirement for our project. Our objective is the obtainment of a fully orthogonal import system by utilizing the two peroxins Pex5 and Pex7.
Engineering of Pex5 and PTS1
Designing our receptors
To achieve the engineering of an orthogonal import pathway, we followed two approaches regarding Pex5. The first is based on targeted mutagenesis based on educated guesses which is first verified by molecular dynamics and later experimentally in the laboratory.    The second approach is based on a recently published paper: We searched for literature dealing with the modification of the peroxisomal import machinery. During our research we came across a paper of Cross et al., published in 2017, in which they present a synthetic construct of the Pex5 protein, partly Arabidopsis thaliana and partly Physcomitrella patens. Compared to the wild type Pex5, this one shows different binding affinities since it interacts with a PTS1* variant that does not interact with the wild type Pex5 Cross et al. . Since the protein sequences of yeast's and plants's Pex5 differ quite a lot, we aligned both sequences to understand where the mutations were set.
Figure 1.1: Alignment of the Arabidopsis thaliana's Pex5 and Saccharomyces cerevisiaePex5
Figure 1.2: Alignment of the yeast’s Pex5 with the Pex5 variant R19
The alignment shows three red marked amino acids we changed in our receptor sequence. Interestingly, these mutations are located within the TPR motifs of our Pex5 protein and this persuaded us to try out this receptor, we call it R19. Due to lack of time we tested this Pex5 variant in silico and in vivo simultaneously. We started molecular dynamics simulations with a couple of PTS variants that we already tested with our previous designs − one of them was actually the variant they used in the paper (YQSYY). The details and results of our structural modeling can be found in the modeling section .
Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work"

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," mathematical formula obtained from the concentration calibration curve, we are ready to create a test strip with AOX to measure alcohol concentration and apply it to be a blood alcohol meter. We called it IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter).
This work was done by the collaboration with BIONIME Corp. who is an innovator working on Blood Glucose Meter design and develop. We thank the executive vice president, Dr. Wiley Chung (Shie-Shiun Jung), went to Mingdao High School to help us develop the blood alcohol meter. From him, we not only learned the electrochemical chemistry, but also completed the amazing experiments in our lab.
This year, we got the idea from blood glucose meter and designed a brand-new IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter) and completed all the experiments to prove that our system works well. We’ve constructed 11 biobricks, analyzed the protein expression and enzyme activity, as well as do modeling in an electrochemical simulator. Although this is just a proof-of-concept study, through the collaboration with BIONIME Corp., we believe the prototype will soon be applied to a real blood alcohol meter for the public in the near future.
Eleven biobricks were completed. A novel part of Alcohol Oxidase (AOX) [BBa_K1991001] from Pichia Pastoris was synthesized by IDT, which codon was optimized for gene expression in E. coli. We also improved an existing BioBrick Part [BBa_K1694002], where NcoI site was created between the part and SpeI site for cloning a Lpp-OmpA (LO) fusion protein. However, we found an extra NcoI site on the chloramphenicol resistance gene. And we improved it by replacing NcoI site with BamHI site [BBa_K1991004]. As a result, we used it to make another new part of fusion protein, LO-AOX [BBa_K1991006], which would be expressed and displayed on E. coli cell surface. Finally, a constitutive promoter and RBS were used to drive the gene expression.
To test our gene expression system, we measured GFP level of E. coli carrying GFP and LO-GFP genes. LO-GFP fusion protein [ BBa_K1991010 ] was detected at a low intensity level but significantly expressed compared to wild-type E. coli or E. coli expression LO protein alone. To analyze the LO-AOX protein [ BBa_K1991009 ] expression, we run on a SDS-PGE"

We have a precise plan for our human practice project. We would like to study the emergence of complexity in many different fields and investigate how people deal with it. We will do this with interviews of experts in different fields, and with a survey for a wider outreach. We will also reach younger people by organizing talks in schools.

Construction of the regulator plasmids
Thursday, July 5th
Construction of the lasR regulator plasmid (piG0040)
Competent cells were transformed with piG0028 (K553003, lasR) and selected on chloramphenicol-LB-plates. Plasmid DNA was extracted by performing a miniprep. The relevant plasmid sequence was sequenced by Microsynth using the primers oiG0001 and oiG0002. Amplification of lasR by PCR using oiG0003 and oiG0004 resulted in the fragment fiG0004 (1.0 kb). The vector piG0034 (pSEVA 181) was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and PacI to fiG0001 (3.0 kb). The two fragments, fiG0001 and fiG0004, were assembled using Gibbson assembly. Thus we used the plasmid backbone of piG0034 and lasR of piG0028 to construct the lasR regulator plasmid piG0040. Competent cells were transformed with piG0040 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. Colony PCR using the primers oiG0035 and oiG0036 was conducted to check the size of the inserted fragment (expected bands at 1.0 and 1.2 kb). The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the same primers.

Overview
A small change in sequence, a big leap for mankind
Genome editing is a recent technique shown to be versatile in manipulating genomes of living organisms. The technique of genome editing is seen as one of the most promising methods in a wide range of fields such as the treatment of genetic diseases, improvement of food security and in diagnostics.
Genome editing technologies have provided scientists with the ability to rapidly and economically introduce sequence-specific modifications into the genomes of a broad spectrum of cell types and organisms. Compared to previous techniques of gene manipulation, gene editing targets specific sites in the genetic sequence to render a particular gene function “silenced” and offers a “permanent” silencing of the particular gene. One of the most popular and easy to use system is the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 protein. In this system, any modification to the genome is carried out by Cas9, an enzyme that can be directed to a specific region of the genome by a guiding sequence and carry out cleavage of the DNA, resulting in a change in gene function.
Genetic diseases are hard to cure. However base editing, a type of genome editing technique, has resulted in a paradigm shift in novel disease treatments. Such a system allows the modification of specific DNA bases, without causing any cleavage or breaks in the DNA strand, thus potentially minimising any off-target effects. In 2016, a group of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley demonstrated treatment of sickle cell anemia in mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (Dewitt et al., 2016). Each year, about"
