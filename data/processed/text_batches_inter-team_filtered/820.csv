Additional trials of media and various water samples were run on both the lachat and ICP as team members were trained in their use. Colony PCR and sequencing to confirm the transformation of phosphorus genes into E. coli were also begun, with completion planned to coincide with the conclusion of next week.
FRIDAY, JULY 30
Focus was placed on brainstorming possible development strategies of silica beads. Two components combine to make these beads: a sol phase and a buffer (Tris-HCl). The team has been trying to find the proper ratio of these two ingredients so beads solidify at an appropriate rate–too slowly, and an amorphous silica blob forms in the bottom of the mineral oil into which the beads drop; too quickly, and the mixture hardens inside the tubing through which it is dispensed. Cool temperatures slow the reaction, so the team has also tried completing the process in the cold room with mineral oil warmed on a hot plate, but to no avail. The current method involves the use of syringes to inject the two components into a small Y-shaped tube where they mix and then pass through a needle at the bottom to drop into mineral oil. According to calculations, 99,000 beads will be needed to fill a standard water filter canister; that’s a lot of drips!

Cellulases (MATLAB model)
MATLAB is a general-purpose mathematical tool, developed by Mathworks , and commonly used by engineers. Among other things, it can be used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by numerical integration.
An attempt was made to use MATLAB to model the degradation of cellulose into glucose in a biorefinery. But accurately predicting how much is converted in the synergistic system (where enzymes are kept close together) is difficult without literature to provide the ODEs and the kinetic parameters. Therefore this model only looks at the free floating (non-synergistic) enzyme approach. It is deterministic and is set by a series of initial conditions.

Assumptions
The mathematical model is based on the ODEs and kinetic parameters outlined in Kadam et al (2004) . The following are its assumptions and basis:
Underlying assumption: cellulose, cellobiose, and glucose concentrations change continuously with time.
Rate equations assume enzyme adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm model.
Glucose and cellobiose, which are the products of cellulose hydrolysis, are assumed to ""competitively inhibit enzyme hydrolysis"".
All reactions are assumed to follow the same temperature dependency Arrhenius relationship (shown"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source"

The conditions of satisfaction
We are looking for information  to answer the major problems found by the                 already existing websites on GMOs. We want to make our platform active and                 attractive for young, researchers and curious people.                 Our goal will be reached when our platform will inform about: An adequate                 definition of GMOs, news about GMOs (the advances in each sector for each                 country) , a  popularized regulation of GMO and a representative opinions.
Consequently, a target of 100 answers is expected per country for each                 survey to enable us to build our online platform.
The statistical analysis
As said above, we selected the surveys with around 100 answers. Also, 12                 out of the 23 questions were analysed to get the population opinion, to make                 hypothesis whether or not our project could be implemented in the country and                 to know if our interactive map was a special need to get more information about                 GMOs. Here are below the conclusions of the 3 surveys we analysed: France,                 Brazil and Mexico.
With no surprise, we found out that our “Softer Shock” product might struggle to find its place in France.
Several results support this conclusion: firstly, 78% of the population think             GMOs are not safe for the environment. Secondly, 144 out of 219 people (65.75%) were             concerned by the eventual presence of GMOs in agriculture or environment.             And finally, 44% of persons against the use of GMOs on crops to protect them             from harsh temperatures.
However, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s             requirements. It meets the needs of 65% people that wish to develop their knowledge             about GMOs.

In opposition with France, “Softer Shock” might succeed to find its place in Brazil.
Several results support this conclusion: Firstly, 38% of the population think that GMOs             are safe for the environment; Secondly, 49 out of 102 people (48%) are supporting the             development and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment.             And finally, the 75% of persons for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh             temperatures.
Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements.             It meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs.

Meet-up Ile-de-France
With great help from two of our fellow Parisian teams, iGEM Paris Saclay and iGEM IONIS, we hosted the iGEM Ile-de-France MeetUp on August 6 at the Pasteur Institute. This event was the highlight of our summer. The attendees of the MeetUp were people from iGEM Paris Bettencourt, iGEM Evry, iGEM Ionis, iGEM UPMC (IMPACT), and iGEM Paris Saclay. Every team had a 20 minutes presentation of their project, followed by questions and comments from the judges and the audience. The essence of the MeetUp was getting feedback and constructive criticism of the projects from the judges. In the judging committee we had:

The cherry on top of the Meetup was the quick demonstration of a drone given by a start-up company from Montreuil named ’Civic drone’ during the lunch break, but also the picnic in the hidden garden of the Pasteur Institute where all the teams gathered and bonded over wine and sandwiches. In the afternoon hours, the law students from iGEM Pasteur gave the audience a crash course in intellectual property law and its role in IGEM, which was followed by an interesting perspective on the same subject and on the concept of Open Source by Jonathan Keller, lawyer and legal consultant from La Pa"

While LASA has not specifically used them, flume hoods have been made available for us to be trained on
We always label our items. This way if they are misplaced we are able to find them still. It also helps nonLASA students identify our project parts
We also keep track of where we store things, in fact we have a refrigerator spreadsheet
Everyone knows how to access exits and where telephones are, in case of an uncontrollable chemical disaster
Each member of the team is trained on how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case the situation arises, we can use one.
Emergency Situations
All members know the contact to Environmental Health Services in case of an emergency
All members know where the exits and telephones are
All members know where the eyewashes and safety showers are located
All members can use a fire extinguisher in the case of an emergency
Biological Safety
As per the rules of iGEM, we stay away from all level three and four organisms, as they could cause serious harm to us
We also use mechanical pipettes not only to ensure better measurements but to increase control (2 for 1!)
We also get a two for one when we properly dispose of our pipette tips and beads: It keeps our lab clean and keeps bacteria under control
Wiping the work bench routinely with a disinfectant is also good for keeping bacteria under control and out of our experiment. It also keeps our bench clean
While this may seem like the most obvious, it is arguably one of the most important. No food or drink should be in the lab. If we need to eat a snack, there is a lounge just down the hall that we can go to and eat

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,", we learned that even small things can make a difference. Even when we were not actively searching for these changes, the thought of iGEM goes green was always in the back of our minds.
When TU Dresden reached out to teams and asked them to create a short sequence for a video on iGEM goes green, a couple of our members took it upon themselves to participate, and went to work. The filming of the short clip was a lot of fun, and made us rethink why we wanted to create a more environmentally friendly lab space in the first place.
We want to thank TU Dresden for the great amount of work they poured into creating iGEM goes green, and for trying to bring this amazing cause into the forefront of people's minds. For us, it was a great way to learn how to think more about how we act in and out of the lab, and about what we can do to help our planet in the long run.
We are also very much looking forward to seeing the finished iGEM goes green video at the Giant Jamboree!

Next to our work in synthetic biology, we also set ourselves the challenging task of developing a hydrogel. Since these hydrogels are supposed to be used on wounds, we needed to learn more about wound care and healing. We also focused on researching which effects the hydrogels would generally have. So, we got in touch with the iGEM-Team from Berlin . We believed since most of their team is made up of medical students, they could help us with our questions. On top of this, Team Berlin also is in contact with some experts at their university.
In our first meeting, we talked about our project and what we are planning to do with our hydrogel. Our detection system for wound infections was also a topic we brought up. In this meeting, we decided to hold a web seminar via Skype so they could help us with our questions. For this, the Berlin team prepared a presentation based on our questions and also consulted a dermatologist for research into the topic.
In the following seminar we learned a lot about different wound types, wound healing and wound care, especially in regards to hydrogels. We learned about applications for hydrogels on burns and diabetes wounds, because their moist setting supports wound healing.
The Berlin iGEM team gave us great information about what we need to consider for the development of a chitosan-hydrogel. We learned which pH-value supports wound healing best and which substances are currently used to treat burns. They also gave us helpful feedback about our ideas"

We can get numerical solutions easily by Matlab as soon as initial \(T_1\)and \(T_2\) are given. Obviously, initial \(T_1\) is related to the initial Taxol concentration. Accordingly, initial \(T_2\) is related to the initial GTP-dimer quantity. All these promoters are initial conditions in the experiment.
We consider a kind of initial conditions of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\). Actually, any initial \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the experiment can be modeled and we can predict the numerical trends. The solutions of one of our example are given in the following charts.  (initial \(T_1\)=50000, initial \(T_2\)=3000, initial \(G_{11}\)=3000, Initial \(G_{21}\)=1000)

Dialogues with law expert, Ms. Fang Ruan
We want to have a better understanding about law and regulation actuality in China. Meanwhile, We have great interest and also are concerned what will happen if synthetic biology is applied to human being. Sooner or later, based on the development of gene therapy, the technique used to modified human being will come true. However, what should we do to guarantee the safety? And is there any law about gene technology? Based on our concern, we have a talk with Ms. Fang Ruan, a judge from the People's Court of Jinjiang, China. She has great experience in judicial work in Intellectual Property Law. In the conversation between Jilin_China and Ms. Fang Ruan, she provided us with a full-scale perspective of gene technology law in China.
The following 4 questions are answered based on our conversation.
1. In China, what are the existing laws concerning gene technology?
The legal aspects of gene technology in our country, embodied in science and technology law，which is an important part of our legal system. Science and technology law refers to the state of science and technology activities arising from the various social relations to adjust the legal norms.
China has developed a number of technical and legal norms on encouraging innovation, safeguarding inventions and patent rights. In the Constitution, we mentioned that science and technology are part of the productive forces, in addition, the state has also formulated the "" Science and Technology Progress Law of the People's Republic of China"", "" Patent Law of the People's Republic of China "" and so on, all of these have a great impact on gene science and technology.
""Science and Technology Progress Law of the People's Republic of China"" is the basic law of our country, however, there are the protection of intellectual property rights and scientific and technological achievements reward of the laws and regulations related to gene technology,, such as "" Patent Law"", the legislation of scientific and technological research institutions and the management of science and technology associations, such as the ""Natural Science Research Institutions to establish, adjust and approve the pilot scheme"", there are also some international scientific and technological exchanges provisions, international treaties and agreements.
2. How popular is the law on gene science and technology nowadays? Whether it is necessary to increase the publicity？
The concept of scientific and technological law is first proposed by the Chinese people. But our development is extremely slow. In recent years, the United States has established more than 100 research centers of various types of technology, published dozens of specialized magazines, nearly a thousand kinds of monographs. Taiwan in recent years has also set up seven research"

During the summer, we worked hard to build our system, which consists of mainly three parts, and we got some quite promising results.                         Here we show a list of our major achievements, including experiments, modeling, hardware, human practice and collaborations.
We cloned several potential antibiotic degrading enzymes, including TetX monoxygenase (TetX) and MnCcP, and successfully expressed and purified them.
After enzymatic catalyzed reaction of tetracycline (Tet), it is necessary to enrich the remaining Tet before any further test. Working with our Advisor Cheng Hu, we successfully established a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using SupelTM –Select SPE (Sigma-Aldrich). This work shall to some extend, if not definitely, provide some guidance for future teams.
We qualitatively and quantitatively measured the antibiotic degrading abilities of four enzymes, and found out the most efficient one, the TetX.
By in vitro experiments, we characterized TetX comprehensively, getting its turnover number and its reactive kinetic properties.
As a proof-of-concept, we showed that TetX can degrade Tet in vivo. To measure the degrading rate, samples were taken for 30 minutes’ interval, and the amount of remaining Tet were measured by LC-MS or UV absorption.
We established a method of utilizing LC-MS and UV spectrophotometer to measure the degradation of Tet in a QUANTITATIVE way.
We demonstrated that Mn(III) can also degrade Tet, providing a basic idea for future work.
We successfully cloned 11 putative toxins onto a cloning vector, induced by aTc (anhydrotetracycline). We further cloned four antitoxins induced by IPTG.
Among the 11 hypothetical toxins, 7 showed different levels of toxicity. We measured the growth curve of bacteria expressing the toxins. By doing so, we can evaluate the toxicity of varies toxins.
We demonstrated that out of the four antitoxins cloned, three effectively neutralized their corresponding toxins.
We conducted an online survey concerning with antibiotic residues and resistance. We got more 1,200 responses, which provided sufficient data for us to analyze the knowledge and opinions of the public. Besides"

METAL BINDING PROTEIN
The use of the CutA protein is employed as a proof of concept because it is found in E. coli and binds to copper. This protein ensures that ion homeostasis is preserved within the cell, whereby the excess of copper ions is removed by this protein[5]. There will also be a hexahistidine tag for purification purposes. The CutA protein has three binding sites allowing for three copper ions to be bound per protein.
Our primary proof of concept proteins to be used are CutA and Cup1. Both are copper binding proteins to be used in the final construct attached to the ELP N- or C-terminal in order to effectively bind to ions. For protein purification, a hexahistidine tag will be used in the constructs for either protein.
In further applications of our project, there are many different proteins that can be used in our final system for the tailings ponds that are able to bind various metal ions. By using the CutA as well as Cup1 proteins as a proof of concept, this shows that our system is able to work properly with a metal binding protein.

They recommended us to be very careful with the dose and consider the addition of a fermentation inhibitor in our formula.
Concerning the final product being a dilution, they commented that this was difficult to apply since, if our product was to be applied frequently, it would be laborious to have to spray every three days, for example, 2,000 boxes of bees.
In their city, the foulbrood that represents a problem is the European.
Finally, they congratulated us for our research and stressed the importance of feedback between researcher and producer since this way we can collaborate in a more effective way, guaranteeing a bidirectional communication.
MSc Alejandro Romo offered us to experiment with his bees in his laboratory at Cuauhtémoc.
After this meeting, our project changed to the production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli for the inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius
Detailed Description
We thank Mr. Guillermo Rodríguez for inviting us to the monthly meeting of the Cuauhtemoc's beekeeping society. The society consisted of approximately 33 beekeepers and researchers who gave us a warm welcome, listened to our project, and gave us their opinion on particular details that we had to consider or improve. They were happy that young students of other disciplines were interested in their work and bees, we explained to them the reason it was important for us to talk with them and why we had chosen to work with bees in our project, something that made them curious.
Until that meeting, our project consisted of the production of antimicrobial peptides in Pichia pastoris for exclusively the inhibition of the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. We planned on using yeasts due to their high capacity to carry out post-translational modifications, similar to the protein folding mechanisms of bees and their ability to secrete heterologous proteins to the environment, in this case, our antimicrobial peptides. The intention was to apply these yeasts in a solution with hexane extract of the plant Achyrocline satureioides which its efficiency against P. larvae has already been shown previouslysup>2, in presence also of surfactins, the surfactin would have a synergistic effect with the hexane extract.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html," a probiotic.
INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
After choosing our topic of healthy ageing we spoke to various researchers in the area. We especially valued the opportunity to speak to Aubrey De Grey, an author of books such as 'advocate for an indefinite human lifespan' and 'ending ageing'. He is the co-founder of SENS research and is renowned in the field for his research. We were particularly looking forward to discussing the idea of a antioxidant probiotic with him following his interest in the free radical theory of ageing and his positive view that ""Ageing is emphatically not an inescapable destiny"".
In conversation with Aubrey de grey, it was suggested to us that our lycopene probiotic would need to be controlled. This is because reactive oxide species are useful in important signalling processes which act to protect the cell. Taking on board this advice, we considered a method to  control lycopene expression.
 
 
To achieve this we decided to look through the registry at existing promoter which would select lycopene expression only in 'high stress' conditions which mimic the imbalance of stress within the cell. Hence, we decided to combine lycopene with a stress sensitive promoter which would only release lycopene when cells are stressed. This promoter was NarK. We are very grateful to Aubrey for his insight and enthusiasm for our project, and also thankful that he took time to speak with our team and influence our project in a positive way.
To watch our conversation click here .
OXIDATIVE STRESS
Early in our discussion of what we could target in ageing, we spoke to various academics, including Dr. Max Yun, a Senior Research Associate in the UCL’s Division of Biosciences who recommended a paper to us - ‘The Hallmarks of Ageing’. This highlighted not only is ageing a complex, multi-faceted problem, but also that it wouldn’t be possible to target all hallmarks, instead, we chose to focus on reactive oxygen species (ROS) which underpin some of the hallmarks (1) of ageing.
For instance, endogenous damage caused by ROS leads to DNA lesions including telomerase shortening(1). These lesions essentially lead to genomic instability (1). Ageing in this instance is caused by imbalance between DNA damage and DNA repair, for instance insufficient repair mechanism or excessive DNA damage promotes ageing (1).
Oxidative stress can also cause proteins to unfold and aggregate, again leading to ageing (1). We found greater strength in this argument when we were shown data from research undertaken at Imperial University showing oxidative stress to have a detrimental impact upon protein"
Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have also gained a lot.
Currently, the type of substances that can be monitored in a working fermentation tank is limited to simple molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide. The dynamic monitoring of more complicated compound like the target protein and its intermediate product is not available in most cases. That may be a problem our memory device can solve.
The infection of different bacteria in the fermentation tank can be a serious problem. If we want to monitor the substance directly inside the fermentation tank, special attention must be paid to control the spread of the engineered E. coli. A suicide gene triggered by condensed bacteria population may be a good choice
Applications in daily life
What can a tiny sequential memory machine do in our daily life? That is also a question we are interested in. So, we advertised on our Wechat platform to collect ideas from the public. We got about three hundred clicks in a couple of hours.
The gif file on the left is the short video of the paper model we used to explain our circuit to the public. We posted the short video in our Wechat article.
We got ideas like ‘building a memo in sequential order, so that things can be done properly’. The ideas are quite crazy and may not be fulfilled by our project, but we do see an affection for an easy check of all the collected data via cellphone apps. If we want to popularize our memory device among the public, trying to digitalize the result can be a good start.
Conversations
At the same time, we are also involved in lively conversations both within the iGEM community and the more diverse world beyond
At the school club fair
The club fair of our university is very famous for its diversity and its large scale. To get more new ideas about our work from people with different majors, we brought our project to the club fair. One of our team members dressed up as a cute E. coli to interact with visitors.The conversations were far more thought-provoking than we had expected. Not only did we receive admiration for  delivering a new way to look at biology research, we also received challenges and questions for the attempt to ‘play the role of god’. The questions made us think more critically about our work and it remind us never to take it for granted that life is there to be programmed. At the end of the activity, we all gained a lot. We also recruited about 20 candidates for the iGEM team next year and have a lot more people to visit our Wechat platform.

Molecular databases such as Reactome and KEGG support the visualization and analysis of biomedical networks [COWH11, KGSF12]. These pathways usually consist of enzymes, substrates and products, and their corresponding reaction processes.Websites of both databases provide 2D network visualizations which are often enriched with the information where specific genes or proteins are located. These images are curated and the corresponding subcellular localizations are usually reliable.
But problems arise if biomedical networks are (semi-)automatically generated based on heterogeneous database information. For example, if a set of proteins – e.g. correlated with a specific disease – is found by combining information from different databases, consistent information regarding the subcellular localization is usually missing. To obtain the localization information, again various databases can be consulted. But the problem is now to obtain reasonable localizations in the context of the newly created biological network. For this purpose, the CELLmicrocosmos 4 PathwayIntegration was developed:
http://Cm4.CELLmic roc osmos.org
Using subcellular localization charts it is possible to compare, analyze and predict the protein localization based on a number of established databases [SKDA13]. Direct links to the original sources enable the validation of the localization predictions. Moreover, the results can be mapped into a virtual cell 3D environment which is directly connected to the 2D visualization of the biomedical pathway. Based on the jSBML library, protein- related networks can be imported from various sources[DRDD11].

METU-BIN_Ankara,2011,Team:METU-BIN Ankara#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," of the software we have been developing for efficient use of the parts database.
Classification of BioBricks in the Parts Registry with gene products that are pathogenic, infective or toxic with potential threats to researchers, public health and environment are some of our main suggestions. When this information is available it can be integrated into the database search tools and users of the Parts Registry will be aware of the potential dangers of any biobrick they are planning to use in their devices. Some might argue that this classification might point to the candidate biobricks for misuse, but as METU-BIN Team we support that the researchers should be informed about the potential threats of the parts and this information should be easy to access so that they can take precautions for their designs.
Any information needs to turn into action to become an actual threat as in garage bioterrorism. But one would need to physically access to the biobricks distributed through iGEM's Parts Registry, so increased security measures to control, screen and follow the laboratories, which requests biobricks and registering users, is a natural start point for a more safer Parts Registry. As an initial precaution to make our software, M4B, safer we will be following the users of our software by their IPs and if needed we can restrict access to our software website to academic users or to only iGEM registered laboratories. If a list of high risk IPs is provided to us by iGEM we can cross-check our users in real time and inform iGEM about these suspicious activities. In addition, if the biobricks in the registry are classified by iGEM, we can keep the list of users whose search involves high risk biobricks or the search results with devices which includes potentially hazardous subparts and track the access of these users to our server site to inform iGEM.
At the same time, we are aware of the fact that iGEM's biobrick distributions are not the only source of devices that are built with synthetic biology techniques. Most molecular biology laboratories would have the capability of building biobricks and devices as in the Parts Registry. So, any new security measure on access to the Parts Registry and to our server site to use M4B should not be a restrain on researchers, should support the creative side of the synthetic biology, aiding to the new innovations in the field.

These results only signify improvements from the last set of minipreps for parts E0110, E0130, C0132, pRS306, and Z0842.  Clearly overestimated the amount of DNA and used too much liquid for elution.  This overestimation could have stemmed from the fact that 1-1.5 mL of each culture was used for making glycerol stocks, thus reducing the number of cells going into the miniprep.  However, one should note that there were rather sizable pellets after centrifuging the overnight cultures.  Thus, it is possible that, due to the 18 hours in the incubator, many of the cells may have been dead when the miniprep began, which could have played a role in lower-than-anticipated yields.
Realized that P0501 and P0560 had been forgotten in this second round of minipreps, as no cultures of these two parts were made.

In their representations, each part has both upstream and downstream domain and adjacent parts are connected by forming a bond between the upstream domain of one part and the downstream domain of the other. In addition, all the agents in Kappa Language are allowed to appear in any order so that it may blur the recognition of spatial relationship of agents; it is hard to pick up the agents in a DNA chain with the correct order. For example, a complex of RNA polymerase binding to trp promoter (MIT registry ID K191007) with LOVTAP on p2 can be rewritten as `\textbf{\small{DNA(up!2,bind,type$\sim$K191007p3), LOVTAP(dna!1), DNA(bind!1,type$\sim$K191007p2,down!2), RNAP(dna,rna)}}'. However, most readers, even specialists, have some difficulties to recognize and map it to the molecule it represents in a short time, making the process of model contruction laborious and error-prone.
Aiming to simplify the representation of DNA and RNA sequences, we use the hyphen character `-' to connect two adjacent BioBricks rather than through bonding between one pair of upstream and downstream sites. This is good for visualization since the structure of molecules pictured in this way can be understood eaisly by readers. As to the syntax of single BioBrick representation, there are some minor differences with Kappa language: (1) the name of each BioBrick should be the same with the identifier of that BioBrick in the MIT registry; (2) the reversed sequence of each DNA BioBrick is assumed when an asterik character `*' appears following its name; But the sites of each BioBrick are defined in the same way as Kappa Language does and those names should be different with each other indicating equivalent sites are not supported. For example, the reverse part of Lac promoter (r0010) can be represented as r0010*(), where sites in the parenthesis are not shown. It is worthy of nothing that the parenthesis cannot be omitted even for BioBricks that do not take any sites. By convention, a DNA sequence written from left to right is assumed to read from 5' end to 3' end.
As shown in the example of Lac dimer, a molecule may contain several agents as members separated by `.', by which means an agent is the basic unit of its composition. In MoDeL, the basic unit, however, has been expanded horizontally to be a"

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. Among many we can find severe health issues and resistance development in the most commonly occurring family of strongyles. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these parasites. By reprogramming a smart bacteria to detect and report the presence of the parasites, we aim to develop a simple diagnostic method. This will provide the tools necessary to help farmers both to make decisions on whether to treat their animals and prevent infection.
Small Strongyles
Cyathostominae
Small Strongyles
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 9].
Statistics Box:
In a study of 461 horses in Sweden, 53,7 % of all horses were discovered to be infected [1].                          From July to September the prevalence was estimated to 78,4% in the horse population, indicating a seasonal trend for infection rate [1].                          Similar trends are seen in Europe and North America showing reported cases with 100% of horses showing small strongyle infection [2].
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach number up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts,  millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [6]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [10].
By providing a better diagnostic tool, farmers will be able to know when to treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.
Methods of Detection
Currently the only method for detection and counting of how many"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," field of synthetic biology. It appears that in many technological disciplines, such as aerospace engineering or chemical engineering, risk analyses are done in a more standardized manner. The relative novelty of the field of synthetic biology is a possible explanation for the absence of a well-developed risk management system, however, this is not an excuse. The potentially large and controversial impacts the integration of GMOs in society and nature could have, create the need for proper and complete identification, assessment, mitigation and management of all synbio-associated risks. Not only our team, but also the dutch national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM) has identified the need for a watertight system to perform these important risk analyses and we have collaborated with them to develop the tool. Therefore, we decided to develop an easy risk assessment tool that other iGEM teams or research groups could use as a standard to evaluate the safety risks associated with their project.
The idea behind the tool
The tool provides help in determining the relevance of general risks encountered in synthetic biology experimenting. We encountered several complicating factors in the design and implementation of the Risk assessment tool. Firstly, a complete risk analysis is of considerable size and complexity, and project-specific factors play an important role in determining the project-related risks. The time frame of iGEM and the presence of many important subparts next to policy and practice and safety rendered making a very extensive risk assessment framework impossible. Furthermore, assessment of risks – their probability of occurrence and severity of consequence – is only reliable and generally applicable when supported by large sets of statistical data. The novelty of synthetic biology, as mentioned before, implies that reliable assessment of all possible risks is simply impossible due to lack of data. These difficulties resulted in the decision to make a fairly generic tool, applicable to a wide range of synbio-oriented projects.
Risk level is defined as ‘Probability of occurrence’ times ‘Severity of consequence’. A risk with very mild consequences, such as being stung by a mosquito, can become critical when the probability of occurrence is very high – e.g. a probability of 0.8 out of 1 that you will be stung once every minute. Conversely, a risk with disastrous consequences, such as being hit by a truck, does not have to be critical when the probability is very low – e.g. a probability of 1 in a million (0.000001) that it will occur once in your life. Theoretically, it is best to design an experiment in such a way that the risks have minor consequences and a low probabilities. In practice, however, this is not always possible; though"

We will also take into account pre-cautionary perspectives (things are bad until considered safe) and pro-actionary perspectives (good until proven otherwise). Our paper will involve two (or more) applications of our signaling system that will be evaluated through E3LS. Can’t wait to get working on it!

Lactobachill: a smart psychobiotic with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties
According to the World Health Organization, depressive disorders affect more than 300 million people worldwide, and severe cases could lead to life threatening outcomes such as suicide. Although depression is a multifactorial condition, recent studies have shown that alterations in the microbiota cannot only affect human nutrition and energy metabolism, but can also lead to a variety of diseases and have a negative impact on mood and cognition. In recent years, psychobiotics (i.e., probiotic microorganisms that provide a benefit to the mental health of the host) have emerged as an attractive strategy for the treatment and prevention of a variety of psychiatric disorders. Alternative approaches like this are critical due to the increasing prevalence of depression and suicide worldwide, as well as the side-effects associated with conventional antidepressant medications.
Accumulating evidence has shown that there is a strong correlation between alterations in the gut microbiota and the immune system, which could ultimately lead to systemic inflammation due to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, and IL-6. In particular, IL-6 trans-signalling has been implicated in the development of a variety of pathologies, such as chronic inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, as well as psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Furthermore, clinical evidence has demonstrated that patients with anxiety and depression exhibit high plasma concentrations of IL-6, as well as increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress. Because of this, significant efforts have been made towards the development of therapeutic strategies that can ameliorate the proinflammatory effects of IL-6. However, the specific inhibition of IL-6 for the treatment and prevention of depression remains largely unexplored.
Based on this evidence, we aimed to develop Lactobachill, a psychobiotic that is able to sense the levels of nitrosative stress in the body, and respond by secreting different soluble receptors that can inhibit IL-6 trans-signalling. Briefly, we"
TU-Eindhoven,2012,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," also arranged recordings of the day, which were streamed live. They are still available online: presentations part 1 , presentations part 2 .
All in all, the day was an unique experience. It was a first opportunity to test presentation skills and a first chance to set up collaborations. But most importantly, the day warranted a bond between the Dutch iGEM teams. Friendly contact with your competitors can provide perceptive understanding of the competition. Besides, isn’t there a saying about keeping your friends close, but your enemies closer?
Matchmaker NTNU-Trondheim
The NTNU-Trondheim team had an excellent idea this year: a Matchmaker for collaborations. We soon posted two offers on the matchmaker:
The iGEM team of TU Eindhoven offers help with the BioBrickTM characterization. For instance, we can measure the behavior during cultivation, response time, the kinetics of the expressed BioBrickTM and, of course, other ways of characterization can be discussed.
And:
We're going to make you an offer you can't refuse... Only lab geeks in your team? No modeling experience? Getting stuck with all the differential equations needed to describe your problem? Or do you just need a check for the correctness of your model? At Eindhoven University of Technology, the modeling part certainly is not new for us! Contact us!  Programming languages: MATLAB, MATHEMATICA and (if needed) Python and Java
Unfortunately, no one responded to our characterization offer, but two teams responded to our modeling offer. The Queens_Canada team requested help in setting up a model for their project and the Trieste team wanted help in verifying their model.
Offering modelling help - Queens_Canada
The Queens_Canada team contacted us for help in setting up a model for their project. After a few emails, we decided a Skype-meeting would be the most efficient way of discussing a model. The Queens_Canada team had no plans yet for their model, so we gave them input on what they should be able to model and what options they could consider. Their wiki-freeze is a week later than ours, so we have not seen any results of their model at the moment of writing. We hope our suggestions led to some inspiration and that the team was able to create a working model!

The Trieste team contacted us for help with verifying correctness of their model. After a few emails about their project, we raised some questions concerning their differential equations. Soon the deadline approached and we have not seen any model results, but we hope we helped them along and"

We collaborated with City of New York Kingsborough Community College iGEM Team to collect the necessary             data to characterize the results from their protocol with access to EtBr, where we prepared a sample of DNA             with a concentration of their choice (0.5 ng/µl) and a 1 µg/mL dilution of DNA. Then, we created a spot by             adding 1 uL of the diluted DNA to 9 uL of diluted EtBr -- for a total of 10 uL per spot (sample picture             below). We provided five samples. We also exchanged ideas about our iGEM projects. Thanks to Amy Yang for presenting CUNY Kingsborough iGEM's exciting research project :)
We also collaborated with CUNY Kingsborough Community College iGEM Team on EtBr project with same 6 samples - for one we took the picture with the overhead light turned off and for the other with the overhead light turned on. In retrospect, our DNA sample concentration was not very high to start off with and when it was diluted the concentration decreased even more.

Abstract
As Synthetic Biology field is on the rise, iGEM also grows up and number of parts in parts registry increase with submission of more complex constructs each year. Our first milestone was to perform more efficient standardization on parts entry due to facing some difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry. We also used Software Requirements Specification, Software Design Description and Quality Plan approaches to define requirements for each part and building blocks, risks and design art elements of the designed software program.
Next, we have used graph theoretic modeling to visualize relations between parts and to standardize representation of the parts as much as possible. It will help us when we try to find input-output relations between either biobrick parts or constructs. By this way, our program BIOGUIDE will act as a guide for searhing biobricks and will provide alternative pathway choices to users for construction of the most reliable devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs.
Team
METU Turkey Software is an interdisciplinary team of 7 students and     4 advisors from various backgrounds such as Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics,     Computer Engineering and Computer Education and Instructional Technology.     We have put our knowledge and experience in our fields together to bring     a much needed solution to a daily problem in field of synthetic biology     for iGEM 2010

Design
In this section, our aim is synthesize the TlpB protein in our E.coli for to E.coli can penetrate to the stomach mucus layer, which is our pathogenic bacteria, H.pylori, resides.
For enhance the production of our protein TIpB, we aim to assemble our TIpB gene with T7 promoter which is a fast and strong promoter during we design our parts.
For controlling the system, we decided to add a Lac Operator, which is LacI protein can bind, between TIpB gene sequence and promoter. We searched for a expression vector that include Lac Operon and we found that peT45-b has the properties we want and we decided to use that vector.
When we order our genes we added RFC10 prefix site to 3’ end and RFC10 suffix site to the 5’ end of TlpB gene and also we added BamHI and XhoI restriction site sequence on the Pet45-b for cloning.
We planed to cloning TlpB gene that we ordered as described above to the Pet45-b vector with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes.
When this cloning achieved succesfully, there will be a construct that with order T7 Promoter-Lac Operon (LacO)- HisTag-TlpB and also there are LacI constructive promoter and LacI protein sequence ,in front"

During Bio-festival held by School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, we seized the        opportunity to popularize the concept of synthetic biology and immunotherapy and talk to public about our project. At the same time,        we issued questionnaires about CAR-T therapy (details in Human Practices-Survey of CAR-T Therapy page).
Bio-festival was an annual event in our school, which was aimed to popularize biological knowledge to public as well as students from        other majors. Together with SYSU-Software, we apply for booths of Bio-festival.
Our booth in Bio-festival
We made a synthetic biology version of the game ""You draw I guess"". We created detailed rules        for this game and created three levels.Whether the game participants know synthetic biology or not, they can participate in the game        and learn from the game.
Words for the easy level include transgene, cancer, laboratory animal, etc.
Words for the medium level include T cell, gene modification, immunity, etc.
Words for the hard level include CAR-T therapy, CRISPR Cas9, cytokine storm, etc.
We made explanation for every word and every level, participants could look up for it when they played the game. Participants who        puzzled out more than 3 words in one minute would receive prizes. The more questions they puzzled out, the more prizes they could        have.
In total, we gave away one bucket of chocolate (1/3 eaten by our team members), and more than 20 bonsais.
Some of the participants' works
The board game version of this game was shown to the public during Bio-festival and every participant received prizes. If there is a        chance, we will try to make an online version（maybe in next year）."
ICT-Mumbai,2017,Team:ICT-Mumbai#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Week 13: Discussions and decisions!
After a negative 3A result, we discussed and planned our next plan of action.
Week 14: Examination time!
We could not work this week as our university mid-semester examinations were scheduled.
Week 15: Eureka moment, again!
We learnt that indC from Photorhabdus luminescens encodes for indigoidene synthase which when acted on glutamine yields a blue coloured compound called indigoidine.We started looking for indC in the registry and found that the 2013 Heidelberg team had designed a range of parts with indC. We checked for their availability and ordered for these parts both from the registry as well as the Heidelberg team.
Week 16: Starting anew!
We cloned glnA in pET-43.1b vector between sites NdeI and HindII. While waiting for indC parts, we discussed about possible collaborations with other teams and started working on the team wiki>
Week 17: indC arrives!
We received indC (BBa_K1152008, BBa_K1152018 and BBa_K1152019) from the iGEM registry, whereas BBa_K1152013 and pRB5 were generously sent by the Heidelberg team. BBa_K1152008 was transformed, prepped, ligated with pET 43.1b+glnA and transformed in E. coli DH5α competent cells.
Four colonies of transformants (43+glnA+indC) were screened by performing RE digestion with NdeI
Results: Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed band of ~7000 bp in all colonies tested.
To reconfirm, colony 3 (C-3) was inoculated in LB+Amp. Plasmid prep of this colony was performed the next day and confirmed by double digestion with NotI and XhoI. Release of indC fragment (3855bp) was checked by running a 1% agarose gel. We could not see a band of the correct size.
Lane 2 contains 1kb DNA ladder whereas lane 3 contains RE digested pET 43.1b+glnA+indC.
Week 18: Getting glnA in place!
Since the concentration of G1_F1 obtained from IDT was very low, we PCR amplified it using Phusion polymerase.
From left to right: G1_F1, G1_F2 followed by 1kb DNA ladder
In the end, we determined the concentrations of G1"
Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," pOpt_mVenus. By surrounding the first promoter with the iGEM prefix and suffix, we created an iGEM compatible protein expression plasmid . In this way, teams can remove the suffix and replace it with a codon-optimized coding sequence for heterologous proteins of interest, or remove the promoter region entirely, testing alternate promoters and coding sequences upstream of a hygromycin B selection cassette.
Genetic engineering of microalgae is not new. C. reinhardtii, in particular, has been explored as a platform for heterologous proteins for years but to a far lesser extent than mammalian cells or higher-order plants. Although they're difficult to engineer, microalgae are poised to disrupt biofuel, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. With their primary reliance on CO2 and their capacity for producing complex proteins, microalgae like C. reinhardtii represent the chassis of the future."

The samples were then stained with 50 µL of a 0.03% CV solution and allowed to incubate for five minutes. The samples were again centrifuged at 16,000 × g for two minutes and the supernatant containing excess CV was discarded. The pelleted biofilm was then washed with 800 µL of 95% EtOH without resuspension, centrifuged for 30 seconds, and the EtOH was discarded. The EtOH wash was repeated twice more for a total of three washes. The samples were then resuspended in 200 µL EtOH, transferred to a 96-well plate, and incubated for five minutes. The plate was then shaken for ten seconds and absorbance readings were taken for each sample at 540 nm, the absorbance wavelength of CV.
The above graph shows both the average pellet weight and the average absorbance readings for samples treated with 0, 2.5, 12.5, and 25 µL of α-Amylase. There is a distinct reduction in the amount of biofilm growth between untreated and treated samples, with samples treated with 25 µL α-Amylase showing a 65.8% decrease in biofilm formation after 48 hours. While this clearly shows the ability of α-Amylase to inhibit biofilm formation by V. cholerae, further characterization is needed to determine the capacity of α-Amylase to degrade preexisting biofilms.
The biofilm assay was again run with Dispersin B as the treatment enzyme, and similar data was gathered:
The above graph shows the average absorbance readings for samples treated with 0, 2.5, 12.5, and 25 µL of Dispersin B. There is a distinct reduction in the amount of biofilm growth between untreated and treated samples, with samples treated with 25 µL Dispersin B showing a 40.0% decrease in biofilm formation after 48 hours. While this clearly shows the ability of DspB to inhibit biofilm formation by V. cholerae, we did not see any degradation of the biofilm at treatment T = 48 with one hour of treatment incubation. Further characterization is needed to determine the capacity of Dispersin B to degrade preexisting biofilms.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

HUMAN PRACTICES & OUTREACH
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Intercellular Coordination Through Community Signaling
Cells in a local population have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus. This noisiness may be due to differences in extracelluar environment or intracellular molecular makeup. Yet these cells often need to coordinate and respond in a concerted way. Our project seeks to understand the complex intercellular interactions that must happen to produce such a specific community phenotype.
Our goal is to create a synthetic framework that uses cellular communities to model collective behaviors emergent from individual autonomous rules.

Fig. 7: Luminescence corrected with the volume of the collected fraction plotted against the fraction during purification of <partinfo>K525311</partinfo>. Abbreviations: s.n. = supernatant, F = filtrate, R = retentate, FT = flow through, E10 = elution with 100 mM NaCl.
The purification strategy has to be improved. The inclusion bodies cannot be purified because urea damages the luciferase irreversible (data not shown). The loss due to adsorption of the SgsE | luciferase fusion protein to PES membranes could be avoided by using different membranes. The binding conditions of the IEX have to be improved as well. Anyway, the idea behind this purification strategy could be a starting point for a better strategy. Possibilities for improvement are:
Different membranes for ultra- / diafiltration
Other binding conditions for the IEX capturing step (higher pH)
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography as purification step after IEX (works in general, data not shown)
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for polishing
Immobilization behaviour
After purification, solutions of monomeric SgsE S-layer proteins can be recrystallized and immobilized on silicon dioxide beads in HBSS (Hank's buffered saline solution). After the recrystallization procedure the beads are washed with and stored in ddH2O at 4 °C in the dark. The fluorescence of the collected fractions of a recrystallization experiment with <partinfo>K525305</partinfo> are shown in Fig. 8. 100 mg beads were coated with 100 µg of protein. The figure shows, that not all of the protein is immobilized on the beads (supernatant fraction) but the immobilization is quite stable (very low fluorescence in the wash). After the immobilization, the beads display a high fluorescence indicating the binding of the SgsE | mCitrine fusion protein.
Figure 8: Measured fluorescence of collected fractions of immobilization of purified <partinfo>K525305</partinfo> on silica dioxide beads (n = 3, 100 mg mL-1 SiO2, time of recrystallization: 4 h).
Optimal bead to protein ratio for immobilization
To determine the optimal ratio of silica beads to protein for immobilization, the degree of clearance ϕC in the supernatant is calculated and plotted against the concentration of silica beads used in the accordant immobilization experiment ("

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rectify misconceptions. We tried to ask students and parents questions like - “do you think it is dangerous to work with bacteria” or “is genetic modification safe?” Initial responses were generally negative, but the questions gave us a platform to address the issues.
The concept of toehold switches had also proved extremely challenging to explain. We subsequently developed the analogy of a knot to explain them. The knot prevents a protein making factory (ribosome) from reading the instructions (mRNA) to make a protein that glows (GFP). Through diagrams, and use of animations, we were able to explain the concept of our project. We delivered an assembly where we used this analogy to explain our project and sent out a quiz. To our delight people understood most of our project and a few understood nearly everything. 109 completed the quiz and the majority scored over 75%. Find out more on our engagement page .
We thereby vastly improved our education and public engagement programmes, learning from how people to develop an approach for explaining difficult concepts in an accessible and interesting way. We improved our presentation and communication skills throughout the project. We were delighted that rest of the open days, as well our assemblies and workshops went so well and got people interested in synthetic biology.

Even though they are well described and characterized, peptide aptamers are not used to the same extent as antibodies.
in therapeutic applications , the peptide aptamer must not be immunogenic in humans. By choosing a protein of human origin as the scaffold protein, like the human thioredoxin, we expect it to be less immunogenic than other potential scaffolds. With an estimated half-life of 100 hours, Reference: Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. 2015. Available from: http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam1?P10599%402-105. the human thioredoxin provides a stable scaffold and helps prevent the peptide aptamer for premature degradation. This is of course the half-life of the non-recombinant hTrx. The half-life for the recombinant hTrx is probably influenced by the insertion of the randomly generated peptide sequence.
Peptide aptamers are by far not the only antibody mimetics known. Other affinity proteins have been studied throughout the years - and few even commercialized. Reference: Key Benefits: Affimers have some simple but essential advantages over antibodies: Avacta Life Sciences;  [updated 19-08-2015]. Available from: https://www.avactalifesciences.com/key-benefits. However the market is very small. We believe that the hTrx-based peptide aptamer in combination with the bacterial two-hybrid screening method provides an easy and fast alternative to antibody production.

DMPA cells in M9 medium didn’t grow in any case (with and without polyamines).

The Ligase Chain Reaction Protocol
INTRODUCTION
The Ligase Chain Reaction Protocol (LCR) is designed to replace and improve the current Templateless Chain Reaction Protocol (TPCR). The LCR is thought to have many distinct advantages:
1.) Accuracy of BB sequence should be increased (theoretically).
2.) The actual construction of the BB should be considerably easier thanks to the overlapping feature of the oligonucleotides.
3.) Money should be saved throughout the entire workflow because the LCR only needs to be run once to produce workable results.
In order to make a working protocol we must first subject the given protocol to stress tests to test for robustness.   The second part of our experiments should be to test known working samples of the LCR trials in order to prove that the experimental procedure works correctly. (We did this because our oligonucleotides were built incorrectly) We used samples from Jennifer Tullman’s batch of 3L.3_23.A1 BB.  The third part of our testing will be to assemble the failed BB’s from the Intersession 2009 work that Mary and I worked on.

Description
Protein purification is important to both biopharmaceutical production and scientific research. Producing recombinant  proteins with high purity is essential for protein drug-based therapies, protein structural analyses and functional studies. Most currently used protein purification techniques, such as commercial resins conjugated by various ligands, different types of chromatography and ultracentrifugation, require expensive investment, special device or tedious procedure. Meanwhile, they have different flaws in getting purified proteins, such as low specificity, long-term operating procedures and harsh conditions to sacrifice protein activity; thus, many of them, even with their combinations, cannot meet the required protein purity and quality for many applications. For instance, affinity chromatography is reputed for its high affinity, but tightly bound proteins typically require relatively extreme eluting conditions to disassociate from affinity columns; ultracentrifugation or size exclusion separates samples based on molecular weight difference, but they can co-purify other proteins and large molecules of lipid or nuclear acids. Thus, developing fast, easy to operate and economic approaches to purify recombinant proteins with high quality is urgently needed.
Fig.1 Purification progress by using the Nickel column
Our team developed a novel protein purification approach that eliminates most weaknesses of other techniques. Our method is based on the highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation between Spytag (a peptide with 13 amino acids) and Spycatcher (a peptide with 116 amino acids). We also take the advantage of a magnetic bacterium AMB-1 that can produce magnet particles, also called Magnetosome, covered by a bilayer phospholipid membrane, in which Mms13 protein is anchored. We generate Spycatcher-Mms13 and express this fusion protein in AMB-1 bacteria to make Spycatcher linked to the Magnetosome. A protein of interest with a Spytag at its N- or C-terminus is expressed in E. coli and present in bacterial lysate. The Spycatcher-Mms13-linked Magnetosome can specifically and covalently conjugate to the Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet. Due to covalent linkage,"

The Project
The RMIT University iGEM project will attempt to create a peptide expression platform using Synthetic Biology. The recombinant production of protein is routine in science and industry. Despite protein expression being achievable, peptide expression is frequently too complicated or not economically viable; peptides are small and often contain very little – or even no secondary structure – making them highly susceptible to proteolysis and other cellular processes.
In the laboratory for research purposes, carrier proteins with affinity for a purification matrix are commonly employed, allowing “protection” of the peptide intracellularly and providing a defined bioprocess. There are several limitations to this technology that curtails the scale: Firstly, the process is extremely inefficient as it expends the feedstock and cellular metabolism to essentially produce large amounts of a worthless carrier protein (as much as 98% of the protein-peptide fused product by mass)., Secondly, affinity resins used to capture the carrier protein are expensive and rarely congenial to scalable chromatography unit operations such as expanded bed chromatography., Thirdly, there is a requirement to separate the peptide from the carrier protein that often utilises a protease. Proteases are expensive at elevated scales, and despite popular beliefs are actually inefficient with best estimates ranging in ratio yields of 1:40 – 1:200 for the desired product as a “good” outcome due to inefficiencies, non-specific cleavage or loss during purification. For these reasons there are very few commodity peptides made recombinantly or even by semi-synthetic methods, with solid-phase peptide synthesis remaining the industry benchmark.
The RMIT University iGEM project poses the question: Can the bottlenecks of purification and proteolysis be removed from the workflow to economically produce a peptide and commodity carrier protein? In this project we propose the thermostable protein Taq polymerase may be used as a carrier molecule to allow for the production of a peptide that will be attached to the Taq commodity enzyme. The peptide-Taq fusion will be attached by a thermolabile bond – an Asp/Pro bond in between the peptide and the Taq Polymerase, with the intention of releasing the peptide-Taq fusion products by thermolysis. The hypothetical bioprocess will involve heating the bacteria below the threshold of the thermolabile bond, then following clarification or polishing, heating above the threshold to separate the"

Used BioBricks
This is a list of all BioBricks we used from the registry or created by ourselves and a short explanation, why and / or how we used them. The list is sorted alphabetically.
BioBrick (name and partnumber)
Status
Comment
double terminator, <partinfo>B0017</partinfo>: <partinfo>B0017 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
from registry
This is a double terminator which contains two <partinfo>B0010</partinfo> terminators. We used this double terminator instead of the commonly used <partinfo>B0015</partinfo> double terminator (which was assembled from the <partinfo>B0010</partinfo> and the <partinfo>B0012</partinfo> terminator) because of problems mentioned in the partsregistry with the <partinfo>B0012</partinfo> terminator.
RBS, <partinfo>B0034</partinfo>: <partinfo>B0034 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
from registry
The strong ribosomal binding site (RBS) AGGAG was always assembled.
lacI gene, <partinfo>C0012</partinfo>: <partinfo>C0012 SpecifiedComponents</partinfo>
from registry
This is a gene for the lac repressor lacI with a LVA degradation tag. We used this BioBrick to build a tightly regulated lac-operon <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> with low basal transcription. It seems that this lacI is either degraded too quickly or it does not work properly because it is not possible to repress the lac operon with this part.

Penn_State,2012,Team:Penn State#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Molecules. They have approved the research conducted in our lab, and we are in full compliance with the biosafety regulations imposed on our work by the IBC.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Another way to ensure safety could be to create a new lab strain of E.coli that has more auxotrophic requirements. This would make it more difficult for a modified bacteria to escape and possibly spread a Resistance factor or Virulence factor.
Parts could be made safer by introducing more regulation components. By making the bacteria require cofactors to function or to live in an antibiotic containing environment would help to ensure containment of the strain being studied. You could also make it more difficult for the new BioBricks to be transmitted in an active form to an undesired bacterial strain.

Methionine Synthetase (MetRS)
Original part: BBa_K567015
Submitted by: SJTU-BioX-Shanghai 2011
Designed by: You Wang
Rational behind improvements: BBa_K567015 encodes for a truncated MetRS without the anticodon recognition domain. We have improved this part by including the entire coding sequence, which has been codon optimized for optimal expression in E. coli. For easy purification we have included a C- terminal hexahistidine tag with a serine glycine linker. We have also optimized MetRS to be overexpressed in BL21 DE3 gold cell by putting it under the control of a T7 promoter ( BBa_I719005 ), RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ). The original part is also incompatible with biobrick standards. To address this we have removed all illegal cut sites from the construct.
Our Part:
T7 RNA Polymerase (T7 RNAP)
Original part: BBa_I2032
Submitted by: MIT
Designed by: Bartholomew Canton
Rational behind improvements: BBa_I2032 encodes exclusively for the coding region of T7 RNA polymerase. In order to improve it and incorporate it into our Next vivo system we have Codon optimized for use in E. coli and attached a N-terminal hexahistidine tag with a serine glycine linker for easy purification. We have also optimized our T7 RNA polymerase to be overexpressed in BL21 DE3 gold cells by putting it under the control of a T7 promoter ( BBa_I719005 ), RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ).

Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#HumanPractice#collaborationMap_-_-_TEXT.html," collaborative teams are the newly formed ones.
Legend
Level of collaboration
The following graphs offer us three different options:
The first one shows teams collapsed by level of collaboration for each region: the first level is no collaboration, the second is collaboration only with teams of the same region, and the third is collaboration between regions.
The second graph shows the distribution of collaborating teams by country: each teams of the same country have the same color
The third one shows the ratio of collaboration per region: all the teams of each region have the same color
For example on this map we can see that countries with a lot of teams have just a little parts of them which are collaborating (look at, China and US)
An example: Japan vs USA collaborations over time
We were appalled by the difference between Japanese and US levels of connectivity. Indeed, we observed that throughout the years Japanese teams have constantly collaborated between each other. As a polar opposite, very few US teams connected to each other. Japan and China has the ""meet ups"" where all the teams in the country meet to share ideas and present their project to other teams. This is contributing to the greater of links between teams in this region which creates a hub (highly linked) in the entire iGEM community.
Preliminary conclusions
As years pass, there are two trends: the first is the increase in the number of teams, the second is that they get more and more inter-connected. Unsurprisingly, we can assess qualtitatively that the most successful teams are the connected ones. Indeeed, the one that cumulate gold medals, prizes etc. are the ones that also made an effort in the way of collaborating. But we cannot formally recognize that connecting to other teams is a key to sucess, for instance the MIT in 2010 won ""Best Manufacturing Project"" award but were not collaborating. All we can say, based on our experience, is that the more you exchange, the further your ideas and projects can advance.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the promoter of                                 soxRS-regulated gene.
micF: antisense ncRNA with ompF mRNA 5' UTR,*2011 JMB*
SoxS, a transcriptional activator of oxidative stress genes in E. coli.                                     SoxS in vitro binds the promoter of soxRS-regulated genes such as micF,                                     sodA and recruits RNA polymerase to the promoters.
In accordance with relative effective response of antibiotics, we are determined to                                 implement micF to sense the existence of sulfamethoxazole and sulfadimethoxine in water                                 sample,
and SoxS to detect the concentration of tetracycline or oxytetracycline.
In the circuit, micF and SoxS won't directly reporter fluorescence signal, instead,                                 information will deliver through quorum sensing for positive amplification. In                                 antibiotic substance sensing module, LuxI will be expressed directly for Bacteria II                                 processing.
Quorum Sensing Module
Using community with different compartments would further improve the signal                                 amplification, as known, quorum sensing is a system for stimulation(some signaling                                 molecules called autoinducers) and response(receptor that will transcript certain genes)                                 that is related to the bacterial concentration in the system. Many gene expression is                                 naturally regulated by quorum sensing, which is also treated as social interaction in                                 bacterial community.
In some gram-negative bacteria, such as Vibro fischeri, biosynthesis of                                 autoinducers is used for yield of bioluminescence through luciferase. The signaling                                 molecule used by V. fischeri is an acylated homoserine lactone(AHL),called                                 N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone, which can be engineered into E. coli. The                                 signaling molecule will be produced in the cytoplasm using LuxI synthase enzyme and                                 then secreted through the cell membrane to the extracellular surroundings. When                                 N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone begins diffusing back into cells or other bacteria,                                 LuxR will recognize the existence of N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone with a                                 threshold concentration, about 10ug/mL. Finally, target gene such as LuxlCDABE will be                                 activated with LuxR and N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone complex.
It has been proved that LuxR has evolutionary conservation in many gram-negative bacteria, which enables E. coli to receive AHL from other bacteria. Thus we                                 engineer Bacteria I to"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Crowdfunding_-_-_TEXT.html," the stop motion pitch video, designing rewards for supporters and write newsletter blogs for fans. Furthermore, writing the script for the video really has raised our awareness of how difficult it actually is to explain our project to a person without much biological background knowledge. As a consequence, we tackled this issue by discussing and optimizing the comprehensibility of our project with students and by designing a dictionary for technical terms of synthetic biology.
Bielefeld ""Mittelstandsforum"" 2016
Bielefeld has a strong collective of mid-sized companies, including certain innovative and young start-ups from different industries. At March 13th iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec was invited to the 13th Bielefelder ""Mittelstandsforum"" (Link to German program:  http://www.wege-bielefeld.de/newsletter/Mittelstandsforum-2016.pdf). The annual event is a meetup for people from economy, research and politics. Under the slogan ""We back on special ideas"" (""Wir setzen auf besondere Ideen"") young entrepreneurs and academics were encouraged to present their business and projects. Together with members from iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015 we had the chance to represent iGEM and Bielefeld University. This was a great opportunity to tell people about the iGEM competition and our projects. Afterwards, there was time for further conversations and discussions with the visitors. We could earn some useful tips, especially for entrepreneur and marketing aspects of our project. We used it, to expend our contacts to local business, partly leading to an active long-term exchange between iGEM and public. These advices became very useful during our project development. Moreover, we relied on these new contacts to address several issues.
Press
In order to inform people about our project and gain fans for our crowdfunding campaign we also entered a dialogue with the public relations office of our university and as a result they published this article .
In addition, we had an interview with Rainer Kurlemann , a journalist writing science articles for a well-known German newspaper.
Local media wrote about us as well."

dCas9 with split β-lactamase
When designing the dCas9-split-β-lactamase construct we used a dCas9 sequence modifed from iGEM Peking 2015. To this sequence we added one part of the split-β-lactamase (either N-terminal lactamase or C-terminal lactamase).
Galarneau et al, (2002) [1] demonstrated that splitting the β-lactamase into two fragments consisting of amino acids 26-196 and amino acids 198-290, does not interfere with the biological activity when the two split parts are re-connected. This means that the enzyme becomes a biologically active enzyme as soon as the two parts are in close proximity to each other.
The beta-lactamase cleaves the C-N bond in the beta-lactam ring of nitrocefin. The hydrolyzed product has a different color than that of nitrocefin, changing from yellow (580 nm) to red (482 nm) [6].

Nitrocefin is a cephalosporin with antibiotic activity, which is another important reason that our kit will be used at a doctors office or pharmacy, where it can be handled and disposed off in a safe manner.
To connect the dCas9 with the split β-lactamase, we inserted a linker sequence, consisting of three GGGGS repeats. The linker sequence was previously used by iGEM Peking 2015 [B]. We designed four different combinations of the construct:
Nlact connected to the C-terminus of dCas9
Nlact connected to the N-terminus of dCas9
Clact connected to the C-terminus of dCas9
Clact connected to the N-terminus of dCas9
Figure 2: Four different dCas9-constructs with split beta-lactamase. Orange: Overhang for vector backbone (Gibson cloning)
Unfortunately, IDT was not able to synthesize any of these four constructs due to their large size and complexity. Therefore, we decided to split each of the four constructs in two individual parts. Only then was IDT able to synthesize our sequences.

b. Chinese cardiovascular mortality
Cardiovascular disease mortality in rural and urban areas in 2013 is 293.69 / 100,000 and 259.40 / 100,000 respectively ( figure 1 ) ; death of cardiovascular diseases account for residents of diseases constitute 44.8 per cent in rural area and 41.9 per cent in cities, ranks first in the various diseases, higher than the tumors and other diseases.
c. The upward trend of cardiovascular mortality
The upward trend of cardiovascular mortality is due primarily to the increasing of ischemic heart disease (IHD). National disease surveillance system 2004-2011 mortality surveillance data shows that people over 35 years old of IHD mortality rates showed a clear upward trend in various parts of the China, IHD mortality annual rates for men 5% women 3.65%. Rural residents increased IHD mortality is fast, whether male or female, rural residents in IHD mortality are rising in 2004 to less than city residents as 2011 years higher than that of urban residents.
According to the data，we know the grim situation of ischemic heart disease, at the same time，we know more about the current conventional therapies such as drug treatment for ischemic heart disease (nitrates, and antithrombotic drugs, calcium channel blockers, etc), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Based on these data, combined with our expertise, we have decided to utilize synthetic biology to the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia.

Introductory Lab Session: 24th July 2009
James and Neil removing most of the 70% ethanol by using pipettes - the DNA pellets will then be dried using the vacuum pump
Introduction
As far as the introductory lab sessions go, we have completed one half of the ethanol precipitation procedure; once completed the procedure will see the plasmid pSB1A2 (containing GFP) and the plasmid pSB1AT3(containing RFP) free from ethanol. This means they can be loaded onto gel and analysed appropriately (i.e. DNA gel electrophoresis)
Practical Outline
Remove the Eppendorf tubes from fridge and resume the rest of the ethanol precipitation protocol.
Ethanol Precipitation continued
So far we have added sodium acetate to the 2 DNA samples and also added ethanol. The team have also divided the samples into Eppendorf tubes and stored them in the fridge overnight (a replacement for the15 minute incubation-on-ice step). The following was carried out:
The 16 Eppendorf tubes (8 containing GFP and 8 containing RFP) were spun down for 20 minutes at 13,000 rpm.
With the supernatant removed the 16 samples were rinsed in 70% ethanol and spun for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded (making sure that the DNA pellet was it disturbed) and the tube dried using the vacuum pump.
The DNA pellets were then resuspended in 50ul of distilled water and stored away in the -80ºC freezer.
Conclusion
Both the pSB1A2 plasmid containing GFP and the pSB1AT3 plasmid containing RFP will be"

The HSL synthesis rate was modulated by assembling constitutive promoters of different strength upstream of luxI gene. In this way, the lux pR can be activated when the HSL concentration in the growth media is greater than a threshold, which changes as a function of the HSL synthesis rate. The constitutive promoters were chosen from the Anderson Promoters Collection, available in the Registry.
Figure 5: Self-inducible devices behaviour. Pcon is a generic constitutive promoter.
Besides the use of constitutive promoters of different strength to regulate the production of the signal molecule, the plasmid copy number was taken into consideration as another important parameter. The studied combinations are summarized in Fig.6, 7 and 8.
Figure 6: Both sender and receiver are assembled on high copy number plasmid.
Figure 7: Both sender and receiver are assembled on low copy number plasmid.
Figure 8: Sender part in low copy number plasmid and receiver on high copy number plasmid.
Thus, these BioBrick parts can be used to express recombinant proteins without adding an inducer to trigger the transcription initiation of downstream genes; in large-scale production of such proteins this strategy can be cost saving and ease the entire process. Users can rationally choose the cell density at which the initiation has to occur by selecting a self-inducible device library member.

Integrative standard vector for E. coli
The integration of the genetic circuits of interest into the microbial host genome can eliminate the need of expensive selection techniques, such as antibiotics or auxotrophic media, in cell cultures.
In order to simplify the engineering of the host genome, two standard and modular integrative vectors have been designed for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two commonly used hosts for industrial protein production. Here, a detailed description of the integrative vector for E. coli is reported, while the following section deals with the integrative vector for yeast. The parts notation is reported in Fig.11.
The structure of the designed vector, here named <partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo>, is shown in Fig.10. Most of its features have been inspired by <partinfo>BBa_I51020</partinfo> (BioBrick base vector) and <partinfo>BBa_J72007</part"

Telling about Mercury  (Hg) to future docs in Amazon
UFAM-Brazil team is has an interesting diversity is its students skills (see our team section). Majors and minors of all sort: biology, biotechnology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, arts, design and also medicine. The medicine student proposed to the group a nice twist in our outreach: a material orientated for medicine students regarding to Hg contamination.
Hg contamination has lots of implications for the Amazon region as we already discussed here in this Wiki, however doctors and medicine students are not alerted as should be about it and even some diagnosis are misleading over time and people who has symptoms are not properly treated. This occurs mainly because the Hg contamination is a topic “hidden underneath carpet” and not well divulgated or discussed. In Amazon the natural levels of Hg are high due to the soil and water constitution, which bring concerns since the gold harvesting activity is much spread and are based in Hg use, bring the rates of this element beyond the acceptable by the World Human Organization (WHO).
Our Human Practice found out this could be a great chance of talk about the problem and show how is the state of the art in this field including show the Mercury Bacter project.
This approach couldn’t have gone better! The med students loved it, they got to know about the Hg and gold mining issues for environment and human health and they had lots of fun learning about our project and about SynBio!
For that we prepared a concise material about Hg and relations with the medical field to show to the future docs. This material is below in detail. We give one advice to future teams working in environmental topics: these issues are highly related to human health problems and are great to include future docs in your team; they give an interesting perspective to the whole thing! We got so lucky on that… our team mate from medical school also participated and contributed a lot with our Modeling (colocar hyperlink do modeling), so they can be math docs also. ;-)
