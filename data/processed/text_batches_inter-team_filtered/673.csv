The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the equation, Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of enzymes’ substrates, Km is the Michaellis constant of enzymes, [I] is the concentration of inhibitors, KI is the inhibition constant towards enzymes DszC brought by HBP, and   shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
Because substrate S has inhibition effect on DszC enzymes, we modify the model into:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Taking astringency into consideration, using MATLAB for models and experimental data fitting will be infeasible, so we choose graphical method to obtain K1 and  .
First we use double-reciprocal plot to analyze the 1/S changes over 1/v:
①The slope of double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
②The intercept of 1/v –axis in the double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
The intercept of I-axis is -αKI.
Based on models above, the value of KI,αparameters are derived.
Table 2: Conclusion of parameters related to four major inhibition reactions:
3. Determination of associated parameters of biological catalytic activity loss, without considering the effects of HBP.
Cell suspension is cultured in DBT-free liquid medium--30℃, 250rpm, 24h. Sample is detected for biological catalytic activity of BDS over time. The biological catalytic activity of BDS accords with an exponential attenuation, which is shown as below:
Hypothesis:
2.3 Modeling Part
1).Suppose the two intermediates--DBTO2 and HBPS—are only present in cytoplasm.
2).The inhibition to DszA, DszB and DszC of HBP is considered, while the inhibitory effect of HBPS on DszC which is mainly exists in the early stages of BDS is neglected, with the purpose of simplifying our modeling.
3).The DszD’s activity is considered non-inhibited, therefore we took the enzyme out of our modeling.
4).The loss of biological catalytic activity without the effects of HBP is considered.
5).Assume that the concentrations of DBT and HBP stay the same in all the three different phrases as the stirring rate"

Background
コンストラクトはiGEMプロジェクトの最も重要な部分である。  iGEMerは他チームのコンストラクトを理解し、自チームのプロジェクトの目的を達成するコンストラクトを設計しなければならない。そのためには、遺伝子回路の原理を理解する必要がある。  さらに、設計した遺伝子回路の応答を予測するためには、そのダイナミクスをモデル化して計算しなければならない。そのためには、モデル化の考え方を理解する必要がある。
これらの点において、現状では次のような障壁があると考える。
問題点①
遺伝子回路のダイナミクスを学ぶにはシステム生物学の教科書を開けば良いのだが、それを理解するためには、微分方程式を用いた生化学反応のモデル化をきちんと理解しなければならなかった。これは多くのiGEM入門者にとっては敷居が高いものである。
問題点②

- a threshold value is required to tell the patient when their blood bile acid level is dangerous and may need a medical treatment
- therefore, we will modify the linear relationship between bile acid concentration and GFP intensity level into a Hill system using Hill equation to find the threshold value
- also, we may use colour indicator instead of GFP (light indicator)
Background:
- Bile acids are 24-carbon steroids found in bile, which are subject to enterohepatic circulation
- synthesized in liver and stored in gallbladder, helping in digestion and absorption of dietary fat and liposoluble vitamins
- bile acids are highly toxic. Therefore their concentration must be tightly regulated
- the level of bile acids is controlled through a negative feedback system mediated by a nuclear bile acid receptor FXR. FXR is highly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney cells. It responds to bile acids and has been shown to repress CYP7A1, a key gene associated with bile acid synthesis.
- Defects in bile acid homeostasis due to functional variations of FXR result in cholestatic conditions such as Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder characterized by pruritus (intense itch) an abnormal liver function
- The dysfunction of maternal liver could induce stress on the fetal liver as the fetus relies on maternal liver to remove bile. It has been shown that ICP pregnancies are more likely to suffer from meconium staining of the amniotic fluid (MSAF), cardiotocography (GCT) abnormalities and respiration distress syndrome (RDS).
- The risk of complications such preterm labor, prenatal death and stillbirth are directly linked to severity of ICP
- The morbidity of ICP is geographically and racially dependent. [1]

During our second visit to Vidilab they also informed us about the difficulties with detecting large strongyles since all current techniques are based on egg counting in grass samples. After some consideration we outlined a strategy to battle this problem as well. First of all we wanted to investigate the need for a better preventative tool for large strongyle infections. In order to gather data we worked on a market analysis based on a survey that we spread among horse owners in Sweden. Secondly, we wanted to try and see if a similar system as we outlined for the small strongyles could work with large strongyles present in grass, hence we made an analysis of the visibility of fluorescent proteins in grass sampling.
Figure 1. Some of our team members during a visit at Vidilab
Interviews
Horse Owners
We used every opportunity we had at our disposal to discuss our project with horse owners. From these discussions we learned about the best ways of isolating samples and about the difficulty of isolating urine from a horse. We therefore moved on to investigating detection methods in feces. These interviews also gave us the idea to start investigating on a larger scale to what extent the horse owners are aware of issues related to strongyle infections — and the idea of conducting a market analysis was born.
Veterinarians
We contacted different veterinarians in the beginning of the project to see what their experience with strongyles was. The overall view was that they did not know about horses becoming ill from a large amount of small strongyles, but they mostly spoke of the negative effects with large strongyles. These results pushed us to investigate more about large strongyle infections.
Multinational Market Research
Before we could start with our project we first needed to look into whether there was a market for our diagnostic tool and whether we could shape the potential product to an existing niche. We were interested in the actual state of urgency of the disease along with potential concerns for the future, though as can be seen from the above mentioned communication we had been receiving some conflicting information. Some sources would state that strongyle infections are of relatively small concern – while others would see it as a large issue. To analyse this further we conducted a market analysis based on a survey that was distributed not only in Sweden but also abroad. This confirmed that the needs of the horse owners regarding large and small strongyles was consistent with Vidilabs needs, indicating that the majority of each stakeholder had the same view of the current situation.

Collaborations
This time the BIOSINT_Mexico iGEM team had the opportunity to support the new Guanajuato_MX team. This team is made up of students from different universities, who with the intention of starting their experience in this competition, they decided to join efforts to carry out their project. Competition from synthetic biology, iGEM, is not only based on the successful completion of the main idea of ​​the project, but also has other areas of knowledge in which the teams must approach, the development of ethical attitudes and free spreading information are some of them, as well as integration between different teams.
Undoubtedly the support and collaboration between different institutions and iGEM team is vital to achieve this goal; there are many problems that arise throughout the development of the project to meet all the objectives; in this case the Guanajuato_Mx team, with all their encourage decided to participate in the annual version of Interlab Study, nevertheless, its iGEM kit was unfortunately not given them, so this study could hardly do. Fortunately for both teams, we were able to be in contact and because BIOSINT_Mexico did have its kit, with great spirits was given"

About Our Team
We are 12 high school students gathered from various different schools to participate in iGEM 2018.
Organized with students from Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies(HAFS), CheongShim International Academy(CSIA), Korean Minjok Leadership Academy(KMLA), Korean International School(KIS), Shanghai American School(SAS), we are a team with much diversity! We hope to bring synergy between students from different backgrounds to complete this year's project.
This project is the result of hard work and collaboration of every single team member. We learned to collaborate effectively with students from different schools and to appreciate all team members who were responsible and tried their best.
Our team members are enthusiastic to make the most out of iGEM experience. Gathered by friends' friends, we became close in the summer, working in the lab and doing human practices together. Although we may be physically apart, we have tried our best to efficiently distribute work and enjoy each other's company. We are thankful for iGEM in providing such opportunity and hope to see all of you at the Giant Jamboree!

Hello!! I am the team captain of BioMarvel iGEM team this year. My participation in last year’s iGEM drove me to re-enter iGEM 2018. As a team captain, I am in charge of the contact within all of our team members as well as coordinating the whole project. I was involved in the project from start to end, from topic selection, experiments, human practices, to uploading everything on the wiki homepage. Although it has been a long, arduous journey, it had been a fulfilling one and there were many take-aways. I am interested in biotechnology and in the future, I hope to contribute to the development of early diagnosis of diseases and to eventually move toward preventing them.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM"

Gel Electrophoresis
Written by Seray Cicek
Part 1: Casting the gel
Add 0.5g of Agarose and 50ml of 1X TAE buffer to an Erlenmeyer flask. (Note that TAE buffer in the stock has 50X concentration and needs to be diluted with autoclaved Milli-Q water)
Place the flask into the microwave. After this step flask will be hot. Use heat gloves
Set the timer to 2 min. Start the microwave oven but stop every 30 sec to swirl the contents of the flask. This helps suspend the undissolved agarose. Continue until agarose particles are dissolved.
While hot, add 3ul of 10,000x SYBR Safe into the agarose solution and mix throughly.
Set the flask aside for cooling. Occasionally swirl to make the cooling even.

Our reflections
This essay is the third of four pillars towards a better understanding of complexity. It brings elements from the survey, from the interviews, the outreach and from further reading together. Here, we reflect on how our project and science, in general, relate to these topics.
Our human practice project was guided by the following questions:
“How do people experience complexity? Which approaches do exist to approach complexity? How does complexity arise? Should people, scientists in particular, consider that subparts of a complex entity are mixed in a both ordered and unorganized way, and accept uncertainty? If yes, how can the uncertainty be taken into account? Or are simple parts strictly ordered, and complexity arises when these simple parts follow rules?”
This questions splits up into two approaches. The first approach is needed to take into account uncertainty of intrinsic complexity of the parts we consider as of the environment. The second approach is necessary to understand the parts better in order to be able to predict results.
On our way of answering the questions coming along with complexity we focused on four different components: Listening, discussing, sharing and thinking.
The first component of listening was covered by a survey regarding complexity and its emergence. We listened to the public and learned about the existing ideas of complexity and how people relate to it. Something that we have observed is a trend of increasing complexity when going from non-living objects to living beings. A feature of living beings might be that they have emerging properties. This is what we experience as complex. 70% of the participants of our survey have shown an interest to"

Figure 2(below) shows the killing of M. smegmatis with TDMH expressed by E. coli. We mixed liquid cultures of E. coli and M. smegmatis at equal cell densities as determined by plating assays. When expression of TMDH was induced with IPTG, nearly 99% of the M. smegmatis were killed within six hours. We saw no change in viability in cultures of M. smegmatis alone or when mixed with uninduced E. coli.
  We next sought to quantify the effectiveness of TDMH killing. We mixed induced E. coli and mycobacteria in different ratios and used plating assays to measure viability. As shown in figure 3 mycobacterial killing displayed dose dependence on the E. coli cell density. Small numbers of E. coli could kill many mycobacteria. For example, in mixed populations with 100 mycobactera for each E. coli, we still observed >50% mycobacterial killing after 2 hours. This indicates that, on average, each E. coli produced enough TDMH to kill 50 mycobacteria. We reason that this killing may be even more effective inside macrophages, where constrained volumes will increase the effective TDMH concentration.
Figure 1 Experimental setup of the M. smegmatis killing assay.
M. smegmatis and E.coli cells (Uninduced and induced with various concentrations of IPTG) were cultured up to OD 1,then serially diluted. Equal volumes of E.coli and M. smegmatis cultures of the same dilutions were mixed, incubated for 6 hours, and plated at 0,3 and 6 hours.
Figure 2 TDMH-expressing E.coli kill mycobacteria in culture.
We mixed TDMH-expressing E.coli and WT M. smegmatis in LB media at an initial cell density of 107 cells/ml each. Plating assays were used to count specifically M. smegmatis after the indicated times. When TDMH-expression was fully induced with 1 mM IPTG, more than 98% of mycobacteria were killed after 6 hours (red line). Populations of mycobacteria alone (black line) and mycobacteria mixed with uninduced E.coli (blue line) were stable.

The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.
In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
6. What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.
When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.
For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.
In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.

14. Hamburger Studierendentagung: An Introduction to iGEM a project featured by the UHH
This year iGEM Hamburg attended the Life Science student convention in Hamburg to promote iGEM and science by students in general. For starters retired professor Uli Hahn held an impulse talk about his career and the potential possibilities awaiting us. From about 300 attendees 50 students held a short talk about the results their recent graduation work. A lot of interesting topics were covered and discussed in detail in the following poster presentation. Among them were novel results in the fields of bone formation leading to clues in osteoporosis research, and MRT imaging based on doppler ultrasound technology with impressive live imaging of a fetal heart. We presented iGEM and how it is applied at the university of Hamburg including a short introduction about this year’s topic, multi resistant bacteria and a gallium-trojan-horse-strategy. During the breaks life science and medical companies and organizations had the opportunity to present themselves among some coffee and snacks which lead to an enjoyable overall atmosphere. To conclude the event Katharina Fegebank, our secondary major and senator for science and equality, congratulated the students for their presentations. Before she could leave we were able to have a couple of words with her about a possibility to support iGEM in Hamburg and how to potentially involve students from universities from all over Hamburg.
EU Meetup Delft
To begin with it was great! And I recommend the attendance on regional meetups for every iGEM Team that has the possibility to do so. Sadly, only a small part of our team could participate since we had to cover 100% of the costs by ourselves. However, we were still able to send one member of any division that we have, so Martin (Chemistry), Sören (Nanoscientist) and me Shanti (Molecular Life Sciences and Teamleader) faced an adventurous trip to the beautiful city of Delft.
And boy adventurous it was. Starting with the selection of a decent route and to find the correct mean of transportation. After a couple of hours, we thought that we were ready to go"

I am a third-year student in the School of Electrical Engineering. I’m majoring in Bionics, i.e. combining engineering with existing biological systems. Measuring electrical signals in the human body is one of my key interests.
My contribution to the team was more on the entrepreneurial side as biochemistry is not my field of study. I really enjoyed taking our work to the public via the Summer of Startups program. I worked much on the presentations we held, and did quite a lot of pitching too.
Later in the summer I researched and built the LED rig we used to perform our measurements. I really enjoy building things. I enjoy coding too, but ended up programming very little, because we have so many great coders in our team.
I did learn a whole lot of gene technology and lab-work on the side too. This was a really awesome project to be part of and I can assure that interdisciplinarity really took us far.
Keep it simple. I enjoy photography, building things, programming and entrepreneurship.

BioBrick Master
Aalto University
I’m a Bachelor of Science (technology) in Chemical Engineering. This is my fourth year and I’m starting Master’s studies majoring in Bio and Food Technology at Aalto University.
I have spent the summer mostly in the lab and made loads of gel runs, ligations and transformations, that is, the cloning. My special skill is knowing the Biobricks well as I had already had an introduction to them when making my Bachelor’s thesis last spring. So I knew the principles of the assembly techniques although I had never done any gene technology lab work before.
During the work with my thesis I regretted I would never know if Biobricks are useful in reality. The stroke of luck came in the form of an announcement to build the first-ever Finnish iGEM team. In theory, Biobricks sounded like a cool way of making genetic engineering easier but now I really got an opportunity to do some hands-on work with Biobricks!
In my official hobbies I would include synchronized skating and scouting which both I have been into since I was a kid. In addition, I like knitting, spending time outside in the nature and geocaching."

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," us look to Uganda as a case, a country in eastern central Africa. Its main export is coffee and 10% of the $91,212 billion economy is allocated to the health sector - with a population of  41,5 million people. This is 5% below the Abuja declaration, where heads of African states agreed to spend 15% of the GDP for health care.
The current funding of $27 per capita per annum expenditure on health care is far below the $44 per capita recommended. That is a health budget that is also needed for addressing Hepatitis A, Malaria, Rabies, Typhoid and Yellow Fever [2]
This means that a course of antivenom, for a critical dose of envenoming by the commonly occurring Bitis gabonica snake will run up (based on Product: FAV-Afrique antivenin by Sanofi-Pasteur, France) $120 a vial - and many venomous bites must be treated with more than one vial. This is above what most families earn in a whole year [3].
This is the raw cost of the most effective treatment. We only  speculate on how a detection device will be prioritized.
While still appealing to the higher values of social responsibility. We also ask: Who says that is can not be good business. There are potential money to be made. A report from the businesscomission.org: Better business, better world report, the solving the UN SDGs, has been estimated to have an market opportunity of $12 trillion. The issue of snake envenoming related directly to Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, secondary to goal 1, 2, 4, and 8: No poverty, zero Hunger, Quality Education and Decent work and economic growth, respectively. The goals are related in so far as the issue debilitates the families financially thus causing further poverty or disabilities that preclude attending schools.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Foundational Advances#MiniTn7#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," unsuitable for applications involving the release of bacterial strains to the environment.
E. coli as a host. E. coli is the workhorse of genetic engineering. Because of its easy and fast growth in culture and the extensive knowledge accumulated on its genetics, metabolism and physiology, it is appropriate for many applications. However, there are others for which it is a better choice to use a different microbial host. For example, E. coli does not survive well in the environment, particularly in soils, and it is therefore unsuitable for many environmental applications.
For the iGEM 2011 competition, the UPO-Sevilla team intends to develop the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a set of fully biobrick-compatible vectors that intend to overcome the concerns listed above. These vectors contain the prefix/suffix biobrick multi-cloning site within the ends of defective Tn7 transposons. Some of the features of our miniTn7 BioBrick toolbox are:
Stable integration at a single site in the chromosome. Tn7 has the ability to integrate at a single target in the bacterial chromosome downstream from the conserved gene glmS. The insertion site is neutral, as it is located at a convergent intergenic region ( Gringauz, 1988 ; Waddell, 1989 ). Transposition is exerted by Tn7 transposase provided transiently from a suicide plasmid, granting a single transposition event and the impossibility of secondary transposition ( Peters, 2001 ). Stable transposon insertion generates safer organisms, as horizontal gene transfer is minimized in this way.
Antibiotic selection not required. MiniTn7 insertions do not require antibiotic selection, as the transposon is faithfully replicated as part of the bacterial chromosome. Furthermore, all our miniTn7 vectors will be equipped with FRT-flanked antibiotic resistance that allows precise excision of the markers by Flp-mediated recombination ( Cherepanov, 1995 ). Stability of the insertion and the lack of drug resistance markers make strains with miniTn7 insertions more appropriate for environmental release than plasmid-bearing strains
Suitability to multiple bacterial hosts. Most likely, Tn7 transposition is functional in a large array of Gram-negative bacteria. So far, Tn7 has been shown to transpose in over 20 different Gram-negative bacterial species, including several enterics, members of the genus Pseudomonas, Caulobacter crescentus, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and others ( Craig, 1996 ).

OLS_Canmore,2016,Team:OLS Canmore#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," transporting of waste as well as the formation of new low-quality products. Once we were aware of the current methods of disposal, we began to research the benefits of keratinase more extensively.
Construct Creation
To begin the creation of our biobrick, our team had to start off by designing and optimizing our constructs. This was done by improving upon the Chicago and Sheffield iGEM teams’ previous projects, as they both previously worked with keratinases. The University of Chicago was unable to successfully express KerA in Bacillus due to issues that occurred during their transformation. The University of Sheffield iGem team had an unsuccessful expression of keratinase US due to cleaving issues that resulted from the differing signal peptides between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
For our project, we decided to use E. coli JM109 and DH5alpha, which is gram-negative, as our bacterial chassis.  The coding regions in the biobricks consisted of KerA and KerUS genes. These genes came from organisms in the Bacillus genera, which is gram-positive. As we learnt from the University of Sheffield iGEM team, this was quite problematic because the secretion of keratinase requires the “tagging” of a short amino acid signal. This signal is required to give it folding instructions to prevent the misfolding of the enzyme within the periplasm. The signal will also allow the secretion tag to be removed, thus resulting in the expression of the proteolytic enzymes. Because of the signal sequence differentiation between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, we had to optimize the gene sequences by changing the export tag. With the help of our mentors, we decided to completely remove the gram-positive signal and replace it with a signal peptide called pelB . We also decided to use an IPTG-inducible promoter (part BBa_J04500) for our expression cassette for this enzyme.  The composite part was then synthesized into a pUC57 backbone, and using 3A assembly was placed into the standard biobrick pSB1C3 backbone.
Integration
While working on creating our construct, we began to create an implementation plan for our project within the poultry and wastewater industries. We furthered our research by coming in contact with various individuals in the poultry industry. Through our communication, we discovered that feather waste is dealt with by placing all of the waste in either a container to be dealt with. If it is not disposed of on site, it is transported in large quantities to be dealt with elsewhere. Because feathers are all handled with in a similar way, it was quite easy to foresee and plan the integration of the project"

Last year I went on an internship at the University of California San Diego working with Mark Tuszynski's lab at the Center for Neural Repair UCSD School of Medicine. During the internship I had experience working with neural growth factors and their implementations in various neorodegenerative diseases e.g. Alzheimer's disease or spinal cord injury. Apart from medical applications of synthetic biology, I am interested in computer graphics, art and Mexican cuisine :). I like drawing, taking photographs and travelling.

Raising synthetic biology awareness on 150 cm².
Distributing knowledge
When it comes to synthetic biology the public may be prejudiced. This is most presumably caused due to misconceptions. This year's iGEM team Düsseldorf from the HHU Düsseldorf felt called upon tackling this issue and motivate the people to overcome their skepticism. Thus the idea to create and distribute educational postcards in the context of synthetic biology emerged.
Gathering the creativity of all other German iGEM teams, topics ranging from the production of insulin to gene editing were covered. We exchanged packs of about 100 postcards with some of the other teams to be able to have a broader area to spread them . This led to receiving postcards from the teams from Aachen, Darmstadt, Duesseldorf, Hannover, Goettingen and Tuebingen. Our postcard was designed after the motto 'Tolerance for Transgenes'. By that we demanded for a higher level of tolerance for GMO's which in general are negatively connoted in Germany and pointed towards their advantages.
We would like to thank team Düsseldorf for letting us join their campaign. Hopefully, many will follow their example and engage in public"

1. Cancer introduction and treatment
Current situation
Cancer, also known as malignant neoplasm, is a disease caused by abnormal mechanism controlling cell growth and proliferation.  Apart from incontrollable growth, tumor cells invade surrounding normal tissues.  Cancer is a joint name for a broad class of malignant neoplasm.
Cancer cells not only reproduce unlimitedly, consuming large amount of nutrition in the patient's body, but also secrete many toxins, causing a series of symptoms.  Worst of all, these cells could transfer to the whole body through lymphatic metastasis, blood metastasis, and implantation metastasis, resulting in emaciation, weakness, anemia, inappetence, fever, and severe damage to viscera.  Patients will eventually die of organ failure.
Cancer affects human health seriously, posing a great threat on human life.  According to WHO, 12 million people were diagnosed with cancer globally every year.  And the number of patients dying from the disease is predicted to reach 17 million in 2030.  Therefore, cancer is considered the first cause of death.  Listed in the following are lists and discussions of several cancer therapies at present.
Specialized cancer therapies and the future direction of researches.
(1) Progress in chemotherapy
The main methods for curing cancer at present are chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Since Goodman et al. tried nitrogen mustard to cure lymphatic tumors in 1942, chemotherapy became common. Chemotherapy is to transport drugs to tumor surroundings using different administrations. Anti-cancer drugs nowadays are from diverse sources, and have different mechanisms. However, they share a common feature of low specifity. They kill certain amounts of normal cells while killing tumor cells, causing toxic side effects like alopecia, chromosome damage, and harm to urinary system.  These side effects of anti-cancer drugs greatly reduce the effects of clinical treatment. What are worse, researches revealed that cells can escape from chemotherapy. Cancer therapies at the present stage are lack of drugs possessing significant effects and less toxicity. Even the patient is diagnosed, he could hardly get effective treatments, not only placing heavy economic burdens upon numerous families, but also torturing patients both physically and mentally.
(2) Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy electromagnetic radiation to act"

Cultures pAK13AB number 5, pCg13Y number 1, pAK13AC number 1, and pCg13Y number 3 from yesterday didn't grow for some reason. Ran a NotI digest screen of all the pAK13D ligations, as well as colony PCRs of the pC13P ligations. Plasmid pAK13AB numbers 1, 3, 4 and possibly pAK13BB number 4 looked like they worked on the gel. The gel of the colony PCRs looked weird, possibly because they were run on wrong extension time for a while. Going to rerun PCRs. We also re-ran a gel of the NotI digest screens from yesterday, pAK13AP and pAK13AN. All the pAK13AP colonies had blank colonies, but pAK13AN colony 1 had the correct bands. Sent pAK13AN colony 1 for sequencing but accidentally sent in the wrong primers. Primers for pSb1AK8 should have been used, but pSB13C primers were used instead. Transformed pC13AV ligation and pC13AL. The transformation arced, but the time constant was still 3.8 so the cells were plated anyway. Finally, 2 250mL solutions of cym agar were made and autoclaved. Began drying mycelium to isolate the genomic DNA.
Sent in pC13AH, pC13AY, and pC13AT for sequencing. In addition, the digest screens of all the pAK13D ligations were redone, along with the colony PCRs of the pC13P ligations. Transformed pC13AV. Attempted to dry mycelium to isolate genomic DNA.

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," short-chain alcohols such as ethanol. AOX is present in the methylotrophic yeast like Pichia pastoris , which has two genes, AOX1, AOX2 under a strong methanol inducible promoter. The yeast uses AOX genes to metabolize methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX enzymes were used in biosensors ( Biosens Bioelectron. 2005 ) but with a limited application because its electrochemical properties including reduction potential are not well studied.
DISPLAYING AOX ENZYME ON THE CELL SURFACE OF E. COLI
Protein induction and purification may cost much time up to 12 hours and need tricky technical skills. To simplify the procedure of AOX enzyme application, we obtained the idea from the project of an iGEM Team – NCTU_Formosa in 2015. A protein can be displayed on the cell surface of E. coli by fusing to Lpp-OmpA. Lipoprotein ( Lpp ) is a major outer membrane of E. coli which interacts with the peptidoglycan to maintain the structure and function of cell membrane. Another transmembrane protein called outer membrane protein A ( OmpA ) is involved in bacterial conjugation and phage infection. A study showed that Lpp-OmpA hybrid can direct the heterologous protein GFP to the external surface of E. coli ( Enzyme Microb Technol. 2001 ). Bacillus lipase ( J Microbiol. 2014 ) and Fungi xylanase ( Curr Microbiol. 2015 ) were demonstrated to be displayed on the cell surface of E. coli and maintained the functional enzyme activities. We’d like to display the AOX enzyme on bacterial surface by fusing with Lpp-OmpA and apply to the electrochemical analyzer by depositing on the test strip.
DEVELOPING IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter)
In order to replace GOX with bacteria displaying AOX on the cell surface to the sample test strips and apply it to the electrochemical analyzer, we’ve conducted the following experiments to demonstrate it works.
GENE CLONING
AOX genes synthesized by IDT and Lpp-OmpA got from NCTU-Formosa were amplified by PCR followed by restriction enzyme (RE) digestion, and finally cloned onto pSB1C3 based on the biobrick standard assembly rule. The recombinant vectors carrying the AOX genes were checked by colony PCR and RE, and further confirmed by sequencing.

The Pathway To Methyl Salicylate
Figure 2 | The Shikimate Pathway
The conversion of Ery4P and PEP to DAHP (3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate) is catalysed by DAHP synthase, which exists in three isoforms, coded by the genes aroF, aroG and aroH. These isoforms are selectively inhibited by Tyr, Phe and Trp, respectively. In E. coli, about 80% of the enzyme activity by contributed by the DAHPS of aroG(Ikeda et al., 2006).
When there is enough phenylalanine, the production of DAHP, and hence chorismate, will stop by inhibition of the aro genes.
The conversion from chorismate to MeS starts with a conversion to isochorismate, catalysed by isochorismate synthase, encoded by pchA. Isochorismate is directly converted to salicylate by isochorismate pyruvate/lyase, encoded by pchB. This conversion happens immediately, since pchA and pchB form the pchBA operon which is always transcribed to one mRNA. Conversion of salicylate to MeS is catalysed by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, encoded by bsmt1 (Gaille et al., 2003).
A Biobrick to start from
The iGEM team of MIT 2006 already constructed a Biobrick ( BBa_J45700 ) encoding pchBA and bsmt1, for the production of MeS. However, the MIT team only observed MeS production when salicylic acid was added to the medium. Our experiments with this Biobrick confirmed this lack of MeS production (see the smell test below). There had to be something wrong with the conversion of chorismate to salicylate. One possibility is that there is something wrong with the enzymes produced by the pchBA genes. Another one is that there is a lack of chorismate present in the cell. We have attempted to increase the productivity of the MIT 2006"

What is Synthetic Biology?
Not many people have heard of Synthetic Biology. Synthetic biology essentially aims to utilize natures tricks to design and build artificial biological systems for engineering purposes as well as a way to get a better understanding of why biological systems are set up as they are. The term “synthetic biology” was first used on genetically engineered bacteria that were created with recombinant DNA technology. Parts from natural biological systems are taken, characterized and simplified and used as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. The term was then used when referring to when organic synthesis is used to generate artificial molecules that mimic natural molecules such as enzymes.
There are two types of synthetic biologists:
those who deal with re-designing and fabricating existing biological systems.
those who deal with designing and fabricating biological components that do not already exist in the real world.
Synthetic biology provides us with a new perspective from which we can understand and ultimately utilize life for our own benefits. [1,2,3]
For the second type of synthetic biologists, the foundation is to create and characterize ready made biological building parts that can be used in new applications. From the existing list of available biobricks from the partsregistry, it can be seen that currently these functionalities are limited to linear sensor reporter systems, as is the case for inverters, quorum sensing systems and traditional receptor/reporter systems[4]. On This Wiki we present our contribution to the development and characterization of standard biological parts, developed around the frame work of the iGEM competition.

How does the public decide what projects to focus on?
There are many moral questions to be asked during the study of synthetic biology. These arise and question the very morals and values that people hold so dear. Synthetic biology deals with creation and this may bring these morals and values under scrutiny and question culture and religion. Such questions have come since the beginning of human thought, and continue to do so to this day.
Do you have any closing points to make?
At this time, the Northwestern iGEM team would like to extend our thanks to Professor Zoloth for her time and her unique perspective on Bioethics.

Population Control
An example of an industrial process that is susceptible to phage-mediated collapse is the fermentative production of yogurt. With the amount of work that the iGEM community has put into the production of compounds such as vanillin and caffeine, we envision the next generation microbes in yogurt fermentation being able produce these products in vivo. Consolidating these, however, might not be efficient because while many people may want vanilla flavoured yogurt, there might only be a subset of those who want the caffeine boost. This got us thinking about engineering CRISPR in a way that allows population control in a bioreactor. For example, there could be a vanilla producing bacterial strain that is immune to all the known environmental phage while a caffeine producing strain is also immune, but selectively susceptible to a rare phage. In a co-culture fermentation, which is the situation in yogurt production, the system could be phage resistant but the targeted addition of a rare phage could knock down a subset of the population and effectively remove any caffeine producing bacteria from the fermentation. We worked on biosynthetic pathways such as those producing vanillin, cinnamaldehyde, and caffeine to further part characterization in addition to modelling and validating parts of our hypothetical system. A proof-of-concept experiment showing targeted population control using CRISPR in E. coli is underway and will be presented in Toronto.

As a control DH5alfa strain was used. The schema of the 96 wells plate can be observed below.
Procedure
Both strains, DH5α and Yale with and without device, were harvested in a liquid culture with optimal conditions until saturation.
Optical density of both cultures was  mesaured and the concentration was readjusted to be 0.1 A.
Growth mediums were cleaned twice in order to ensure a perfect control over the growing conditions during the test.
A M9-polyamines Mix (x2) was prepared.
M9-polyamines Mix (x2)
22.12 μL Putrescine (1000x)
22.12 μL Spermidine (1000x)
2.5 mL
Last column of the 96 wells plate was filled with 100μL of M9-polyamines Mix (x2) and 100 μL of M9 minimal media (with aminoacids and salts). [link here]
100μL of M9 minimal media (with aminoacids and salts) was placed at each well except for the last column.
100μL of M9-polyamines Mix (x2) was placed at well A-11 and resuspended.
100μL were transferred from well A-11 to well A-10.
1:2 serial dilutions were performed all along the row until well A-1, discarding the 100μL remaining in the last step.
This procedure was repeated for all the remaining rows of the 98 wells plate.
Finally, 100μL of cells with the convenient antibiotic were placed at each well; form A-C with Yale with device, D-F with Yale strain and G-H with DH5α.
Characterization of absorbance peak of polyamines
The aim of this characterization was to be able to determine the amount of polyamines in a medium just by using an spectrophotometry assay. Several concentrations of Putrescine were used in the assay being 10mM and 0.016mM the highest and the lowest concentration respectively. The schema of the dilustions can be observed below.
Procedure
Polyamines mix at maximum concentration was prepared.  Polyamines Mix (10mM) |  ———— |  17."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

OVERVIEW
Click the arrow above for the summary of the rationale behind our experiments and our results:
In order to probe further into the feasibility of our project, we addressed the fact that bacteria evolve in response to bacteriophages. The basis of our project is that gram-negative bacteria without a working tolC gene (be it knocked-out, misfolding, or incomplete) will be unable to form a complete antibiotic-efflux protein complex. As a result bacteria without a functioning tolC gene will show an increased sensitivity to antibiotics normally resisted through efflux[1]; we demonstrated this experimentally using a Kirby-Bauer assay and the antibiotics Novobiocin and Erythromycin (See Documentation > Results > Kirby-Bauer Assays).
Since evolution is driven by selection of random mutations, we decided to imitate this mechanism. In order to simulate this, we would need a way to simulate the insertion of random non-silent mutations into a tolC gene/protein, a way to predict whether or not these mutations were damaging to the function of the TolC protein, and a way to predict whether or not these would affect TolC-mediated phage binding. For the sake of simplicity we considered only point mutations to the coding-region of the DNA. We divided the mutations into 4 main types:
A nonsense mutation which turns an amino acid into a stop codon; this will prevent a full TolC protein from being translated, preventing both antibiotic efflux and phage binding.
A missense mutation which prevents the TolC monomers from forming a trimer. In these we included strongly polar or charged amino acids being mutated into the beta-barrel regions, the insertion of Valine, Threonine, Isoleucine, Serine, Aspartate, Asparagine, or Proline in the alpha helices (these amino acids are not accommodated in an alpha helix[2]) which are critical for TolC trimerization, and in addition 1/4 of any other mutations in the alpha helices (we assume the amino acids on one face of each helix are critical for interaction with other monomers; there are ~3.6 amino acids per turn).
A base-pair substitution in the extracellular loops of the TolC protein. These mutations do not affect the assembly or function and therefore do not affect antibiotic resistance[1]. We assumed any of these would result in phage-resistance.
Any mutation not fitting into the above three categories"

Thursday 6/23
So today we met with Wellesley's iGem team and exchanged progress and ideas about what we have been doing and what we need to do in the future. I think what they have been working on is definitely cool and I am looking forward to going over to Wellesley's to see their surface on Monday. After the meeting, me, Viktor, Swapnil and Janoo went over to the wetlab where Viktor taught us how Puppeteer works and how he is connecting to the robot through sockets. I now have a much better understanding of Puppeteer and I will start trying to connect to Evoware on my own local server.
Friday 6/24
We planned to show up in the lab at 2pm and test the Puppeteer protocols on the robot with real samples and enzymes. However, I realized that enzymes have similar consistency as glycerol and requires a different liquid class to pipet properly. We ran into another problem trying to pipet fractional amounts. Apparently we need to pipet 0.5ul of some liquid that we were not anticipating and the RM came back with a error saying that not enough required liquid found. I am assuming this is because the number is rounded and casted as int somewhere and we need to get that debugged. Those errors and problems caused us to postpone the testing until next Tuesday.

Wellesley and BU Team Picture
Today we went to Wellesley to get updated on what they have been working on. They showed us a couple cool demos which really impressed me. I also wrote down some comments and suggestions for them on the sticky note that I hope they will benefit from. We collaborated to brainstorm ideas about the three main projects, the Electronic Notebook, the Design, and the Primer Designer. I worked in the Electronic Book section and I really think I contributed to the project with my ideas and I really think I can help them in developing this App since I already have experience developing apps on the iPhone, which uses the same programming language and environment as IPads. We had a good time touring their campus and playing ultimate Frisbee afterwards, it was a good day.
Tuesday 6/28
We had a short joint meeting today to catch up on things between the wetlab and the drylab. Me, Viktor and Swapnil then went over to the robot to do some more preliminary testing on the robot since a few things has changed since the last time we went over. We were playing around with the liquid detection and liquid"

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!

Nowadays, the feed additives for aflatoxin are usually not effective because pigs lose its appetite. Our product Aflatoxout is actually made of yeast. Therefore, it supposedly would not taste that bad. “If it also degrade the aflatoxin in pig’s gastrointestinal tract, it would be a promising feed additives for pig farming industries,” Dr. Wang said.
Milk House Co
Milk House Co. is a milk-producing startup in Taiwan. It made a sensation and now have their milk supplying in the biggest convenience stores in Taiwan and Japan, FamilyMart. We had an opportunity to talk with the CEO of this company, Dr. Chien-Chia Kung, who is also a licensed vet.
During the conversation, he told us that there are currently no regulations on cow feed. However, aflatoxin can adversely affect cow’s health and the quality of milk. Therefore he is really optimistic about our product, hoping that cows can eat healthier, consequently consumers also drinking higher quality milk.
Charoen Pokphand Enterprise
Charoen Pokphand Enterprise is the biggest animal feed company in Taiwan and Asia. We were fortunate enough to talk to the Dr. Kun-You Lin, the Associate General Manager of the Taiwan branch of the Charoen Pokphand Enterprise. Since it is the biggest animal feed supplier in Asia, they have become one of our potential future customer.
“In the current anti-myotoxin additives, yeast cells has been used for long time. If you could successfully use genetically-engineering techniques to make yeast produce enzymes that degrade aflatoxin, our customer would definitely give your Aflatoxout a try.” Dr. Lin said. He also said they would collaborate with us if Aflatoxout could significantly degrade aflatoxin in animal’s gastrointestinal tract. This really prove that Aflatoxout could be a great product for animal feed market.
Analysis
As mentioned, most companies pretty care about the influence caused by aflatoxin and have some methods to reduce the financial loss. Below are the current solutions that companies in Taiwan use for aflatoxin prevention. (And we take pigs for instance)
  Mixing dilution technique
Since the regulation standard for the concentration of aflatoxin in pig feed is below 50 ppb, animal feed companies would mix the high concentration feed with the low concentration ones to pass the regulation. However, this still does not change the fact that livestocks will take in the polluted feed.

In addition, the compound is immunosuppressive (http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleHtml/2008/CC/b719353j) and would therefore be disadvantageous to normal people. Many of the envisaged applications would only work with less problematic analogues of prodigiosin.

Anti-Venom
- traditional way of anti-venom production:
1. injecting venom or detoxified venom into a horse (tiny amount, multiple times)
2. after the antigen growing period, contract the horse blood plasma
3. use stomach digestive enzyme to breakdown the anti-venom protein into smaller globin
4. use (NH4)2SO4 to salt out the globin (purification) [1]
- oxides like K2MnO4 can neutralise venom by denaturing the polypeptide chains - complex ligase like AuCl2 can denature venom by binding with them, when preventing venom entering the tissues [2] -immune system has a stronger response to venom [3]. When the mast cells are stimulated, they release histamine. Histamine can subside the venom - histamine producing bacteria: found in tuna; 18 types of bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens and other anaerobic bacteria
- to conclude: 1. decide the working mechanism (toxicology) of a specific type of venom: does it attack neurons? brain cells? cardiovascular system? respiratory system? 2. does it react with histamine? 3. bacterial production of histamine

Four SRDs were created using JMP; Central Composite Design-Uniform Precision design (CCD-UP), Box-Behnken (BB), Central Composite Design-Orthogonal (CCD-O), and Central Composite Design (CCD). The design diagnostics feature was used to compare the designs (Figure 4). Specifically, the colour map on correlations, power analysis for each factor and interaction, D, G, and A efficiencies, average variance of prediction, and number of reactions were compared to determine which design would be used. The colour map on correlations shows how correlated two terms are (red is highly correlated, blue is highly un-correlated). The more correlated two terms are, the more difficult it is to determine which is responsible for the effect on the response (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). As would be expected, in each design, terms are highly correlated with themselves (observed as a diagonal red line). Other terms are generally very lowly correlated with different terms. For the CCD-UP, BB, and CCD, the terms at the bottom right of the map have correlations above 0. For CCD-UP and BB, these correlations are still very low, but for CCD they are at about 0.5. Power analysis shows the likelihood of detecting an active effect for terms in the design (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). The CCD-O had a higher Power for all terms, with CCD-UP having the next highest. BB and CCD had lower Power for all terms, but some terms were higher in the BB design than the CC design, and some higher in CC design than the BB design.

D, G, and A efficiencies are a measure of each design to be D, G, and A optimised. A design is D optimal if confidence regions for the vector of regression coefficients are minimized, G optimal if maximum prediction variance over the design region is minimized, and A optimal if the sum of the regression coefficient variance is minimized (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). The CCD-UP design has the highest D efficiency and the"

PCR for 16s characterization, sequencing interpretation and phylogenetic tree construction.
To identify bacterial strains, 16S rRNA sequences were amplified through colony PCR, column purified, and Sanger sequenced by GATC.
The resulting sequences were submitted for BLAST comparison at ncbi.gov.
Alignments were performed using the Ribosomal Database Project Aligner tool (https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/),
and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Geneious software with the following parameters: we used Neighbor-Joining tree building with Jukes Cantor as the genetic distance model, with a 93% similarity cost matrix for the alignment with free end gaps.
The tree was then exported and improved using the online Tree of Life software (http://www.tolweb.org/tree/).
PCR for genome sequencing.
We isolated bacterial DNA using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit from Qiagen.
We submitted four strains to GATC for whole genome sequencing: NS.4 (Lysinibacillus), S.48 (Stenothrophomonas maltophilia), S.33 (Oerskovia Paurometabola), NS.33 (Microccocus Luteus) according to their sample preparation specifications.

If bands formed on the PAGE we left to develop overnight, we will incubate the now cleaned biofilm plates with the same supernatants used to PAGE yesterday.
Day 38
So far, only E# has worked for SDS-PAGE. Need to optimize for the rest of the constructs - (D,E,H,J,K,L,N,O,P)#
Today, let’s just focus on the Art-175 constructs because it’s too difficult to do all of them. So, that’s (L, N, O and K)# overnights - see TCA precipitation (taking up8 flasks)
When setting up flasks for supernatants, wash with antibiotic free media.
→ Also try Art-175 supernatants against the biofilm degradation plates
Day 39
Run SDS-PAGE in the morning for the supernatants
(L, E, J and P)# prepare supernatants and run PAGE. Potentially do more if growing in falcon tubes
Day 40
(L, E, J and P)# left secreting overnight - isolate supernatants for SDS-PAGE
Week 9
Day 42
Set Up for TCA
Dilute the 4 Art-175 overnights - 16 conical flasks
Secrete at 18C overnight and TCA ppt tomorrow
Secretion
Prepare 50/100 ml volumes of Ara + cell cultures for purification from supernatant
Determine buffers for purification.
Day 43
Expression
Lysis and His tag purification of P# (DNase)
SDS-PAGE for Nickel column fractions collected Day 42
TCA ppt for overnight secretions of Art-175 constructs - store ppts
TCA ppt for the overnights (secretion for four hours in the afternoon)                                             → Dilute 1/20 in LB + appropriate antibiotic first thing in the morning so that we can start secretion asap
Purification
So far - DNase DsbA and DspB DsbA expressed 4hrs, DNase expressed overnight, Art-175 group expressed 4 hrs and overnight
Setting up secretion for DsbA tagged and DspB that I can run on a column tomorrow - 4 hrs secretion

COMPOSITE PARTS
Targeting GFP brick
Description: This targeting sequence consist in the large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase enzyme, RuBisCO, ( BBa_K1113701 ) attached with a flexible linker ( BBa_K105012 ) to the superfolder GFP ( BBa_I746916 ) under the regulation of the pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ) and includes a RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The targeting sequence is constructed to deliver the fluorescence to the Carboxysome under the induction with L-arabinose. Since this is a targeting sequence, in order to work it needs to be expressed in the presence of the Carboxysome, ( BBa_K1113100 ).
This part was constructed with a mutation in the Prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”), which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly. This part it’s also constructed on the pSB4K5 standard vector.
The large subunit of RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley).

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#cn_-_-_TEXT.html," this emerging field.  This map is based on publicly available data from official websites, scientific literature, government reports and records, and newspaper and journal articles. Synthetic biology is, however, a growing field, and therefore, the map is still in the progress fully depicting synthetic biology all around the world.
The map identifies 20 entries in Mainland China, 7 in Hong Kong, and 6 in Taiwan in year of 2013. The entries include universities involving in synthetic biology researches, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) laboratories, and companies. All of the entries lie in the east coast in China, where the economy is relatively more prosperous than those of the central and western regions. Also, regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau are more globalized than mainland China. These regions can provide the public and academia more opportunities to communicate with experts from other countries such as the United States.
Compared with leading countries in synthetic biology such as the United States, China has far fewer entries. The most significant difference can be seen in private companies. This may be caused by insufficient information about synthetic biology for the private investors. Overall, SynBio map reflects China’s position in synthetic biology development. Prospectively, Chinese government will put larger capital on synthetic biology and attract more and more high-tech talents to devote themselves into synthetic biology in China.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Thousands of college students from Mainland China who want hand on experience in synthetic biology participate in the iGEM competition. In recent years, there have been teams from Peking University, Tsinghua University, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Tianjin University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) participating in the iGEM competition. They have made remarkable achievements. For example, in 2007, Peking University team won the world championship. (""Research results of,"" 2010) Trying to meet this standard, more universities are devoted to do better in the competition by increasing the fund and having more students and faculty involved in the iGEM competition.
Biotechnology Industry
From the start of last century, China had made great efforts to apply biotechnology in industries, agriculture and medical science. Because of these efforts, there are currently five main industries under the larger biotechnology industry: agricultural biotechnology industry, biological pharmacy industry, industrial biotechnology, biological resources technology and environmental biotechnology, respectively (Liu, 2006).

Abstract
The Fantastic Lysisbox: Genetically engineered cell death is essential for the application of biotechnology, such as in bioremediation area. In order to control the cell-death, we designed “Lysisbox”, which consists of a pair of modules: “Killer gene” and “Anti-killer gene.” As the Killer gene for Escherichia coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1 gene] of lambda phage coding for holin and endolysin. The holin form pores in the inner membrane and the endolysin access and degrade the peptidoglycan passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose SΔTMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes' expression level has the key to the E.coli’s life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores should show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes and a cell wall. “Lysisbox” will contribute a lot to all the future iGEM projects, thus you must say “FANTASTIC!!!""
Introduction
Background
The cell-death device is required in many fields [1] [2] . In bioremediation, for example, this device can prevent ecosystem disruption by introduced bacteria [3] [4] . Also, it can be applied to other ideas such as E.coli capsules which scatter drug or aroma by cell"

Introduction Removing  antibiotics resistance gene Questionnaire Debate Bibliography
Introduction
In this report, we present the bioethics part of the ULB-Brussels project.
In the first section, we sum up our project from an ethical and theoretical point of view:
what about the resistance to antibiotics?
what is clean biology?
In the second section, we discuss the questionnaire given to a sample of the population.
What was this questionnaire about?
What were our results?
How can we discuss them?
And then in the third and last section, we analyze the debate we organized with the other Belgian team, the KULeuven Team, and draw conclusions about what we learned during this debate.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Late presentation of symptoms was identified as the biggest challenge in its diagnosis. This played a role in our decision to choose NSCLC as our tool could be used to screen patients, and achieve the early diagnosis that would reduce mortality rates.
Tests are usually only done once symptoms appear - as this is when the patient goes to their doctor. Unfortunately, for cancers like NSCLC, symptoms usually only appear once the cancer has metastasized and can only be treated palliatively. Early detection is vital as survival rates are much higher in earlier stages - stage one NSCLC tumors can easily be excised surgically.
Attribution: Philippe Verdy, in public domain
Screening
As the primary application of our sensor would be in screening, we carried out research into previous attempts to screen for NSCLC. This allowed us to gain an understanding of the problems with existing technologies and how our tool could be an improvement.
Screening for NSCLC is attractive due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease in its early stages, and relatively good prognosis when detected early. Numerous trials have been carried out to investigate the efficacy of low dose computerized tomography (LDCT) in improving mortality rates for NSCLC. Previous trials have shown other screening methods such as sputum cytology or chest radiography to produce no reduction in mortality rates. The national screening trial in America showed with LDCT, a 20% reduction in mortality rates from lung cancer in high risk groups compared to X-ray. [1] However, the benefits of screening remains highly controversial due to high rates of false positives leading to unnecessary further testing, thoracotomies for benign lesions and associated cost.

The meta-analysis performed by Gopal et al. showed that using LDCT to screen high risk individuals 70% of lung cancers were diagnosed at stage one compared to the 16% detected at stage one during routine care. However, the benefits in early detection may be outweighed by the limitations of the screening method. The screening arm produced a massive number of false positives - for every 9 stage one tumors detected, there were 235 false positive nodules and 4 thoracotomies for benign lesions performed. Compared to the control, the false positive rate was a 3.1 times larger and patients"

Time flies...
Jeez, where's the time going?? It's weird to think that we have about 2 weeks left and also very scary. It's full speed ahead here with us in the lab, but also in the dry lab. The SDU-iGEM team came to our part of the world for a wee visit and we had our own little conference and it was very beneficial as we gave each other good feedback and ideas. It was also brilliant to finally get a fresh pair of eyes to look at our project.

So far so good…
Despite all the stress about making the deadline on the 27th of October, it seems like we’re progressing forwards with pleasing results. Up until now, all our ligated constructs seem to have worked successfully after having verified them via verification PCR’s from minipreps.
The last stretch of work will hopefully go smoothly as well cause its here where we really need everything to work especially as they’ll be for our measurements!
The first construct out of 5 needed for running measurements will be made today; this differs from the other 4 as it doesn’t contain any terminators within the construct, this will be used to illustrate how the system will function containing an anti-terminator and nut site though no terminator. So firstly a ligation will be made, followed by a transformation and finally the transformants will be plated and tomorrow we’ll know if this ligation was successful or not, hopefully"

Abstract
We have chosen to put a great deal of effort into making our project as safe as possible. This safety paper represents our thoughts and ideas, as well as throughout  assessments of the safety and security of the project. We have, in addition to assessing the safety and security, attempted to create a new safety standard in the form of a watermarking standard. We have taken care, throughout the process of electing a project, not to create a potentially pathogenic bacteria. This made us abandon our initial project as we foresaw some issues concerning the pathogenicity of our construct.  We have blasted all genes and proteins for homologs in pathogenic bacteria, and performed a risk-assessment of each bio-brick, as well as an assessment of the entire project. We have taken care to uphold the laws and safety guidelines laid out by the UN as well as by the Danish Government, especially concerning assessing the risks of our project, as well as the properties of the individual parts, such as substitution of potentially pathogenic material, and the guidelines for personal safety. We have enlisted the help of our local bio-safety group, associated with the university, to help us better grasp the potential risks of our project as well as offering a lab-safety course, that all participating students passed.
Finally, to further the safety of the world at large, we have created a watermarking standard. We propose to insert watermarks into synthetically engineered parts. The watermark consists of a licence associated with the creating team, accessible from the parts-registry, containing information on how to contact the creating team, as well as all relevant information and characterizations of the parts involved.

We showed our work with other synthetic biologists, covering topics such as the difference between natural and synthetic forms of life, the promise and compromises of synthetic biology, new manufacturing processes, iGEM and finally the way that the concept of life might change due to synthetic biology.
As a group of artists and designers competing in a competition set up for engineers and scientists we need to think about how we can make a meaningful contribution without emulating the approach of science-based teams. As a group we found we were skeptical of the engineer's view of biology and wanted to explore alternative visions and ways of manipulating"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and"
HIT-Harbin,2014,Team:HIT-Harbin#WholeNameList_-_-_TEXT.html," data allows us to characterize the genome-wide distribution patterns of epigenetic marks, which have improved our understanding of the relationship between chromatin modification/structure and genes expression. More and more studies have found that epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in many biological processes, such as Transposon Element silencing and long-range interactions within the genome. Moreover, those studies have found there are different layers of cross-talk and interplay among epigenetic marks to be involved in chromatin- dependent processes. Here, we take advantage of evidence from recent genetic, biochemical and high- throughput sequencing studies to explore the complex cross-talk between different epigenetic patterns, and address how these epigenetic marks interplay with each other and then affect gene transcription. Finally, we build a cross-talk network and analyze the characteristic of the network. Comprehensive cross-talk network of epigenetic marks will help in fully understanding the functional roles and biological impact of epigenetic regulation.

Title：'Professionalising digital data curation skills in Universities'
Louise Corti UK Data Archive
Abstract：Researchers’ responsibilities towards their research data are set to change across all domains of scientific endeavour. Research funders are increasingly mandating open access to research data; governments internationally are demanding transparency in research; the economic climate is requiring much greater re-use of data; and fear of data loss calls for more robust information security practices. All these factors mean that researchers need to improve, enhance and professionalize their research data management skills to meet the challenge of producing the highest quality shareable and reusable research outputs in a responsible and efficient way. The promotion of these skills offers a strategic contribution to the world's research capacity building programmes. How can we go about professionalising our data management skills? I take a guided tour of various efforts in UK universities to help make this agenda happen.

Abstract: Systems biology aims to understand the behavior of a biological system at the system level by means of investigating the behavior and interactions of all the components in the system. Due to the ability to produce data of one and the same phenomenon at different scales, the modeling of biological systems is moving from single scales to multiple scales, e.g., from the molecular scale to the cell, tissue, and even the whole organism

Primers were designed for making BioBricks out of the separate genes from  the nisin operon. For this, the sequence of the transposon Tn5307 was used, a transposon that contains the nisin operon, and of  which the sequence is known.1 This sequence is close to the sequence of the transposon Tn5276, the transposon which will form the template for making the new BioBricks. The primers for making a BioBrick out of PNisI with a RBS were based on a sequence found in a research paper that documented the identification of this promoter.2
It was decided to combine the genes NisR and NisK as one BioBrick and NisF, NisE and NisG as one BioBrick, because these genes are related in function or work together.

The Social Benefits of iGEM
By Benjamin Couillard
With assistance from Abraham Ogbaslase, Steffi Tran, Jacob Rumsey, and Pavel Shmatnik
The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology has a large social benefit, in terms of education and tangible impacts, and accordingly that barriers to participation should be lowered in the interest of expanding this social benefit. There is a substantial literature on how various aspects of iGEM- problem-based learning, engineering competitions, and undergraduate research- provide academic benefits and/or signal the acquisition of skills to potential employers. There is also some literature on how participation in iGEM specifically teaches important scientific skills and higher-order thinking, generates a passion for science, and occasionally results in scientific publications. Besides reviewing this literature, this paper will demonstrate that the act of publishing scientific research based on an iGEM project indicates a larger educational benefit than participation alone, since publication is often done by finalist and gold medal-winning teams (issues of causality will also be addressed). It will also demonstrate that the number of scientific publications and businesses resulting from an iGEM project is non-trivial, and will demonstrate how businesses resulting from iGEM teams connect to the greater economy.
The paper is organized thusly: Section One is an introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology. Section Two is a review of the literature on the pedagogical benefits of different aspects of iGEM and some literature on iGEM itself. Section Three is an analysis of patterns in the publication of 82 papers based on iGEM projects. Section Four is an analysis of 20 startups affiliated with iGEM teams, either because a former iGEM participant is a co-founder or because the startup is directly based on an iGEM project. Section Five concludes.
Section One
While no universally-accepted definition of synthetic biology exists, it can be pithily summarized as the application of engineering principles to biology, primarily through the creation and alteration of DNA sequences in bacteria, in order to achieve some human-chosen objective. It offers many applications that would benefit humanity, such as synthetic organisms that"

   Mei Chen's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
I characterized the CrtEBI (lycopene gene) biobrick K274100 submitted by team Cambridge 2009, for which two new biobricks was constructed. Addtionally, I contributed to the bioreporters partly, such as bioreporters for mercury or lead.
