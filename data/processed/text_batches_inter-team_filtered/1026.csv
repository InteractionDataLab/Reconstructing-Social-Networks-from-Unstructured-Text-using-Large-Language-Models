I Why we design this project?
    The relationships between populations and individuals are very complex. For gregarious animals like ants, there exists an ant society, in which a clear division of labor can be seen. Despite of it, how the society is organized is still a mystery. For animals so simple as ants, the interactions between individuals still involve lots of genes. Similarly, for us human, how our society works is also a very complicated problem. Though difficult to study, the knowledge of the organization of societies is really precious as it directs our further research into behaviors and more importantly, gives us more angles to view history and instructs us to make the present society better.
    As all of these systems are too complicated and uncontrollable, it is hard for us to study these systems directly to understand the nature of these relationships. To achieve this goal, this year we decided to use our knowledge of synthetic biology to construct a simple system which can be used to simulate many kinds of relationships between individuals and populations. Through this system, we can simplify the complex natural system so we can get a better understanding of these relationships.
    What's more, we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of some factors (Like the initial number of each populations and spatial factors) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War ( Game Overview ) to satisfy our needs.
    Despite of the research values of our system, we found that as it is very simple"

UTP-Panama,2011,Team:UTP-Panama#After Regional Week 1_-_-_TEXT.html," the plates out from the incubator
- grow a Renbo colony, in liquid LB @37ºC with shaker.
Things we have to do for Saturday, October 22nd, 2011:
- miniprep. of Renbo
- electrophoresis of Renbo.
Octuber 20
Bristol (choromphenicol)
Rembo (Ampycillin)
We used 4 plates for each ,renbo and Bristol:
First plate( LB ,antibiotic ,renbo)
Second plate(LB, antibiotic, competent cells without plates)
Third plate( LB,  competent cells)
Forth plate(Thermal  shock at 45°C for 1 minute)
4 parts of 500µl of competent cells
Using the protocol of page 40 but instead using 20ml of solid LB.
RENBO=  30 µl of ampycillin
BRISTOL=14.6 µL of cloromphenicol
Observations
1) We make calculations for 15 ml of lb .
2) For  the negative control ( LB + Competent cells ) we just use 1 plate,  so in the incubator we had 7 plates. 3 for Renbo
1(LB+ ampicillin+ competent cells)(control)
2(LB+ampicillin+renbo)
3(LB+ampicillin+renbo)
3 for Bristol
1(LB+ clorophenicol+ competent cells)(control)
2(LB+clorophenicol+bristol)
3(LB+clorophenicol+bristol)
1 plate generally negative

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," concentrations of phage to specific wells, and using a plate reader we measured the absorbance during 23 hours.
Figure 6 - Table showing the number of bacteria cells in each well. Each well had a certain number of phage added so that the concentration of phage was 2.5x10^-9 PFU. The wells labeled LB are the blanks for background, and the wells labelled T4 are only T4 phage and contain no bacteria in order to observe the absorbance of only the phage over time.
Figure 7 - Graph demonstrating the bacterial growth over time when the same number of phage was introduced to varying concentrations of bacteria. In the graph we can see that the highest concentration of bacteria grew relatively slowly in comparison to the other concentrations, and this is likely because the phage had an abundance of bacteria to infect and more bacteria were dying.
Figure 8 - Graph showing the bacterial growth curve when varying concentrations of phage were introduced. The bacteria concentrations that were introduced to the most phage grew slightly slower than the other samples. This shows that the phage may be successfully infecting the bacteria.
The results demonstrate the growth curve of the bacteria, and while the bacteria are still growing, they grow at a slower rate than they would be without the phage present. In addition, the maximum amount of bacteria decreases when phage are present. The starting OD is higher in the graph than in the legend, and this is due to the bacteria reproducing during the time period between when the original dilutions were measured and when the sample was measured after the phage were added. Our phage assay demonstrates that it is likely the phage are infecting the bacteria, as a higher concentration of phage resulted in decreased bacterial growth. Furthermore, increased numbers in bacteria result in decreased growth, and it can be interpreted that this is as a result of the phage having an abundance of bacteria to infect. This increases the rate at which the bacteria are infected and results in a less extreme growth curve.
ELASTIN-LIKE POLYMER SYNTHESIS
Our team completed elastin-like polymer (ELP) synthesis because the repeating amino acid sequence is very long and difficult to order in one large sequence. Therefore we ordered the sequence in smaller pieces and completed extension PCR to overlap and add on another piece of the ELP. In the future, we hope to experiment and test the properties of the ELP. We successfully extended the ELP by connecting the first, second and third parts. The procedure of this experiment will be elaborated on in the design page.

The IIT Delhi team, this year, is working on modifying the Danino Oscillator. IISC Bangalore plans on working on reducing production costs, by replacing the centrifugation step by an autoaggregation step of their design. IIT Madras meanwhile is working on 2 different aspects, one of them being testing noise in devices, and the other being a ribose switch.
Workshops
Using the biobrick repository of iGEM Foundation, India has a tremendous potential to contribute in newer applications of Synthetic Biology. We initiated an ‘iGEM India Campaign’ under which we conducted several workshops and published articles in national newspapers and magazines.
DAV Model school, Kharagpur
DAV Trust is an educational organization in India with over 800+ schools and 75+ colleges. Collaborating with DAV Trust, we organized an interactive workshop at DAV Public School which saw participation of over 70 high school students. Competing under high school division with international teams at Giant Jamboree of iGEM is a great opportunity for these young students. We received a good response from the students and faculties who were quite enthusiastic and were eagerly interacting throughout the workshop. The workshop at  DAV Model school, Kharagpur, was aimed at spreading the concepts of synthetic biology and  about the iGEM competition. through a comprehensive presentation which also involved previous and this  year’s ideas.
University of Kolkata, Kolkata
One of the most successful workshop was organized at the University of Calcutta where 3 professors and around 60 students were inspired by our team of undergraduates and we extensively discussed their feasibility to participate in iGEM in 2017.
The workshop at University of Kolkata was attended by postgraduate students. It was aimed at spreading the concept of Synthetic Biology and introducing them to iGEM and to encourage a participation from them. The students were quite enthusiastic about the presentation and also about iGEM. They were postgraduate students and therefore had an idea about Synthetic Biology and understood our project quite well. Workshop started with presentation by the members of our team. The presentation included information on iGEM, our current idea and past idea as well as some path breaking ideas of other teams during the previous iGEM competitions. After the presentation, there was some good discussion about the scope of the project and suggestions from their side about further modifications and lab work. The students and teachers were"

Discovery of Aequorin
One day in the fall of 1960, shortly after my arrival at Princeton from Japan, Dr. Frank Johnson showed me a small jar containing a spoonful of white powder. He explained that the powder was a freeze dried “squeezate” made from the luminous jellyfish Aequorea, and that it would emit light when mixed with water. He asked me if I would be interested in studying the bioluminescence of this jellyfish. The powder did not emit any light when moistened. But I was quite impressed by Dr. Johnson’s description of the brilliant luminescence of live jellyfish and the great abundance of specimens around Friday Harbor, Washington. So my response was a definite “yes.” My experience in bioluminescence research at the time was meager and limited to only the luminescent system of the ostracod Cypridina. I imagined, vaguely, that the jellyfish would probably contain a kind of luciferin and a luciferase, possibly with one of the cofactors, such as ATP, FMN, or NADH, like the fireflies, luminous bacteria, and Cypridina that were known at that time.
In the early summer of 1961, we traveled from Princeton to Friday Harbor in Dr. Johnson’s station wagon, which he had newly purchased for the excursion. The car was fully loaded with necessary equipment and chemicals, including a MacNichol integrating photometer of gigantic size (a two-foot cube), and"

Our team was approached via Facebook by Enrique Salas to participate on a survey related to Self-medication and Public Health. Later on the team also showed interest in getting to know better our project. After some messages exchanged, we offered to send them a copy of our recent poster designed for “The European Experience 2016”. This was an opportunity to share knowledge about layout, structure and content of a scientific poster, a very important feature of the iGEM experience.
iGEM Manchester
Our team was contacted via Twitter by iGEM Manchester to take part on a survey related to Alcohol consumption. There was quite a fuzz over this survey among our team members since the topic “Alcohol consumption” is very appealing. We contributed with over 15 entries and had a lot of fun while answering.
iGEM Groningen
Our team was contacted through email by Ilona Mager from iGEM Groningen to take part on a survey related to Digital Information Storage and Cyber Security. Our contribution to the survey was awarded with this great cooperation badge shown above.
iGEM Tel Hai
Our team was approached via Facebook by David Lancry to help their team raise awareness about Cystic Fibrosis. They collaborated with the Cystic Fibrosis Fondation of Israel and created together a campaign worldwide which our team was invited to participate. The goal was to take a picture of our team with a red rose, the symbol of the campaign.  We were really proud to be part of this initiative!
iGEM Mentorship Program
We enrolled on the Mentorship Program proposed by iGEM this year. We received a first contact from our Mentor, Fabian Fröhlich, and our Team Coordinator, Liza Figueiredo by email. Further on a monthly schedule of Skype conference calls was settled with Fabian, who is a bioinformatician and has a great deal of iGEM experience.  The Mentorship Program allowed us to be more aware of the iGEM standards and to come to our mentor with several obstacles our project faced through the course of the months. We were pleased to have taken part on this experience because it brought to the team fresh eyes when needed, external opinions and therefore new perspectives we could not have had otherwise.

This week we got a break from struggling with zMol and zSpace to go to BU and learn about their project. I had to try to understand biology to learn what their project was about, so that was an interesting learning experience. We had fun with them by having lunch and going bowling. While at Boston University, I did the Sifteo Cube study  with Consuelo which I thought was the best part about my trip to BU. I really liked learning about her project and some of the other uses for Sifteo Cubes. Wednesday and Thursday we returned to working on zMol and double bonding at Wellesley. We're still struggling with understanding the old zMol spaghetti code. We got Kevin, one of the previous developers of zMol to come help explain the code to us and his thought process during their development. We've experimented with double bonding enough to get bonds to change colors but it's very glitchy and crashes a lot. We're starting to understand more things, bit by bit.
June 14
We've struggled with double bonding for several days with a bit of success, but there are still many glitches. We spent a few days just getting everything in working order to present our project to BU. We were joined this week by our intern, Yoav. We're getting into more of a rhythm with our work this week. We're supposed to start thinking about our 3D representation of the periodic table of elements so we spent some time drawing up designs for the program. We're hoping to make it easy and intuitive to use. We'd like it to be searchable, colorful, and to contain as many 3D things as possible. A goal of ours is to show information about each element in the 3D space instead of on a GUI and to have all the elements interact with zMol so we can accurately allow users to create covalent bonds. We presented to BU and they liked playing with the sample programs on the zSpace, but our program didn't seem to interest them much.
June 28
The last two weeks we've been under a lot of pressure to get things working in zMol. Orit decided that we should try to submit a poster presentation for UIST, which is a really prestigious conference in"

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

Mathematical modeling
To determine the Affinity k_D, experiments to find out the binding affinity of the plastic binding domain are necessary. To get a direct access to these values, we cloned the plastic binding domain in front of a GFP. Then, dilution and washing assays could be performed on polystyrene microtiter plates, red out by a fluorescence plate reader.  The desired parameters could be calculated by measuring dilution rows of GFP proteins and measuring the fluorescence signals at the different concentrations. C_total could be determined by a dilution row with subsequent washing steps, to find out at what [P] concentration there is a saturation. See description of the plastic binding subproject for more detailed explanation on the experimental setup.
A qualitative experiment to prove that Nickel is binding the Precipitator is sufficient, since k_2 >> 1 and does not play a significant role in our setup. This experiment could have been done using a nanofilter that blocks protein but let through ions. The Nickel concentration of the flow through can then be measured.
Alternatively purification of the Precipitator by fusing it with a GST-tag could be done, to subsequently measure the absorbance of the protein, before and after adding Nickel to the solution. After Jordan 1974 a detectable change in the absorbance should be detectable after the complex is formed. A similar effect – a colorshift from white to blue -  is visible when one prepares a Ni-NTA column. For this purpose we cloned the GST domain in front of the Precipitator. However towards the end of the project there was no more time to perfom these experiments.

The Genetic Limiter
To build a genetic limiter, we employ the tools of a synthetic biologist and cybernetician.  Defined by Dr. Norbert Wiener in 1948, cybernetics is the study of systems of regulation and control.  Regulatory elements can be studied and modeled in the abstract, whether their manifestation is mechanical, electrical biological, natural or synthetic.  Our limiter circuit is an example of a complex device built from smaller parts whose internal complexity can be abstracted away in the mode of the synthetic biologist.  We began by devising the logical control network that results in threshold regulation of an element outside of its boundaries.
Leading to the limiter
Consider a gene of interest (G) for which one inducing transcription factor (A) is known (Fig. 1).  In the presence of unnaturally-heightened levels of inducer A, our gene will experience excessive activation.  A logical method for addressing this problem would be to introduce an inhibitor for the gene of interest to attenuate its presence or activity.  Traditional pharmaceutical interventions either block the activity of the protein encoded by gene G, causing interference on the level of protein interactions, or make changes upstream then can arrest expression of gene G.  One concern that arises with the use of a chemical input is that, especially in the case of multi-cellular organisms, this often has diffuse, unspecified, and often undesirable effects.  Drugs that are administered to biological systems in a therapeutic context particularly require an understanding of the intricate balance between efficacy and toxicity.  An alternative may be to directly reduce the expression of gene G with an introduced transcriptional repressor.  Although a genetically-based inhibitor is more difficult to implement, such a genetic tool would afford a great deal of specificity to the system, directly repressing only the gene of interest.
If we were to introduce a repressing transcription factor (R) driven by a constitutive promoter (Fig. 2), we would see a constant amount of repression of G, independent of its level of activation.  We might face the issue that increased expression of inducer A would surpass the repressor's"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," 16 ]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which causes an inflammatory response of the urothelium.
It is estimated that approximately 40% of women have had a UTI at some time in their lives [ 10 ]. UTIs may be caused by a variety of different organisms, most commonly bacteria. The most frequent cause of UTI in adult women is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85% of community-acquired UTIs and 25-50% of hospital-acquired UTIs. Nosocomial infections may involve more aggressive organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species.
The Solution
Break down bacterial biofilms to liberate the bacteria encased within and reduce the dose of antibiotics required
Directly kill the bacteria encased within the biofilms to provide an alternative to antibiotics
Overview
Our solution is focused on providing a treatment for UTIs because conventional antibiotics are unable to treat these and other biofilm-associated infections. Given the prevalence of such infections, there is a growing need for alternative therapeutic agents that can specifically degrade biofilms and kill the bacteria encased within. The use of synthetic biology to produce enzymes is the most effective way to achieve this specificity based on current technology. Our solution aims to investigate how bacterial biofilm disrupting proteins and antimicrobial proteins can be exported from E. coli and subsequently retain their antibiofilm/antimicrobial function. Using this secretion device we seek to create a system that offers persistent protection against biofilm formation.
We have designed a device that can exert antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa, the two leading causes of CAUTIs [ 4 ]. A nonpathogenic laboratory strain of E. coli is used as the expression host for the production of these enzymes as a proof-of-concept. The antibiofilm enzymes that we are using are Dispersin B and Micrococcal DNase, and the antimicrobial proteins that we are using are Art-175 and Microcin S.
Degrading the Biofilm
Prof. Malone-Lee stressed to us that sensitivity is a greater problem than complete antibiotic resistance. “Many more strains of bacteria are just insensitive to low doses of antibiotics, many can be overcome by high doses over long periods of time. Resistance is definitely not absolute.” Breaking down the biofilm increases the sensitivity of the bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.

The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-X"

Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," produces for example almost half of the total german potato yield.
Harald Wiedemann expressed his severe concerns about the biodiversity and the extinction of specific species due to the use of glyphosate and other herbicides. He and his party are also part of the initiative „Stopp Glyphosat“ to reduce the use of a herbicide which long-term effects are not known yet.
Achim Hübner however pointed out that the use of glyphosate is essential in order to guarantee the high amount of yield and the low prices of food in the supermarkets. In addition, he said that we never know all the side effects of the substances that we consume and therefore one cannot forbid only one specific herbicide on spec.
When our team members asked about an alternative for glyphosate Horst-Henning Steinmann stated that the current alternative to glyphosate are non-chemical methods such as ploughing, this however is more expensive and takes more time. He also said that glyphosate is the cheapest and most effective herbicide available at the moment and pointed out that the side effects of alternative herbicides are also not known yet. However he is also in favour of the reduction of the wide use of glyphosate especially in area where it is not a 100% necessary. Werner Wille agreed with the point of view of Achim Hübner and would see the act of forbidding glyphosate as populist.
After the very diverse and motivated discussion of our guest the audience also asked a few questions. This was very interesting because it was a very versatile audience of students of agriculture, members of the BUND Göttingen and even farmer of farms close to Göttingen. In the end it can be said that even though the panel discussion lasted for one and a half hours there is still much more to talk and discuss about.
The result so far was that there is no alternative at the moment, especially when the people are not willing to pay more for their food in the supermarket, even though the impact of glyphosate on the biodiversity could be severe. All in all the panel discussion was a huge success and we thank all of the participants for coming!

""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
——————————————— Peter Carr, Director of Judging
      Our project this year originated from a real social issue in our life, and we dedicated to ensure that “Our projects are safe, responsible and good for the world.”
      In pursuit of that goal, Human Practice connects us with the society and maps our research to the real world.                                         Our Human Practices could be further divided into 3 Acts: Survey (about the real world scenario and interviews with experts), Meet-ups (communicating with other iGEMers), Engagement (science popularizing [sessions]). Next, we invite you to join us and learn more about how our work affects the world, and how the world affects our work.

According to the results of these questionnaires, we realized that the sleep problem has been a common problem in the modern society, and it’s high time to solve this problem and promote the public awareness of healthy sleep. In addition, melatonin could be a hit into the market with proper conduct propaganda, and the particular population who often worked the night shift may be our major potential customer.

Chitin Synthase NodC
We set out to produce chitosan hydrogels that use chitin as a source material. Originally, this N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide (chitin) is extracted chemically from crustacean shells under usage of a lot of chemicals, producing chitin oligosaccharides of unspecified length [1] . To reduce the usage of chemicals, one aim of this project was to produce chitin in E. coli by insertion of a chitin synthase (CHS) into this organism, using the BioBrick system [2] . The CHS can produce chitin in E. coli in an enviromentally friendly way. The enzyme that was employed in this project is the CHS NodC from the bacteria Rhizobium  leguminosarum. NodC is an N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase which catalyzes the formation of chitin tetramers and pentamers using activated N-acetylglucosamine monomers. In addition, NodC reliably produces short oligosaccharides of certain lengths which can further be processed in vitro [3] .
Introduction
Besides cellulose, chitin is the most common polysaccharide in nature. Chitin is composed of β(1,4) linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose (N-acetylglucosamine, Figure 1). The polymer is a white, hard nitrogenous polysaccharide and is a component of fungi cell walls and of the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans, like crabs or shrimps [4] [5] .
Figure 1. Structure of Chitin. Chitin is one of the most common polymers in nature. It is composed of β(1,4) linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose, which are acetylglucosamin monomers. The NAc stands for the acetamide group.
The extraction of chitin from crustaceans produces a lot of waste and uses a lot of chemicals. The waste of the seafood-processing industry, mostly the shells of crustaceans, contains 14"

In digital circuits, a Flip-Flop is a term referring to an electronic circuit (a bistable multivibrator) that has two stable states and thereby is capable of serving as one bit of memory. Today, the term Flip-Flop has come to mostly denote non-transparent (clocked or edge-triggered) devices, while the simpler transparent ones are often referred to as latches; however, as this distinction is quite new, the two words are sometimes used interchangeably.
A Flip-Flop is usually controlled by one or two control signals and/or a gate or clock signal. The output often includes the complement as well as the normal output. As Flip-Flops are implemented electronically, they require power and ground connections.
Flip-Flops can be either simple (transparent) or clocked. Simple Flip-Flops can be built around a pair of cross-coupled inverting elements: vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors, field effect transistors, inverters, and inverting logic gates have all been used in practical circuits — perhaps augmented by some gating mechanism (an enable/disable input). The more advanced clocked (or non-transparent) devices are specially designed for synchronous (time-discrete) systems; such devices therefore ignores its inputs except at the transition of a dedicated clock signal (known as clocking, pulsing, or strobing). This causes the Flip-Flop to either change or retain its output signal based upon the values of the input signals at the transition. Some Flip-Flops change output on the rising edge of the clock, others on the falling edge.
Our project simulates a SR Latch (Figure 11), the most fundamental latch, where S and R stand for set and reset. It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q (or the complement Q"

Our Part Collection includes:
Original TRPC5 plasmid (<partinfo>BBa_K1943021</partinfo>);
Five mutated TRPC5 plasmids(<partinfo>BBa_K1943022</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943023</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943024</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943025</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943026</partinfo>).
Transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) is a mechanosensitive (MS) channel [1] which takes charge of hearing in our project. Future teams could use original TRPC5 plasmid (<partinfo>BBa_K1943021</partinfo>) to sense sound or other kinds of mechanical forces. Furthermore, we randomly mutated the ankyrin region of TRPC5 channel by PCR. We expected the ankyrin region to be a crucial part for sense mechanical forces based on the structure of TRPC5. [2] (Detailed methods are shown in our notebook.)
Directed Evolution Experiments
These mutated TRPC5 plasmids(<partinfo>BBa_K1943022</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943023</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943024</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943025</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1943026</partinfo>) have all been sequenced. Because of limited time, we have not yet transfected them into cells to observe whether the channels are more sensitive to sound and mechanical force or not. Future teams are welcomed to use and finish testing them.
The mutated amino acid sites are as listed:

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Education Session
On the 4th of July, we participated in the Ultimaker Education Session in Zaandam. Here, the newest innovations in 3D-printing techniques were showcased. We presented our device, both in a presentation and at a poster stand, and got some valuable tips on refining the settings of our 3D-printer from Ultimaker.
European iGEM Meetup
iGEM TUDelft organized an European iGEM Meetup. On the 7th of July, various teams from all over Europe gathered in Delft for a symposium. This included three speakers that talked about implementation of synthetic biology and poster presentations of the iGEM teams.
Central Veterinary Institute
The Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) is the bioveterinary research institute of Wageningen University & Research. Located in Lelystad, it is commissioned by the Dutch authorities and carries out research related to vaccine development, diagnostics and animal health in general. On the 10th of July, we gave an elaborate presentation on our project, during which we discussed the setup and story with the people at CVI.
Go/No-Go presentation
In order to involve our colleagues at the university in our project, we gave a Go/No-Go presentation, where all researchers and students in the relevant chair groups were invited to attend. Here, we gave a comprehensive 20-minute presentation on our project, how far we had come, and how much we were still planning to do in the last few months before the Jamboree. Afterwards, the audience was able to ask questions and vote if we made enough progress to proceed and participate at the Giant Jamboree. We got some valuable input and tips on the science part of our project, as well as the way we tell our story. Luckily, more than 90 percent of the public voted for a 'go'!
Master students Biotechnology
During the introduction week of the new academic year of Wageningen University & Research, we presented our project to the new batch of master students in Biotechnology. This way, we already taught them something about synthetic biology, and hopefully got them hooked on participating in iGEM next year! After the presentation, we got some great comments and several curious and interested students who wanted to know more.
Topsector Chemie
One of our team members pitched our project at the annual Topsector Chemie closing ceremony in Wageningen, at the 30th of August. This short pitch focussed on the challenges we face in using synthetic biology. Topsector Chemie is an"

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," mechanism is developed, which can facilitate other iGEM teams engineered organisms to work efficiently.
During ametabolic state, the DNA repairing mechanism is halted and cells are vulnerable to mutagenic radiation. Hence our final goal is to ameliorate our protection system by expressing the protein Dsup, in providing resistance towards radiation for the engineered bacteria, as well as MnSOD, which protect against oxidative stress during desiccation process.

We contacted Michelin Tires to ask them about their new sustainable natural rubber policy.6 We saw this policy as indication that tire companies might be looking for more sustainable sources of rubber, since natural rubber plantations currently contribute to deforestation and are susceptible to blight.7 However, we have yet to hear back from Michelin.)

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the 50 ul plate to find a colony that contains the w+zif268 insertion. We used the same recipe at our PCR reaction [[#PCR of omega+zif268 with overhangs on Friday. If the insert is present, then we should see a band at 709 bp. We also included 2 positive controls: our isothermal assembly product and our selection strain from which the w+zif268 was originally copied.
We ran an agarose gel to check the bands:
Lanes 1-8
Lanes 9-16
None of the colonies displayed any bands, except for primer residues. Lane 16 contained the selection plasmid, on which we performed a successful PCR on Friday, so we definitely expected a band at 709 bp. Because the positive controls did not have a band at 709 bp, we suspect that something went wrong with the PCR. We plan on re-running the PCR tomorrow.

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#invertase_-_-_TEXT.html," used two test parts, Secretory invertase and Pcon_mRFP_TT. Each of them are transformed into E. coli MG1655. E. coli MG1655 with different plasmids are called Peasant and Civilian (Despite their similarity to Peasant and Civilian, we cannot call them in that way because their genetic circuits are different after all.) separately, which do not have any invertase genes in genome. Peasant and Civilian will grow in M9-sucrose culture media, a special M9 culture media in which glucose is replaced by sucrose. Then there are only two available carbon sources, sucrose, if hydrolyzed, and arabinose, if added.
III Methods
1. Cultivate a pipe of Peasants and a pipe of Civilians for 12h.
2. Adjust their OD600 to be the same value.
3. Take 2ml each, and centrifuged them at 12000rpm for 1min. The supernatant was removed and each sediment was resuspended with 2ml M9-sucrose culture media.
4. Add 5ml M9-sucrose media and 100μl bacterial liquid, in which Peasants and Civilians are mixed. The concentration of Arabinose was set by adding concentrated Arabinose solution.
The experimental groups and control groups are listed as follows. The number ""1"" and ""3"" in the boxes are the numbers of repeats.
5. All of the groups were cultured for 20h. The growth was measured by flow cytometry. The number of cells is averaged.
IV. Results
The number of cells were counted and illustrated in the figures. Figure 1 shows the number of living cells in each group. Figure 2 shows the number of cells expressing mRFP in each group. Figure 3 shows the ratio of the number of cells expressing mRFP to the number of living cells.
Figure.1 The number of living cells
Figure 2. The number of cells expressing mRFP
Figure 3. The number of cells expressing mRFP/the number of living cells
V.Analysis
Figure 2 tells us that when Peasants and Civilians coexist in the media, Civilians grow more than the group in which Civilians live alone in the media. Also, the number of Civilians becomes larger than the negative control group if the primitive fraction of peasant is larger. Contrarily, the number of Civilians does not become larger if the primitive quantity of Peasants is too big while the original number"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," vector-borne diseases, WUR
Both dr. Sander Koenraadt and dr. Niels Verhulst see the benefit in focusing on both human diagnostic and mosquitoes. In mosquitoes there is no problem with the presence of viruses in the blood or issues with treatment availabilities. However, there is currently not a great need for a new field test for viral diseases in  blood fed mosquitoes. It only becomes a necessity after a disease is transmitted from animals to humans.
Background
We talked to dr. Sander Koenraadt, Assistant professor at the Laboratory of Entomology (Wageningen University & Research), expert in medical entomology and vector-borne diseases, about the application of our device on mosquitoes and he referred us to dr. ir. Niels Verhulst. Dr. Niels Verhulst developed an odor compound combination which attracts blood fed mosquitoes. He also developed traps which have already been used in the field.
June 20
Decision
From the opinion of the experts, we decided that vector control will not be our main focus but will be explored as a side-project.
We continue with the human-based testing and gather more opinions of experts in the field of infectious diseases. Does it make sense to diagnose people if treatment is not always available? How is the situation in Africa compared to other tropical regions?
Jeanine Loonen MSc.
Medical Entomologist at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Amsterdam
Jeanine has hands-on experience with the situations in tropical areas in Africa with regards to health care and diagnosing since she has worked in Congo for MSF. We learned that education of the local population is very important to gain the trust of the population and prevent miscommunication. Moreover, Jeanine gave lots of information about the local situation in Congo, which we can take into account in our roll-out plan . Furthermore, she confirmed that diagnostics are still important even when treatment options are not available, as they give information about the diseases present in the area and play a major role in preventing epidemics. This means our device is more relevant at large-scale screening than on individual-based testing.

Via the expert talk with dr. Sander Koenraadt, we were referred to her for more inside information. She told us that there are often sudden explosions in the number of infected people, that may be caused by mosquitoes that get resistant against pesticides.
The control of, for example, malaria is challenging because of the political status of Congo: setting up and maintaining a functional health system is very difficult. This was also emphasized earlier during our talk"

UChile_Biotec,2017,Team:UChile Biotec#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the pros and cons of our project.
At the next meeting, the Peshawar team gave us a document describing solutions to the problems our project has, as well as others that our team had overlooked. The document sent by Peshawar is attached below:
Our team was very happy with the content of the document. Mainly because it helped us to find ideas for our main problem. How to avoid the disintegration of our aptazymes by DNAases, when measuring the concentration of STX in real samples (and not pure samples of STX as we have worked in our proof of concept). The Peshawar team proposed us to use molecules that block DNase activity, and sent us a complete list of molecules that fulfil this function, in order to select the one that best fits our system (that is, the one that will least affect the activity of the aptazyma). They also proposed to work our system at low temperatures, since they inhibit the activity of DNAases.
After discussing the different points of the document mentioned above, we began to discuss the most important problems of the Peshawar team project. That's how we found out that their biggest problem is how to reliably detect ion concentrations that are insoluble in aquatic samples. We also discussed the possibility of investigating if they could fulfill the objective of their project (sensing metal ions in water samples) using a system like the one we propose. That is how our team generated the following document:
In this paper, we describe how metal ions of interest to the Peshawar team (Hg, Zn, As and Cd) could be measured using functional DNA and a cell-free system, such as ours. For this we rely on a bibliographical analysis. In this analysis, we also find that these systems that use functional DNA are capable of efficiently measuring insoluble metal ions, so we managed to propose a solution to the great problem Team Peshawar, just as they did with us.
In conclusion, this was a very valuable collaboration for our team for several reasons. First, we could interact with an iGEM team from a country very distant from ours. This made us realize that despite the distance and that both teams are from different cultures, science is able to unite us deeply. As a team, we are very grateful that iGEM allows us to have these opportunities. Another reason is that we managed to discuss our projects in depth, and we received a very valuable feedback, which helped us to see our project from another point of view, which will allow us to continue improving it. Finally, we would like"

Modeling
Introduction
Modeling allows us to observe what happens to a system when you change the parameters that describe it. By quantifying the system’s response to these variables, we can aid the wet lab team in their design of their biological system. By repeating the modeling, data-fitting and refining schedule we approach a sufficient description of our required design.
Our modeling is made up of three pieces: gene expression, diffusion and biofilm modeling. By modeling gene expression, we can inform the lab team which parameters they can choose freely - and which ones they must pick carefully - to maximise the output of our product. The gene copy number is one example of these parameters. By modeling diffusion, we can incorporate into our previous model the effect of our protein being separated from the biofilm it is trying to interact with. If this is a large effect, the lab team must change the design of their system. Finally, by modeling the formation of a biofilm and its interaction with our product, we can decide upon the required concentrations of product we need to clear the urinary tract infection. In all cases we use both deterministic and stochastic models to investigate our system.
Gene Expression
Deterministic
A deterministic model evolves according to ordinary or partial differential equations. We model the following system:
\[\overset{\alpha_{1}}{\rightarrow}Arab\quad\overset{\alpha_{5}}{\rightarrow}AraC\]                                  \[Arab+AraC\mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{\alpha_{2}}}_{\mathrm{\alpha_{3}}}}Arab:AraC\]                                  \[\overset{K}{\rightarrow}mRNA\overset{\alpha_{4}}{\rightarrow}P\]                                  \[Arab\overset{\gamma_{1}}{\rightarrow}\phi\quad AraC\overset{\gamma_{2}}{\rightarrow}\phi\quad mRNA\overset{\gamma_{3}}{\rightarrow}\phi\quad P\overset{\gamma_{4}}{\rightarrow}\"
St_Andrews,2012,Team:St Andrews#Public-outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," interview for the Slovenian main newspaper Delo.
Read the article
Participants were invited to visit the Honorary sponsor of the conference, President of Slovenia, Dr. Danilo Türk, who emphasised international cooperation in science is crucial.
Before the conference started on the 19th of July, Veronica was able to visit the Slovenian iGEM team, who have been very successful in the past. This was an informal and friendly meeting, where they got to know each other and shared experiences in the progress of the projects.
Ethics Forum and debates
Ethics Forum with Morven Shearer
In addition to engaging with members of the public, we were keen to discuss Synthetic Biology and its implications for the modern world with our colleagues at University.  We hosted an ""Ethics Forum"" with Dr Morven Shearer from the School of Medicine and we advertised the event in the science departments beforehand.  At 4pm on Wednesday 4th July, our chosen meeting room was filled and we discussed the difference between Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering; concerns that arise when the BBC broadcasts news of the first ""spider-goat""; as well as what should be done to combat false and exaggerated claims about scientific research.  Although many of the participants held contrasting views, even in response to the question of ""What is Synthetic Biology?"", some opinions were held by all. In particular we agreed, as scientists living in a world dominated by media headlines, the decisions we make when we share news of our work can be as influential as the decisions we make while carrying out our work.
Multimedia Debate and Poster Campaign
We facilitated two multimedia debates during our ten weeks of project work.  Participants were invited to write their responses on one of the many posters displayed around campus and town; by tweeting us, or by writing a comment on our Facebook page.  Our two debate topic were:
""What is Life? Is there one truly fundamental and fully comprehensive definition? How does the advent of emerging Scientific Discipline Synthetic Biology affect our viewpoint?
Recently, Synthetic Biology made possible the creation of the world's first artificial cell ( www.bbc.co.uk/news/10132762 ). Dr Craig Venter of the J Craig Venter Institute led his team to design and produce an entire genome - all genetic information governing the function of a cell - in the Lab. The resulting micro-organism had no parents.  With such ""advances"" in this Scientific Discipline, how is our understanding of the concept of ""life"" affected? If new organisms can be created so readily, does the value we associate with mortality change?""

T7 Large phage: Average plaque diameter of 0.264cm +/- 0.0867cm.
There were also many plates that seemed like they could have mutant phage, but we have to run further experiments to confirm them.
VI) Conclusion
From the average plaque diameters in step 8, we conclude that we have found a smaller phage and a larger phage! The small phage made larger plaques, while the large phage made smaller plaques. The standard deviation is relatively high, but that is most likely due to the already high variability of plaque sizes. Our next steps will be to take a picture of the small and large T7 phage using an electron microscope and sequence their genomes.

The University of Georgia’s iGEM team has worked very hard over the course of the past summer. We have learned much about the field of synthetic biology and have grown significantly as scientists in our attempt to expand the use of Archaea in the field of Synthetic Biology. This would not have been possible without the contributions of the many people and organizations listed below.
A very special thanks to:
The first group that we must thank is the University of Georgia Microbiology Department. They have allowed us to use their equipment and provided us with the lab space needed to conduct our experiments. The Microbiology department"
Tsinghua,2009,Team:Tsinghua#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," comes into equilibrium between synthesis and degradation about 10 hours later. The steady state amount of package proteins can reach the amount of about 10 in the orders of 7, given the parameters as showed in the figure, which means it is enough for packaging target DNAs.
Since there are 420 major protein D and 420 major protein E on the surface of bacteriophage lambda viroin, the number of the theoretically packaged GenSniper viroin is 5.0 in the orders of 4. The wildtype bacteriophage lambda requires a lytic cycle of 40-45 min with a production rate of 100 viroins per cell. In contrast, the production model suggests that the yield of our synthesized gene therapy vector overweighs the wildtype lambda viroin production by 2 orders, while the lytic cycle seems to be longer and less violent. This point can be reflected in our wet lab work, where the actual IPTG induction time was about 10h.
Moreover, the accepted high efficiency gene therapy vector production system requires a titer of 1×10^10-1×10^12 genome/ml. Assuming that OD600≈2 means about 10^8 cells per ml in the liquid culture, and that very viroin should contain one genome, our Bottom-Up project can give rise to a titer of 5.0×10^12 Therapeutic DNA/ml, which meets the criteria for industrialization.

Top-Down approach
Q protein is a native λ phage protein which regulates λ phage's late gene transcription. In our system, Q protein is transcripted under regulation of T7 promomter then regulates the transcription of λ phage package protein through its anti-termination property to R'promoter. In this modeling section, we'll predict how much package proteins we will get using Pr'-Q regulatioin system.

Those must then be merged with Amplification Droplets, wherein every droplet contains the same amount of amplification reagents and Reference Nucleotides. After the droplet merging, each droplet now contains a ratio of Product nucleotides to Reference Nucleotides. If the catalytic biomolecule was highly active, the ratio of Product Nucleotides to Reference Nucleotides will be high. In contrast, if the biomolecule activity was low, the ratio will also be low.
These specific nucleotide ratios in droplets can then be recorded into DNA, by the means of DNA amplification. As DNA is amplified in each droplet, specific ratio of nucleotides is incorporated into the copy of initial template. Such amplification results in molecules that both encode the sequence of a specific biomolecule and information about that particular biomolecules’ catalytic activity.
Proof of concept
We now have a population of droplets, wherein each droplet contains a specific amount of Product Nucleotides or 2'-deoxycytidine triphosphates.
As already mentioned earlier, we have chosen to use MDA reaction in order to amplify the DNA isothermally. Isothermal amplification allows us to amplify the DNA without disrupting the stability of the droplets. Also, for the Reference Nucleotides, we have decided to use Methylated Cytidines (2'-deoxy-5-methylcytidine 5'-triphosphates). These Reference Nucleotides can be readily incorporated by multiple polymerases, including Phi29 which we use for our MDA reaction.
Next, we need to merge our Substrate Droplets with the Amplification Droplets containing the MDA reaction mix. Droplet merging is not an easy task to achieve, as efficient merging requires precise tuning of multiple parameters, such as 4 different droplet and oil flow rates and the strength of the electrical field that helps the droplets to merge. Searching for these parameters experimentally can often be like searching for a needle in a haystack. For this reason, before starting to do droplet merging experiments in the laboratory, we have written a thorough mathematical model which describes the droplet merging in detail and has the ability to predict the correct experimental parameters. We have successfully determined those parameters and showed experimentally, that they were indeed well-performing conditions for the droplet merging.
Substrate Droplets could then be merged with Amplification Droplets containing MDA mix and Reference Nucleotides.
Each merged droplet now contains a"

The goal of our research is to understand the transcriptional program upon differentiation and reprogramming. A single cell, the zygote, can divide and differentiate into all types of cells in an organism. Even though the genetic information encoded in the genomic DNA is identical in the cells of the same organism, the readouts of the genetic information, namely transcriptional program, vary from cell to cell. Differential transcriptional programs lead to differential gene expression profiles, hence, different phenotypes and different cell fates. Transcription factors, epigenetic modification, microRNAs and signaling transduction pathways all contribute to the regulation of transcriptional program. We are interested in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotent cell differentiation, e.g. from ES cells to differentiated cells, or from the zygote to the blastocyst, and then to the cells of three germ layers. Recent studies showed that ectopic expression of few transcription factors can reverse differentiated somatic cells to an embryonic stage, namely induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). Due to their pluripotency and easy derivation without requirement for developing embryos, iPS cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine. We are eager to explore the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming. Meanwhile"

Debrecen-Hungary,2010,Team:Debrecen-Hungary#project_-_-_TEXT.html," according to preset standard parts.  The international genetically engineered machines and associated parts registry are, to date, one of the largest registries for standard parts in use for synthetic biology. Free information can be found in the registry regarding parts, devices and modules all inputted by various teams worldwide.
Eukaryotic synthetic biology is still in its infancy. The large kingdom of metazoans includes all multicellular eukaryotes such as mammalians, arthropods and nematodes. No standard chassis (framework) exists for the animal kingdom which makes them far less popular then the famous E.coli. The protein modules derived from metazoans (like Drosophila or C. elegans) are functional in yeasts also. Very few iGEM teams (or even labs outside iGEM) have chosen to toggle the animal chassis (two notable examples are team Heidelberg 2009 and team Slovenia 2006).  The amount of available compatible parts is limited, which severely restricts the options of creating complex biological devices. Nearly no imagination is required for designing tools, since their analogues already exist in the bacterial chassis. The possible use of such systems is unlimited. Field’s such as of environment, medicine, energy and research all gain to profit from the development of animal synthetic biology.
Systems requiring gene expression input in eukaryotic synthetic biology systems require a way to standardize gene expression, a complicated task. The way from gene to protein contains many steps of possible error: transcription factor binding, promoter strength, recruitment of auxiliary proteins, nuclear RNA synthesis and many more steps finally leading to translation, folding, cleaving and delivery (but hey, you have to start somewhere).
Our team was interested at designing eukaryotic synthetic biology tools related to PoPs. PoPs (polymerase per second), the flying Dutchman of synthetic biology, is a number which represents the rate (base pair per second) at which RNA polymerase crosses past a given DNA position. Currently, no in vivo technique for measuring PoPS directly exists; it can be estimated indirectly by measuring other parameters (eg protein expression or enzyme activity). Nevertheless it is still a useful abstraction for thinking about transcription-based logic devices and it allows the engineer to define devices. Our aim, was not only to infer PoPs but to devise a way to titrate it remotely.
New Tools for Synthetic Biology: Nuclear Receptors
Nuclear receptors (click to find out about nuclear receptors), best viewed as transcription factors which can be activated by extracellular cues, are unique in their ability to allow direct remote PoPs titration (both activation"

RNA Logic Control Gate
Source
After a long period of development, the traditional logic gates in igem comes up with a series of limits, such as a usual plasmid can not hold a big system fo its size, and when implied to another species, there are always lots of bugs, and the number of interaction between DNA and protein used as logic gate is not enough to allow us to build up a system big enough to imitate nature logic gates system.
Considering this condition, apocalyptoed by the interaction of proteins in eucells, like the G protein signal passageway, we come up with the idea that we can use items that are “of all the same” as elements in the logic passageways,for the future of our project.

As is well known, RNA is considered as the start of life. Also, there are reports about using programmed DNA strings as calculation elements to compute Tic-Tac-Toe game（picture）. Thus we came up with the idea that use nucleic acid as elements, being more specific, we chose hammerhead ribozyme which tend to cut itself at special cleavage site when its activity center is of right secondary structure.（picture）
Inspiration
The pattern of our project was from two elite work: the paper of robert pankovsky and XXX. from the first we establish the strategy of control the activity of a ribozyme by a short RNA, while after cleavage, the short RNA resulted from cleavage can also used to modify another ribozyme, after calculation, the sequence is determined, and formed the four basic types of gates:AND, OR, NO, YES, thus form the basic pattern of our project. Another was the theory that if a ribozyme is assembled in front of a sequence that coding protein, the coding sequence can still work if there is a spacer. However, after cleavage, for the coding sequence lost the protect in front of it, it will be digested by nucleic acid exonuclease faster and the expression of protein will decline.

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," equal to the whole filaments units number in this dilution system. Since it should be proportionate to quantities of microtubules only by a coefficient \(\lambda \), we can use this to simulate the results whose condition is used in the wet parts.
Details of Partial Differential Equation Model
We know that the movement of any material is ruled by the certain laws of nature (physical and chemical laws). We establish some mathematical model including partial differential equations to describe these rules especially the mechanism of numerical relationships in the tubulin.
We build the partial differential equations and definition conditions based on the conservation laws.
The tubulin solution area \(\Omega\)  is thought to be a kind of fluid motion. In the solution there are many assembling of tubulins, the hydrolysis, aggregations and disaggregation of the protein filaments. Although the mechanisms of these biological phenomena are still uncertain but we can build the equations based on conservation laws, which certainly rule the biomass.
We take a solution area as our study object. The quantity in the solution area is certainly ruled by conservation laws no matter what shape of the area is. Our models are based on conservation of mass.
We choose a solution area \(D\)  in the \(\Omega\) . Considering in the time range  , according to the mass conservation:
\(\overrightarrow{f_1}\) is the velocity of assembling of the solution which flow into the \(D\) . \(\overrightarrow{f_1}\)  can be regarded as the product of the velocity \(\overrightarrow{v}\) and the assembling ratio \(k\) . However, there is no need to consider the  \(\overrightarrow{v}\) and \(k\) . The inflow mass during  \(dt\) through any  \(dS\) of the \(\partial D\)  can be given:
$$-\rho \cdot \overrightarrow{f_1} \cdot \overrightarrow{n} \cdot dS \cdot dt$$
\(\overrightarrow{n}\) is the unit normal vector toward outside so there is a minus in formula. \(\rho\) is the density of the tubulin solution in \(D\) . In a similar way \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\) is the velocity of the disaggregation mass which flow out the \(D\)  and \(\overrightarrow{f_2}\)  can be considered as the product of outflow velocity  \(\overrightarrow{v_2}\) and disaggregation ratio \(r\) there is no need to consider the  \(\overrightarrow{v"

A drop in the cellular levels of the precursor for aromatic amino acid synthesis causes death of the organism that has been treated with Roundup.
The usage of glyphosate
Glyphosate is resistant to chemical hydrolysis, thermal decomposition and photolysis due to a stable C-P bond (9). Moreover, due to the fact that glyphosate is toxicologically safe and that transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops have been introduced by Monsanto , the herbicide has become the dominant weedkiller worldwide (10-15).  The production and usage rate of Glyphosate increasing up to this day (Figure 2). Moreover, given the fact that genetically modified crops that produce glyphosate-insensitive EPSP synthases are tolerated in the united states, glyphosate is the most used herbicide in this country (13).
Figure 2. Glyphosate usage over the last two decades. It has been estimated that the production of glyphosate is increasing with a rate of about 40 tons per year. Adapted from Benbrook (13).
The problem of glyphosate-resistant crops
Due to the intensive application of glyphosate in agriculture, several plant species have become resistant against the herbicide. Please check out the webpage http://www.weedscience.org , which is reporting of herbicide resistant weeds globally. The international survey of herbicide resistant weeds is a collaborative effort between weed scientists in over 80 countries. The main aim of this collaborative effort is to maintain scientific accuracy in the reporting of herbicide resistant weeds globally. The collaborative effort is supported by government, academic, and industry weed scientists worldwide. Moreover, the project is funded by the Global Herbicide Resistance Action Committee and CropLife International . The development of glyphosate resistance is a severe problem in agriculture because increasing amounts of the herbicide have to be applied in order to kill weed. Unfortunately, the increased usage of glyphosate may negatively affect the biodiversity because the weedkiller does not discriminate between weed and other plants that serve as a food source for insects like honey bees. Since honey bees are very important for pollination , a decrease of the honey bee population has a strong negative impact on plant reproduction, which also affects the fruit yield. A recent study revealed that the weedkiller affects the composition of the gut microbiome of honey bees (Figure 3). The alteration of the gut microbiome composition increases susceptibility to infection by opportunistic pathogens.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

NEU_China_A provided us with E.coli Nissle 1917. Since this strain can target the cancer cells without any further processing, it is the ideal chassis for our project. NEU_China_A also gave us plasmids containing gene norR, which can express NorR protein to help the norV promotor function well. In our project, we use the norR promotor to sense the level of nitric oxide and then produce azurin to kill cancer cells. In return, we gave them the colon cancer cell line HT29 to test their system and also the nitrate and nitrite sensitive promoter Pyear with a GFP in 2018 Distribution Kit Plates( BBa_K381001).

Our team has worked with STAR system in last year’s projects so we gave the plasmid to them. Moreover, they faced some problems transforming the bacteria which were used for the 2018 interlab study so we inoculated colonies from our own plates and sent the culture to them.

--CB MM TR--Our group is assigned the kill switch for the Nitrosospira multiformis organism we’ll be creating. We want to make sure it can’t get out into nature because that’s irresponsible, or whatever. Didn’t want to reinvent the wheel so I looked on the iGEM registry for kill switches and found one using a holin, one using a lysozyme (these two from T4 bacteriophage) and one using three genes (S, R,and Rz), this one from a lambda virus. They’re labeled and listed in the Kill Switch powerpoint presentation in the iGEM folder. The ones on the registry will have to be attached to a special promoter that is useful for our purposes. We’ll want one that turns on if the organism escapes the bioreactor, so a promoter turning on with low metal cation or ammonia concentration will do nicely. (I actually found one that works on ammonia concentration, so we’ll try that first.) Will either have a simple one promoter one kill switch method or, if things are easier by random chance of the parts we have available, a promoter that turns on in the bioreactor, making a repressor for the kill promoter, turning off when it leaves the bioreactor.
March 12, 2014
--CB MM TR-- Researched possible kill switch options for N. multiformis. Focused on the environment of the bio-reactor to control spread of N. multiformis.
Paper about riboregulators creating a fast, powerful, programmable kill switch for microbes. Seems unnecessarily intricate for what we’re doing though.  http://www.pnas.org/content/107/36/15898.short
Originally we considered designing a trigger that is specific to the environment of the bioreactor that, when removed from the environment would express a gene that would kill the bacteria. However we realized that such a design would be problematic due to the high mutation rate of N. multiformis.

Q3. Have you met any difficulties in finding experimental material related to your project?
In the meantime, 34.09% of teams found it difficult to repeat or improve previous iGEM projects, 56.82% of teams thought it was hard to say and only the 6% of the teams said it would be easy to do so.
iGEM has already established a functional platform of biobricks on registry, and iGEM teams are recommended to use and improve those parts. However information related to those biobricks is often ignored on registry, such as information about bacteria strains, antibodies, enzymes and so on. How can another team acquire certain bacteria strain, when the biobrick is better expressed in this strain than it is in E.coli? Can other teams get this strain directly from the original team, or is it possible that they obtain it from a third party? If those information could be well collected and presented on the platform, independently or as a supplement for registry, “ishare” would be of great help for teams to repeat and improve previous projects, independently or as a supplement for registry.
Q4. How difficult do you think it would be to repeat or improve previous iGEM projects?
Like we expected, 84.09% of the teams agreed that a resource sharing platform like ""ishare"" would help on solving the problems above.
Q5. Would a resource sharing platform help in improving previous iGEM project?
And 84.09% of the teams would like to join “ishare”.
Q6. Would you like to be part of iShare?
In addition, we questioned about team’s preference about sharing materials. 78.41% of the teams would like to share bacterial strains, 57.95% of them would like to share cells strains, 67.05% of them would share enzymes, 55.68% of them would share antibodies, 80.68% of them would share plasmids and another 21.59% would share other materials.
Showed in the histogram below, teams were generous about real materials they would offer. In the meantime the actual process of sharing the material for instance shipment of bacterial strains may still be troublesome. However it won’t remain as a problem for long, as long as teams are truly involved in “ishare”. There could dozens of solutions between different teams,"

During the 1980’s, every news outlet covered the Ethiopian famines, the ‘Killing Fields’ in Cambodia under the auspices of the Khmer Rouge, and even the South American/Mexican establishment of drug cartels and civil unrest. These places have three things in common. Firstly, they all have numerous indigenous groups. Secondly, these groups are disproportionally affected by poverty. Finally, these groups have been and currently are struggling to survive due to cultural stagnation by outside influence. Even now, as these words are typed, some mother has to explain the intricate politics of why they cannot get any more food, or why they never have enough harvest to sell at market to pay for necessary items. She will likely sigh, shrug, and state resignedly, “That’s just how it goes. There’s nothing we can do about it.” Thus, it is morally necessary to turn the proverbial gear towards humanitarian aid, which now is possible through a broad but effective scientific development.
Biotechnology and Western Intervention
This scientific development comes in the form of biotechnology. According to the Oxford Dictionary, biotechnology is, “the exploitation of biological processes for industrial and other purposes, especially the genetic manipulation of microorganisms for the production of antibiotics, hormones, etc.”  This is a field newly discovered, only being fifteen years old, and the possibilities are virtually endless. There are some drawbacks to a relatively unknown field, however. One such conflict, and a heated one, stems from the use of GMO’s, or ‘genetically modified organisms’.
These GMO’s are not the only facet to biotechnology, as they are simply organisms with certain ‘desirable’ genes expressed for various purposes. There are multiple uses for biotechnology: medicine, agriculture, fuel efficiency, and even BactoBlood , engineered by UCLA Berkley students, which is a substitute for red blood cells. Although BactoBlood was not successful, it still provides"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," the system can be flipped dependent of the inducers applied. Therefore, focusing on the regulation and the stability of the system, we aim to establish a model to describe, analyze, and predict the behavior of the system.
Model Equations and Derivation
In order to study the system dynamics and to achieve a better simulation result, we consider every part of the switch by setting the strength of every part as a parameter, which constituted a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Based on mass action kinetics (Phillips, 2013) , a model of genetic circuits, which considered transcription and translation, is constructed. By so doing can we derive the basic equations that describe the change of mRNA and proteins over time:
Transcription level model:
Inducer-repressor interaction term:
Translation level model:
However, our case, in which three circuits are involved, is much more complicated, as it requires a system with 6 ODEs. Therefore, we sought to reduce the complexity of the system. Grounded on mathematical model of bistable toggle switch in  (Gardner, Cantor, & Collins, 2000), we developed a series of three equations to describe the switch.
(I) Quasi Steady –State Approximation:
The modelling begins with the application of Quasi Steady-State Approximation on mRNA dynamic. Assumed that the time scale of mRNA dynamic is much smaller than that of protein dynamic, we then consider the concentration of mRNAs remains constant over time (i.e.$\frac{dr_x}{dt}=\frac{dr_y}{dt}=\frac{dr_z}{dt}=0$, the system of ODEs then reduces into the following form:
(II) Non-dimensionalisation
In this model, every part is regarded as unique. Having an independent parameter in each part, though gives a better description of the system; apparently increases the complexity of the ODE system. Therefore, additional assumptions were made to simplify this model by reducing the parameters.
Firstly, it is assumed that each protein has the same degradation rate because of the negligible differences between them. Under this condition, we could apply non-dimensionalization to integrate a series of parameters that model the same circuit into one main parameter represented by ""k"". In spite of this assumption, six main parameters in the system are remained. In order to further simplify it, these main parameters are generalised to one changeable core parameter on the ground that three circuits of the same strength are the basic requirements for a tristable switch. Furthermore, the Hill’s coefficient of each repressor-protein interaction are close to each other"

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Biology Festival: introduction synthetic biology to public
Collaborated with SYSU_CHINA iGEM team, we held a parade in the campus to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Our audiences included students of life sciences and many other majors, teachers of different backgrounds, and residents in the campus who are neither students nor teachers. Our parade includes 2 parts: Design a circuit; Project sharing.
As for the “Design a Circuit” part, we designed a funny game. The participants were allowed to design gene circuit based on the genetic parts provided by us for specific purpose. At first, we thought this game would be very easy. All they need to do is just put the genetic parts in the right orders to complete a circuit. The situation, however, is quite different from what we expected. We explained to them what the promoter is, but it was so hard for them to understand, not to mention completing a circuit. Since most of the students lacked related knowledge, few students attended this game. And those who attended this game required a lot of hints to finish the circuit.
In terms of the “Project Sharing” part, we presented the project of 2015, CORE. We demonstrated the function of our software. They also gave us some suggestions.
""Although I can't understand more about synthetic biology, I still feel very interested in your work and ideas."" To our surprise, a student told us when the Biology Festival ended.

""Bio-Lab Rescue"": game promotion
In many people's eyes, synthetic biology is mysterious and hard to understand. We hope to change this situation. We think synthetic biology is also funny and easy to get close to ordinary people — if we integrate the principle of synbio into online games.
In the summer, our team designed and developed a game "" Bio-Lab Rescue "". We hope to spread synthetic biology in a funny way. And we promoted the game around our university, and posted its URL on social medias.
Figure 22.Bio-Lab Rescue Game
Obviously many students were attracted by the game. They were very excited and gave much advice to us about improving the game experience. When we asked the players if they realized the topic we wanted to tell them, a player said yes and described what he learned from our game, which encouraged us a lot. However, he is the minority who can understand the game. We should think more about the combination of knowledge and entertainment, and how to spread synthetic biology.

Wastewater Treatment: Energy and Innovation
about this project
During the beginning of the semester we were sitting around scratching our heads as we thought about current problems that are facing our world today. Through much deliberation we were finally able to settle on a central theme: energy production. Looking through the literature and past iGEM projects we saw many different ways in which this problem could be approached, however, one such method caught our eyes: microbial electrochemical technologies, specifically microbial electrolysis cells (MEC’s). A project focused on the improvement and production of a MEC not only would contribute to clean energy production but was also a multifaceted and interdisciplinary approach in which many Northeastern undergraduates could participate.
Microbial Electrochemical Technologies
Microbial electrochemical technologies take advantage of bacterial oxidation of food sources by the production of electrical current. Microbial electrolysis cells, which are a subset of microbial electrochemical technologies, use the electrical current generated by bacteria metabolizing substrate. This biologically generated electrical current can serve used as a substitute subsidy for the evolution of valuable chemicals typically used on the cathode inside of the cell.
Hydrogen normally requires an input of  approximately 0.41V to be produced using  acetate. In a MEC hydrogen  can be produced at approximately 0.2V due to the bacteria providing a portion of the current. However, when oxygen is introduced into the MEC system  hydrogen generation is hindered  because oxygen readily reduces at the cathode.  Maintaining an oxygen-free environment, through co-culturing the bacteria producing the current with bioengineered  oxygen scavenging E. coli, may prove advantageous for MEC’s.
Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, Calgary
Bhandup Complex Water Treatment Plant, Mumbai
Power Loss in the Cell
A major source of power loss in MEC’s is derived from incomplete proton transfer from anode to cathode.  This reduces the efficiency of the electrochemical reaction and creates local pH gradients that cause harm to the bacteria on either electrode. Exporting protons at the cathode can help neutralize basicity caused by the reduction reaction and would provide more substrate for hydrogen generation"

The expression of the Dronpa-Cre-Dronpa construct is under control of a promotor, that is influenced by a sensor. Any biosensor that is able to positively regulate a promotor can be used in our setting.
After expression the Dronpa-Cre-Dronpa construct is constituted of fluorescent Dronpa domains that attach to each other and thereby inhibit the Cre domain sterically.
Illumination with violet light (400nm) re-activates Dronpa fluorescence and also leads to the closed conformation of the construct.
Illumination with blue light (500nm) deactivates Dronpa fluorescence and thereby also multimerisation of the Dronpa domains.
In the induced open conformation of the construct, the Dronpa domains are only losely connected to the Cre, which thereby becomes active.
The RFP-luciferase reporter switch leads to expression of RFP if the memory system has not been activated by CREllumination.
After activation of the Cre protein it removes the loxp-RFP-loxp part of the reporter switch. This leads to expression of luciferase, which serves as the final reporter of the system.
Project Description
A Biosensor Memory Module: Cre Sensor
Photostimulation is one of the most important non-invasive analysis methods allowing researchers to examine the relationship between metabolic processes, e.g. through activating a molecule via light treatment. We want to create a module which makes it possible to take a snapshot of the activity of a sensor at any time. Our designed system should be capable of capturing such a ‘snapshot’ of the activity of a sensor. Therefore our aim is to create a Cre recombinase whose activity can be reversibly controlled by light. By activating this construct only for a short period of time, we can use a Cre to switch on expression of Luciferase in only a limited amount of the sensor cells. Through coupling the Cre expression to the sensor we can thereby permanently write the sensor state of a given time point into the DNA of a system.
To achieve the construction of a reversibly activatable Cre recombinase we want to apply the caging mechanism described by Zhou et al [Zhou 2012] . This caging is performed by fusing a copy of"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration

In a different cell, i.e., one that does not have antiholin on its genome, the antiholin and endolysin will kill the cell, preventing it from keeping the plasmid containing the auxin genes. This mechanism will prevent the succesful horizontal gene transfer to naturally occurring soil bacteria.
This will require a careful balance of the levels of expression of holin and antiholin, although it is better to have an increased expression of antiholin to provide some protection to our cells. The expression levels will be governed by the promoter and RBS combination. In order to make this easier, we fixed the promoter in front of the antiholin as J23100, and then the Salis Lab RBS designer was used to generate an RBS sequence that would give the correct level of expression, a value that would be generated using computer modelling.
Because we have to use the holin gene that is in the cell lysis cassette submitted to the registry by Berkeley 2008, it would be too difficult to replace the RBS that is upstream of the gene. Instead, we calculated its strength using the Salis Lab RBS calculator and used this as a fixed value around which to model the required promoter strength.
As can be seen from the data presented on the modelling page, we were able to calculate the required RBS strength for the holin expression and the appropriate promoter for the anitholin expression. Our RBS
One flaw in the design, is that, due to the time constraints placed upon us by the iGEM competition, the system that we will engineer will have antibiotic resistance genes on the genome. This is not something that is intended as part of the overall design, but is necessary for this competition.

There is still a question confusing us that is “what is synthetic biology”. Professor Ouyang Xin academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences said synthetic biology is to create or change organisms with rational design for the good of human beings when he accept the interview from Huan Qiu Ke Xue which is the Chinese version of Scientific American. There are three main paths for synthetic biology which are gene synthesis, remaking metabolism system and remaking organisms. Synthesis of mycoplasma promoted by American scientist J.Graig Venter is an example of the first path while synthesis of artemisinin precursors promoted by ay D. Keasling is an example for the second. Nowadays synthetic biologists are often busy in finding new bio bricks optimizing bio bricks and remaking metabolism systems as if these were just the three paths of synthetic biology. But what is the difference between finding bio bricks and finding new genes with traditional bioinformatics technology?what is the difference between optimizing bio bricks and remaking proteins with traditional molecular biology technology and what is the difference between remaking metabolism system in synthetic biology and changing metabolism pathway with metabolic engineering? Or each path of synthetic biology requires all these technologies and ideas. It is also questionable if synthetic biologists are working in different aspects according to their interests or it is scientists working in different field claim to work in synthetic biology because of the popularity of the concept of synthetic biology. For conclusion, synthetic biology is still immature until scientists can work hard in their direction as well as holding the ideas of synthetic biology.
Synthetic biology also needs scientists who can stand up and lead the way of the research in this area and unified data base for bio bricks to store research productions and standard bio bricks. IGEM foundation has set a good example for it in leading research directions and running bio brick data base."

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fib"
