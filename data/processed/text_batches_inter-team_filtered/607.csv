We were excited to have identified 16 candidate split sites, and cloned most of these split saCas9 constructs into the FKBP-FRB dimerizable domain backbones, in both orientations. We set up our flow cytometry experiments similarly to our integrase and RDF ones, except used our traffic light reporter and new guide RNA designs.
When performing flow cytometry, we measured mCherry (NHEJ) and GFP (HDR) fluorescence values in arbitrary units. Each transfection condition was performed in triplicate on every plate, and thus we were able to obtain the mean and standard deviation across three replicates. However, the results that we obtained using flow cytometry were not optimal. Below is a result of our conditionally dimerizable saCas9 variants (in both domain orientations).
               
We noticed that we got a low raw fluorescence signal using this reporting system, even with the intact saCas9. Because of this, we did not calculate or plot normalized % GFP or % mCherry for this system. We believe that our negative results are likely due to our modified gRNAs using the traffic light reporter system - these might not have optimally functioned, thus resulting in minimal saCas9 activity. We would debug our initial experimental workflow by adding in an additional control - characterizing how spCas9 (for which the traffic light reporter system was initially designed) functioned. If we had a functional reporter system, we could properly characterize our split saCas9 variants and identify any viable splits and interesting trends.
Despite unsuccessful flow cytometry results, we had another interesting finding to share. Towards the end of our project (at the very end of August), the Feng Zhang group at MIT published the crystal structure of saCas9 in the journal Cell7. The paper demonstrated the development of a conditionally dimerizable saCas9 system using the FKBP-FRB domain pairs and PYL-ABI domain pairs, which is what we originally wanted to accomplish.
One facet worth noting is that the Zhang group used the 3D structure of the saCas9 protein to target flexible linker regions that would serve as potential split sites."

Backbone pSB1C3 was used for σx generator construct and comW construct. comX gene / comW gene were fused with BBa_K880005 which contains a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The purpose of this strong constitutive promoter and strong RBS is to unsure the large production of σx and ComW protein throughout time. Then, a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) is fused with the promoter, RBS, and comX. BBa_K880005 and BBa_B0015 were obtained from 2014 iGEM distribution kit.
Construct using pSB1C3 backbone consisting only σx CDS ( BBa_K1379004 ), and σx followed by double terminator BBa_B0015( BBa_K1379045 ) was also built to facilitate assembly of σx to promoters and RBSs of choice.
Bacterial Strain
The bacterial strain of E. coli used is DH10B. Since this strain of E. coli has clpXP degradation enzyme which targets ComX for degradation, an excess amount of ComX protein is required to maintain enough amount of ComX for Com-Box promoter induction.
comX and comW gene
comX gene and comW gene were cloned from NCTC 7465 S.pneumoniae strain genomic DNA by PCR using Vent Polymerase.
ComX Tag Protein
We engineered a C-myc protein tag in the 3’ ends of comX by including the sequence in comX extraction primer.

Synthetic Biology in the 21th century
1974. In a few sentences, the polish geneticist, Waclaw Szybalski, laid the foundations of the Synthetic Biology. Following the development of biology molecular and the discover of the enzyme of restriction, he thought that one day, it would be possible to build some new genomes, or parts of genomes.
“Let me now comment on the question ""what next"". Up to now we are working on the descriptive phase of molecular biology. (...) But the real challenge will start when we enter the synthetic biology phase of research in our field. We will then devise new control elements and add these new modules to the existing genomes or build up wholly new genomes. This would be a field with the unlimited expansion potential and hardly any limitations to building ""new better control circuits"" and(...)finally other ""synthetic"" organisms, like a ""new better mouse"". (...) I am not concerned that we will run out of exciting and novel ideas (...) in the synthetic biology, in general”.
In Vivo and in Vitro Initiation of Transcription, Page 405, Waclaw Szybalski
Nowadays, Hugh Whittall, Director of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, describes Synthetic Biology as “the construction of novel biological networks/organisms with bespoke properties, using standardized biological parts that code for known functions”. These parts can be extracting from existing organisms or be the results of a chemical synthesis after an artificial design.
The SynBio can be divided in two approaches: top-down and Bottom-up. The first one consists in starting from a whole organism, and then reducing its genome until it can only provide a specific function. The second one is the opposite: you create an organism just with biobricks (system developed by the MIT). You just add to the organism’s genome the genes that bring it the function of interest.
Three methods have been developed in this frame: minimal genome, artificial cells and synthetic biomolecules.

XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#exhibition_-_-_TEXT.html,"Some middle school students paid a visit to our exhibition. They came from Quanzhou, Fujian Province and they hoped they can enter Xiamen University after their graduation for further study. Although not all of them loved science, three still expressed their strong interest in biology. One of them even said that he will dedicate in synthetic biology field. At last, we left this joint picture. The woman stands at the second from left is their leading teacher.
   
Scene 4 on Aug. 27
On this closing day, almost all our team members appeared at the hall to leave pictures and celebrate the success of the exhibition. At this moment, a young couple entered and asked for a joint photo. We happily received their invitation and we formed a heart-shape circle surrounding them. Finally, they thanked us and left their best wished to our team – win the championship in 2012 iGEM.
Scene 5 on Aug. 27
Economy is a prosperous major in Xiamen University. On that day, a group of students from Department of Economy visited our exhibition. While we orally illustrating the contents in each panels, they showed great interests. Actually, their perspective differs from ours because they stress more importance on the market and commercial-related issues about synthetic biology. By asking numerous questions, they in fact also brought us a spirit that science and technology is expected to become real commodities to benefit the public rather than constrained in laboratory.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Oilsands_-_-_TEXT.html," on a bed in a second floor bedroom driving the house.
One thing we looked at was the tailings ponds.  These are essentially large ponds where by-products are deposited and left for long periods of time for some of the components to break down and settle.  Small sheets of pure water are added periodically to aid this process.  The pollutants eventually settle out at the bottom while the clean water stays up near the surface.  Eventually these lands are reclaimed, although this takes a lot of time.  When reclaimed, the lands are made to be hilly in order to allow for drainage.  Eventually, they will hopefully be certified for human use again.
Lunch was in the cafeteria where some of the workers live.  We got a brief view of the facilities that they have for their workers.  After lunch, we went and saw some reclaimed land.  This is land that has been cleaned up son that plants and animals can live there.  Bison is one animal that is currently living on some of this reclaimed land.
When land reclamation occurs, barley is planted over the Muskeg to prevent soil erosion. Barley holds the soil until the seedlings can grow then the Barley dries out, which is a good thing or else the seedlings would have to compete with barley to grow.
We also learned a little bit about the history of the oil sands.  Essentially, underground oil reserves were brought up by the formation of the mountains and caused the oil to mix with the sand, causing oil sands. When oil sand is boiled the oil (bitumen) becomes less dense than water and floats on water. This is how the oil is separated. When oil sand is too deep and can’t be dug or some other reason. Pipelines are drilled – slant drills- until oil sand reservoir is reached then steam is pumped into the soil. The steam separates the oil from the sand and makes it possible to collect the oil from this underground deposit. Two types of products are produced: sweet product – without sulphur and sour product – with sulphur. The removed sulphur is used in fertilizer – Syncrude has a fertilizer plant on site.
On Tuesday we went on a tour of ConocoPhilips in the morning.  This started out with a presentation of the general overview of their site and the processes they do.  We learned that there is bitumen in oil sands ranging from the Rocky Mountains to Fort McMurray, including under Calgary.  The bitumen is only extractable near Fort McMurray however because here it is closer to the surface.  In other locations, the bitumen is found too"

Since our previous CPP synthesis order was rejected due to repetetive sequences Johan and I redesigned the order into two separate clusters, CPP_N and CPP_C. The new clusters were designed with both restriction sites and primer annealing sites flanking each CPP. An extension sequence was also added to enable gel separation after digestion, as the CPPs are very similar in length.
Johan also redesigned the coding sequence by shifting codons by the addition of ""silent mutations"".

The objective of this debate was to achieve a state of art on the ethics questions raised by synthetic biology, and our project. Thus, we were convinced that our different stakeholders could provide pertinent questions on the differents issues related to the subject. We wanted to present to the scientist community this ethics debate.

Summarization of reflections
« Ethics is the movement of the Liberty which searches a well life, in the solicitude toward others is in just use of social institutions »; Paul Ricoeur quotation, philosopher of the 20th century. In other terms, ethic represents the philosophical field gathering moral values which define the way we have to behave.
Applied to synthetic biology, ethics indicates the way to follow in order to allow this discipline development by avoiding its drifts. Indeed, even if it lets dream to large perspectives as new energy sources, accessible therapies to all or biological remediation methods, to manipulate the living rises regularly to a certain number of ethic questions. François Le Fèvre mentions « it is the first time that human is confronted to the possibility to create new forms of life ».
It seemed  important to us to interest to these points, beside the biologic engineering  technic aspect. In this way, we organized an ethic debate based on the topic of the synthetic biology, in which some different expert key figures of the domain were invited. During this debate, different problematics were raised.  Like emphasized Thierry Magnin, some of them are of metaphysical order, and concern notably what «this gives us as the living representation, as life »; some others concern direct applications and their technical aspects which can push us to imitate them. At the occasion of this debate, we presented our project to our guests in order to take out ethic questions.

JUDITH BOLDTBioinformaticianI come from Hamburg, a city known for its rainy and windy weather. After studying Mathematics and Bioinformatics in the sunny Munich, I almost feel at home in Paris, where you never know if it will rain in the next minute. Before I joined iGEM, I spent 6 months studying at the CRI, getting to know a new and interactive way of learning. With iGEM, I want to put my theoretical knowledge into use in a scientific project.
IHAB BOULASBiologist After graduating with a Biomedical Sciences BSc., my interests were focused on bringing new answers to neurodegeneration and aging by the use of innovative approaches such as Synthetic Biology. In that respect I wanted to learn by doing Synthetic Biology. Besides, I see this project as a large proof of concept : showing that we are able to control our microbiome. I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it. Thus, I see this competition as an opportunity not only to commit to a project I helped design but also to broaden my skills and show what I can accomplish in a given period of time. It looks like it's gonna be a summer as great as smelly !
MARIANNE CARDONDesignerI am a 24 years old student at ENSCI - Les Ateliers Design school. iGEM gives me the opportunity to work on a science base project with an international and interdisciplinary team. I think design can help to reach user centered project and question the relation between innovation and society, as much as facilitate the public access to scientific research and ideas. Taking part in this project is the best way to put theory into practice !
URSZULA CZERWINSKASystems BiologistMy name is Ula and I am from Poland. I study Systems Biology in Paris. Besides science I am very interested in Science communication and education. At iGEM I am working on the 'Teen Spirit'. I try to evolve bacteria to scavenge 2-nonenal, a molecule responsible for the old people specific odor. I love iGEM spirit and my iGEM international team. Cannot wait to participate in the Jaboree.

The araBAD promoter (BBa_I0500)
In our project to control chiXR (one of the sRNAs) expression we used the arabinose promoter (PBAD) from the araBAD operon that is regulated by the AraC protein [3] . AraC can work both as a repressor and activator of PBAD. In the absence of arabinose, AraC represses transcription from PBAD while a conformational change turns it into an activator in the presence of arabinose. In addition, the promoter is subject to catabolite rerpession and is, thus, further repressed in the presence of glucose.
PBAD is a very frequently used promoter because of its extreme tightness. In the presence of glucose, this promoter triggers negligible amount of transcription which allows cloning of toxic genes downstream of it, however, it is also relatively weak even upon full induction preventing high level of expression which could be necessary, e.g. for protein purification. Even though the response of the PBAD promoter appears graded to inducer concentration at the population level [2] [3] , it has been demonstrated that this is not the case at the individual cell level. [1] An ""all or nothing"" behaviors with cells being either completely ""OFF"" or fully ""ON"" have been showed and only the fraction of OFF/ON cells is varying upon arabinose concentration modification. As a result only a subset of cells becomes induced with the arabinose. This can be very problematic when trying to express poorly soluble functions or when working at the single cell level.

Entreprenuer-ship
On Product design and entreprenuership... We produced a product portfolio to analyze whether our product fit the market. The product portfolio includes a general market analysis and a specific health check market analysis in China, a full product description and a SWOT analysis of our product. We concluded that health check is suitable market to assess due to the large scale of customers every year, but improvement must be made to satisfy vary demand in cancer detection. On the other hand, large scale of promotion and education should be made in advance to prevent misunderstanding from public. We applied our designed system on the a screening chip. The DNA device and proteins that required for detection can mix with E.coli cell-free system, freeze-dried on a paper chip, and stored in low temperature. The blood sample from the patient provides a liquid environment which can reactivate the cell-free system. The reaction takes place when the target sequence presents, emitting fluorescence on screening chip. Individuals can use the product associate with a kit to detect lung cancer within few hours. A further analysis of the market is also made in the section of entrepreneurship.
On Integrated HP... We compeled a survey and analysis for Chinese companies who provide ctDNA detection and cancer screening services. The companies all provide similar detecting services but with slightly varied outcome. However, no similar technique is used in those companies indicates there is no technology monopoly in this industry at the moment. We analyzed the result of this investigation in order to put our product in social content and compare it with others exist products in the market.  We also communicate with experts to give their opinions on our product design. For example, we visited Dr Fang from Peking University shenzhen hospital and member of staff from BGI product research department. All suggestions and opinions that we gathered help us improve the efficiency and customers experience of our product. On Engagement... We gave small science lectures to enrich STEM education in primary school and middle school as well as a formal introduction of the iGEM competition in one of the largest high"

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Modules#In vivo_-_-_TEXT.html," the lumazine biobrick (BBa_K216007) was sent to us by Edinburgh Team, due to this construction hadn't been tested we decided to synthesize it, in order to avoid unexpected results for possible errors in the already assembled biobrick from Edinburgh.
This is the composition of the synthesized sequence, “Gene” stands only for lumazine coding region.
Preffix+ Promoter + RBS + Gene + Double Terminator + Suffix
See Lumazine (BBa_K360122) annotation at the registry for more details.
RESULTS
In order to test if lumazine protein is working correctly, shifting the emission spectrum from Vibrio fischeri luciferase to more blue light output, co-transformation of the plasmid from Mr. gene harboring the Lumazine gene with the plasmid sent by Cambridge team containing the Vibrio Fischeri luciferase with the substrate generating and recycling pathway (luxABCDE) was successfully made, but the blue shifting glowing phenotype was not obtained, it was still green-blue. It is possible that the wavelength shift had done correctly but was not visible to naked eye due to the change is minuscule (495 nm to ~ 475 nm). So, it was required the usage of a sensible measurement device to detect it.
A first measurement was done with a spectrophotometer but it didn’t detect any RLU (relative light emission unit), even the bioluminescence was visible to naked eye in the dark room.
A second attempt will be using a CCD camera that is expected to have the necessary sensitivity to detect bioluminescence and measure the light emission spectrum.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Ag43+FLAG+MCS(-)β-hairpins
Abstract
We describe the creation of Biobrick constrct Bba_K1352002 which expresses autotransporter Ag43 with an inserted FLAG epitope tag at codon 148, flanked by multiple cloning restriction sites.  Two 17 amino acids long beta hairpins were removed from Ag43 in order to eliminate native aggregation properties. We describe the design and construction of the new Biobrick, and its verification using restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. We show that removal of β-hairpins removes auto-aggregation capability of Ag43, creating a useful reagent that can be used for E. coli surface display.
1.       Structure and function
Antigen 43 (sometimes called Ag43 or fluffing protein) is a phase-variable outer membrane protein encoded by flu gene. It is native to E.coli K12 strain and is usually expressed at about 50, 000 copies/cell. Ag34 precursor is 1039 amino acids long and subsequently becomes cleaved into alpha and beta chains (499 and 488 amino acids long respectively). The beta subunit forms a β-barrel pore via which alpha-subunit translocates to the cell surface, and with which it remains non-covalently joined. The surface alpha chain can be released by a brief heat treatment at approx. 60oC. Ag43 is an autotransporter protein, therefore it possesses all information necessary for translocation to the cell surface in its coding sequence. Ag43 mediates autoaggregation, via a velcro-like mechanism (Heras et. al., 2014), and plays a role in E.coli biofilm formation. Interestingly, the alpha subunit is able to express foreign peptide sequences on E.coli cell surface if inserted just"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Dignity and integrity is mostly seen as a reply to an argument from category A. It’s therefore often used by a precautionist, as their way of saying “slow down - somethings are more important than utility”. The core idea is that living matter has a dignity and integrity that we as a society should respect, but living matter can be defined in many ways allowing room for a versatile argument KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The teleological, natural and religious arguments are grouped together, due to their habit of being intertwined in an argument. Teleos is the ancient greek word for ‘goal’ or ‘striving’, meaning that all things have a form of ‘striving’ in their essence - the world included. So the argument normally goes: “There is a bigger purpose with the world, that we shouldn’t try to change or interfere with”. Sometimes it’s intertwined with religion, stating that one shouldn’t try to “create”, because that is only meant for the divine KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The different types of arguments aren’t always neatly sorted out as they have been presented, but often work in relation to each other or consists of different appeals, all to make a stronger argument.
Principles in bioethics
To guide the appliance and decision-making process there are some principles that apply in all arguments:
The No-Harm principle
The principle of Personhood
The Precautionary Principle
The No-Harm principle is perhaps the oldest principle in applied ethics and dates back to Hippocrates and his thoughts about practicing medicine. It simply states that one should not cause harm to another person. It’s intuitively simple in outline but lacks better definition of what ‘harm’ is - is it only physical harm or does mental harm count as well? The answer to that question normally depends on whom one is asking. For our purpose and understanding we’ll consider it to be intuitive that one shouldn’t cause physical harm or severe mental harm KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bio"
Newcastle_University,2008,Team:Newcastle University#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Since subtilin is an antibiotic, this was a good indication that the subtilin we had collected that day was of good quality.
Overall, the microscopy and flow cytometry suggest that our biobrick is functional, but requires high levels of subtilin in order to be activated. The days that we performed microscopy for instance, we did not observe killing of the cells after 10% addition of subtilin, indicating that our subtilin for that day was at a low concentration. Subsequently, we did not observe a strong GFP induction. However, when we did observe killing (indicative of high subtilin concentrations), we did observe induction of GFP (see flow cytometry). So in principle the system works, and we have engineered the lab strain of B. subtilis 168 to respond to the external addition of subtilin, but more work should be done to further optimise the system. For instance, it was shown that the spaS promoter fused to gfp gives high yield of protein production when present on a multicopy plasmid, after the addition of subtilin (Bongers et al, AEM). Also it may be possible to introduce a positive feedback effect by introducing a spaS box and associated promoter upstream of spaRK in addition to the normal promoter.

Human Practices
Over the past year, members of our team engaged in a variety of human practices endeavors. These ranged from educational activities involving the community, such as a parent-teacher night, where we introduced parents from our community to iGEM and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) initiatives; moreover, our team held a forum at City Hall to create awareness of the great upsides to iGEM. In addition, we conducted interviews with experts in the ink industry and environmental fields, such as Dave Warwick of Warwick Printing Co. and Greg Vilk from the University of Lethbridge Liaison Office. We have also explored the possibility of integrating synthetic biology and STEAM initiatives into our public school system, beginning with an interview with Sheanne Cox, a local elementary school teacher.
Overall, the criteria for silver and gold medal requirements in human practices was met (as can be seen by exploring the wiki pages).

The core goal of Biohub 2.0 is to help biologists obtain the most matched and the most high-quality Biobricks more efficiently. Given a set of query conditions and searching for the most similar items, such task has already had mature solutions, which can be perfectly done by most of the search engines. In our project, we choose ElasticSearch to accomplish the it. The only problem is: how to order the matched Biobricks by their quality?
The first step is to define ""high quality"". Technically, a Biobrick can be described by multiple properties, including objective ones (part sequence, part status, etc.) and subjective ones (number of stars, rate scores, etc.). Objective properties are usually connected with the physical characteristics of the part, which veritably reflect the quality, but some of them are difficult to quantize (for example, part sequence is the direct proof of whether a part is good or not, but such conclusion can only be drawn after experiements are done). Subjective properties, on the contrary, are very easy to be quantized, but there's no guarantee for their authenticity. Thus, we synthesize both of them to evaluate the quality of a part. According to early investigations, we define a part as ""high-quality"" if:
It is in good condition. (has available samples, satisfies most of the RFC, etc.)
It is welcomed in the community.
The next step is to find an appropriate method to measure the quality. The method must be:
fast enough. The evaluation process should not consume too much computation resources.
extensible. Adding new factors into the evaluation process should be easy enough.
In our project, we use the data downloaded from here as main data source, and meta information crawled from iGEM offical website and daily data generated from Biohub Forum as supplements. The data set contains tens of properties to describe a Biobrick, but we will only use a small amount of them, since not all of them are relevant to quality. Based on the assumptions above, we select the following fields:
part_status (from main data source)
sample_status(from main data source)
works(from main data source)
uses (from main data source)
has_barcode(from main data source)
favorite (from main data source)

Endotoxin is a type of natural pyrogen that was found in outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and can make impact on over 30 biological activities. To ensure the safety of our drug system, avoid toxicities, thus prove that our achievement is of great value for clinical application, a detecting assay was carried out using an endotoxin test kit. The result was negative, demonstrating that our drug system satisfies the safety requirement.

checkAn efficient drug delivery system
KRAS mutation was identified in NSCLC more than 20 years ago, but its clinical importance in cancer therapy just began to be appreciated. Our project aimed to develop a drug system that employed modified exosomes with iRGD peptide on its surface to deliver KRAS-siRNA into lung cancer cells specifically, thus target KRAS gene and down-regulate K-ras protein expression to treat lung cancer cases. Our results had demonstrated that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be delivered into tumor cells and efficiently down-regulate KRAS expression both in vitro and in vivo. In silencing validation, we transfected KRAS siRNA into A549 cells using Lipo 2000 and performed western blot to test the function of our siRNA. Subsequently, we collected iRGD-modified exosomes loaded with KRAS siRNA, evaluating its effect on lung cancer cells (A549) by examining KRAS expression after transfection. The result confirmed that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA could effectively down-regulate KRAS transcription level and reduce its protein expression. Later, the EDU assay further ascertained the biological role of KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation suppression in vitro.
To perform in vivo validation, none-small cell cancer mouse model was established after implanting tumor in 40 mice by subcutaneous injection with A549-LUC cells. After a short-time treatment, tumors harvested from killed mice were measured, then protein and RNA extracted from these tissues were examined, results supporting that KRAS siRNA can efficiently"

The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation        of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle       vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that        A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by        spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin).        These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and        even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and        capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

However, the collaboration changed its direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation of their plasmids.
Figure 1: Snapgene overview of NTHU Taiwan’s construct.
TU Delft offered to revise their SnapGene files featuring their construct to discard a faulty design as the issue and shared a series of recommendations on how to make their design clearer in Snapgene and  achieve transformations with higher yields.
Finally, NTHU communicated TU Delft the accomplishment of their transformation! We wish all the best to our fellow iGEMers of NTHU Taiwan and look forward to meeting them at the Giant Jamboree!
Wageningen UR
This year’s project of Wageningen UR consisted in a device for the diagnosis of tropical diseases, which featured sensitive perishable material in the form of engineered cells.
As TU Delft also aimed to manufacture a device intended for the broad audience, we were aware that one of the biggest challenges to both of our projects was the shelf-life or storability of the biological material. To circumvent the previous issue, our team dedicated a part of our project to research the applicability of tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) in order to enable the stabilization of all fragile material with just a simple drying step.
Consequently, TU Delft shipped three of his developed plasmids encoding for the production of the TDPs that conferred the most protection (CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094 and SAHS 33020) to Wageningen, so that they could test it with their cells.

As depicted in Figure 1, the survival of the bacteria upon drying overnight and resuspending is greatly enhanced for all the samples featuring the BioBricks with respect to that of the empty vector. In addition, Wageningen resuspended the samples with both Milli-Q water and PBS buffer, achieving additional results that indicated that the survival of the cells producing CAHS 94205 was improved in PBS while that of the cells with SAHS 33020 was instead worsened.
In return, TU Delft iGEM tested an additional preservation method researched by iGEM Wageningen UR, consisting of"

The key role of Integrated Human Practices in our project
Because our project was focused on tackling a problem extremely relevant to our society, it was essential that we looked at the impact our project would have and how we could adapt our design according to the acquired information from stakeholder dialogues. Only then would our project have the desired value to be able to contribute to the issue of antibiotic resistance. Developing a detection method in the lab is one challenge, but developing a detection method that could be used in the real world is another, more complex, challenge. The complexity of the challenge in the antibiotic field made it hard to find the niche in which we could apply and validate"

In conclusion, our lectures helped to propage the concepts of SB and iGEM competition to high school students, most of who didn't know about those issues. Some students are willing to participate in the iGEM competition while others are not due to academic and financial shortage. Hence, next step we considered to offer some help to the students with interests, like teaching them how to implement elementary molecular cloning experiments; if it is possible, we would also like to guide students and schools to apply fundings from the Education Commission.
Funding Application
After the lectures, Ms Lee Xuemei, the Science Director of Beijing No.4 High School, exhibited strong interests to Synthetic Biology and international Genetically Engineering Machine (iGEM) competition. On July 26th, Ms Lee came to the lab of Peking iGEM. It was the time PKU-UCSF Workshop taking place, with the company of our advisor Prof. Ouyang Qi, we took Ms Lee to the workshop field and had a serious talk on how to spread ideas of SB and iGEM to high school students.
Figure 19. The Science Director of Beijing No.4 High School Ms Lee came to Peking2012 iGEM team and had a serious to with us. (Ms Lee is on the right-hand side)
Figure 20. A group photo of Ms Lee, our advisor Prof. Ouyang and Peking2012 team members.
Durign our discussion, we have reached an agreement. Unlike most universities, high schools in Beijing, even in whole China, are short of an abundance of financial support, private or public. Thus, we thought that participation in iGEM HS Division in China would better be government-aided. Therefore we decided to write a report together with Ms Lee Xuemei to apply for a specific funding for Beijing high school students to participate in the iGEM competition. The report contains survey of iGEM competition these years, aptitudes and abilities of high school students in Beijing, and a comparison between students in China and the United States. It has been submitted to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education and is waiting for approval.

Their aim was to produce different compounds in Escherichia coli that smell fragrant. Another very interesting application of the ""Banana-Odor"" Biobrick is pursued by the iGEM Team of Queens in 2013 . This team tries to neutralize foot odor by creating a skin creme containing bacteria with a genetically engineered metabolic pathway to neutralize the volatile compounds that cause these smells. This pathway begins with the uptake of isovaleric acid, a known mosquito semiochemical that is present in foot odor, and converts it into banana smell. By establishing this skin creme, it should be possible to prevent people from being attacked by mosquitos and saved from typical alienable diseases mosquitos spread.
Target Audience
The target audience for our kit are secondary schools with focus on a biotechnological educational pathway, so all students have access to the required laboratory equipment for the experiments. Before sending the kits to the schools, we tested them in detail - with success. All schools we contacted to spread our Synthetic Biology kits are very enthusiastic concerning our idea of supporting young prospective scientists, so they are very excited to receive and use our kit!
Availability of the Educational-kits
We appreciate other interested schools in trying out our “Educational-kits”. Do not hesitate contacting us. We are happy to supply you with our forward-looking Synthetic Biology “Educational-kit”!
You can send requests to: igem@wzw.tum.de
Due to the World Championship Jamboree of iGEM, we offer the description of our ""Educational Kit"" directly to everyone, who is interested in it! Just click on the download-Button to get it! This decision supports the open-source idea which is intrinsic to iGEM as well as our team, to facilitate the education of every pupil, prospective scientist and scientists.

Safety
To avoid confusion about the terms ""biosecurity"", ""biosafety"" and ""biohazard"", some people gave a definition of each of these terms.
✵ Biosafety describes principles, technologies and containment practices put in place to avoid accidents and unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins.
✵ Biosecurity describes the protection measures put in place and management of important biological materials in laboratories, in order to prevent them from being accessed without authorization.
✵ Biohazard includes, in this case, both biosafety and biosecurity.
Reference : http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Biosecurite-dans-les-laboratoires
The team who worked in the lab received instructions of lab safety with safety training. We learned how to act in the case of an accident, where to find emergency showers, fire extinguishers and emergency doors. Some basic safety requirements were discussed such as wearing gloves and a lab coat for most procedures. In some cases, during the use of ethidium bromide, nitrile gloves are mandatory. Other experiments must be conducted with safety glasses. It is also recommended to wear clothes offering a minimum of protection. We also learned about working with chemical products and how to dispose of them. Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol). Chemical products are just irritants and so need to be handled with gloves. In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes. Moreover, all biological waste will be autoclaved before disposal. All work is done on benches or under open-front hoods.
Since we worked with non-toxic organisms as Escherichia coli (BL21) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Invsc1), all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions but no specific security procedures needed to be put in place.
Why is it safer to use Curdlan rather than copper sulfate ?

ALPHABRICK
1.  Executive Summary
AlphaBrick is a novel software tool for the easy design, exchange and creation of synthetic gene constructs.
Recent advances in the synthetic biology field, such as with the Crisper/Cas9 system, have dramatically increased the potential of synthetic biology technologies to transform our world. We can now use our biological understanding to create products that solve some of the biggest challenges the world faces. These advances, however, require a new set of accessible computational tools that enable the synthetic biologist to quickly and collaboratively design and test DNA circuitry.
Employing a lean methodology, we have"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing"
TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Notebook#Conrad_-_-_TEXT.html," different kind of cells located in the foot. (Pujol, 1967) There are three specific regions in the foot where the different cell types are clustered together; namely the phenol gland, the collagen gland and the enzyme gland. (Tamarin) The phenol gland produces proteins for the protective varnish and for the plaque. The produced proteins are stored in membrane-bound granules, which are homogeneous, dense, spherical bodies. After the formation of the granules, they are transported to the secretion area.
The attachment to a surface in steps
If the mussel identified a suitable surface, this surface will be inspected by the tip of the mussel foot. After this inspection, the foot will sweep the surface to clean it. This cleaning is probably done to remove all the unbound matter. After the cleaning the foot become motionless for 2-5 minutes, in this time the formation of byssus thread takes place. This means that first the ventral groove contracts to squeeze out all the seawater. The groove is then filled again by the already produced granules, containing the proteins and all the components for the formation of the byssal threads and the plaques.
If this procedure it disturbed within 1 minute, the mussel will detach, leaving behind a plaque which is attached to unfinished thread. (Maheo, 1970) This suggests that the characteristic time for plaque formation is less than a minute.  This immediately raises the following question: how is it possible that the content of the granules from the enzyme gland mix fast enough with the proteins released by the phenolic gland? This implies that the cross-linking must be very effective, within a minute, since this is the time the mussel needs for formation of the plaques.  (Haemers, 2003)
One should also keep in mind the environmental and other biological influences; both environmental factors (salinity, temperature, pH, season, and substratum choice) and biological factors (age and metabolic state of the organism) also affect the efficiency and strength of byssal attachment to surfaces (Van Winkle 1970 ; Crisp et al. 1985; Carrington 2002).
The mussle foot proteins (mfps)
There are at least five different mussel foot proteins identified in the foot of the mussel, the proteins are present in varying amount. The amount present depends on the “specialisation” of the protein (coating or attachment for example), which is directly linked to the DOPA content and the presence of their additional characteristic residues.

Formal Lab Session - 13th August 2009
Overview
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team - attempted to transform Bacillus subtilis cells with pGFP-rrnB as practice
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
Summary
The plates for our test transformation.
Yesterday's germination attempt seems to have worked, but results are not yet clear. This may have been due to a calculation error for the lysozyme, where instead of adding 40ul of stock lysozyme per ml of buffer solution, 4ul of stock lysozyme was added instead.
Therefore, on Monday , we intend to redo the experiment. See Monday, 17th August for more details.
Today we are trying to transform Bacillus subtilis with gfp-rrnb integration vector using the Transformation Protocol as well as following the changes which the Metal Sensor Team implemented. Metal sensor team kindly inoculated B. subtilis cells into flask tubes and placed them into the shaking incubator. The overnight cultures were labelled 1, 2 and 3, while the control was labelled as 4. Our team used overnight culture tube 3 and control tube 4.
Results
Following an illustration which clearly explains what to plate out from the Bacillus Transformation Protocol , we plated 4 plates, 3 of which contained the antibiotic chloramphenicol, and LB, and 1 containing just LB. The plate which contained just LB was the control plate.
The following pictures show the results of our team's transformations, which were a success.

2) Add 50 µL of thawed competent cells into pre-chilled 2ml tube, and another 50µL into a 2ml tube, labelled for your control.
3) Add 1 - 2 µL of the re-suspended DNA to the 2ml tube. Pipet up and down a few times, gently. Make sure to keep the competent cells on ice.
4) Add 1 µL of the RFP Control to your control transformation.
5) Close tubes and incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
6) Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ºC for 60 seconds.
7) Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes.
8) Add 600 μL of LB media (make sure that the broth does not contain antibiotics and is not contaminated) to each transformation
9) Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 45min while the tubes are rotating or shaking. 
10) Label a petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid backbone, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 100 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread. This ensures that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
11) For the control, label one petri dishes with LB agar (AMP). Plate 100 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread.
12) Incubate the plates at 37ºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow. This is especially true for ampicillin - because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivates the antibiotic outside of the bacteria.
13) You can pick a single colony, make a glycerol stock, grow up a cell culture and  miniprep .
Strain Reservation:
In the clean bench, using Micro pipette tip pick a single colony and put it into a LB liquid medium. Put into shaking table 10-12 h. In a clean centrifuge tube, add 200uL bacterium liquid and 300uL glycerin, then put into -20℃ refrigerator.

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial cells take up foreign DNA and express the genes encoded by it. Since in reality only a small portion of competent cells are transformed, a reasonable representation of transformation efficiency is calculated by dividing successful transformants by the amount of DNA used during transformation procedure, in CFU/μg of DNA. By verifying the transformation efficiency value against that of standard competent E.coli cells (1.5x108 to 6x108 cfu/μg DNA), competency of electroporated sample can be validated. The transformation efficiency kit from iGEM includes five vials of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3. Each vial contains DNA at a different concentration: 50pg/ul, 20pg/ul, 10pg/ul, 5pg/ul, 0.5pg/ul. The transformation efficiency test is performed with each concentration of DNA in parallel.
Safety Precautions

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," looking for a “magic bullet” that he speculated would selectively destroy pathogens but not the host organism (1). Originally, antibiotics were seen as a “miracle cure” and there was no medical evidence that indicated that was any need to be concerned with their extensive use.  With the development of new antibiotics specific to certain bacteria, the field of medicine had become even more successful in curing illness and disease.  However, over time, it was discovered that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics had promoted the evolution of new resistant bacteria which were impossible to destroy (1).  These bacteria, which are invulnerable to any antibiotic currently developed, could potentially lead to a massive outbreak of untreatable patients with life threatening infections.
The use of antibiotics, which play such a major role in the health and welfare of human beings, has many ethical considerations which were inadvertently overlooked at the time of their initial introduction into society.  Notably, the most significant was their misuse.  With the eradication of diseases and an improvement in the medical success rate, there was an increased usage of antibiotics in an effort to stop any bacterial sickness before it spread.  Doctors thus began prescribing patients high dosage antibiotics that were strong enough to wipeout all the targeted bacteria if taken as instructed. The near to impossible task for doctors was and still is, to try to impress upon their patients the importance of finishing the entire prescription regardless if they were feeling better after only taking half of the prescribed dosage.
The intentions of all of the parties involved in the sale, distribution, and regulation of antibiotics and other drugs, must be considered when looking at this from an ethical stand point. During the developing of new antibiotics, scientist were primarily concerned with ways to combat disease and were unaware that society would, or even could, misuse their products through both excessive and insufficient, usage. The doctors were concerned with the well being of their patients, so they distributed antibiotics as they deemed fit. The large drug companies’ primary interest was to sell large quantities of their product and amass the largest possible profit.  Eventually, it became the responsibility of the government to step in and look after the regulation and legal issues regarding antibiotics. When it comes to the health and welfare of the public, the government will always ultimately be held responsible. Although the degree of government intervention varies from country to country, it is apparent that the differences between the public and private sector of the antibiotic development, distribution, and sale, are a source of.

Figure 10. Closed circuit diagram
Figure 11 Current density which is normalized with electrode surface area over time
After we built the mfc circuit as shown in figure 10, we could obtain the current over time when the variable resistor is fixed. Dividing the measured current by contact surface area of the electrodes, we could obtain the above graph. Figure 11 showed a constant increase of the current density over time during the experimental period.
Figure 12. Relationship describing electromotive force,  current, load resistance and internal resistance
Therefore, it is possible to determine the internal resistance by plotting the above graph, given that the emf is a constant. However, emf is not a constant for mfc as well as the internal resistance.
As known, the internal resistance of a microbial fuel cell is affected by the emf of itself. To determine its relationship, different emf with corresponding internal resistance was recorded over time. Since the above graph is only valid in constant emf, we could only approximate the constant emf by obtaining the current-resistance relationship in a very short period of time so that the change of the emf could be neglected.
Figure 13 Internal resistance against electromotive force (emf)
The graph above showed the relationship of internal resistance and the output voltage of the microbial fuel cell across the first 90 minutes after it was built. 20mM lactate was added as the sole carbon source. The curve indicates that the internal resistance increases with the output voltage more rapidly in the early stage, but reaches its maximum as the voltage further increases. From this result, it could be concluded that the internal loss of the MFC will be gradually minimised as long as the voltage continue to increase.

Figure 14. Teriminal power output over time
Figure 15 Total work done of MFC
Since we have obtained the relationship of voltage against the current, which could be evaluated to the terminal power output, we want to tentatively evaluate the actual energy output of our MFC. As we learnt from the figure 13, the power will fluctuate at the beginning, but it will develop an apparent increasing trend after the experiment had been carried out for 50 minutes. To further visualise the actual energy output of the MFC, we calculate the total work done from the data of power and it gives the figure 14, which still abide to the increasing trend of the power.  From the two figure above, we could conclude that our designed MFC could be applicable"

Before going to the MakerFaire, we stopped by at the iGEM Team Bielefeld. While having coffee and cake, each team presented their project followed by a little discussion and receiving feedback. We were fortunate to get valuable ideas concerning using our pumps in microfluidics. As a consequence, we adjusted the design of our devices and focused on a modular system to support this, and other possible fields of application.

Teach the teacher
Fascination has no age
The best part about the MakerFaire was when children at the age of twelve were fascinated by the bioreactor and tried their best to understand the working principles behind every part. But also adults were affected by our presented hardware. A number of teachers asked us if they could take pictures of us and our work for teaching purposes. One teacher from a private school was even interested in buying our bioreactor.
Together we worked out a possible teaching concept that unites different classes:  Assembly of the bioreactor in a science class, analysis of the software in the computer science class and using the bioreactor in the biology (they have an S1 lab) and chemistry class. Unfortunately, we could not realize the project before the jamboree because of the summer holidays in German schools.

We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

COLLABORATIONS
Collaboration
This year, we have carried out several collaborations with other iGEM teams. As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficulty and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit P&P to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team accepted this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.

The previous batch of potential mutants which were different shades of red on a replica plate got replated to see if we'll be able to see a clearer difference between shades of red on streaked plates.  So far there appears to be a good range of redness which is a positive sign that our mutagenic pcr worked somewhat well.  Out of 12 plates, we got 9 possible mutants.  We're planning on taking a closer look with our Tecan plate reader early next week.  This will give some more definitive proof of good mutants or not.  These mutants also got cultured so we can prepare them for sequencing soon.
In the Dh5α strain, LacI repressor is always present so, upon induction we expected to see red.  It seems from our mutation protocol that we mutated them too heavily since most colonies were white even with IPTG present.

It was nice to see that there is a community of synthetic biologists in Northern California that we can share ideas and materials with.  After a relaxed lunch, we had a small meeting to discuss how to achieve the medal requirements.  We discussed helping each other to fulfill one of the gold medal requirements with the Berkeley team since some of our software tools might be useful for their project this year.  We then got to see their lab and received some pBAD+AraC since those parts from the registry seem to be faulty.  Overall a really good day!

Our Edutainment Product
Meet-up
Film of Our Life
Overview
To establish a bond which connect synthetic biology and the public, we devoted ourselves vigorously to public education. We hosted ""Gene Go"", a giant education event which drives the public participation in synthetic biology. We promote iGEM in a more innovative way, such as DIY classroom and stage play adapted from our project. We also open up ""iGEM Classroom"" which contains experiment practice and iGEM classes both online and offline for teenagers. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them forming their own iGEM team. Furthermore, we created a series of edutainment products such as Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Gene Card Online (an online board game), Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in education. Above all, what we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is.
“Gene Go!”
“Gene Go!” was held in Sichuan Science and Technology Museum (SCSTM) on June 17 by UESTC-China and UESTC-Software. It is an event of Education and Public Engagement. We released information on the activities through the platform of SCSTM. Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families, reaching the maximum capacity of the activity.
“Gene Go!” includes five section, such as DIY classroom, “Cellulose Go!” Stage Play, Exploring the micro world etc. We created an atmosphere of synthetic biology, telling people what is iGEM and what we’re doing for the world. Through this event, we interacted more with the public and received feedbacks from them as well.
“Gene Go!” was appreciated by SCSTM as well as a lot of parents. They both expected us to hold this great event next year.

Our research material, Aequorea, was really abundant. A constant stream of floating jellyfish passed along the side of the lab dock every morning and evening, riding with the tidal current. I describe our methods for collecting and extracting the luminescent material from Aequorea in my Nobel lecture.
We brought the crude extract back to Princeton in September 1961, where we began the process to purify it. In February 1962, we obtained about 5 mg of nearly pure luminescent substance. It was a protein, and we named it aequorin. Aequorin attracted wide attention as a unique protein that emits light in the presence of calcium ions, even in the absence of oxygen. Aequorin was the first photoprotein ever discovered. During the column chromatography of aequorin, we found a trace of protein that showed green fluorescence, which eluted sooner than aequorin. We also purified that protein, which is now called green fluorescent protein (GFP).
In August 1962, I visited Bermuda to study the famous fireworm Odontosyllis enopla at the Bermuda Biological Station. The fireworms are very small but they show a spectacular bioluminescence display that is correlated with the lunar cycle. The luminescence display takes place during a period of several days following a full moon. It begins about one hour after sunset and lasts only for 10 minutes. It begins with the sudden appearance of a swarm of brilliantly luminescent females (about 2 cm long) at the surface of the water, each worm quickly moving in a tight circle. Within a few seconds, numerous brightly luminescent males (about 1 cm long) appear, and they dart toward the females from all directions, attracted to the light. I collected the fire-worm and studied the properties of its luciferin.
Due to my U.S. visa expiring in 1963, I was expected to return to my position in the Pharmacy Department at Nagasaki University, from which I was on leave. However, I received through Professor Hirata an offer of the position of associate professor at the Water Science Institute, Nagoya University, with the understanding that I could continue my research on bioluminescence. I took the offer. In September 1963, I began working under Professor Tadashiro Koyama at the Water Science Institute. A few months later, Professor Hirata asked me to assist his graduate student, Yoshito Kishi (later a professor"

We have been looking into Arduino code to find out what changes we need to make to our current C++ code to make it run on Arduino. We will also able to connect the LCD display to Arduino and make the display show “Hello World!”. As of now, all of the components of our future circuit are working (the components include the colour sensor, temperature sensor, and the LCD sensor with connections to Arduino), but certain improvements are required to ensure our system consistently works.
The next step includes exploring the LCD code and figuring out how to make it output more complex messages. Then we will start on putting all components together in one circuit. This week we also met with a microfluidics expert to get his insight on our idea to use microfluidics in device’s design. He suggested we use microtubules in our design rather than considering a complicated microfluidics set up. A syringe or some form of pressure or excitation can be used to pump the liquid across the device. We have come up with a basic outline of how we see our device’s design. The best material suggested for the tubing is Teflon. We are looking into getting necessary supplies for building the prototype for testing. The Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop at Schulich School of Engineering will be helping us to build a prototype. There will be a simplified design for the testing purposes - the syringe will be taken off to get all of the necessary components into the device and put back together. Since the tests are taking place in the lab, there are less concerns about contamination.The results received from a plate reader experiment do not meet the expectations - it appears that few cells grew over the night. After some discussion, it was decided to repeat the experiment next week. This week we also started preparing a 20 minute presentation for the rest of the team on what the engineering subgroup has achieved so far. This presentation will also be a good practice for the presentation at Giant Jamboree.
Week 12: July 21st - July 25th
This week we started testing the sensor using printed colour strips that are located together similar to how we see it in our device.  We also tested to compare white background vs black background. However, the main purpose of these test was to see what we will see when multiple colours are present. These results were inconsistent and therefore inconclusive."

Preparing fibers for Instron testing
cut 25mm x 25mm cardstock squares
in the squares, cut a 10mm long hole to create a frame
Lay down some black tape on the inside of a PDMS mold (which happens to be 25mm x 25mm as well)
place the frame on top of the PDMS mold
place epoxy glue on the sides of the frame
Lay down a single fiber across the frame
place another layer of cardstock on the epoxy glue to cover the fiber.
allow epoxy to cure for at least 24 hours
Today, we ran Instron tests on natural b.mori silk fibers.
some challenges in the Instron testing:
it's near impossible to get the fibers to be perfectly straight in the Instron
very difficult to lay down the fiber so that it is flat on the tab
when cutting the tab margins, sometimes the fiber is shifted at an angle in the Instron
sometimes when laying down the fiber, it is not taut, and so you are actually tabbing a longer length of fiber than the length of the window.
tabbed some of yesterday's fibers for Instron testing.
labeled Tam 1, Tam 2, ... Tam 5."

Cadmium's Environmental Impact
Our project aims to take up cadmium from the environment. Although Cadmium has highly adverse impacts, the use of synthetic biology, particularly in industry, are far reaching. We felt it was important for our project to look at the implications of each and weigh up the pros and cons. For the full report, see the link below
Cadmium in the Water...
Cadmium in natural waters exists as either free/aquated cation (Cd2+/CdOH+)[1] this is due to the competition of organic binding resulting in aluminium causing the almost complete displacement of cadmium.
A large amount of cadmium pollution in water ways is due to either industrial waste or fertilizers produced from phosphate ores. In unpolluted natural waters the cadmium concentrations are usually below 1μg/l[2] however the maximum level ever recorded was in Rio Rimao in Peru at 100μg/l[3].  The WHO have set the guideline level of cadmium in global drinking waters as 3μg/l[4] In 2007 UNEP stated these would be the parameters set for water quality as a global index[5].
...and Cadmium in People
The main issues with cadmium getting into waterways and food supplies are the affects that it will have on the people who ingest it. The effects of cadmium poisoning can be devastating as it is a known carcinogen and can consequently lead to death if ingested in large quantities. The other l effects of cadmium ingestion include:
Gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, salivation, abdominal pain, cramps and diarrhea[6]
Anemia due to the cadmium resulting in a lower level of iron intake in the gastrointestinal region, this is especially problematic if the affected individual already has low levels of iron intake in their diet[7]
Kidney damage is a common symptom of cadmium toxicity which further leads to a decrease in production of vitamin D[8]
Osteomalacia and osteoporosis both of which lead sufferers to have increased chance of bone fractures and"

We also can notice that, even if they aren't totally “admit” in the iGEM competition (named “non-competition teams”), DIYist and amateurs have a place in the 2009 event to compete for their own “non-competition price” ( here ). The iGEM projects are often planned, design or wanted as “fun”, “sexy” or innovative. What about “having fun” by “making science”? That point take us to a more global question about research, work and producing scientific knowledge : Do every scientific work has to be a strain? Is effort and hardness necessarily close to scientific production? Can't we imagine having fun in the lab? Do that “sexy” projects are serious? Can biology be a hobby? The DIY practices in synthetic biology take us to two more points : amateurs in science and link with the innovations in informatics and web 2.0. DIYbio wants to make amateurs more involved in biology, proving that DIY is the better way for them to learn, and that they can bring some new and innovative knowledge for biologist they work with : a cooperation, everyone take from the other, a “get some, give some” movement (I borrow that maxim to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts). The ""get some, give some"" is questioned by some student of the team as a new way to create elitist community of users and that communalism is not so obvious nowadays. The link with the Internet world is claimed by DIYbio in a pragmatical perspective. Cooperation, barcamps ( here ), “having fun projects” is also presented as the way innovations are made in the Internet. So, why not in biology?
Everyone in the team agrees to reject it, to me, more as a matter of principle which is expressed, embodied in concrete cases. In other words, it lays the question of the system of practices in science as a question of epistemology, practical paradigms and the way scientist perceive and have accepted the architecture of their own work. The principle expressed by the team is that “science is serious, science is not about having fun”. The team's global reject could be reduced to two element, about science's principle and its effect on practice : science is not about “having fun” but about knowledge (as a moral precept of science) and that the researcher's work will be strain, because biology is not a hobby (about the scientist work).
How that principle is defended by the team? What are the embodiment of that position? In which theoretical and practical examples?
Informatics.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," of the GadE on the mechanism.
The central activator is the LuxR-family member GadE (formerly known as YhiE). GadE binds to a 20-bp sequence called the gad box, which is located 63-bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites of gadA and gadBC. (4)GadE and GadBox are an important point for GadA and GadBC. This means that GadE and GadBox are an important for acid resistance. The basis section of acid resistance is GadE’s regulation. At least 10 different regulatory take part in this regulation.
GadE have three main activation mechanisms. The first of these is performed by evgA and ydeO. About GadE activation phase:
1. EvgS (sensor kinase) activate EvgA (response regulator)
2. YdeO and evgA are independently from each other and GadE takes an active role in transcription activation.
The second GadE activation circuit includes CRP,RpoS and two AraC-like regulators, GadXand GadW.
These steps are as follows:
1. GadX and GadW, are located downstream of gadA also GadX and GadW directly activate transcription of gadE
2. GadX and GadW also bind to the gadA and gadBC gad box sequences and seem to repress the gadA and gadBC promoters. (4) GadW inhibits this GadX’s repression  Also GadX and GadW regulate indirectly GadA/BC transcriptional functions.
3. The balance of power in this circuit is influenced by cAMP and CRP,which together inhibit the synthesis of RpoS. Growth under acidic conditions reduces the concentration of cAMP in the cell.  RpoS increases GadX’s transcriptional function  The increase in GadX then stimulates transcription of GadE and also down regulates GadW.
The third activation of GadE contains TrmE and glucose. These steps are as follows:
1. The function of TrmE in the cell is not fully defined but it does have a clear effect on tRNA modification
2. TrmE and glucose increase independently GadE’s transcriptional function
We discourse GadE’s regulation and then now we will discourse GadE’s effect mechanisms. GadA/BC’s effect mechanisms to acid resistance are as follows:
1. The external pH is normally neutral but if external pH turns to acidic pH, internal pH begins to become acidic pH with HCl diffusion.
2. If the external pH=2,5 and internal pH begins pH=4.2 ± "

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:
Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.

Fig 8. Congo Red Assay of His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag
After CR dye, the figure indicates that the His-CsgA-SpyCatcher-Histag mutant induced by 0.25 µg/ml of aTc and cultured for 72h at 30? successfully secreted a thin-layer biofilm on the plate which are stained to brown-red color by CR, compared to the negative control with no inducer. (Because the ratio between Congo Red dye and Brilliant Blue dye is not in the best state which leads to the unapparent phenomenon through the lens, the brown red biofilm is easy to be identified visually.) This assay also proved that the new and challenging construction of appending a large protein onto CsgA subunits will work accurately and effectively.
His-CsgA-SpyCatcher
After 72h culture, we scratched the biofilm down from the well and apply 25 µg/ml of Congo Red into solution. Then centrifuged and washed by PBS for several times, we get the result: newly His-CsgA-SpyCatcher mutant induced by 0.25 µg/ml of aTc was stained to bright-red color by CR, compared to the negative control with no inducer and the color can’t be washed away. This assay also manifested the success in construction of His-CsgA-SpyCatcher mutant and add versatility to our biofilm platform.
2. Quantum Dots Fluorescence Test: successful binding test of Histag with nanomaterials
Then comes to the next part: we want to check if SpyCatcher protein will be too large to cause steric hindrance effect on Histag peptide. The best approach to verify is the fluorescence assay of binding with nanomaterials.

Ethical Concerns and Applications
The enzymes we are manipulating have many potential uses, including applications in the oceans, streams, and rivers that make up nearly 75% of the world’s surface.
Excessive quantities of plastic float in these waterways, causing the death of numerous marine organisms and damaging the fragile ecosystem, as well as other environmental and health risks. Our specified enzyme could potentially break down this plastic and rid these ecosystems of pollution, saving the oceans from years of perpetual damage.
Despite this, with anything, there are many ethical concerns that people may have. The idea of using E Coli, the bacteria in which we put the enzymes, probably would scare people who are unaware of its minimal health risks to the population (strain K12; benevolent). Synthetic biology is very controversial in itself, as it illuminates whether or not it is ethical to genetically modify organisms for our own benefit.
Additional concerns people may have include the potential for our genetically modified organisms to mutate and instigate problems in Inner Harbor, especially regarding aquatic/human life. Since E. coli procreates so rapidly, these organisms have a more prominent susceptibility for genetic mutations, which is why our future work would include manufacturing a kill switch for these E.coli cells, having them self-destruct at pre-determined conditions.
Our Collaboration with the Broad Run iGem Team
Just prior to the formation of our own Baltimore BioCrew, our team collaborated with the Broad Run iGem from Virginia. Originally, we had worked together to progress their research from the year before; however, because the commute was significantly strenuous for both parties, we mutually decided to set up our own, individual teams.
Before the we started our research on the plastic-degrading Ideonella Sakaiensis, the team collaborated with the Broad Run team by assisting in a multitude of operations.
Since the Broad Run iGem team specialized in yeast cells, vigorous research had to be enacted by all team members to acquire a more refined knowledge-based concerning our research. We assisted the Broad Run team in a multitude of ways in the lab; oftentimes, every member from the Baltimore team would volunteer to work a certain day to focus our efforts on specific wet-lab tasks. By this, our collaboration was cumulative- we would build off of each others knowledge"
