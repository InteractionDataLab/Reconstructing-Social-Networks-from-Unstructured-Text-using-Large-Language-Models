Participating in iGEM for the first time, we had Team SVCE_CHENNAI mentor us. Being practically neighbours, they were with us every step of the way, right from troubleshooting our protocols to ordering our g-blocks. Ramit, the student leader of their team had earlier designed a quorum sensing mechanism which we modified and incorporated into our project to overcome the lethal effects of our peptide of interest, latarcin, on the chassis itself.

COPENHAGEN COLLABORATION
UCopenhagen came up with an innovative idea for creating quality awareness about synthetic biology. ""Science out of lab"" by UCopenhagen is a podcast series where science was brought into a social, ethical and environmental context by interviewing people from different walks of science. We joined forces with them and interviewed postgraduate students and professors in our city, adding a small value to the podcast series.
ALL INDIA iGEM MEET, PUNE
The All India iGEM Meet was held at IISER, Pune on the 15th and 16th of July,2017. Various iGEM teams from across the country participated in this Meet. The main agenda of this gathering was to allow teams to share their projects, for other teams to put forth suggestions on how to better the team’s project and thus, to basically encourage exchange of ideas between the different teams.
Eminent speakers from various fields of Science were also invited to speak to us. We were allowed to glimpse into some of their astounding work and encouraged to raise questions. IISER Pune was an excellent host in making sure our stay was a memorable one.
This year, two members of our team represented the team’s idea at the All India iGEM Meet in front of an audience of the other Indian iGEM teams. After the presentation, lots of valuable suggestions and feedback was given by the members of the different teams.
We have taken these ideas into consideration and tried to customize our project accordingly.      Being our first iGEM venture, this Meet helped us not just in"

UbiX transfers a prenyl group from dimethylallyl monophosphate (DMAP) to flavin mononucleotide (FMN), thereby creating a cofactor that happens to be essential to the functionality of FDC. This part is contains the protein-coding UbiX sequence from E. coli. Additionally, this part includes a T7 promoter, allowing for inducible expression.
Biobrick: BBa_K1692007
UbiX with T7 promoter and FLAG tag UbiX is a flavin prenyltransferase that normally plays a role in ubiquinone biosynthesis in E. coli. UbiX transfers a prenyl group from dimethylallyl monophosphate (DMAP) to flavin mononucleotide (FMN), thereby creating a cofactor that happens to be essential to the functionality of FDC. Our genetic construct includes the UbiX coding sequence, a T7 inducible promoter, a ribosome binding site, and a FLAG-tag peptide sequence for easy and efficient protein purification. We have sequenced our construct and verified that all these components are indeed present.
Biobrick: BBa_K1692008
Styrene Synthesis Operon This operon is a composite of three enzymes in the following order: FDC, UbiX, and PAL.  PAL converts phenylalanine to cinnamic acid.  FDC converts cinnamic acid to styrene.  UbiX modifies flavin mononucleotide to produce a cofactor that is required for FDC activity. The entire operon is controlled via an inducible T7 promoter. Each protein-coding sequence is preceded by a ribosome binding site and followed by a FLAG-tag peptide, enabling easy and efficient extraction.

The main part of the lactate sensor we implemented in our system consists of synthetically designed promoters that is regulated by LldR and lactate, as well as by LacI. We characterized the sensitivity of these promoters to lactate and IPTG to find the best solution to fit our model with a good ON/OFF-ratio. Going one step further, we also probed our E. coli cells for their reaction to the actual lactate output of mammalian cells, the protocol of which you can find in the section of experiments combining mammalian cells with bacteria .
Antibody staining for Annexin V
To find out whether or not our INP-Annexin V construct leads to proper exposition of Annexin V on the outer membrane of our E. coli we performed an antibody assay where we stained the strains listed below with a primary antibody against Annexin V and YFP, respectively. Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy we would then detect binding of this antibody by staining with a secondary antibody (antimouse) which is coupled to Alexa488.

Table 1. Six strains were tested. We expect staining only for the strains expressing an INP-AnnexinV or INP-YFP construct, respectively, since without INP, Annexin should not be visible on the surface of our bacteria. Negative controls therefore include cells without any construct as well as cells expressing Annexin V but lacking INP. As a positive control we used an existing BioBrick (BBa_K523013) as well as our construct expressed on a high copy plasmid. One construct includes red fluorescent protein which will make it possible to probe our cells for colocalization of RFP and Alexa488, as well as colocalization of RFP-expressing E. coli with CTCs.

Our Synthetic Biology Club hosted a speaker series on campus during the spring semester.
Learn to Engineer Bacterial Biosensors!
The primary focus of Dr. Styczynski research is the experimental and computational study of the dynamics and regulation of metabolism, with ultimate applications in metabolic engineering, biotechnology, and biosensors/diagnostics. He spoke of the importance of micronutrient deficiencies and the importance of having an accessible and affordable way to measure deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiencies are a significant healthcare concern across the globe. Significant even in some developed nations, micronutrient deficiencies are more severe in the developing world and locally in the wake of major disasters. These conditions, though easily treated, remain a problem because they are often difficult to recognize and diagnose, requiring lab tests that are prohibitively expensive in both material and human resources for those in developing or remote areas. As obligate consumers of the same micronutrients, bacteria possess cellular machinery to control intracellular micronutrient levels and have corresponding regulatory mechanisms to respond to varying concentrations in their environment. His lab is developing a novel medical test based on bacterial sensors using designed genetic circuitry to direct existing or minimally engineered cellular machinery to trigger specific changes in color in response to defined micronutrient levels. Such a test would be cheap, requiring no complex equipment and minimal medical training to administer and interpret. This would obviate the logistical problem of laboratory access and sample transport in remote and low-resource environments, allowing on-site diagnosis of micronutrient deficiencies in the populations most at risk.

After getting the plasmids of constitutive GvpA and GFP generator, constitutive GvpC and GFP generator, we transform the two plasmids into E.Coli to see if they can float. As expected, they float! It shows that the gvpA and gvpC genes work. In other word, only two genes (about 700bp) can make bacteria floating.

Project Description
BBa_J04450 has a lac promoter and mRFP gene, thus E. coli harboring this plasmid will give red color when the bacteria were grown with lactose or IPTG. Oppositely, the expression of mRFP will be decreased when glucose was present in medium through a mechanism called catabolite repression. We use this phenomenon to measure the concentration of glucose in honey by calibrating the color of E. coli medium using android-based mobile phone. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIAGlc genes, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. We expect an engineered E. coli, which shows red color expression in different range of glucose concentration. By changing mRFP gene with amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein, we may obtain E. coli expressing either red or blue color when different honey added to the medium due to different glucose concentration.

BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP has 8 amino acid mutations. Point of its sensitivity of redox states is                         two Mets which locate in the surface of protein. Once the cell is in a reduced state, the                         disulfide bond between two methionines will come into been, leading different absorption of                         light at two wavelengths. Specifically, the response of roGFP2 to H2O2 is                         reflected to its excitation spectrum (emission wavelength is 515 nm), which has a max absorbing                         peak at 405 nm and 490 nm. The peak value changes with the oxidation state of environment and                         this change is reversible. Measuring the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the roGFP at                         two wavelengths can reflect the changes of intracellular redox state in real time. [11]
However, roGFP dosen’t only reacts with H2O2, but also other oxides,                         which means it gets                         oxidized generally, there’s a lot of interference. So according to information about Yap1, we                         found that compared with Yap1 and Grx (Saccharomyces cerevisiae gluten), Orp1 has a                         specificity to H2O2, instead of all kinds of ROS. [12]
Fig. 7 How roGFP works.
Also there is similar transformation of intramolecular disulfide bond in Orp1-roGFP fusion                         protein to intermolecular transformation between Yap1 and Orp1.
Fig.8 Mutation of Aa sequence
With reference to the part designed by Cornell University in 2017: BBa_K229600                         , Constitutive Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S, the roGFP2-Orp1 (C82S) fusion protein sensitive                         to the intracellular redox state response was selected as the signal output of our project.
Fig. 9 Codon optimization
We also optimized the codon for roGFP2, making it more suitable for translation system of Saccharomyces                             cerevisiae cells.
Summary
Having established each part of our system, we can achieve our original aim “Detect and measure                         the antioxidant in living cell”. Let’s review how we design the whole gene circuits.
Fig. 10 Final gene circuits.
Firstly, in regulator part, overexpression of two genes, ndi1 and yno1, stimulates ROS                         accumulation in H2O2 form. Through knocking gene yca1, improve the tolerance of yeast cell to                         high level of H2O2 .

Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Introduction
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) helps direct protein to the mitochondria when this peptide sequence is in front of the N-terminus of the protein of interest. MLS will be removed upon the peptide’s translocation into the mitochondria, but four additional amino acid residues (Ile-His-Ser-Leu) will be left at the N-terminus of the protein. The CDS of MLS was cloned out from pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA) using PCR.   This part is in RFC10 standard but cannot be fused directly to other CDS due to limitations in RFC10. Users who obtained this part can extract the part by PCR and fuse to other domains using Splicing by Overlapping PCR. MLS in RFC25 standard (BBa_K1119001) is also submitted to facilitate fusing with other CDS.
In our characterization, the CDS of MLS was assembled in frame with that of GFP reporter using Freiburg’s RFC25 format(BBa_K648013). The translation unit was driven by CMV promoter (BBa_K1119006) and terminated by hGH polyA signal (BBa_K404108). The MLS-GFP generator (BBa_K1119009) was then transfected into HEK293FT cells. Mitochondria were stained after transfection and co-localization was determined by area of signal that overlapped. To provide a positive control, CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted downstream and in frame with the CDS of the MLS in the commercial plasmid pCMV/myc/mito, (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). A negative control was made by GFP generator that does not contains the"

ask Dominik:
how exactly does this strategy work?
when is this an appropriate strategy to use?
Is ""PCR Ligation"" also a good Method (seperate PCRs for fragments; primers have ""overlapping tail"" takend from next fragment; ligation of fragments in one single PCR"")?
Important! What about Freiburg? are they willing to help us with Gibson Cloning?

Assembly
First we adapted a pSB1C3 plasmid to Golden Gate using the adapter that we previously designed. We ordered the adapter and digested and ligated it to the plasmid; then we did a transformation and obtained positive results validated by PCR of the miniprep as shown in Figure 6. This miniprep was used as the vector of the dCas9’s Golden Gate reaction.

We used the NEB Golden Gate Reaction for multiple fragments (5-20) despite of having a 4 fragment reaction due to negative results with the 1-4 fragment NEB reaction. For this reaction we defined the thermocycler program as the general based on a 37oC digest for 5 minutes followed by a 16oC ligation for 5 minutes, both steps repeated for 30 cycles, and a final inactivation at 55oC for 5 minutes. This strategy ensured efficiency thanks to the fact that upon digestion, BsaI recognition sites will be lost, and was selected due to the fact that we were working with the dCas9 open reading frame.
We performed a transformation with 4 uL of the reaction and obtained 66 white colonies with only 4 red colonies as a result of the dCas9 assembly. Because we didn't have a selection method, the efficiency of the reaction was 6%, with a total of 4 events confirmed by minipreps’s PCR from 66 colonies processed.
As shown in Figure 7, the fragments of both versions of the dCas9, have a size between 4000 and 5000 bp based on the Mass Ruler ladder, which matches the theoretical size of 4525 bp for both version A-dCas9 and B-dCas9, respectively. Based on this result we could argue that the fusion sites TCTA, GCAA, GGGT, AATG, and TACT can be used in a same Golden Gate assembly reaction.

Application: Optogenetic Control of Insulin Secretion Pathways
    Cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes have consistently been rising since the 1980s in both developed and developing countries, with reports estimating nearly 422 million people globally living with the disease. New technologies have made significant advances in the way we treat this disease, and optogenetic control with regards to cell growth is one of the most promising of these applications. Optogenetic control is a powerful in relation to the treatment of chronic diseases (such as diabetes) due to its non-invasive and targeted approach, allowing for the selective treatment of a given type of cell or region within the body. Take the secretion of insulin in pancreatic β-cells, which is a process controlled by a variety of intracellular components. Of these components, cyclic AMP (cAMP) is the most important due to its regulatory activity. With the implementation of photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (PAC) being used to mimic the effects of cAMP along the insulin secretion pathway, a team of scientists were able to effectively promote the release of insulin levels comparable to that of secretagogues treated β-cells via the use of an inducible optogenetic control system. Where the iGEM project comes in is through the creation of a system that would allow for the control of multiple bacterial cultures at once using an optogenetic system. Being able to control and induce multiple cellular regions and cultures with a system would ultimately be the best way of controlling something like insulin secretion in the case of diabetes. The issue lies in creating an automated control system to self regulate cell growth and protein production levels without having to manually uptick or decrease the system, something the Waterloo iGEM team is directly testing and refining.

If your company is going to start working with GMM, the first step is getting the Certified of Biosafety by CTNBio and create an internal committee of biosafety. Then, you need the approval by the regulatory agency (e.g. Anvisa for human purposes and the MAPA for agriculture purposes). You are going to need to fulfill a lot of requirements in order to get the registry and the permission to develop your research in your lab.  For agriculture purposes, once you have finished your research inside the lab, the CTNBio will evaluate it and emit a position paper that will allow you to do a planned and controlled release. To do that, you are going to need to fulfill the requirements of the Normative Resolution n. 6 of November 6th, 2008.
For medical purposes, once you finished your research inside the lab, you are going to need to ask Anvisa for a registry of biological medication and you are going to need to fulfill all of the requirements stared in the Resolution n. 55 of December 16th, 2010.
Once your product is registered and approved by CTNBio and MAPA or Anvisa, you will be able to release and/or commercialise it.

A. If you use GMMs in an open system (e.g. agriculture use, bioremediation use): In the use of open system, first, you have to apply for the approval of use regulations with the evaluation sheet of biodiversity influence to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment. Once you got approval, you can start using GMMs. At the same time, you have to report the results of the information collected after using GMMs. And you will also get site inspections by Ministries written above as well as independent administrative institutions (FAMIC, NARO, NLBC, FRA). As a result, you will get administrative orders and you have to follow these order by re-submitting information or change/annulment of the use regulations.
B. If you use GMMs in closed system (e.g. using GMMs for production of enzymes/catalysts, using GMMs for production of reagents/ industrial materials): If you use GMMs inside faculties and prevent GMMs to diffuse, first you have to check if the GMM you're using is on the GILSP list. If it is on the list, you have to follow the steps to prevent diffusions that are prescribed and start using GMMs. Then"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards"

We adopted the PCR method to amplify the Gal1-part (BBa_K2407001) and CYC1-part (BBa_K2407107) from a Gal1-Vika plasmid we had used in our former lab work with specially designed primers for this procedure. After PCR, the Gal1 has the cutting sites for SalⅠand BsaⅠon both ends, and CYC1 has that for BsaⅠand BamhⅠon both ends. Meanwhile, the HO (BBa_K2407109) gene was obtained by gene synthesis, flanked by specific hangtags for BsaⅠin order to be cohesive with Gal1 (upstream) and CYC1 (downstream). Thus, we have built our composite part (GHC).
After the ligation ofGHC (BBa_K2407100) and PRS416 Plasmid (GHC-416), we transformed the E. coli for the augment of our new plasmid——GHC-416. We examined the transformation result by PCR method to amplify the HO gene in the E. coli which we randomly selected in the plate.
Fig. 1-3. The results of PCR of #6, #7, #16, #20, #27, #36, #37, #55 colonies. HO gene (length of 1770bp). As we can see, HO gene in all 8 colonies has been amplified, which indicated that we succeeded in constructing the device for HO gene expression.

The result of mating type switching(MTS)
We transformed the chassis yeasts for the new device——GHC-416, the new yeasts we selected in the Sc-Ura plate is named as SynⅩ-dUra-416.
In this section, we only got to test the Gal System due to time limit. And we figured that the result for Gal System is adequately enough to represent the feasibility of our designed strategy for MTS.
The whole test process can be divided into three steps.
1) Step one
Activate the Gal1 promoter. After that, the expression of HO gene in the SynⅩ-dUra-416 can be initiated"

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#labnotes4_-_-_TEXT.html," was amplified according to CP1.1 and run with an annealing temperature of 63 celcius and 2 minutes elongation.
The PCR samples were loaded on a1.5% gel with two ladders (100-1000 and 100-10000) FlhDC native was loaded in the first 5 lanes and FlhDC mut in the next 5 lanes.
The gel is expected to show two bands for the native FlhDC gene, one arround 900bp and one arround 100bp, while the FlhDC mut is expected to show only one band, between 900bp and 1000bp.
Results: The gel is pour, shows smear and bands at 200 bp.
We suspect that the primers are to blame for this result. It is possible that when the primer-stock used was made, old primers was used instead of the new longer ones. If this is the case then the annealing temperature of 63 celcius (ajusted to the new primers) is way higher than that of the old ones (45 celcius) which would make it impossible for primers to anneal.
So we made new primer-stock, and removed the old stock and primers.

Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Notebook#Week4_-_-_TEXT.html," this type of function would be very useful to us.  This would be useful in determining a host organism by seeing which organisms each reaction can take place in.  Therefore, using the new tools I had learned for Python and the KEGG API I started making programs that compiled lists of information from the KEGG database that I could use to perform this organisms, and hopefully vice versa for get_organisms_by_reaction.  Before I started making code, I made a map of going from Organsims, to genes, to enzymes, and finally to reactions.  My first task was to compile a list of Organsims and the 3 or 4 letter codes that KEGG has assigned to each organism.  These code names are needed when doing certain queries to the KEGG API.  In particular, I needed this list of code names for the Organisms to genes step via the command get_genes_by_organisms. I ended up writing my code to retrieve all of the genes by code name for every organism listed on the KEGG database and compiled these lists of genes for every organism into one HUGE list of lists.  I ended exporting this extremely large list of lists of genes by organism to a text file via the pickle module for python.  This text file is the biggest text file I have ever seen, coming in around 200 MB.  LOL....  This program also took a long time to run as well, took about 3 or 4 hours to finish.  Since this list is so huge, I decided to just work with Ecoli for now, and move on to S cerevisiae and other organisms later.  My next step was to get enzymes by genes.  I did this for Ecoli only, and compiled and exported the list to a txt file.  This also took quite some time.  I started working on getting reactions by enzyme, when I learned something interesting, yet annoying.  Enzymes are given a code name in the form of 'ec:1.1.1.3' on the kegg database.  This code name is ""non-organism"" specific.  Therefore, getting reactions by enzyme has the potential of retrieving reactions that do not occur in Ecoli, since the enzyme name is a  generic name for any enzyme that performs a reaction.  Sometimes, enzymes can facilitate more than one reaction.  In terms of Ecoli, not all of these reactions that an enzyme can perform can necessarily occur in Ecoli. Therefore, I discovered I must find another way that will be organism specific throughout the whole process of going"

Taking TDH3P-mCherry-ADH1T cassette for example, we obtained fragments TDH3P,mCherry and ADH1T with homologous arms by PCR and then we transformed three fragments and linearized vector pRS413 which had been digested by enzymes BamHΙ and Not Ι into Saccharomyces cerevisiae to do yeast homologous recombination.Through the screening of nutrition label and the verification of PCR, we got the right strains for further measurement.
The detailed information were shown on the table2 below.

Figure 3  fluorescence intensity of various fluorescence proteins
We excluded mOrange, ECFP and RFP and finally we chose Nanoluc, Fluc, EYFP and mCherry as our report genes to characterize our system. The reasons were that mOrange showed very low fluorescence intensity and it takes too long for RFP to degrade and we didn’t obtain right genes of ECFP. EYFP and mCherry were finally picked out, which showed higher fluorescence intensity.
Except for the selection of reporter genes, these cassettes play a role in other ways . For example, it was used as a positive control group in measuring. And we measured the degradation curve of mCherry and EYFP, which did a favor for our analysis of the results on the one hand and added new experimental characterization data to part_BBaE2030 and part_BBaE2050 on the other hand.

Due to the Y2H system, the promoter needs to have less leakage expression and respond sensitively to the proteins combination. After thorough search, we eventually found a mutant"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the other hand, if the enzyme isn’t a membrane protein, as previous reports of its expression might suggest, the mating factor α would allow for its secretion.
In order to find the conditions where the enzyme is produced best, we designed three different variants of the enzyme, all codon optimized for yeast. One is only the enzyme (figure 12), the second one has the secretion tag in the N-terminus of the enzyme (figure 13) while the third one also has the secretion tag, but instead of just one propeptide part, there are three propeptide parts (figure 14). Our hypothesis is that the first one would remain in the cytosol, the second one would be optimal for localization in the plasma membrane, and the third one would favor secretion.
We also wanted to be able to purify our produced enzymes in order to quantify the amounts produced. We chose to add a 6X His tag, which is composed of six histidine residues, in the C-terminus of our enzymes. This should make it possible for a simple purification using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) while also allowing for detection in Western blots with anti-His tag antibodies. The His tag had also been used by Dziga et al. (2012) when expressing MlrA in E. coli , which indicated that a His tag should not interfere with the proper function of MlrA.

The MlrA sequence we decided to use is from Sphingomonas sp. ACM-3962 (GenBank accession number AF411068.2), as it had been previously used by Dziga et al. (2012) in the heterologous production of MlrA in E. coli . Since the original sequence is from a bacterial host, the sequence was codon optimized for yeast in hopes of achieving the highest possible yields in protein production. Codon"

Guangdong Frontier Defence General Hospital
    We first went to the Guangdong frontier Defence General Hospital and recorded a video in May 2nd. According to the doctor, we knew that although HCV is a type of infectious disease, just a few concern about it. That’s because the virus can incubate for a long time after the initial infection and keep damaging the liver of the patients. Only when the HCV virus causes enough damage to the body can it be discovered. So we realized that we should raise the public awareness of prevention of HCV.
    Doctors also queried the validity of our project, because they doubted that whether the substrate, gingival crevicular fluid, has enough concentrations of the virus. And then we intended to use serum instead of gingival crevicular fluid, and improve the sensitivity of our paper.
    From the communication with doctors, we learnt that to test whether a patient is HCV-positive needs a long time, usually for two hours. It means that our paper will obtain the result much faster than the testing technology at present.
                                                
The Second People’s Hospital of Shenzhen
    On August 27th, SFLS-iGEM went to consult the doctors about our project and conduct a survey on HCV detection. We consulted Xiuqing Liu, the director of laboratory medicine, who introduced us to the current situation of the application of the HCV virus test paper. After the conversation, we knew that our idea of promoting our test paper to the blood bank was unrealistic, for they only examine the blood after they transport it to the blood centre. We also got to know other ways of detecting HCV virus.
    After that, we surveyed over 100 medical workers from stomatology department and ICU with the questionnaire. The question included: the current situation of HCV detection, the pros and cons of paper testing, and the public awareness of HCV.
    The result indicated the following points:
1. Many patients didn’t receive timely treatment, for common people wouldn’t take HCV examination regularly.
2. All of the current ways of detection has the disadvantages of inconvenience and time-consuming. On the contrary, our paper is quick and convenient, and meets the demand of certain kinds of examination.
    Based on this survey, we perfected our project in the following aspects:
1. We started to think about adding  a quality control area on our paper in order to insure the status of our device, as the doctors suggested"

Safety
 
 
 
As a software team, our team work does not include any wet lab part.
Nonetheless, we take safety into account as well as measures from a variety of aspects.
 
1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
 
Researcher safety:
As a team working out software program, our main problem of this part is the radiation-effect of computers while all the members are programming. For health of programmers and ergonomically working, we formulate several rules such as limitation of working time (the upper limit is 8 hour) and team members need to relax their eyes by taking a walk of view scenes every hour.
 
Public safety:
Our projects are set in iPhone OS, whose underlying code can't be changed by user, leading to almost antivirus. Besides, with our hard work and the serious examine and verify of app store,  the possible error has been estimated and reduced to guarantee user informations. We also aware to show a concise and academic user interface which has no academic irrelevant content.
 
Environmental safety：
We solemn promise that we didn't have or create any experiment product which can effect the environment.
 
 
2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
 
As a software team, we didn't make any BioBrick. And no safety issues happened from this.
 
 
3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
 
Our university is a new university and there is no biosafety committee, but we do consult our professors of Department of Biology during the programming progress.
 
 
4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal"
Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Human Practices#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM is playing an increasingly important role in promoting multidisciplinary communication and promoting engineering in the field of synthetic biology.    Talking with high school students  One of our team members Guo Fuyu went to Hutian Middle School in Huaihua, Hunan Province. He introduced systems and synthetic biology to the students while helped them with biology in high school as well. To our point of view, it’s of foundamental significance to provide as much middle school students in second-tier cities in China as possible with access to frontier science, for quality education is definitely as important as examination-oriented education. (图1) According to a survey in Peking University, freshmen who have had a sense of high education and sought for their interest in high school get accustomed to college life and study remarkably faster than those who haven’t. We genuinely hope university students and professors across China can communicate more with high school students and help every single one find his or her own interest worth pursuing their whole life as soon as possible. We especially hope the students in second-tier cities and rural areas get the same chance of quality education as those in supercities.   pre school scientific education  May it be a crazy idea to introduce the most cutting-edge science to the kids in kindergarten, the kids and us can still spend a nice day with science. Two of our team members did this in the kindergarten attached to Peking University. We designed a series of games with the background of science: demonstrating the three phases of water, observing phase separation, constructing a “phase separation” system with magnet ball and water drawing. The kids liked these games very much which inspired us a lot. It’s a big challenge for us to tell the children about basic science, but we’re happy to see them enjoying the games which is also interesting and relaxing for us. We enjoyed the fascination of science which is believed to cross the boundary of age and life experience. This activity made us confident about the perspective of scientific communication, and we realized we can communicate in a both “meaningful” and “interesting” way, where all the talkers are equal and relaxed and the conversation is much more efficient.    Documentation of Peking iGEM as enlightenment for beginners   We have built up a WeChat public platform which is a worldwide platform with billions of users for documentation, communication and popularization. To give the future igemers a taste of igem projects and help them learn the basic rudiments of synthetic biology we have reviewed the projects of Peking iGEM in the past 14 years. All these articles are rather approachable and most of them received positive feedbacks. We"

YF1 fusion protein = blue light sensor that becomes unphosphorylated in blue light and phosphorylated (activated) in darkness
FixJ protein = after being phosphorylated by YF1, this activates the promoter FixK2
FixK2 binding site = initiates the transcription of CI when FixJ binds to it
lambda (λ) repressor protein CI = a protein that can repress or activate the transcription of two different genes
OR right tripartite operator site = an operator site to which CI binds, downstream from OL in the λ phage
OL left tripartite operator site = an operator site to which CI binds, upstream from OR in the λ phage
PR promoter = a promoter that is active only when there’s no CI protein
PRM promoter = a promoter that is active only when there’s a little CI protein. Too high or too low CI concentration inhibits the production
genes A-C = the three genes that you can choose. Our system would regulated them as explained earlier
Tetracycline repressor TetR = a protein that can bind to a TetR repressible promoter site and inhibit downstream gene transcription
Background
Developing Our Idea
In the beginning of our project, from March 2014, we focused solely on coming up with new ideas for the project, building the public team website and applying to Summer of Startups 2014 program and foundations with deadlines during the spring. In our team meetings, we had different types of brainstorming sessions where all of us could present even the craziest ideas. We came up with disco bacteria that glow in sync with music, new kinds of bacterial drinks that change flavour with the storing temperature, remote controllable bacteria, oil-eating bacteria, tooth paste bacteria that keeps up the mouth hygiene despite forgetting to brush the teeth, etc. On ane Friday evening we had a vote and everybody gave a score from 1 to 5 for each idea. We made an idea gradient where the ideas were sorted according to the score from bottom left to top right.
We chose the top five ideas and presented them to our advisors and researchers from Aalto University, VTT and University of Helsinki to get feedback and comments on the feasibility. After all, none of us had never done anything even close"

        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))

Thaumatin
Responsible: Martin Schappert and Alois Bräuer
""Why? O WHY???"" is the reaction we usually face when we tell our friends, that we genetically engineer yeast to secrete a sweetener. ""Kruzifixnochemol"" is another, more cryptic one.
We must admit, even we do not think that a ""Münchner Hell"" or a ""Pils"" would benefit from the distinct sweetness of Thaumatin, originally produced by Thaumatococcus daniellii.
So, why, o why have we chosen Thaumatin? There are a variety of arguments that have to be taken into consideration:
Since experiments in the 1980ies, nobody tried to express Thaumatin via S. cerevisiae - so we saw the possibility to enhance the production and make it more efficient (as one of the biggest problems for industrial use of Thaumatin so far is the low yield efficiency) by codon usage optimization.
If you think of the beers of the Anglo-Saxon world - stouts and ales - these are the sorts that could directly profit from the licorice-like sweetness, as they are"

Imaging of silicatein-expressing cells and their elemental composition using TEM
Introduction
Electron microscopy is an imaging technique that can acquire images with resolutions far above the optical limit due to the small wavelength of electrons (Nellist, 2011) . An electron gun forms an electron beam which is focused and accelerated by magnetic lenses. In order to make sure the electrons are not defracteddiffracted before reaching the sample, the beam and the sample are in high vacuum. When the electrons reach the sample, there are several interactions possible with the sample (figure 1). These various interactions can be used for different techniques. We have used high-angle annular dark-filed transmission electron microscopy (HAAFD-TEM) to make an image of the sample, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to analyze the element composition of the sample and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the phenotype of the samples.
Figure 1: Interactions between the electron beam and sample in electron microscopy.
In HAAFD-TEM electrons pass through the sample and are inelastically scattered at a high angle and acquired by a detector. The amount of electrons scattered at a high angle depends on the thickness and the material of the sample. When the thickness is high, the sample scatters a lot it will appear bright in the image.
Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is an analytical technique to determine the elements present in the sample (Friel et al., 2006) . When the electron beam interacts with the sample x-rays can emerge from the sample. These electrons can be detected and are characteristic for the element which emitted the x-ray. In that way we can specifically determine which elements are present in our sample.
Methods
The experiment were performed using E. coli BL21 cells with the plasmid containing OmpA-Silicatein. Two samples were made where the first sample was induced with IPTG but no silicic acid was added and a second sample which was both induced with IPTG and silicic acid was added, therefore this sample will have a polysilicate layer. The samples were prepared by fixation using 1% polylysine on the surface of a quantifoil carbon grid. Samples were imaged using a Titan transmission electron microscope from FEI company.

TECHNION-ISRAEL,2017,Team:TECHNION-ISRAEL#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," a great opportunity to discuss our idea with people from different countries and cultures. In addition, we were excited to bring our message of “Tolerance” to another country and share it with other iGEM teams.
This is the first time that a team from the Technion Institute has participated in an iGEM meet-up abroad. In total four teams participated. Two teams from France, one from Spain and us. Each team presented their project and received feedback from the judges that team AIX arranged and from the different teams. The Feedback was constructive and helped us improve our presentation and poster as well as our project as a whole.
The projects presented were interesting and inspiring. The atmosphere was great and allowed room for discussion and collaboration. We truly experienced the unique and special nature of the iGEM community.
We hope that in light of this experience, future teams from the Technion and the Middle East will participate in multinational meet-ups abroad.
Collaboration with team Peshawar
Team Peshawar and the Technion have a rich collaboration history . This year we collaborated with Team Peshawar by video chat. We shared our project ideas and brainstormed regarding problems and potential solution. We also discovered we were both planning to write position papers concerning our projects, and shared insights regarding planning and execution. Additionally Team Peshawar went to extra lengths to produce a very thoughtful “Tolerance photo” that received incredibly positive feedback on social media (shown below).

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Now that we have this algorithm, and can generate correct invertase keys for each permutation of n parts, the next step is to visualize the invertase tree.  Every node in the tree is a permutation, and all edges represent the invertase which leads to that permutation.  Once we have a good method for visualizing, I will move on to the top-down approach of tailored invertase designs.
7/11/11
Today I worked generating a table of keys for each permutation.  I gave the user the ability to distinguish between for example, A B C, as a permutation, and A' B C as a permutation.  Each of these can return different keys if the users wishes.  I also worked on using jGraph a little to visualize our tree/graph; however, I am not happy with the visualizing methods provided by jGraph thus far.  I am also looking into DOT for doing this.
In addition, I think that I might make a library module which contains all of my invertase related code.  Then I can begin the design of the Trumpet GUI and keep PADS around as well, both of which will rely on the invertase library.
7/12/11
- I stumbled upon JUNG today which allows me to generate trees for our invertase keys very simply.  So far, I am able to take in a table of permutations and keys and spit out a tree that represents these keys.  I have not integrated this into PADS yet.  This is because I am planning on building the front end for Trumpet, which will be the final tool that integrates all of my work this summer.  It will let users target permutations of parts and then, based on a set of heuristics, it will spit out the best possible design construct for the user.  Tomorrow, I will layout the preliminary version of this GUI.
7/13/11
- Below is the initial version of the final Trumpet GUI:
So far, the parts list is hard coded, meaning that Trumpet pulls the first n parts from the parts on my local connection.  The list of invertases are also hard coded.  Based on the parts in the working parts set, a list of possible permutations is generated.  The user can then select certain permutations and add them to the list of desired permutations.  Finally, they select an algorithm, only Link Sort is available currently, and then they press Go.  So far this is the only functionality that I have coded.  By Friday, I hope to integrate the key tables and key trees into the app so"

2.3The effect of Induction temperature on enzyme expression
The recombinant strain E.EcolI  were inoculated into LB liquid medium for OD600 value bacteria liquid reaches 0.6,added at a final concentration 1mmol/L of inducer IPTG and placed in different temperature (23℃, 30℃, 37 ℃ ) induction training.Measured enzyme activity after disruption of the cells by timing sampling and repeating freeze-thaw method with liquid nitrogen.The results show in figure 7. From figure 7 visible, the enzyme activity of culturing at 23℃ and 30℃ were higher than the corresponding value at 37℃, and the induction time was reached the peak at 12h. At the same time, found that the enzyme activity decreased significantly at 37 ℃ after 9 hours. This is main that the enzyme expression speed is slow at low temperature, which is not easy to form inclusion bodies.At high temperature, the enzyme expression of the speed is too fast, the enzyme protein is not enough time to fold the mature and active enzyme protein , which is easy to form inactive inclusion body. Considering the induced temperature is too low will affect cell growth, therefore, the choice of induction temperature 23℃ to 30℃ is appropriate.

The Calvin cycle involves eleven enzymes, of which eight are intrinsic to E. coli. The three heterologous enzymes are RuBisCo, SBPase and PRK. The latter phosphorylates ribulose-5-phosphate to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. This is the substrate for RuBisCo, which catalyses the carboxylation, whereby glycerate-3-phosphate is produced. Later in the cycle, SBPase catalyses the dephosphorylation of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, which is later converted to ribulose-5-phosphate, completing the circle. The net effect of three full cycles is the conversion of three CO2 molecules into one molecule glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which can be used for energy production via glycolysis or polysaccharide biosynthesis. Separately, these enzymes have previously been heterogeneously expressed in E. coli using various donor species, such"

In the guest book on the exhibition site, we received feedback from many enthusiastic audiences, expressing their appreciation for the development of science and technology, the encouragement of researchers, the confidence and expectation of a better future for technology, and the blessing of our team to achieve the desired results and have continued success this year.
Our 10th anniversary theme exhibition
Besides, we participate in School of Life Science open day and introduce our project and synthetic biology to other students in our school.
Life Science Open Day
On the afternoon of October 10, our team together with SJTU-software team had a poster session at the open day at our school. We met lots of freshmen of school of life science, and we have introduced our project, iGEM competition and synthetic biology theory to them. They said they are willing to join our team next year and want to attribute themselves for synthetic biology.
Introducing iGEM at open day
As well, we went forward to rural areas in China to provide teaching support about basic biology knowledge. Student were all enthusiastic about our synthetic biology works. Those brand-new thoughts arouse their creativity and they also gave us some creative ideas about our work and synthetic biology.
Teaching Support
We all know that the future of mankind depends on the next generation, and the next generation depends on education. Qinghai Province is a relatively backward area of ​​education and scientific literacy in China. Due to the lack of bioscience literacy among students in Qinghai, they chose to promote public science. Therefore, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team member He Peixiang followed the school branch to the Huangchuan Middle School in Qinghai Province on August 2-7, and led the students to observe various samples using microscopes and introduce botany, microbiology and other related knowledge. Exclaiming the beauty and wonder of creatures, the interest in biology has greatly improved.
On August 4th, team member He Peixiang conducted a science education activity on the theme of “Synthetic Biology and Gene Molecular Machines”. During the event, He Peixiang mainly introduced the concepts related to synthetic biology, the ideas, principles and methods of molecular machine construction, and introduced our project “ECHO” as an example to introduce how biotechnology should be applied and benefit humanity. The students felt that they had benefited a lot and had a preliminary understanding of the knowledge and significance of synthetic biology.

With the number of cells and the amount of CsgA per slot known we were able to calculate the number of CsgA proteïns per cell: 2.06105 molecules/cell.
Conclusions and Future Directions
With the experiments described previously we achieved biofilm formation with our harmless lab Escherichia coli strains. Also, we managed to limit this expression only when rhamnose (a metabolizable inductor) is supplied. In overall, these results show a promising genetic construct to be used for bio-printing purposes. However, the experiments conducted in that part of the project could not really determine the exact effect of the induction level (i.e. concentration of rhamnose) in the biofilm formation. So, we would like to advise future researchers in this field to look for more detailed and complex experiments that could give information about the biofilm structure differences in time.
Next to the linking experiments, a step further in biofilm design would be to endow our strains with surface-attachment capability. This property will be analysed in the next part of our project, Affinity Tags.
Affinity Tags
In this section we worked in the characterization of strains that display special affinity to certain surfaces.
Introduction and Motivation
In our aim to develop a fully customizable biofilm formation process, we wanted to improve their adhesive properties and make them stick to any possible surface. To achieve this goal, we modified the CsgA protein (monomer of the curli nanowire) and added affinity tags to it. First of all, we thought about biofilms that naturally grow in our mouths. These biofilms are a major issue in testing antibacterial products like toothpastes, so we thought we could contribute to that process by adding an affinity tag for the dental surface.  Moreover we also designed other affinity tags of interest. The complete list is shown in Table 6:
Table 6. Summary of the affinity tags added to the CsgA molecule in order to give a specific surface attachment
In the following section, we have analyzed the biofilm-making ability of the strains carrying the plasmids containing the modified csgA sequences. Also, for the HA tag (hydroxyapatite), we have designed an experiment for evaluating the attachment specificity of the modified amyloid to the dental surface.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," provided some great insight. Dr. Pellini has been in the diagnostics space for over 20 years, and he was able to validate much of our foundational understanding. As with most of our interactions, we were told that the key bottleneck for development and implementation of liquid biopsy tests was the lack of strong predictive value in order to be of use to clinicians. He also thought that at this point, it would be a good idea to give some forethought for our intellectual property strategy . Because we were going to disclose a lot of our research through our wiki and presentation at the Giant Jamboree, he felt that filing a provisional patent would be an important component of defining our differentiating core.
Takeaway:
This conversation primarily helped confirm that we were on the right track with our intuition about how the navigate the space around epigenetic-based liquid biopsy. It helped us understand some of the concerns about intellectual property. We also decided that in the wetlab, following the successful testing of our baseline circuit, we would need to develop some signal amplification strategies. Following this, we met with Parth Majmudar at the UCSD Office of Innovation and Commercialization who helped walk us through the process. Prior to the Jamboree, the team has filed for a provisional patent.
Dr. Tina He, post-doctoral scholar at the Zhang Lab
One of our shifts in the wetlab was to add steps that would enhance the diagnostic power of our assay. In addition, one of the problems that we had run into after over-expressing the MBD protein was that the protein would detect hypermethylation across the entire body of the sample, just not the promoter region as we wanted. Thus, we needed to address the non-specificity of the MBD and derive a quantitative readout. To do this, our team implemented a graphene oxide platform, and used its properties of affinity to single-stranded DNA and fluorescence quenching to give the specificity needed.
Takeaway:
This was one of the most significant modifications to our wetlab design: we added a GO (graphene oxide) platform that would allow for the MBD to detect in the promoter region.

Dr. Kreisberg is part of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative, a joint collaboration between UC San Diego and UC San Francisco.

Then we explained the steps and principle of experiment by PowerPoint clearly to increase the familiarity of experimental operation, and prevent any accidents from happening. After the experiment began, we put our iGEM team members into each group so that they can avoid making mistakes during the experiment and help the students in understanding the experimental technique.
The E.coli we prepared for them had been transplanted red fluorescent protein gene, and it is in beautiful red color at the beginning. But when we added the solution II which needed for taking the plasmid out of the bacteria, then the color changed suddenly into bright yellow. What’s more, when we added the solution III, it changed form yellow into colorless. This significant color change phenomenon made the student surprise and gave rise to their curiosity on iGEM, finally, aroused their passion on the experiment.
Day 5
Today we had a trip to visit the supreme academic organization in Taiwan. It is the Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica. We invited two professors to join us, and hoping that they could answer the questions pointed out by students. Genomics Research Center also generously provided us the opportunity to visit their lab and they explained how the equipment works in detail. And we also explored the cutting-edge technologies of genomics by their lecturer’s speech.
Day 6
In the last day of the camp, we held a competition to test the learning achievement and knowledge that each group member learned in previous days. Therefore, we designed some questions on genetic engineering to make them think. And then we invited Mr. Tsai who is very energetic and humorous to host the competition. First, they should listen to the question and write the answer onto the whiteboard we had provided for each group. Second, they should show the answer to everyone. Finally, we gave scores according to their creativity and feasibility of their answer, just like a real iGEM competition, so that the students could personally experience the presence of competition. Due to the special charm of the host, the atmosphere was extremely tense and exciting. It is very difficult for us to decide who will win the competition. The points between each team were very close, so every students tried hard to recall the lessons they learned, hoping to win for the team. I believe the knowledge and experience they have learned in this six-day camp was precious. And they’ld never forget this memorable trip.

There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"

To solve this problem, we introduce orthogonal ribosome into our system. Since its great orthogonality to the host genome, we believe that it can reduce the unexpected interaction of genome and our target gene.
Fig.2 Expected effects orthogonal ribosomes may achieve.
The bacteria ribosome consists of rRNA and protein responsible for translation of mRNA to protein. The Shine-Dalgarno(SD) sequence of the mRNA is a major determinant of translation efficiency as the interaction between the SD sequence and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno(ASD) sequence through RNA-RNA base pairing. Therefore, to change the sequence of the SD sequence and the RBS sequence could isolate the gene downstream the mutant RBS from the host ones as the mutant ribosome could only translate the target genes theoretically. In this way, the resource competition could be solved, which means our output will follow the input accurately.
Fig.3 Left: Structure of ribosome, pink stands for the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of its 16S rRNA. Protein Data Bank accession number 4V4P ; video created with Chimera. Right: Example mutation of SD and RBS sequence that give rise to orthogonal ribosome.
Through desktop research, we found several different editions of orthogonal ribosomes. After consideration, we chose four pairs of orthogonal ribosomes and orthogonal RBS(ribosome binding site) to test and try to find the best to use in our system. They are labeled as A2, B8, C9 from Jason Chin's lab and TJU from TJU_2012 iGEM team. Although no constructed plasmid was available from Jason’s or the TJU team, the way they mutated the host ribosome 16s rRNA were provided in the paper they published. Therefore, we are luckily to have the chance to construct these orthogonal ribosomes by mutagenesis in our own lab.
Experiment design
Construction
As the ribosome binds to the mRNA only depending on the small subunit 16s rRNA, we only need to construct orthogonal 16S rRNA. To obtain the orthogonal 16s rRNA, we first cloned E.coli genomic DNA 16s rRNA rrnB to T-Vector. According to the sequence provided in the paper or website, we mutated the Shine-Dalgarno site for every version of orthogonal ribosome. And for A2, B8, C9 orthogonal 16s rRNA from Jason Chin's lab, an extra mutation was performed from 722 to "

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Electrace_-_-_TEXT.html," biosensors have been developed. Also, D’Souza [4] published a list of 44 papers describing biosensors already in 2001. However, microbial biosensors have only very limitedly been commercialized. Su et al. [5] state:  “Commercial microbial biosensors are just tips of the iceberg compared to the great amount of academic research on them”. They relate this to “the intrinsic disadvantages (slow response, low sensitivity, and poor selectivity)” of microbial biosensors, which, however, can and will be solved by the developments in synthetic biology [5].
One major reason microbial biosensors are currently limitedly used is not mentioned by Su et al., namely the fact that most current microbial biosensors require a microscopy set-up to be read out, due to the optical nature of their output. “For light and fluorescence assays you need lots of equipment and devious procedures,” Mr. Van Der Berg of BDS has explained to us . The equipment mentioned is very expensive: For instance, even the Zephyr DIY fluorescence microscope developed by iGEM team TU Delft 2013 costs around $1500, and this is already extremely cheap compared to commercially available machines. [6]
The need for bulky microscopy equipment and complicated procedures currently limits the use of whole cell biosensors to advanced laboratories with highly trained personnel. This greatly reduces the possibility for commercially viable applications. Whole cell biosensor-based consumer products are under the current circumstances impossible, but also business-to-business products would only be available for the small subset of companies which has (or can afford to pay for) a lab and technicians.
To increase the chances for commercial applications of microbial biosensors, outputs other than light-based outputs are needed. Several other output mechanisms are available. Bousse [2] mentions multiple methods to measure the energy metabolism of cells (including pH measurement and measurement of oxygen consumption). All these measurement require that the analyte has a distinct influence on the metabolism of the cell, for example due to toxicity or increased cell growth. This greatly limits the range of analytes which can be tested and also makes the construction of new sensors with synthetic biology techniques very difficult. Several other methods based on changing pH or redox potential have been described [7]. However, these methods are not widely used and much less popular than light-based outputs.
From these observations, it can be concluded that, in order to make a commercial application of a microbial biosensor possible, a novel output mechanism has to be developed. The novel output has to meet several requirements. Firstly, its output signal should be measurable with the use of equipment which is inexpensive,"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

The Risks of Our Projects Now
What are the risks to the safety and health of lab members?
To minimize risk to team members working in the lab, BSL-1 facility standard operating procedures are followed. http://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/biosafety/ The lab is kept clean and organized and inspected regularly. All members of the lab group have received current instruction on safety procedures.
What are the risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab)?
All strains used are considered nonpathogenic and engineered to be unable to survive outside laboratory conditions. To minimize accidental exposure, access to the laboratory by unauthorized persons is not permitted. There is no planned release of engineered bacteria. In order to reduce risk, cultures are grown in small quantities and micro technique is followed for all laboratory procedures as to minimize ecological impact and potential for toxicity to humans.
What are the risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab)?
All of the strains we use are engineered to be unable to grow outside of a laboratory environment. Waste disposal should pose no threat as the modified bacteria cannot live on pipet tips or dried up agar plates, and liquid cultures are killed with bleach before disposal. Our lab is locked, with access to lab members only, and any materials that escape should not be able to survive without the correct additives in the media.
What are the risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries
None of the strains used are on the Select Agent list and pose no threats to biosecurity.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For"

Close up of several cells, showing GFP expression in the periplasm
For this cell a linear profile was made that shows both the GFP and RFP signal across the cell:

Modeling Methods
To assess the ability to distinguish the periplasmic from the cytoplasmic space we made a model which is based on a perfect spherical cell with and even layer between inner and outer membrane.
To get a value of the RFP and GFP signal we used a cross section of the spherical cell and measured the length of RFP and GFP going across this section; see the measurement bars at the figure.  The make a graph of this we set the middle of the cell to be 0 on the x-axis. On the y-axis we let two lines show the value of GFP and RFP in the cross section.
The first graph can be seen below:
The first model was done in Maple.
Model of ""Hello World"" construct
With the mathematical equations made for making the graph above we made a interactive model that enables the user to set their own settings with regard to GFP and RFP intensity and cytoplasmic vs. periplasmic fraction. If the parameters are set well the model reassembles the images we acquired with the fluorescence microscope.

Conclusions
Biobrick BBa_K1067009 successfully directs GFP SF to the periplasm of E. coli. This experiment is a proof of concept that proteins can be exported to the periplasm. In previous iGEM projects, there has been confusion as to whether or not it is possible to export GFP to the periplasm; this experiment verifies just that and gives a procedure on how to reproduce this.

Collaborations
Collaboration is one of the various benefits of iGEM; because, it is dependent to the contributions and teamwork to improve the science. Sailing for new horizons, harmony with the colleagues and collaboration are secret columns of the science society; so, when we were planning our project, collaborations were taken into account below our main missions. Our synthetic biology survey was translated into German and was shared with Freiburg and Frankfurt iGEM Teams. We reached more people via distributing our survey in the universities of Freiburg and Frankfurt. In exchange we presented their projects of this year in our presentation days and hope that it was helpful for young minds for understanding Synthetic Biology and iGEM studies better. We are thankful for their contribution and collaboration.

We did a new Gibson Assembly to build our working plasmid. This time it worked! We obtained some twenty or thirty colonies.
Additionally, we made our first video with 3DS Max, and Max almost destroyed his notebook with that amount of processing! You can see it here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je5JkoOMITE . Hopefully we will use these tools to make our wiki more attractive.
Also, this week we participated in Ingenia Fair.  You can find more information in our wiki section Human practices/Ingenia Fair.
April 30 – May 6, 2012
Analytical PCR was done to verify if the parts that we obtained from the Distribution Kit 2011 to build the GFP Reporter and Protease Producer plasmids have they corresponding size. The results were positive. Then we proceeded with the PCR products purification. Finally we did the Gibson Assemblies to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid, using pSB1K5 and sfGFP as positive controls. The Assemblies worked all right! Afterwards, we sent all our constructs (Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid) for sequencing.
Also, we are very happy because we received the free license of Matlab. Hopefully we will use this tool for modeling.

The proNGF purification using a single step Ni-NTA column was not conclusive. Many proteins were found on elution fractions. His-tagged proNGF fused to HlyA export signal should be found at 33 kDa while the proNGF cleaved by TEV protease should be found at 27 kDa. We finally analyzed five gel slices around 20 to 35 kDa of the FPLC flow-through (lane 2, Figure 6)  by LC/MS/MS mass spectrometry, to verify the presence of proNGF.
With the LC/MS/MS analysis, 14 coverage unique peptides corresponding to proNGF were found in all fractions. The sequence coverage represents 63%. Results of mass spectrometry analysis demonstrate the expression of proNGF. According to Figure 7, proNGF pattern are found on each fraction sent to mass spectrometry. The major amount is found on fraction 5, corresponding to 33 kDa. At this molecular weight, the proNGF is still fused to the signal peptide. However these results are also consistent with a mix of cleaved and uncleaved proNGF. The TEV protease, 34 kDa fused to export singal and 28 kDa cleaved from the export signal are found.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," was challenged. Mr. Björk thought that the best would be to only include smokers since it otherwise would make the program too complex and expensive. This is supported by the fact that approximately 90% of all lung cancer patients have smoked at some point in their life. This cutoff was also suggested by Dr. Koyi in a skype meeting that was held during the summer where he proposed the idea to only include people that have been smoking for 30 years. It is also supported by the American Cancer Society's recommendation that people that have been smoking a package of cigarettes a day for 30 years should be included in a screening program [4].
Inclusion of only smokers in the program was thoroughly discussed especially from a practical and ethical point of view. Questions that came up included how the smokers would be documented and how long you have to smoke to be counted as a smoker? Would it be ethically correct to document the population’s smoking habits? From another perspective; would it be fair to exclude the few but still existing non-smokers that are in fact also discovered to suffer from lung cancer?
In the end, it was concluded that the most efficient method would be to only screen smokers that have smoked for more than 30 years of their life. This would reduce the cost and required organization for the program and since as many as 5 200 patients die from lung cancer every year due to smoking, it was considered a legitimate cutoff [8]. The documentation can be done in several ways but Cancerfonden suggests that the primary health care system could be involved to reach the people in the risk group and refer to the screening program. This could be considered too risky and causing many people in the risk zone to slip through the cracks. Another idea is to send out forms to the part of the population that turn 60 where they have a chance to report their smoking habits. In this way it is voluntary to give out the information. This is a part that has to be continuously worked with to assure that as many people in the risk zone as possible are reached and that people’s privacy is ensured.
Examination method
The sampling would occur at a hospital by trained healthcare personnel using the BREATHtaking device , see Figure 1.  Before the examination, the patient will be instructed not to eat a few hours before the examination, which was recommended by Dr. Koyi. This because different type of foods can secrete VOCs and therefore interfere with the results. When beginning the examination, the patient will be instructed to inhale and then blow into the mouthpiece of the device which will lead the air through a filter collecting the"

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthesis biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthesis biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend.
However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.
Overview
Team Overview
Team
This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,".
However, attracting interest from these two sectors of our community is not an easy task. The majority of the population in these segments probably have never heard of the new and emerging field of synthetic biology. Furthermore, there has not been much done about the ethical issues surrounding synthetic biology, which could raise questions concerning the potential harms and benefits of the field. These concerns are some of the communication barriers that stand between the corporate and education sectors, and the field of synthetic biology. Although, the complete removal of these barriers is impossible, their impact of these communication barriers could be significantly reduced. This reduction in the impact could lead to greater involvement of the education corporate sectors in the field of synthetic biology.
Keeping these considerations in mind, our University of Calgary iGEM team tailored its approach towards the human practices aspect of our project in a way that would try to reduce the impact of these communication barriers and therefore would lead to greater involvement of the education and corporate sectors in the field of synthetic biology. And as mentioned above, these segments would play a pivotal role in the formation of a synthetic biology community. In order to increase the impact of our human practices approach, we divided our human practices team into three areas namely ethics, marketing and, education and outreach. Each area would have its own individual focus but in the end, their goal would be to work towards the formation of a synthetic biology community. Our University of Calgary iGEM team strongly believes that it is very important for these three areas to interact with each other because all these fields are interrelated. Since the formation of a synthetic biology community was our University of Calgary iGEM team’s long term goal, we assigned each area specific short term goals and milestones that would be accomplished before the iGEM Jamboree. The following is a brief summary of the goals of the three areas of our Human Practices aspect of our project:
ETHICS
The University of Calgary iGEM ethics team focused on two major components this year:  1) Written Paper 2) Ethics Conference  The written paper examined the varying issues that surround the emerging field of synthetic biology. The main areas that we focused on are environmental, economical, ethical, legal and social issues that arise in synthetic biology. Some of these issues include:
* What beneficial and detrimental effects can result from these biological developments? For example, if a biological approach is taken in the oil and gas industry, what kind of environmental and economical effect will this decision lead to?
* What kind of ethical issues arise from this new emerging field?
* Should these biological circuits be patented? What governing structure should society have for monitoring these developments?

Role of iGEM
This year’s iGEM team from Wisconsin Lutheran College is working with bacteriophages to combat antibiotic resistance. The TLS Phage used binds to TolC, an antibiotic efflux pump commonly found in resistant bacteria. When antibiotics are used in tandem with phage therapy, the antibiotic will eliminate the bacteria lacking a resistance gene while the TLS Phage will kill the rest.
Cultural Implications
Historically phage therapy has not been prominent in Western cultures, but it has the potential to gain popularity in the future. One must, therefore, question past and current practices: Why do we “over-medicate” with antibiotics? Is there a culture of excess? Are there consequences to overusing phage therapy as happened with antibiotics? What then?
The West maintains a culture of excess, and most American/European media portrays opulence as total success. In battle there is the need to annihilate the enemy in effective, though  destructive ways, be it an army, a competing corporate entity, or a microscopic organism. While this phenomenon of antibiotic abuse has spread across the globe, it is not as ingrained in non-Western cultures.
The culture of over-medicating in the US began almost as quickly as antibiotics were developed. Farmers began feeding animals antibiotics because they were often infected by bacteria present in fecal matter, near or in grazing pastures, and contaminated water. Patients in hospitals also often neglected to take their full courses of antibiotics due to miseducation and/or personal laxness. Therefore, what few bacteria survived grew resistant, so much so, that any formerly used antibiotic was rendered  useless.
According to the Wall Street Journal, “Doctors in some hospitals prescribed up to 3 times as many antibiotics as doctors other hospitals.”[3] While this is not indicative of abuse, out of 250,000, at least 14,000[4] people die from Clostridium dificile, which is commonly found in hospitals, and is an antibiotic-resistant bacterium.
Should phage therapy become widely used in the West by 2020, given this culture of excess, there are concerns that this technology may be abused. Is it possible that phage therapy can be abused? For now, it does not appear so, given that antibiotics function in a very different manner than bacteriophages, are found naturally, and are essentially nontoxic, given they “consist of a core of genetic material (nucleic acid) surrounded by"
XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Mideling_-_-_TEXT.html," the wavy lines represent transcription of the protein and the “*” represent degradation.
We further assumed that the concentrations of SAM and, C6-ACP are at a constant levels S0 and C0, respectively. Hence, we may model the production rate of AHL by,
The background noise production rate is donated as kd and ka is the AHL production rates due to the initiation process.
Compared to the timescales of interest, cell division time, these internal biochemical reactions occur very quickly, and it is reasonable to assume that equation (1) is in equilibrium (mathematically, it means dL/dt =0). Combining the result with (2) gives
When polar and coast cells were initiated by diffusing AHLs, they would start to produce chromoproteins. However, it is very hard for us to determine how many chromoproteins that those cells produced unless we disassembled the cells and purified proteins multiple times. Thus, for this reason, the second attempt of this modeling practice was to investigate the initiation status in polar and coast cells.
To achieve this thought, we need to find the diffusion pattern of AHL toward/from the medium. We introduced the factor η=σ⋅A/Vc based on the work of Garcia-Ojalvo (2003) and ETH-Zurich 2013 igem project (2013), with σ representing the membrane permeability, A is surface area and Vc is the cell volume, and ηext=δ/Vext with Vext being the total extracellular volume. Hence,
in which Ae was external AHL concentration and Am was internal concentration of AHL in marine cells.
The marine cell concentration nm change rate donated as,
Where K is the carrying capacity and α is the intrinsic growth rate.
We assumed that, for the location of coast and polar cells, external AHL concentration was consistent with Ae. Hence,
The production of chromoproteins depend on both the concentration of AHL (A) and growing stage. We use a Hill function (Eq. (6) and Eq. (7)) to model the AHL-dependence of chromoprotein synthesis. The Hill function provides cooperative switching from the synthesis-off to the synthesis-on states, via two parameters a and m,
Those two cooperative switch function gave the insight of the producing rate of different chromoproteins in polar and coast constructs."

Overview
We collaborated with University of Washington on a number of fronts: One of their members, Ed van Bruggen, attended a Poster Fair presented at Stanford University. There we presented our iGEM poster to him, we talked through each other’s projects, and we started figuring out how to expand collaboration between our projects. This collaboration took place primarily with troubleshooting. We gave University of Washington our single-chain antibody fusions to model, as a way to test the limits of their modeling method. The modeling failed, but the experience gave them useful information about the constraints of their model. We also took it upon ourselves to test run their wiki tutorial, giving feedback to make it more accessible to other teams. We look forward to future collaborations with University of Washington iGEM!

Boehringer Ingelheim presentation reflection
At the presentation at Boehringer Ingelheim, it was brought to our attention that we need to determine the threshold level, sensitivity, and specificity for our biosensor. To answer these questions, we had a meeting with Dr. Dana Boyd Barr from Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. She said that we should find our threshold level based on the infectivity rate of Cholera. She recommended that we lower the threshold from the infectivity rate because of how much water the average person drinks per day and that the Cholera cells will accumulate in the body. To add, she explained sensitivity and specificity to the team and how it is important because those values convey to the public the accuracy of our test. Dr. Barr described that we should compare our biosensor’s results to a reliable detection method’s results. She also recommended that we have a higher sensitivity to specificity in order to be health protective, but our specificity cannot be too low because we do not want to cause a false panic. Overall, Dr. Barr was helpful with outlining aspects of epidemiology that we were not familiar with.

Riboregulator Characterization
Introduction
Riboregulator is a type regulatory RNA that can regulate translation. One component of the riboregulator system,       cis-repressing RNA, crRNA, contains a cis-repressing sequence which is located at the 5’ of the RBS and the gene of interest.      When the transcript is formed, the cis-repressing sequence can form a loop to form complementary base pairs with the RBS and blocking the ribosome's entry       to RBS. crRNA is commonly called “lock” because it “locks” the translation of proteins. When there is a lock, we need a “key”.  The taRNA is the component of the       system that      act as a key. It can interact (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore activate translation. The HKUST iGEM 2014       team characterized 4 riboregulator already available in the Part Registry and 1 riboregulator introduced by our team.
