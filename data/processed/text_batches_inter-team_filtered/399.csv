BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," under a continuous influx of media. The outputted media would then be analyzed to see if the inhibitor molecules they were looking to produced had been secreted. After doing some literature review on cell culturing microfluidic devices, we designed a chip with two sized cell traps, one to trap the bacterial cells, the other to trap the mammalian cells. Unfortunately, the necessary size of the bacterial cell traps were features too small for us to fabricate. We sent the MIT team our SVG design files for the chip in case they wanted to manufacture the chip through some other means."
TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Notebook#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," only general stress factors and transcription factors are involved. In this case, chances are that KlADH4 can work in s. cerevisiae, because the necessary factors are most likely present. However, we don't know for sure which mechanism is the correct one (specific or unspecific). Therefore further literature research is necessary for this system.
AlcR-Promoter
The information given in our wiki was presented. The system might be a good candidate, because it seems to be well characterized. Because we do not know many details about this system, further literature research is necessary for this system.
Methanol-Inducible Promoter from Pichia pastoris, and methanol inducible systems from prokarya, such as Methylococcus capsulatis (BATH)
During the discussion about ethanol-inducible systems, two additional suggestions were made.  The yeast pichia pastoris is known for its ability to express recombinant proteins upon methanol induction. Maybe this system can be adapted to respond to ethanol - apparently it is based on a specific methanol binding transcription factor. Further literature research is necessary. Also, there is a variety of bacteria which can grow with alcohols (e.g. methanol) as carbon source (Methylococcus capsulatis (BATH)). Maybe they can also provide a system for S. cerevisiae. Further literature research is necessary.
Inducible Yeast Promoters
Chemical Induction: Last year, the iGEM team [ British Columbia 2011 ] created the BioBrick BBa_K517000. This is a Galactose-inducible yeast-promoter which worked for them.
There is a light-switchable promoter system for yeast which has been shown to work for example in a PhD-thesis. See Project Ideas for details. The fact that short light pulses instead of continuous radiation is sufficient to induce expression is an advantage, because light can destroy flavors.
Biosynthesis of small molecules
Resveratrol
There are two approaches for the synthesis of resveratrol, but both require the intermediate Coumaryl-CoA. The 2008 iGEM-Team from  [ iGEM Rice 2008 ] tried to submit the resveratrol synthesis pathway in yeast to the registry, but their BioBricks are not functional (for example, they still include forbidden restriction sites). However, the basic functionality of their construct has been shown to work by a different research lab. It would be a good idea to use the DNA they submitted to the registry and make it functional"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," Synechocytis PCC6803. Cph1 has functional combination sites, which combined with the kinase EnvZ form a two-domain receptor, known as Cph8. Activation of Cph8 is mediated by the chromophore phycocyanobilin, PCB, that is sensitive to red light with maximal absorbance at 662 nm Lamparter T, Esteban B, Hughes J. Phytochrome Cph1 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803. Purification, assembly, and quaternary structure. European journal of biochemistry. 2001;268(17):4720-30. .
When not exposed to light, PCB activates the phytochrome Cph1, thus promoting kinase activity through the EnvZ kinase. When the transcription factor OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, expression of genes regulated by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of PCB by red light results in a situation where the transcription factor OmpR is not regulated. The absence of phosphorylated OmpR leads to no activation of the OmpR-regulated promoter, thereby preventing gene expression.
Figure 1. Left: Red light activates PCB, which in turn inactivates the photoreceptor complex Cph8, preventing gene expression from the OmpR-regulated promoter. Right: In absence of light, PCB is inactive, which enables the Cph8 to phosphorylate the transcription factor OmpR. This promotes gene expression from the OmpR-regulated promoter.
The photocontrol device can be used to regulate a toxin-antitoxin system, enabling the implementation of a light-dependent dormancy system. A toxin-antitoxin system is composed of two gene products, a cytotoxin and an antitoxin, the latter which neutralises the the toxic effect caused by the toxin.  In E. coli K-12 the cytotoxin RelE and antitoxin RelB comprise such a system Gotfredsen M, Gerdes K. The Escherichia coli relBE genes belong to a new toxin-antitoxin gene family. Molecular microbiology. 1998;29(4):1065-76. . Expression of the cytotoxin RelE inhibits translation in the cells, due to its ability to cleave mRNA found in the A-site of the ribosome. RelB neutralises the toxic effect of RelE through interaction between the two proteins. Whether the cell lies dormant in response to expression of RelE depends on the ratio of"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," for us.
The DNA sequences that you want to add to a plasmid can come from a variety of sources. In the simplest case, the sequence you are looking for is already a biobrick, such as the protein DNase. For this component of our project, we used the iGEM parts registry to loacte the DNA sequence. Many of the parts we need to use for our project are already biobricks. This includes the promoter regions, which are regions of DNA that initiate the expression of a particular gene (in effect an on/off switch), and the ribosome binding sites that facilitate the initiation of protein synthesis. If the sequence you need is not a biobrick, you can find it on online databases such as GeneBank.
In other cases, you may have the amino acid sequence of a protein you want to express, but not the DNA sequence that you need to insert into the plasmid. For us, this was the case with the protein Art175. The paper from which we sourced the sequence of Art175 only gave the amino acid sequence. We used the IDT codon optimisation to get the DNA sequence. This software gives the DNA sequence when you enter the amino acids. This programme also optimises the DNA sequence for expression in E. coli (or whichever bacteria species you are wanting to express your proteins of interest in). This is an important step, for which I will now describe the biochemistry.
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 amino acids and each is coded for by three DNA bases, which are called codons. As there are 4 different nucleotides (A, T, C, G), there are 64 different possible codons. With only 20 amino acids, this means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon. For example, AGA, AGG, AGT and ACG all code for the amino acid serine. The relative frequency of codon use vaires widely depending on the organism and organelle. For example, AGA is the most commonly used codon for serine in E. coli. When taking the amino acid sequence of the protein you want to express in E. coli, the codon optimisation software gives the DNA sequence using the codons that are most commonly used by E. coli. This is important to avoid very slow or incorrect protein synthesis.
When you have the codon optimised DNA sequences, restriction enzymes are then used to cut and stick the sequences and plasmids. These enzymes cut at specific sequences of DNA called restriction sites"

From the one-month brainstorm we collected our first proposal – construct virtual bacteria. Yet, for some practical reasons we then shifted to a second proposal, which narrowed to molecular level simulation and later on turned out to be the prototype of our present project.
From the one-month brainstorm we collected our first proposal – construct virtual bacteria. Yet, for some practical reasons we then shifted to a second proposal, which narrowed to molecular level simulation and later on turned out to be the prototype of our present project.
What do we desire to realize? In short, just tell us what you want your bio-device to behave, and we will return you with a list of eligible formation strategies for your design, of course, with bio-bricks. Turgidly as the idea might appear to be, this is basically an adoption of the gist of reverse engineering and evolution. By intake the custom-designated behaviors, we search, sometimes traverse, the solution space formed by nearly-inexhaustible combination of Biobricks. In order to make the simulative process applicable and practical, we employed a couple of algorithms widely used in computational sciences like Metropolis method and Dijkstra Algorithm to cut down the time cost and optimize the final result. Analysis on sensitivity and robustness has also been carried out to escort a reliable output of the final list of Biobrick combinations.
Now we have an ABCD for reconstruction of bio-network, or rather, all ODE systems theoretically. But there still exist many more defects and more inspirations on a higher level. Therefore, instead of fixing 'The End' to the last line of our notebook, we'd rather define another 'and...' clause, claiming another start for greater good.

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," In this case, PhiC31 behaviour was analysed while being regulated by a weak promoter (pNOS) together with a optical density (A.tumefaciens culture concentration) was 10-fold higher than the used in aforementioned experiment (Figure 7).
Figure 7. a) Graphic representation of the construct comprised by a promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by PhiC31 attachment sites (attB and attP). It represents the negative control of our experiment. Only when PhiC31 inversion occurs, luciferase protein will be expressed. b) Genetic construct that allows constitutive expression of PhiC31 in the plant under a strong promoter c) Graphic representation of the construct comprised by a promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by PhiC31 recombined attachment sites (attR and attL). In normal basis, the promoter is inverted, allowing the expression of luciferase protein. It represents the positive control of our experiment. d) Plot representing PhiC31 behavior when infiltrated at OD 0,1.
Conclusion: It was demonstrated the proper PhiC31 functioning and determined its behavior under different protein concentrations and promoter strengths. Although the expected hypothesis may be that the more recombinase concentration the more inversion events,the obtained results suggest the existence of a threshold above which that assumption is not true. Therefore, a low recombinase expression is needed in order to maximize recombinase action.
Therefore, the following question raised: What is the reason for this counter-intuitive phenomenon? We proposed two hypotheses which may explain this:
The high expression of recombinase may demand too much cell resources, causing a metabolic overload. Thus, luciferase expression decreases due to resource competition.
A PhiC31 tetramer binds to the attachment sites and it triggers the recombinase action. However, when PhiC31 is overexpressed, unproductive complexes are formed in the site-specific recombination sites obstructing the inversion event.
METABOLIC LOAD VS UNPRODUCTIVE COMPLEX HYPOTHESIS
An experimental approach was performed in order to demonstrate if the metabolic load hypothesis is correct. Following the experimental design it was proved that there is no relation between a higher expression of PhiC31 with a lower luciferase expression in the plant cell (Figure 8).

Colicin E3
The sequence of this colicin was obtained online from the Uniprot database (P00646) and a synthetic gene obtained from IDT.
This colicin is also ribosomally synthesised and is present in the cytoplasm when this process is complete. When this protein is present in the host cells cytoplasm, it always exists in a high affinity complex with its immunity protein. As with other colicins the complex that is formed between colicin E3 and E3 immunity remains present until the colicin reaches its target cell, this means that the immunity protein is able to leave the host cell along with the colicin. The mechanism of uptake used by this colicin is very similar to that of colicin Ia and colicin E9 as it makes use of the vitamin B12 receptor, BtuB. It is at this point that the colicin-immunity protein complex dissociates and a new complex forms between the receptor and the protein. It is the formation of this complex that recruits the Tol membrane proteins along with OmpF, an outer membrane protein involved in the translocation of this colicin.
This colicin achieves its goal of killing target cells by making use of its 16s rRNase activity. This activity comes from the proteins cytotoxic domain and its effect in the cell is to destroy the 16s rRNA subunit of the cells ribosome. The effect of this process is to prevent cell growth by making the target cell unable to produce any proteins thus causing cell death.
Structure of E3: The three domains of colicin E3, the cytotoxic domain: blue, the Translocation domain: red, Channel forming domain: green.
Modified Bacteriocins
As well as cloning the full length colicin our idea was to create a truncated version of colicin Ia and colicin E9. BBa_K1962002 and BBa_K1962006 encode a truncated version of colicin Ia and E9 that lacks the C-terminal bacteriocin domain. These parts have been engineered to contain a multiple cloning site at the 3' end, preceding the RFC [10] suffix and regulation double stop codons, containing the following in-frame restriction sites: BamHI, KpnI, SalI, BglII and NheI. The presence of this multiple cloning site will allow for different toxic domains to be fused at the C-termin"

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"PFD), has a unique filamentous structure composed of hundreds of monomeric subunits11. This protein complex, which originates from hyperthermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, is involved in binding non-native proteins via distal regions of its highly flexible coiled coils. Our interest in this protein complex as a scaffold, stemmed from the fact that it has been well characterised by the lab our supervisor. Furthermore, Glover’s lab has shown that enzymes can be attached to gPFD sparking an interest in our team to replicate such attachment mechanisms.
However, the use of gPFD in a scaffold has its limitations, including an inability to control the order of the subunits without using a heterogenous mix of filaments. This contradicts FR3.1 which dictates that a minimal amount of subunits are desired and, as such, this protein complex was deemed inappropriate for our desired scaffold system.
Iteration 2 – Alpha and Beta Prefoldin
An elegant solution to this was found in another prefoldin variant, derived from archaea, which has just two subunits. This archaeal prefoldin complex is constructed from two alpha and four beta subunits which self-assemble into a jellyfish-like formation, creating a heterohexamer. Like gPFD, this complex originates from a thermophilic archaeon, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, which affords the archaeal prefoldin complex with a relatively high thermostability, a function that falls under the required adaptability of our system (FR2.2). Furthermore, the six components of this structure allow for the modification and expression of each subunit individually as desired, enabling extensive adaptability of our scaffold to various scenarios.
Future developments
Our research also led us to consider how we could develop our scaffold into the future, in particular with the use of eukaryotic prefoldin. This is also a heteroheaxamer, but unlike its archaeal partner, this variant is made up of six distinctly unique proteins. This would be beneficial as it would allow for us to easily incorporate six different enzymes onto the one scaffold, rather than just two. In accordance with FR2, this would enhance the adaptability of our system to work with multiple biocatalytic pathways.
Attachment System
Having decided on the base of the Assemblase system, the team then began to look at the ways in which we could attach the desired enzymes onto this prefoldin scaffold. Most fusion proteins are connected by non-covalent interactions such as dimerising link"

Incubation facility
The hypoxia experiments could only be performed thanks to the support of the Schwille Group at the Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, which kindly provided the required incubation facility. In this context, we are indebted to Tobias Härtel and Bea, who always offered their invaluable advice and help. The hypoxia experiments were performed by Jan and Elena, who were ready to take samples every 12 hours.
Flow Cytometry
The flow cytometry experiments were all performed by Luisa as she spent 18 months in a research group in Hamburg before she started her studies in Munich, thus already versed in all skills necessary to measure our cells in FACS.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy at the lab of Prof. Skerra was performed by different people as it was necessary for many different sub-projects. High-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy was conducted at the Helmholtz Center in Munich in the lab of Prof. Westmeyer by Christoph as he will also do his master's thesis in this lab. He received the introduction into staining cells and performing confocal imaging experiments from our external Instructor Jeff.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Our colorful Scanning Electron Microscopy images were shot by Prof. Dr. Wanner from the Plant Science Department of the Ludwig-Maximilians University. Elena approached him to support our project in terms of a collaboration to provide us impressive electron microscopy images of cells. Prof. Wanner supplied all reagents required for sample preparation, such as microscopic slides, glutaraldehyde, transport boxes and many more! Clemens was in charge of preparing the samples late in the evening, which were thus slightly improvised. The samples were then picked up and transported by Jan and Elena to the SEM facility.  Afterwards, the remaining sample preparation steps after the fixation were carried out by Prof. Wanner and his coworkers. We are sincerely grateful for his support!
Blood samples
For our ""linker chemistry"" subproject, we needed fresh blood samples as a readily available source of human biotinidase in the form of plasma. For this purpose, Vivien, the student who performed the chemical experiments, utilized her own blood graciously drawn by PD Dr. med. Thomas Skurk, a medical doctor at the Institute for Food & Health.

Social Outreach
In the past year, in order to attraction more attention to the concept and core values of the project, we promoted our project through various social media channels, such as school noticing broad, school online blogs, iGEM team exchange groups, etc. In the same time, in order to keep an account on the development process of the project, we regularly updated articles on Sina weibo, Baidu tieba, the official public account of our department, and through our WeChat accounts and so on. The contents included various iGEM meetings, our experiment progress and the information and feedback we received from enterprises visiting. We also organized small events where the public can get involved and experience the joys of synthetic biology. Altogether, these efforts have brought our team a lot closer, given us a more clear goal to achieve, and more importantly, have become little sparkles scattered in the process of pursuing of the mystery of science!

Awareness session for pollution control and waste management conducted by team members at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Mandi Village, New Delhi, 110047 on 23rd September 2017. 10:00 Hrs.
    
During this session, children were told the very basic steps that can be taken at the individual level to contribute towards pollution control and waste management. It was an event where we learnt as much as we taught as the students too came up with several innovative ideas to deal with the environmental problems being faced by the society paving the path to development for countries like India.
    
A slum survey was done and people living there were given guidance to lead a healthy life. The details of the same are as written below:
      
Time and Date: 17:30 Hrs - 20:00 Hrs on 07-10-2017 and 17:30 Hrs - 19:00 Hrs on 08-10-2017.   Place: Jagatpura, Beside Sector 48-C, Chandigarh (30.679218, 76.756539).   The team members met 5 families and 2 cluster joint families, consisting of 6 nuclear families each. It was found that:   
  
       
      
All of them had settled temporarily and most of them had no identity proof. People settled there were from different states - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Punjab. No sanitary facilities were available in their settlements. All of them defecated openly near the drainage that passed through the slums. No waste disposal mechanism was provided. Large piles of plastic were seen everywhere. Except two families that alternatively used gas, all others permanently used wood as fuel for Cooking food. Wood, used as fuel, was mainly procured from nearby woodland and waste grounds. While some said they picked the dry, dead branches, others axed out fresh trees and dried them in their localities. Also we were told that whenever they came to know about any clearing of forests for industrial purposes by the government, they picked up wood from there in masses.During winters, even those who use gas, shift to wood burning as they don't want to spend their money on heaters nor electricity.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectIntro_-_-_TEXT.html," It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

Policy & Practices
Human practices work was central in so many aspects of our project. The work we completed in human practices was integral to the direction of the wet lab portion of the project Our work was also  constantly influenced by the data and information we collected when interacting with stakeholders, the public, and experts.
To make our project accessible to our community, we designed an implicit association test or “IAT” to evaluate potential unconscious bias towards technical terms related to our project which guided the way we communicated our work.
Waterloo iGEM integrated novel and creative ideas to help bridge knowledge barriers when explaining foundational advance projects to relevant stakeholders by creating the game Snake 35 as a fun and interactive experience to explain our project in a safe and novel way.
We also uncovered problems common to several local iGEM teams at the Ontario iGEM(oGEM) meetup. We realized that many teams struggle communicating the learning curve required in joining an iGEM Human Practices team. In response we created a policy & practices handbook that broke down many aspects of what it means to be  an iGEM policy team member and how to successfully integrate human practices into an iGEM project. We hope this guide will be helpful to many future iGEM teams.
We also alleviated financial costs for our team by creating 3D printing files of some essential lab equipment which is available for all iGEM teams to access.
As well, we documented and conducted interviews throughout the year as cited in the Gold Medal page. These interviews with experts helped influence the design of the project, additional applications, and the direction of social media campaign.

To account for insertions and deletions, another input required in this algorithm is the gap extension W_n, which is the penalty for a gap with length n. The gap penalty is the point reduction for each gap in the alignment. We use an affine gap penalty, which is subdivided into a gapOpening penalty for a first gap induction, and a gapExtension penalty for every base that the gap is extended for.
$$W_{n}=C*n+D,       \,     \,\,   \, \, \,                    (C>0,D>0)$$
$$                                             gapOpening = D = 5$$
$$gapExtension = C = 2                                             $$
2. Constructing a scoring matrix.
Subsequently, the scoring matrix $H$ is constructed. The matrix $H$ consists of $(p+1)*(q+1)$ dimensions for sequences of length $p$ and $q$ respectively.
$$ H_{n0} = H_{0m} = 0, \,\,\,\,\,\, for\,\,\,\, 0 \leq n \leq p \,\,\, and \,\,\, 0  \leq m \leq q $$
3. Filling the scoring matrix.
The scoring matrix is filled as follows, where $H_{i-1,j-1}+s(a_{i},b_{j})$  gives the score of aligning elements, $H_{i-n,j}-W_{n}$ gives the score for aligning element $a_{i}$  at the end of a gap of length $n$, and $H_{i,j-m}-W_{m}$ gives the score for $b_{j}$ at the end of a gap length $m$. Lastly, $0$ is for elements that do now show any similarity.
$$
$$
4. Tracing back.
After filling the complete scoring matrix $H$, a traceback ensues starting at the highest score in the matrix and ending in a cell with score $0$. To obtain a second best alignment, the same is done for the second highest score.
Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm
The Needleman-Wunsch ( Needleman et al., 1970 ) algorithm differs from the Smith-Waterman algorithm ( Smith et al., 1981 ) on initialisation, scoring and traceback and computes global instead of local alignment. In the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the"

In the case of our project, we are not planning on directly applying our genetically engineered bacteria on the plant but only our purified molecule. In other words, we chose to spray on the vine only the cell product: Curdlan. In our project, the cell can’t evolve and in any manner alter the environment.

Economy
A bit of French Touch
The production of Bordeaux is 6.4 million hectoliters with only 14% for white wines. More than 850 million bottles are sold every year and  worth almost € 3.7 billion. Today, the red wines represent 86% of total volumes produced by the vineyards of Bordeaux, 89% of exports in volume and 92% in value.  The Bordeaux vineyard now covers 123,000 hectares for 270,000 hectares of farmland. The climate and the terroir is particulary favourable for a exceptionnal vineyard. Indeed, soils and Girondins basements are rather shallow. The Gironde, the Garonne and the Dordogne make the climate cool and provide the water needed by the vineyard. On the left side of the Gironde and Garonne, there is  gravelly, sandy, clay soil made by the erosion of the Pyrenees. On the other side, soils are likely limestone wich is suitable for vineyard. The warm ocean current of the Gulf Stream accentuates the temperate climate and the Landes forest forms a protective shield against the winds of the ocean.
One of the caracteristics of the bordeaux vineyard is the great diversity of the grape variety, we can find lots of grapes :
Reds: Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot.
Whites: Sauvignon, Semillon, Muscadelle, Ugni Blanc, Colombard.

The plate had a noticeable white residue under the lid around around the edges. We believe this was due to flaking of the plastic cover from vibration in the plate reader.
Cell growth in the plate suggested that IPTG is killing our cells since few cultures survived with IPTG and those that did (LB+Amp) grew less than the equivalent cultures without IPTG.

Checking colonies 78 and 79
All of the cultures grew overnight, so we performed a miniprep on them to obtain the plasmids.
Plasmid concentrations after miniprep
Our concentrations were better than they have been in the past; notably, after the addition of buffer P2, our solution actually turned a bright blue (indicating lysis of the cells), which we had not seen before.
We then ran a PCR on our miniprep product, to check for our desired insert. We used our usual protocol for a PCR of the expression plasmid cross-junction.
PCR results, note that some lanes do not show strong bands
Some of the products did not show up very strongly, but we sent them out for sequencing in case it was a PCR/gel error.
Sending out our expression colonies for sequencing
We sent out the samples from yesterday that had no more than 1 SNP for reverse sequencing. In addition, we also sent out 78 and 79 for forward and reverse sequencing.
Reverse sequencing: 77.1, 77.3, 77.4, 78.1, 80.1, 80.2, 80.4, 81.1, 81.4, 82.1"

Title: Validation of IKKB knockdown through measurement of cytokine TNFa and IL1a expression in BV2 cells.
Conducted by: Avital Bailen, Daniel Deitch, Mor Sela
Date:  20.9.18-11.10.18
Aim:  Quantify the expression of IL1a and TNFa in BV2 microglia cell line infected with the shIKK vector using Lentivirus, using qPCR for cytokines mRNA quantification and ELISA for cytokines quantification.
Importance: We predict that reducing the cytokines, IL1α and TNFα, will prevent the creation of new reactive astrocytes in the brain 1. We predict following the microglia IKKb knockdown will reduce the secretion of the mentioned cytokines and new reactive astrocytes will not be created, preventing further damage to motor neurons.
Design:
Experiment 1: Quantify the mRNA levels of IL1a and TNFa through qPCR using BV2 cell line infected with the shIKK vector using Lentivirus.

Edinburgh,2008,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Project summary#01 July 2008_-_-_TEXT.html,"] results in an increase in the activity of adenylate cyclase, which converts AMP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP associates with the cAMP receptor protein (CRP, also known as the cAMP activator protein, CAP). CRP¿cAMP can then associate with the CRP binding site upstream of the target gene promoter. CRP¿cAMP then interacts with RNA polymerase, resulting in transcription of the gene.
Some examples of genes controlled in such a way are the rpoH(¿32, the heat-shock ¿-factor), the sdhCDAB operon and the genes of the CAP regulon. The best characterised system seems to be the lac operon (part of the CAP regulon).
The lacoperon has its CRP binding site at -70 -> -55, where CRP¿cAMP binds as a dimer and interacts with the C-terminal domain of the ¿-subunit of the RNA Polymerase. We could take this sequence and add it to the same position upstream of the promoter of an artificial cellulase operon.
There are a couple of other things to think about though:
The lac operon has its activity repressed by the LacIrepressor, which binds to the operator, preventing the polymerase from binding to the promoter. Allolactose (an analogue of lactose) displacesLacI. - What this shows is that we do not want to copy the operator!  Other catabolite-sensitive promoters bind CRP¿cAMP in two locations, as two dimers. This could potentially be better for us. Needing 2 dimers to bind would make initiation of the transcription less sensitive.  Searching EcoCycfor CRP¿cAMP transcriptional dual regulator regulated genes gives some 200 results. I propose that we want a gene whose activity is only controlled by CRP¿cAMP, of which there appear to be five. The best candidate out of these seems to be cstA, the gene for a peptide transporter induced by carbon starvation. The CRP¿cAMP transcriptional dual regulator is located at -89.5 from the transcription start site.
This gives the sequences:

Overview
The improvement of characterization was focused on both previous and current parts. Previous parts BBa_K2165004 made by iGEM16_Washington and BBa_K319036 made by iGEM10_uOttawa were characterized carefully and served for biosensor and selective label in our project. Besides, we have also characterized some core parts we used for verification, and they are BBa_K2407303 , BBa_K2407112 , BBa_K2407000 , and other functionally improved parts.
The characterization results were shown
BBa_K2165004
Based on the CUP1 promoter (BBa_K2165004) provided by iGEM16_Washington, we constructed a biosensor with yEmRFP. To characterize this promoter, strains of S. cerevisiae BY4742 containing the plasmid with an initial OD600 of 0.1 were grown for 24 hours in SC-URA medium at 30 degrees Celsius, and then were induced with copper sulfate. Samples in different copper concentration were tested with fluorescent microplate reader after 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours. This protocol was based on the experience used by Waterloo and Washington iGEM teams and amended by our team.
Fig.1 The fluorescence intensity of CUP1p-yEmRFP biosensor with different Cu concentration induced
Figure 1 showed the relationship between fluorescence intensity with induction time and Cu2+ concentration. With 0.1 mM CuSO4 induced, the fluorescence intensity is 2 times over a control with no induction at 1 hour. As time went on, the fluorescence intensity slightly reduced. Moreover, as the Cu2+ concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity decreased, and when the concentration reached 1 mM, the intensity was close to the control group. This might be due to the higher copper ion concentration influences the transcription, expression and even growth of yeast.

Transformation of plasmids P40&P42 into E.coli XL1 blue
Investigator: Lara
Aim:
Transformation of plasmids P40 and P42 into E.coli XL1 blue to get plasmids of higher quality. P40&P42 are directly extracted from the expression strain BL21(DE). The quality of the plasmids might not be sufficient for Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore transformation into E.coli XL1 blue and subsequent plasmid preparation to get plasmids with sufficient quality for SDM.
Procedure:
100 μl of competent XL1 blue cells were thawed on ice. 1 µl plasmid DNA (P40 or P42) was added. Incubation for 30 min on ice. 5 min heatshock at 37°C. 1 ml of LB medium without antibiotic was added, incubation for 45 min at 180 rpm/37°C. After incubation, 100 µl of the cell suspension were plated on antibiotic containing plates (P40: Kan, P42: Amp). The remaining solution was centrifuged for 60 sec, resuspended in 100 µl LB and plated, as well. Incubation at 37 °C over night.

As a senior iGEM team, Peking University has provided many reliable and effective suggestions for                         our projects. After the introduction of the team project, we started brainstorming on the                         project together, the most prominent of which is the proposal for high-throughput application of                         the test method of the project, and the proposal of team cooperation.
Through this interflow, we have enriched our ideas on this project, and we are also moved by the                         enthusiasm of Peking University students. This is our first collaboration, which provides a lot                         of different ideas for our project.
Northeastern University
Time: 27 Aug, 2018
Location: The Meeting Room of Northeastern University Life Science Building
Participant: Four iGEM teams from Northeastern University and Dalian University of Technology
Content:
The meeting began with the introduction of their project by the iGEM-A team of Northeastern                         University. Team A's research project is engineering probiotics, and they expect to study                         methods to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) that                         may be triggered. The next is the Northeastern University iGEM-B team. Team B students turned                         their attention to wine and its excess lactic acid.
After the students of Northeastern University showed up, the students of DLUT-A team brought                         their team's research on gout disease. High levels of uric acid in human blood may cause acute                         gouty arthritis, etc., and existing methods for treating high levels of uric acid have many side                         effects. The students of the DLUT-A team plan to oxidize uric acid to 5-hydroxyisouric acid by                         engineering bacteria to express a uric acid oxidase. The compound is decomposed and quickly                         decomposed into allantoin which is easily metabolized, thereby reducing uric acid.
Finally, the DLUT-B team brought a portable introduction to the detection of β2-microglobulin. By                         immobilizing the Nanobody on the slide, a change in the alignment of the liquid crystal causes a                         change in the brightness of the image to detect an excessive excess of β2-micro in the urine. As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension"

This is the most severe case of crosstalk observed as the induction of pLas by the corresponding inducer and regulator molecule is not significantly different measured by fluorescence as induction by Lux-AHL binding the LuxR and subsequently pLas .  For C4-HSL binding the three regulators LasR , LuxR and RhlR and then the pLas no crosstalk can be observed.
Table 3 Crosstalk matrix for the promoter prhl ( BBa_I14017 )
In this set of experiments the promoter pRhl was tested for potential crosstalk. In the top left position we observe the induction of pRhl by C4-HSL bound to the regulator RhlR . The switching behaviour was observed at a C4-HSL concentration of 1 μM.   In the case of 3OC12-HSL binding the RhlR regulator and subsequently the promoter pRhl insignificant crosstalk has been observed. Severe crosstalk was observed in the case of 3OC6-HSL binding the RhlR regulator followed by induction of pRhl . The transition occurred at a concentration of the inducer molecule of 1 μM but compared to the reference curve a lower value of fluorescence per OD was observed (1000 a.u.). Another case of crosstalk with the pRhl was detected with 3OC12-HSL binding to the corresponding LasR regulator followed by inducing the promoter pRhl . Here switching occurred at a concentration 1 nM of 3OC12-HSL and reached fluorescence per OD of 750 a.u.. This is approximately 0.5 fold the value of the fluorescence per OD shown by the reference curve indicated in green.
Conclusion of crosstalk experiments
As shown in the graphs in the matrices above, we found and quantitatively characterized all three levels of crosstalk. The three levels were the following:
A given promoter with its corresponding regulator and a different inducer molecule
A given promoter with an unspecific regulator and a particular inducer
A given promoter with both regulator and inducer being unspecific
Unspecific inducers binding to the regulators as well as unspecific binding of"

Flow cytometry was performed on colonies from the leucine zipper controls, colonies from plates without induction, and colonies grown on plates contiaint 25% supernatants from a strain constitutive for TraI, the enzyme responsible for making TraR's recognized autoinducer.
The leucine zipper colonies were centered around 104, the colonies without induction around 101. The colonies grown on TraI suppernatant supplemented media looked very similar to those without induction, with only a small peak in the range that GFP should produce.
Though this result is not completely positive, some GFP was observed in the TraR fusion colonies. This could mean that with careful optimization of conditions, this system could function as designed.

Submitted Parts
We successfully cloned 3 of our parts into pSB1c3 before the deadline.
TraR-NGFP translational Fusion TraR-CGFP Translational Fusion Leucine Zipper NGFP translational fusion
However, the NGFP coding sequence contained a Spe1 site. We mistakenly thought that though these parts would be  incompatible with some assembly methods, that the parts would still be accepted with proper documentation explaining what assembly methods could and could not be used. We are working with iGEM headquarters to make sure we get compatible DNA submitted to the registry for these parts.
We are in the process of using QuikChange site directed mutagenesis to remove the Spe1 site from BBa_K916001 and BBa_K916003 and will resubmit the parts with compatible sequence as soon as possible.
We sequenced all three parts and saw that all of them were correctly cloned into pSB1c3. All sequencing information can be found on the parts physical DNA page.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the initial phase, calorie consumption is what we focus on. As long as he get used to the diet, we started to focus on the nutrients in food. Since too much starch may lead to obesity, we should make a reduction. Lastly, if he can follow all these requirements, we can than adjust his diet into a much healthier one, like, adding more organic food or something. If we ask a client to stick to all these rules at first, we can say that there’s no possibility that his determination will last.
We: Have you ever seen someone, like, desperately push himself to the limit no matter what it cost, and, just to lose weight?
  
Coach: Of course, yes. But, I would like to say that if you only care about your stature, but ignore the true value and purpose of exercising; I will tell the person, I’m sorry, but, I think we may not suit your need, and it will be better for you to look for someone else.
We: So, how do clients get started?
Coach: First, we reach a consensus with our clients. Then, we analyze their current physical conditions. Since we should prevent clients from over exercising, we, have the obligation to remind those who train themselves in rashness of the importance of keeping a regular daily routine. 
We: So, how’s it like to have a “regular daily routine” ?
Coach: Try to avoid overworking. Also, too much sleep is not advisable.
 
We: So, how healthy we get is not in proportion with how much we exercise, right? 
Coach: Exactly. You shouldn’t do what your body can’t afford just to get a sense of achievement. 
We: So, in addition to exercising, do you control your diet as well? 
Coach: Of course, yes. But, we don’t deliberately restrain the appetite, for people drop off easily because of that. 
We: So, according to what you said, do you consider our project beneficial?
Coach: Sure. I can say that it is really an innovative idea. But, what you should know is that the mechanism of sugar controlling in our body is much more delicate than you can imagine. You guys should give an insight into some impact it may bring to, like: Will there be any side effects? Will people be too reliable on it? Will a long term dosing lead to endocrine disorders? These are all what you should be wary of.

Project Vyara
Vyara is a genetics student at University of Glasgow and another example of how inspiring we at iGEM Bulgaria can be. She showed a great deal of interest in the work of iGEM and the team behind it. Vyara sees iGEM not only as an opportunity for personal career growth but also as a step towards achieving her ambition to succeed in Bulgaria and contribute to the development of science in her home country. We gave her the opportunity to gain first-hand experience in the stages through which a project is created, i.e. from the scientific part and social campaigning, to raising funds and administrative work. It is safe to say we piqued her curiosity and she was left impressed by the model of the competition. Vyara shared with us her desire to one day help with the development of young, motivated and qualified people from our country.

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," it increases tremendously at the end of it, leading to the death of the colonies during fall or winter.
Needless to say, this infestation has a financial impact, be it because of a decreased honey yield when it is sold, or because of the necessity of buying treatments or even new swarms.  ¾ of beekeepers say they are affected financially by this mite.
Measures against varroa and their efficiency:
Beekeepers use different kinds of methods in the fight against varroa: physical methods such as a wire-mesh floor or the destruction of male broods (preferentially infested by varroas), chemical methods with products like apivar, amitraz, formic and oxalic acids, or essential oils, and finally the genetic selection of resistant bee strains.
Need These diverse methods are more or less efficient. The most efficient of the treatments are the chemical ones, but this efficiency is never 100%.
Description of treatments, pros and cons:
Treatment
Pros
Cons
Formic acid, oxalic acid
Cheap, non fat-soluble (no persistence in the wax)
Hard to dose, might induce the wrapping and death of the queen
Apilife var
Organic product but to be used only after the heat waves for fear of losing the queens
Incomplete efficiency, and a beekeeper observed deserted hives
Amitraz, Taktic
-
Residual product in the honey
Essential oils: vetiver, lavander, thymul…
Organic product, no identified toxicity
No identified disadvantages
Apistan
Easy to use, does not cause death of the bees
Necessity to wear gloves while using it
Apivar
Recommended by some beekeeping trainers
Necessity to wear gloves while using it
Some beekeepers believe they don’t have enough perspective to estimate this impact. Furthermore, since most of them are amateurs honey production is not their first object. They are more concerned about the welfare of bees as pollinators.
This being said, we can state that honey quality is not affected by most products since they are used after the harvest and have enough time to disappear from the hive before the following year’s harvest.
On the other hand, production is affected in the sense that an insufficiently treated beehive will have a population too small to effectively make honey. The size of the colony is linked to the harvest. If the queen lays a lot of eggs but varroas are numerous and weaken the new bees, the colony will weaken and will not be able to gather a lot of pollen to make honey.

Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

At the time of writing this wiki, this is as much as we had accomplished. However, we hope to complete our proof of concept construct by the time of jamboree, we hope to finish up this workflow: We will ligate the PCR product bgl-prefix+RBS+CI+TerTer+bgl-suffix with pGEM, transform, double digest both the transformed plasmid and Lov2, ligate the two together, and transform again. Finally, to complete the Conversion Module (see Logic Design), we will ligate the LovTAP expression construct upstream of our newly obtained product. Using One Shot Invitrogen cells, we hope to be able to successfully transform the bistable part, and will double transform with the Conversion Module to establish our proof of concept!

Education of future iGEMers
German school Stockholm
During our stay in Stockholm with five of our team members, we had the opportunity to visit the local German school. There, we spoke to final year students about iGEM and synthetic biology as a field of study. Our goal was to engage in a conversation with them rather than just telling them about our experiences. We wanted to learn more about their thoughts and what they imagined biology to be. For this purpose, we designed an interactive presentation.  Even though it was still early in the morning, the students were eager to learn more about our work and readily took to our questions. Especially towards the end, we had a great discussion about ethics in biological work. Unfortunately, it was cut short due to time reasons.  For us, it was great to see how younger people, yet uninvolved in science, perceived biology. It thought us that the students are willing to learn more and seek further education. We feel that it is our responsibility as young scientists to teach and inspire them to pursue this eagerness to learn. We want to thank Mrs Delp for giving us the possibility to have this informative and constructive session with her students. We really enjoyed it and learned about how to modify our lessons for other schools.
Johanna-Geissmar Gymnasium
The experience in Stockholm taught us that we should focus more on including the students into our presentation, and to arrange enough time for discussion. On the 18 of October, three of us went to the Johanna-Geissmar Gymnasium (high school) and gave a lesson in two classes of senior students. We conducted a fifteen-minute presentation about who we are, what iGEM is and then showed them our e-learning platform ""Clonecademy"" . We created a interactive module imparting the basics of biology to the students, where they can test themselves on ""what I´ve learned in school so far"". Enthusiastically the students plunged into working on these modules and scored high. They seemed excited to work with Clonecademy and were greatly interested in modules dealing with topics that are relevant for their Abitur (graduation), such as cell biology, genetic engineering, and cellular neuroscience. We aspire to create such modules in January with the result that all students graduating in Baden-Württemberg (Germany) can use this platform to"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"17 - June 21
An issue we addressed this week was the assembly of gene constructs to test ferritin in our system. A tentative strategy plan has been proposed. Coordinating this plan with the TALE and linker teams is necessary to ensure compatibility among the many components of this project. Upon receiving commercially-synthesized genes, we will order primers to use the Golden Gate assembly method.
To test whether the synthesis of magnetoferritin is successful, we must first synthesize it using the method proposed in week 4, where the native ferrihydrite core is converted to apoferritin then magnetite. Using a magnet with a relatively strong pull force (about 50 lbs.), we hope to see the magnetoferritin respond in solution.
We must also confirm the applicability of using ferritin as the Prussian blue reporter system. After generating ferritin with a Prussian blue ferrihydrite core, we will manipulate the core type, pH, coloured substrate, and temperature to test the feasibility of this method. If these tests are futile, we may need to develop an enzymatic reporter that will function in parallel with our system. The necessary materials have been obtained for these experiments, and results will follow shortly.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
In order to use beta-lactamase as a potential reporter system it was necessary to use designed primers to PCR out the gene from the backbone of the pSB1A3 plasmid (it is present here as it conveys ampicillin resistance). Three primers were designed in order to retrieve the beta-lactamase gene just by itself as well as having it with a His-tag in order to aid with protein purification. After the PCR was performed the resulting DNA was run on a gel to confirm the gene size (Figure 2). This PCR appeared to be successful based on size (900-bp and 927-bp for the beta-lactamase and beta-lactamase with His-tag respectively) but after sequencing it was determined one of the primers contained a design error resulting in a truncated gene. The primers will be redesigned in order to successfully achieve the extraction of the beta-lactamase gene from the pSB1A3 plasmid.
Figure 2. PCR making use of custom primers to extract Beta-lactamase from the psB1A3 vector. 5 out of the 8 lanes for the beta-lactamase extraction display bands at approximately 900-bp which is expected as the part should be 909-bp"

We inserted wild-type monomeric streptavidin to see if the extra linker would make the streptavidin functional.  These parts would be equivalent to the 2006 Harvard iGEM parts, BBa_J36848 and BBa_J36850 , except with the extra linker and TEV protease site.  These parts were submitted to the registry as BBa_K215210 and BBa_K215211 .  We ran the same flow cytometry assays that we used for the Harvard parts - the streptavidin is non-functional (see Display and Notebook - this is the same cytometry assay that we used for characterizing the 2006 Harvard parts):

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Medal Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"crAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump exports some terpenes( BBa_K1653006 )
We improved the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part BBa_K1230000 and submitted this improved BioBrick marA gene as BBa_K1653006 to iGEM Registry. In existing part's information of marA, it gives E. coli resistance against kanamycin only. In this year, we confirmed that overexpressing of marA gives E. coli resistance against geraniol as one of the terpene and decrease its intracellular concentration. This information is very beneficial for other iGEMers to production of toxic organic substances that are produced using bacteria.
We introduce an activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (MarA) to release the  geraniol from the cells and increase the content in the media that shows increase these flavors in the ""Flavolator"". In our study, we confirmed that overexpressing of marA gives host E. coli high resistance against geraniol and reduce intracellular geraniol concentration.

Fig. 7: Intracellular geraniol concentrations of E. coli JM109 (WT) and its overexpressing of marA strain, E. coli JM109 (marA).
In this figure, intracellular content of geraniol was less in the strain E. coli JM109 (marA) than the strain E. coli JM109 (WT). The concentrations of intracellular geraniol from E. coli JM109 (marA) was 42.9 μg/ml, which was 40% lower than that from of E. coli JM109 (WT), 72.2 μg/ml. This figure is suggesting that internalized geraniol could be more efficiently exported through AcrAB-TolC efflux pump following the presumed activation of this gene by introducing the activator marA gene.

The core goal of Biohub 2.0 is to help biologists obtain the most matched and the most high-quality Biobricks more efficiently. Given a set of query conditions and searching for the most similar items, such task has already had mature solutions, which can be perfectly done by most of the search engines. In our project, we choose ElasticSearch to accomplish the it. The only problem is: how to order the matched Biobricks by their quality?
The first step is to define ""high quality"". Technically, a Biobrick can be described by multiple properties, including objective ones (part sequence, part status, etc.) and subjective ones (number of stars, rate scores, etc.). Objective properties are usually connected with the physical characteristics of the part, which veritably reflect the quality, but some of them are difficult to quantize (for example, part sequence is the direct proof of whether a part is good or not, but such conclusion can only be drawn after experiements are done). Subjective properties, on the contrary, are very easy to be quantized, but there's no guarantee for their authenticity. Thus, we synthesize both of them to evaluate the quality of a part. According to early investigations, we define a part as ""high-quality"" if:
It is in good condition. (has available samples, satisfies most of the RFC, etc.)
It is welcomed in the community.
The next step is to find an appropriate method to measure the quality. The method must be:
fast enough. The evaluation process should not consume too much computation resources.
extensible. Adding new factors into the evaluation process should be easy enough.
In our project, we use the data downloaded from here as main data source, and meta information crawled from iGEM offical website and daily data generated from Biohub Forum as supplements. The data set contains tens of properties to describe a Biobrick, but we will only use a small amount of them, since not all of them are relevant to quality. Based on the assumptions above, we select the following fields:
part_status (from main data source)
sample_status(from main data source)
works(from main data source)
uses (from main data source)
has_barcode(from main data source)

After a long history of collaborating with iGEM teams fron National University of Singapore (NUS), we were honored to be invited to the first iGEM meeting ever in Singapore. During the meet-up, we were happy to meet with NUS Singapore-A and NUS_Singapore-Sci.
During the event, we had both casual conversations to know each other as well as in-depth discussions about our projects. We were able to propose and find potential areas for collaboration, in both wet laboratory work and human practice. We believe this meet up has laid out a great foundation for our later meetings and collaborations with them.

After meeting with Team NUSGEM at the Singapore iGEM meet-up, both teams were able to quickly find area for collaboration. Afterwards, we met multiple times in our laboratory and after a few weeks, we finalized our plan for collaboration.
 How We Helped?
Team NUSGEM ( NUS_Singapore-A ) developed a novel biomanufacturing method and produced a flavonoid dye, Luteolin, in Escherichia coli. Three plasmids were constructed which are pBrep-F3'H-pTet-FNS, pBrep-F3’H and pBAD-FNS. pBrep-F3'H-pTet-FNS plasmid consists of F3’H gene under blue light repressible promoter and FNS gene under pTet promoter. F3’H plasmid consists of F3’H gene under a blue light repressible promoter, while FNS plasmid consists of FNS gene under pBAD promoter. Our team had helped them to quantify each of the gene expression level by RT-qPCR in cells containing these plasmids versus empty cells.
Figures below shows the exponential fold change of the gene, after normalizing with the wild-type cells and the house-keeping 16s gene.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Our goal was to design a method of chronological event recording that can achieve temporal resolution of stimuli using CRISPR/Cas9 base editing technology. Rather than behave like a “molecular camera” that shows the average concentration of a stimulus over a period of time, our design acts as a “molecular movie camera”, recording the dynamic behaviors of stimuli and the times they occurred.
To accomplish our system design for recording, we had two major considerations: 1. Mechanism to keep track of elapsed time in the system. 2. Method to mark the presence of a specific stimulus in line with the time point.
Once our designed system finishes recording a stimulus in the system, there needs to be a way to tell at what time the stimulus occurred. Previous systems using CRISPR/Cas9 base editors to record stimuli used costly high-throughput sequencing or Sanger sequencing with an algorithm termed Sequalizer (Sequence Equalizer) to determine position-specific mutation frequencies [1][2]. Sequalizer was limited in analyzing mutation frequencies at only one DNA site, and it lacked a user-friendly installment and interface. To improve the ease of analyzing mutation frequencies and to reduce time and resources needed, we focused on two aspects for readout: 1. Method to determine timing of stimuli through a restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel. 2. User-friendly software tool with multi-functionality in estimating nucleotide mutation frequencies and predicting off-target effects.
In the process of developing a molecular movie camera, we considered two different system designs: 1. Individual gRNA System 2. Oscillatory gRNA System
CUTSCENE: A Molecular Movie Camera
In both of our system designs, the system can be thought of as a molecular movie camera
Individual gRNA System
In our initial system of recording molecular events, there are two parts: 1. Writing plasmid with a base editor and two gRNAs. 2. Numerous recording plasmids with zero to five repeated target sequences
At the start, the system is induced with aTc and IPTG, producing the CRISPR/Cas9 base editor and a gRNA. To keep track of time, the IPTG-induced gRNA, gRNA 1, locates the target sequence on all the recording DNA pl"

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"We have had some great help from our supervisors, who have guided us throughout the whole process of making this project a reality.
Christopher Workman has been the primary supervisor of our team. He has dedicated a lot of his time to consult us, and has been great in representing us internally in our department. Besides helping us with practicalities, general management of the team and giving scientific advice, he has helped with design ideas for our prototype as well. He came up with the idea of using Biotin/Avidin interactions to attach our detection protein device to a surface in the incubation chamber of our device. Chris was instrumental for the substrate  modelling part of our project.
Rasmus Frandsen, our secondary supervisor, has provided feedback on our cloning techniques. He was also involved in designing USER-primers for USER cloning of our biobricks, however, we opted not to use the designed primers, as it was easier for us to order de novo synthesized composite parts as gBlocks from IDT, thereby making USER cloning obsolete.
Martin E. Kogle, our residential lab technician, has helped us a lot with getting familiar with the lab, and he has lended us both equipment and chemicals crucial to our experiments. He has also been of great use with helping out when we were unfamiliar with a technique. His apprentice, Sofie L.K. Jensen, has helped us prepare buffers and solutions etc. on a daily basis.
Soumya Kannan provided valuable feedback during the idea generation.

Andreas Hougaard Lausten (postdoc, co-founder of Biosynthis, co-founder of VenomAb, on Forbes 30 under 30) have provided some great feedback on the feasibility of our diagnostic tool, and he has contributed with ideas to improve our project in general. He has also helped us with our biobrick design, as he inspired us to construct a composite part using β-galactosidase, to amplify the output signal of our detection device.
Clara Guerra Duarte (Ph.D., Fundação Ezequiel Dias) has helped us design and optimize our biobricks, by giving us feedback on the different fusion proteins we designed. As an expert in venomics, we have been able to get a lot of feedback on how we should expect venom to affect our constructed fusion-protein.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Phage Display_-_-_TEXT.html," the factors that limit the size of polypeptides that can be displayed on pVIII. — Karlsson (2004)
As a general rule, the minor coat proteins will display larger proteins more effectively than pVIII. — Kehoe and Kay (2005)
[It is plausible] that a phage containing pVIII with a large peptide may be too large in diameter to pass through the 7-nm pIV exit pore in the outer membrane. — Barbas et al (2001)
The pVIII site, although very popular for peptide phage display, is not suitable for the efficient display of large polypeptides such as antibodies. — Benhar (2001)
However, Maurice seemed quite upbeat about the prospects when we met him. It's definitely the case that large stuff has been displayed, but the question is whether this is some sort of fluke that only occurs (say) once per phage (i.e. see the Sidhu quote above).
A possible solution: zipper adaptors
If things don't work well, a possible solution (or at least something to attempt) exists...
MIT 2010 attached small ""zipper"" peptides to pVIII. Their intention was to join phage together. We could use this system to attach our enzymes of interest (i.e. our cellulases) to the phage indirectly, by fusing the enzyme to a zipper and pVIII to the corresponding zipper. The two zippers will attach if we can get them to meet physically.
The basic idea is similar to that of Paschke and Höhne (2005) (see Figure 1) and especially Wang et al (2010) .
Sequence for zipper GR1: EEKSRLLEKENRELEKIIAEKEERVSELRHQLQSVGGC (38)
Sequence for zipper GR2: TSRLEGLQSENHRLRMKITELDKDLEEVTMQLQDVGGC (38)
The construct would then contain two coding sequences:
Promoter--RBS--Leader--GR2--pVIII
Promoter--RBS--Periplasm Signal--Enzyme--GR1
Testing
As proof of concept (i.e. something we can accomplish in a short time) it would be sufficient to get just one fusion protein working. We need to prove that the enzyme part is actually getting out of the cell, so we must demonstrate that some substance which cannot enter the cell is nevertheless being degraded.
A fairly easy test would be to use a fusion of amylase to pVIII,"

Finally the primers necessary for biobricking ADF-3 arrived! And we have got other important material: we talked with Dr. Hugo Olguin, and he is willing to share with us his anti-FLAG antibody. Furthermore, he allowed us to do the western blot in his laboratory. Additionally, we achieved significant advances in the wiki, especially in the section Human Practices.  Unfortunately, we still lack of salmonella.

After some research we found the promising projects of the Japanese iGEM team HokkaidoU 2010 and 2011. They used the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024, from Salmonella Genetic Stock Center(SGSC) in University of Calgary, Canada  ( http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kesander/index.html ). This strain carries a pBeloBAC11 vector encoding a genome fragment of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 which covers the SPI-2 region [B_STM07H21 SGSC4024 1464540～1562427] We asked the iGEM team members of HokkaidoU 2011 if the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024 is capable of secreting proteins to the external environment. But unfortunately it seems that is only capable of injecting molecules into other cells, and that is not what we need.

University of Texas at Austin
With UT Austin iGEM, we worked closely seeing as our teams shared common goals focusing on the field of foundational advancement. This lead to a collaboration based on an exchange of ideas as well as constructs between our teams. In our collaboration, we organized various team Skype conferences, created a collaborative GroupMe, and met in person to exchange parts and ideas. We received promoter-containing constructs from the UT Austin iGEM team, which we then transformed, plated, and miniprepped. By testing these origins from their kit, we were able to provide an extra layer of scrutiny over the parts in their project.

Thessaloniki
With Thessaloniki iGEM, we participated in their interlab collaboration by providing calibration data and negative control measurement data following their fluorescent measurement protocol. The data generated assisted Thessaloniki in determining whether they have achieved plasmid copy number-independent expression of GFP, one of the main goals of their project.
LASA
With LASA iGEM, we helped their team develop ideas to improve the modeling portion of their project. Due to their limited resources and experience as a high school team, we hoped the LASA team could further their modeling skills, not only for this project, but also for projects in the future.
Cornell University
With Cornell iGEM, we aided one another through an exchange of ideas and feedback as we both worked toward a foundational advance. Although we were not able to meet in person, we maintained steady communication through email and conference calls. We received an education outreach learning kit from the Cornell team; we tested it by introducing synthetic biology to the general public using their kit. After these sessions we received feedback from the participants and forwarded it to Cornell, with additional comments from our team.

Engeline van Duijkeren (veterinarian) "",7 experts listed,""There were several interactions with stakeholders that heavily impacted the direction of our design. Integrated Human Practices was extremely valuable in shaping our project. In response to dialogues with the public, risk assessors, and potential users, we changed our design from a GMO-based lab tool to a safe and reliable end product. Key points that we took from discussions with stakeholders were that the method needs to combine a simplified sample preparation, a fast, easy readout and the possibility for on-site use. We integrated all these in our project, by designing a cell-free method that can be stored for up to two weeks and produces a visible readout.
Stakeholder interactions shaped our final design and made it feasible to transform our detection method into an application, resulting in a toolbox with which the farmers can perform the resistance test themselves on-site, instead of being dependent on slow lab processes. Simple, cheap and safe methods - for example the hand-powered centrifuge and boiling method during sample preparation, together with an optimized readout - make our device applicable for rapid frontline diagnostics. We developed our toolbox to detect the most relevant multiple antibiotic resistance genes, expanding the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies."",,Reached out to agricultural researchers and dairy farmers to guide to guide the project.,,,

Extending In July, the founder of BioCurious and inventor of open pcr, Tito Jankowski visited Shenzhen. Our Team is fortunate to have chance to communicate with him at his lecture given at an open lab in Shenzhen called Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab and presented our project. The concept of 'open resource' really stroke us. We started to form our idea of creating a collaborative platform among high school teams to share resource like training courses, lab rescourse and so on. We are still working on realizing the idea and hopefully will have results next year.

Gathering Thoughts To gather thoughts of different teams, we held a iGEM High School Meetup in Shenzhen on August 8th. We invited Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE,will participate in iGEM next year) and SKLBC-China to the meet up. Every team share their projects with other teams. Then, we discussed about the founding of iGEM teams, the difficulties we have or we are facing, and many other fascinating topics. The three teams also gave a lot of suggestions on working on iGEM to SCIE who will participate in as a new Shenzhen high school team next year.

Role in light-based signal transduction
Since retinal plays such an essential role in photosensing in both eukaryotes as well as bacteria and archaea, all work with rhodopsins and proteorhodopsins will need a retinal supply to function. This supply might come from the external environment, but it is an appealing thought that we might be able to supply the retinal internally. Our project centers around phototaxis, but constructs combining photorhodopsins with other membrane associated tyrosine kinases may also be imagined, opening vast posibilities for regulation of phopsphorylation cascades using light as input. In such systems, retinal biosynthesis could play a very valuable role.
Hyperflagellation
Background
Motility can be a very beneficial quality for a microorganism. Evolution has therefore provided bacteria with two general means of transportation; the flagella and the pili. These qualities allow the bacteria to move away from a hostile environment and towards more favorable conditions. Flagella and pili are however viewed as a virulence factor as they also serve as an advantage in colonizing a host organism and yet they can cause a strong immune response [ 19 ].
Many organisms are able to synthesize a flagellum, if the external environment calls for it. The synthesis of a flagellum is a huge and energy consuming process and is therefore tightly regulated by the bacteria’s external environment. One of the most well characterized flagellation systems is the one found in E. coli. Here at least 50 genes are involved in the hierarchical synthesis and operation of the flagella. These genes are sorted into 15 operons which are expressed in a transcriptional cascade separated into three classes. Class I consists of the master operon flhDC. The active FlhDC protein is a hexamer organized into an FlhD4C2 complex with a computed value of 96,4kDa [ 20 ]. The homodimeric FlhC protein is able to bind DNA, while the FlhD homodimers are not."

Slovenia,2016,Team:Slovenia#Mechanosensing#Gas vesicles_-_-_TEXT.html," ( Melbourne 2007 , Groningen 2009 , UCL2012 , Glasgow2014 ) where typically a large gene cluster had to be expressed to obtain gas vesicles.  However iGEM team OUC-China 2012 demonstrated                                     that only two protein components were sufficient to prepare functional gas vesicles in E.coli. Since gas vesicles are compressible their size should vary with                                     pressure variations in the ultrasound or by mechanical stimulus, which would strongly influence the cytoskeleton or cell membrane. Therefore, they would likely amplify                                     activation of mechano-channels (
s1
).
Schematic of a cell expressing gas vesicle-forming proteins for increased sensitivity to ultrasound stimulation.
When exposed to mechanical stimuli the gas vesicles contract and expand, resulting in activation of mechanosensitive                                                 channels on the cell membrane.
Further explanation ...
Gas vesicles are stable gas-filled structures, typically forming cylinders measuring between 45-200 nm in width and up to             1000 nm in length, which provide buoyancy in a wide variety of planktonic prokaryotes
Buchholz1993
. Two              structural proteins have been identified in the gas vesicles of cyanobacteria and the halophilic archaea. The major and most              conserved structural protein of gas vesicles GvpA, is small highly hydrophobic protein that forms the ribs of the gas vesicle wall,             while the minor gas vesicle protein, GvpC, is larger, hydrophilic protein that stabilizes the structure
Hayes1986
.             In the self-assembled vesicles, the connection between protein units is so tight to prevent penetration of water yet allows diffusion              of most gases, which therefore fill the vesicle cavity. Gases inside vesicles correspond to the gas composition of the environment and              can be compressed by a sudden increase of the pressure unlike the liquid-filled cytosol and other cellular vesicles.
Expression of gas vesicle forming proteins in mammalian cells.
Expression of (A) GvpC and (B) GvpA protein was determined by Western blot using (A) anti-FLAG and (B) anti-AU1, respectively.                                                 Expected sizes (marked with arrow) are 22,5 kDa and 8,5 kDa for GvpC and GvpA, respectively.
HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing both gas vesicle forming proteins, GvpA and GvpC. We could obtain GvpC from the Registry and added to its characterization, while the plasmid for GvpA"
